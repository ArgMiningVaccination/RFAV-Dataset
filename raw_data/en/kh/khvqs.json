As used in this prospectus, unless the context otherwise requires, references to we, us, our, our company, and Udemy refer to Udemy, Inc. Overview Our mission is to create new possibilities for people and organizations everywhere by connecting them to the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in a changing world. Our marketplace platform, with thousands of up-to-date courses in dozens of languages, provides the tools that learners, instructors, and enterprises need to achieve their goals and reach their full potential. We believe traditional education and training methods are fast becoming outdated. Technological advancements and novel industries have significantly altered the types of skills required of workers, and lifelong training and continuous skills acquisition are becoming the norm. There is a clear need to expand access to learning across traditional barriers such as geography and social demographics. Udemy operates a two-sided marketplace where our instructors develop content to meet learner demand. Courses can be accessed through our direct-to-consumer or Udemy Business, or UB, offerings. Our platform provides over 44 million learners with access to over 183,000 courses in over 75 languages and 180 countries. Since inception, more than 73 million users have registered with Udemy. Udemy courses address learning objectives such as reskilling or upskilling in technology and business, enhancing soft skills, and personal development. We analyze platform data to better determine our learners needs, helping us match individuals with relevant courses and, within UB, learning paths for a more personalized experience. Our learners also receive access to interactive learning tools such as quizzes, exercises, and instructor questions-and-answers, or Q&A. Within our marketplace and UB catalog, we provide learners with high-quality content by prioritizing courses based on factors such as learner feedback and ratings, topic relevance, content quality, and instructor engagement. Our business has experienced rapid growth. From 2019 to 2020, our revenue grew 55.6% to $429.9 million, which includes 103.5% growth in UB revenue, although we incurred net losses of $69.7 million and $77.6 million during 2019 and 2020, respectively. From the six months ended June 30, 2020 to the six months ended June 30, 2021, our revenue grew 24.5% to $250.6 million, which includes 78.7% growth in UB revenue, although we incurred net losses of $52.5 million and $29.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Industry As technological advancements, new fields of study, and novel industries render existing skill sets obsolete, the need for a new model for learning and teaching skills is urgent. According to the World Economic Forum, companies surveyed estimate that around 40% of workers will require short-cycle reskilling (i.e., six months or less), and 94% of business leaders report that they expect employees to pick up new skills on the job. The shift to online learning has been ongoing for years, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated this shift. According to the World Economic Forum, 84% of employers surveyed report that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need to digitize. 1 Unfortunately, many of todays options have a number of shortcomings: ||| | Relevance: Traditional learning solutions rely on the so-called publisher model, which involves a lengthy, centralized, and expensive top-down development process by multiple levels of editors and reviewers. We believe a top-down publisher model disincentivizes continuous course creation or improvement post-publication because it limits the speed of course development, instructors creative oversight over their content, and the cost-effectiveness of localized content production. ||| | Breadth: Due to the slower speed and higher costs associated with the publisher model, existing solutions often focus on a few popular learning areas such as technical skills or creative skills. These training options may lack the content breadth and instructor diversity to meet the interdisciplinary objectives of modern learners. ||| | Quality: Because traditional providers often lack quality indicators such as ratings, reviews, and past performance, finding high-quality content can prove difficult and time consuming for learners. ||| | Scalability: Existing solutions have proven ineffective at operating on a global scale. Many rely on in-person training and have been slow to leverage technology, making them difficult to reproduce at scale. Other digital solutions, despite being more scalable than in-person training, have also struggled to provide local content for international communities. ||| | Affordability: The high cost of learning solutions prevents many individual learners from advancing or upgrading their skills. Likewise, pricing for existing solutions is often standardized globally, further limiting access in many geographies. We offer a new approach, one that addresses these shortcomings and effectively connects the global ecosystem of learners to up-to-date knowledge from experts and practitioners around the world. We are creating a better learning experience. Our market opportunity According to a HolonIQ study, the global online and offline education market was $2.6 trillion across higher education, corporate training, and online learning in 2019. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of corporate training occurred offline, and we believe that online education is well placed to address the scalability and affordability limitations of offline education. With the increase of internet connectivity, technological advances, and interactive tools at a low cost, we expect a massive shift from offline to online. Based on data from Arizton, we estimate our market opportunity in online learning to be $223 billion. We calculate this estimate by aggregating the global corporate opportunity of $71 billion and the global consumer opportunity of $152 billion in 2021. We believe that our market opportunity could grow to be multiples of todays estimate as learning continues to transition online. Further, we believe that online education can address the rising demand for lifelong learning in the rapidly evolving world economy, a development that would expand our market opportunity to include the majority of the global adult population. Our solution: the worlds learning platform Our platform allows individual learners and organizations all over the world to access affordable, relevant, and up-to-date content from experts and experienced practitioners in nearly every field. We combine high-quality content with data insights and technology to create a platform purpose-built for the needs of learners, instructors, and organizations. 2 Our platform delivers a powerful flywheel of content creation, engagement, and continuous content optimization. Our expert instructors continuously generate new courses and update existing ones, while our marketplace encourages engagement on the most in-demand topics. The volume and frequency of these interactions allow us to generate meaningful insights and provide real-time feedback and analytics for our instructors. These data insights in turn improve content quality, enhance course personalization, and optimize productivity and satisfaction for our learners. One way that we foster access to courses for individual learners and enterprises is through broad content distribution across our various channels. We leverage machine learning, or ML, to increase learner retention and conversion using enhanced personalization. At the same time, we believe our model encourages more relevant and engaging content through well-aligned incentives for our instructors, supported by consistent improvement from the feedback and data collected from individual learners and Udemy Business customers. Over 17,700 free courses are available on our platform. These free courses represent an important entry point for learners to experience our platform. Over 28 million consumer learners have enrolled in free courses on a wide range of topics taught by a diverse set of instructors in a variety of languages. Through this free content, we are able to build a large and cost-effective top of the funnel for both consumer and UB leads. Once learners interact with our platform, our ML algorithms recommend courses for learners to purchase based on topic, quality, instructor rating, number of enrollments, learners country of origin, and more. The algorithms help us maximize revenue while offering the best value to learners. Over 3.7 million free learners have converted to buyers. We also offer unlimited access to a curated catalog of courses through our Consumer, Enterprise, and Team plan subscriptions. The courses selected for the subscription plans are among the highest quality, most relevant, and most popular on our platform. Learners can access the Consumer subscription plan for a monthly fee, whereas Enterprise plans have annual licenses that are priced based on volume. Our Team plan offers customers access to over 6,000 top-rated courses for 5-20 seats at an annual rate starting at $360 per seat. The Enterprise plan begins with the same offering as the Team plan and supplements it with administrative tools, insights, learning playbooks, and additional courses through our language packages. In addition to these subscriptions, we offer immersive learning experiences such as labs, skills assessments, and coding exercises in a range of verticals. What we offer our learners We provide over 44 million learners with relevant, affordable, and high-quality content, and we do this on a platform that enables the constant improvement of our courses by leveraging the social validation of over 594 million course enrollments, as well as thousands of ratings and reviews. With Udemy, learners can fulfill objectives involving: ||| | Technical skills: Learners often seek to gain proficiency in the latest technology, which helps them stay competitive through upskilling or reskilling their capabilities. ||| | Business skills: Business and professional soft skills, such as negotiation strategy or team leadership, are in constant demand as individuals look to advance their careers, react to new workplace environments, or take on new responsibilities. ||| | Personal development: Learners like to complement their primary skills with discovery of new interests or hobbies such as music, drawing, and wellness. Learners on Udemy receive a comprehensive and immersive experience through interactive exercises and the ability to communicate directly with instructors through Q&A functionality. 3 What we offer our Udemy Business customers We have over 8,600 global Udemy Business customers, including 42 of the Fortune 100. Our UB customers typically express high satisfaction with their UB experience, resulting in our average net promoter score of 49. Our curated UB offering begins with over 6,000 of the most engaging and relevant courses available on our platform. We also offer an extensive non-English language collection, which includes courses in Spanish, Portuguese, German, Japanese, and French. Arabic, Indonesian, Italian, Mandarin, and Turkish language packages were launched in 2021, and we plan to launch Korean, Polish, and Russian language packages later in the year. We use a rigorous selection process across a wide set of criteria to determine the courses that will be offered as part of UB, including: ||| | User behavior: Learner feedback and ratings, as well as content searches, help us determine which courses to maintain or add to UB. ||| | Customer input: Specific content requests, prospects requests for proposal, and customer success stories are evaluated to identify new areas of focus that help ensure the continued strong relevance of our offering. ||| | Market research: Industry trends and instructor interviews help us determine relevant topics and new technologies valued by enterprises and their employees. ||| | Competitor analysis: We monitor market data and analyst reports on an ongoing basis to stay at the forefront of market demand and quickly address any applicable gaps within the topics offered. As of June 30, 2021, the UB course catalog included over 74,000 hours of technical content and over 28,000 hours of business, personal, and professional skills content. On average, in 2021, over 460 new courses are added each month. Our overall UB course catalog has increased from fewer than 2,500 courses in 2017 to over 11,000 today. We offer UB customers learning paths, which allow organizations to assemble customized learning series made up of Udemy courses, the organizations own material, and links to external resources. Learning paths are only visible within the organization that creates them and offer a unique benefit to administrators and employees. As of June 30, 2021, our enterprise customers have generated over 360,000 learning paths. We also offer UB customers a comprehensive analytics dashboard and other powerful tools where our customers can gain high visibility into the progress, areas of focus, and feedback of their employees. This strong set of tools, which includes our learning playbooks, helps our UB customers better understand and optimize learning experiences for their employees and ensure they are delivering a strong and measurable return on their investment in learning skills. What we offer our instructors We offer instructors from around the world access to a global audience of over 44 million learners. Our model allows instructors who elect to charge for courses to share directly in the economic upside of the course content they contribute and the growth of our platform. In 2020, our paid instructors earned $161.4 million from Udemy for their courses, with average paid instructor earnings of $2,950 and over 9,000 global instructors receiving more than $1,000 in earnings. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, our paid instructors earned $86.8 million from Udemy for their courses, with average paid instructor earnings of $1,574 and over 6,000 global instructors receiving more than $1,000 in earnings. The breadth of instructors and courses contributes to the wide variety of content topics available on our platform, as well as meaningful depth within most content categories. We believe that this combination of breadth and depth helps foster competition and choice on our platform and attracts learners and UB customers. 4 We enable our instructors to drive innovation and ongoing engagement on our platform. Instructors can use platform insights, review feedback from learners, and harness analytics dashboards to manage their course content, brand, and course marketing. Our performance marketing engine identifies and selects the best courses to be featured to each learner around the world. In addition, we offer instructors insight on the revenue opportunity and existing content for any given topic, and we provide auto-generated translated captions from English to Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, and Polish. When an instructors course is added to the UB catalog, instructors are subject to an exclusivity clause for the use of their content on our platform, pursuant to which instructors agree, subject to limited exceptions, not to offer any on-demand content, such as pre-recorded courses, on any competing platform in a way that directly competes with or impairs the sales of such content on our platform. This exclusivity clause is effective for so long as an instructors content is included in the UB catalog, and we may continue to include content in the UB catalog for up to 12 months after an instructor elects to opt out of the UB catalog. We believe these exclusivity arrangements increase the value of our offerings by increasing the amount of unique content on Udemy and helping maintain our robust roster of expert instructors. We believe that, on average, the value we offer instructors ultimately delivers a far higher return on investment relative to other content creation and online learning competitors. Our competitive strengths We believe our business model benefits from several competitive advantages: Global distribution and reach with strong brand value: In 2020 and during the six months ended June 30, 2021, 61% and 61%, respectively, of our revenue was generated outside North America. Because our online platform is available globally, curious learners and organizations can easily test our content. As these new learners and organizations begin to engage with us, we then have the opportunity to quickly and efficiently expand into these new markets by focusing our marketing, advertising, pricing, and language customization resources and expanding our payment options, which in turn allows us to grow our base of individual learners and organizations on an ongoing basis and attract new instructors who create native language courses. Robust content generation engine: ||| | Premium quality: Our platform encourages instructors to react constantly to learner feedback by continuously updating their courses. This continuous updating, along with personalized recommendations and advanced search capabilities, provides learners with the most up-to-date, high-quality, and relevant content. ||| | Relevance and speed to market: Our marketplace model motivates instructors to provide relevant content to learners quickly, in order to gain a first-mover advantage in attracting learners and enrollments to their courses. We believe these structural inducements, coupled with our aligned incentive model, help drive our instructors to update their courses at a much higher rate than courses offered through competitors with a traditional publisher model. For example, 80% of courses in the UB course catalog were updated in the last two years. ||| | Breadth of content: Many of our competitors offer limited course catalogs specializing in a specific category. We provide access to over 183,000 courses (over 17,700 of which were offered for free as of June 30, 2021), including over 70,000 courses in languages other than English. We also offer a broad set of personal enrichment courses in the wellness, music, and lifestyle categories, among others. On average, instructors publish more than 5,000 courses a month on the Udemy platform. ||| | Affordability: Our ML pricing algorithms determine how much we charge for our courses in our marketplace on a per-country basis, taking into account dozens of course characteristics, including category of content, hours of content, course rating, and popularity. 5 Self-reinforcing flywheel with powerful network effects: We believe the growing number of individual learners and organizations on our platform attracts instructors who recognize that our platform and global audience can create new income streams and help support their families and local communities. In turn, the increasing number of relevant, high-quality, and up-to-date courses offered by world-class experts and practitioners attracts more individual learners and organizations. Our direct-to-consumer offering is synergistic with UB. As individual learners experience the quality and benefits of Udemys platform, they recommend Udemy to their organizations. We have been very successful at driving high-converting leads to UB, with over 60% of leads coming from our direct-to-consumer platform in 2020. Powerful data insights and analytics: With over 500 million unique visitors from 2018 through 2020, more than 594 million cumulative course enrollments, and in 2020 alone, almost 11 billion minutes of learning, we believe that the volume of the data our platform collects provides meaningful insights into the behaviors and needs of our learners and instructors. We leverage that data to provide personalization for learners as well as to promote high-quality and relevant content from instructors. We capture user behavioral data on the learning objectives and interests of our learners to better address their needs and recommend the right courses. We also analyze enrollment data, market insights, and feedback from learners to identify new topics of focus within our content catalog. We share this information with our instructors in real time so they can improve their course offerings. Flexible technology platform: Our technology platform is modern, agile, accessible from a variety of online and mobile channels, and built to scale with our global growth. We use advanced technology applications, such as personalized promotions, lifecycle marketing, and content personalization, to help tailor our platform for our learners. Our platforms ability to provide a personalized experience is further enhanced by the ML methodologies used to develop the algorithms included in our technology, which allow us to continuously and automatically personalize each learners experience. We regularly run tests to determine which product features, course recommendations, prices, and messaging will drive the best outcomes for our learners and Udemy as a whole. In addition, we have built our technology to be flexible to enable us to continuously test and add new features, such as interactive exercises and immersive learning experiences. Our growth strategies We are still in the early stages of our long-term growth strategy. We expect to continue expanding our consumer and UB customer base, instructor network, and content catalog while increasing our market opportunities through the following strategies: Accelerate the growth of our enterprise business through: ||| | Successfully executing on our land-and-expand strategy: Our strategy focuses on acquiring new customers and efficiently growing our relationships with existing customers, beginning with either individual users or departmental deployments. Historically, we have expanded from individual to department to multi-department sales as UBs value is proven and UB customers identify additional use cases. With fewer than 10% of total available seats contracted in our customer base, we consequently see a large opportunity for growth. We intend to continue to expand our sales team footprint globally and to improve our upselling tactics with the assistance of better tools and systems. We have also developed a strong outbound lead-generation process with effective account-based marketing operations, allowing us to target, develop, and nurture key accounts in large organizations. 6 ||| | Improving quality and relevance of our courses: We curate our UB catalog by selecting the highest-rated and most engaging courses from our consumer business. We intend to continue leveraging our large platform to source high-quality and relevant curricula. We will also continue to improve the speed and efficiency of our curation processes, enabling us to quickly discern the content most relevant to our UB customers. ||| | Integrating our UB offering with employees workflow: We provide easy-to-implement learning playbooks, which enable customers to combine UB courses with their own in-house training to create blended learning programs. UB learners can also take advantage of our personalized content recommendations, which we derive from the data we collect. We currently integrate with existing employee learning-and-development and HR workflows, including our customers learning management systems and learning experience platforms, to help enable a more robust offering for UB learners and greater employer visibility into learning. Examples of these integrations include Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, Slack, and ServiceNow. Integrations enable UB customers to incorporate learning in the flow of work: learners can discover, search, and consume our UB catalog. Leaders can sync, track, and report learning progress for employees across other HR systems and also encourage learning across the organization through reminders and sharing on existing company messaging platforms. Looking forward, we intend to expand our offering to integrate with additional employee learning-and-development and HR workflows, and to introduce additional services for employees, thus expanding usage within our UB customers. ||| | Deliver immersive learning experiences: Our platform currently offers powerful learning experiences including practice tests, coding exercises, and quizzes, which permit learners to prepare for certification exams and better retain what they have learned. We intend to expand our offerings to include deeper skills assessments, labs, and cohort-based learning. We will also consider acquisitions to expand the immersive learning experiences we offer, with a goal of improving learner outcomes and ultimately increasing retention. Increase learner retention through: ||| | Building a global personalization engine: Since the beginning of 2020, we have invested considerable resources in developing a personalization-based technology platform, which includes our: |-|| | State-of-the-art eventing platform to track and store every learner interaction with our site and apps; |-|| | Customer data platform to structure and analyze all of our learner data; |-|| | Lifecycle marketing platform to develop, train, and operationalize personalization algorithms; and |-|| | Campaign management platform to link personalization algorithms with customer-facing touch-points, such as website placements, emails, and push notifications among others. Our personalization efforts are only beginning. We believe that these investments will yield high returns around customer engagement, retention, and lifetime value in the quarters and years to come. ||| | Expanding our subscription offering: In early 2021, we launched a direct-to-consumer subscription, currently in beta testing. We believe there is broad demand for learning subscriptions, and we are uniquely positioned to provide a compelling and highly competitive product. We believe that consumer subscriptions, in the absence of employer-sponsored access, will increase the retention of individual learners who seek to continuously acquire new skills and value greater ongoing access to content. Offering different subscription packages based on area of expertise or added features, for example, will allow us to capture different types of individual learners at different price points, all while increasing their engagement with Udemy. 7 Expand our geographic footprint through: ||| | Organic expansion: All of our courses are discoverable everywhere in the world. We enter new countries via courses taught in English. As the platform grows in popularity, local instructors create courses in their native languages. As of June 30, 2021, we offered over 70,000 courses in languages other than English. We will continue to invest in our technology and our brand to drive search engine optimization and word of mouth in order to continue the organic growth. ||| | Executing our international playbook: As the content catalog expands in each country, we start investing in additional growth levers such as local payment methods, local currency pricing, and local marketing. These investments drive higher traffic, enrollments, and revenue for our direct-to-consumer business, as well as leads for UB. Once we reach a steady volume of leads to UB, we build in-country go-to-market sales teams to grow and expand our customer base. We also may partner with local companies. This international playbook will continue to allow us to build a targeted list of countries in which we anticipate we will expand with a high likelihood of success.

These risks are more fully described in Risk factors immediately following this prospectus summary. These risks include, among others, the following: ||| | We have a history of losses, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We incurred net losses of $69.7 million and $77.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and net losses of $52.5 million and $29.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively, and, as of June 30, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $407.9 million. ||| | We have a limited history in an emerging and dynamic market, which makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and future results of operations. ||| | Our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to a wide range of factors, which makes our future results difficult to predict. ||| | Our rapid growth may not be sustainable and depends on our ability to attract new learners, instructors, and organizations and retain existing ones. ||| | Our platform relies on a limited number of instructors who create a significant portion of the most popular content on our platform, and the loss of these instructor relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. ||| | If we fail to maintain and expand our relationships with UB customers, our ability to grow our business and revenue will suffer. ||| | We operate in a highly competitive market, and we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. ||| | The market for online learning solutions is relatively new and may not grow as we expect, which may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. ||| | Adherence to our values and our focus on long-term sustainability may negatively impact our short- or medium-term financial performance. ||| | The COVID-19 pandemic could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in volatile and unpredictable ways. ||| | Any failure to successfully execute and integrate future acquisitions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 8 ||| | Changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection, or cybersecurity, including those relating to the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations could adversely affect our business. ||| | We may be unable to adequately obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary information, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. ||| | We could face liability, or our reputation might be harmed, as a result of courses posted to our platform. ||| | Intellectual property litigation, including litigation related to content available on our platform, could result in significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation. ||| | We are an emerging growth company, and any decision to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors. ||| | The trading price of our common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Corporate information We were incorporated in January 2010 as a Delaware corporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 600 Harrison Street, 3rd Floor, San Francisco, California 94107, and our telephone number is (415) 813-1710. Our website address is www.udemy.com. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute part of this prospectus, and the inclusion of our website address in this prospectus is an inactive textual reference only. Investors should not rely on any such information in deciding whether to purchase our common stock. Udemy, our logo, and our other registered or common law trademarks, service marks, or trade names appearing in this prospectus are the property of Udemy, Inc. Other trademarks and trade names referred to in this prospectus are the property of their respective owners. Implications of being an emerging growth company We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue; the date we qualify as a large accelerated filer, with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; the issuance, in any three-year period, by us of more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; and the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering. As a result of this status, we have taken advantage of reduced reporting requirements in this prospectus and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in our future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, in this prospectus, we have provided only two years of audited consolidated financial statements and have not included all of the executive compensation related information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, delaying the adoption of these accounting standards until they would apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period to enable us to comply with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting standards as of public company effective dates. 9 The offering | | Common stock offered by us |shares.| | | Option to purchase additional shares |We have granted the underwriters an option for a period of 30 days to purchase up to additional shares of our common stock.| | | Common stock to be outstanding immediately after this offering |shares (or shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full).| | | Use of proceeds |The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and financial flexibility, create a public market for our common stock, and enable access to the public equity markets for us and our stockholders.

We have derived our summary consolidated statements of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 from our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. The summary consolidated statements of operations data for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021, and the summary consolidated balance sheet data as of June 30, 2021, are derived from our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. We have prepared the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements on a basis substantially consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the financial information set forth in those unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. You should read the following summary consolidated financial and other data together with our audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this prospectus and the information in Selected consolidated financial and other data and Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Our historical and interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other period in the future. |Year ended December 31,||Six months ended June 30,| |2019||2020||2020||2021| |(in thousands, except share and | per share amounts) |(in thousands, except share and | per share amounts) |Consolidated statements of operations data:| |Revenues||$||276,327||$||429,899||$||201,368||$||250,643| |Cost of revenues(1)||143,510||209,253||104,670||113,916| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Gross profit||132,817||220,646||96,698||136,727| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Operating expenses:| | | Sales and marketing(1) |126,436||192,600||96,176||104,141| | | Research and development(1) |34,379||50,643||24,295||30,196| | | General and administrative(1) |40,033||50,783||26,035||29,802| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Total operating expenses |200,848||294,026||146,506||164,139| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Operating loss||(68,031)||(73,380)||(49,808)||(27,412)| |Other income (expense), net:| | | Interest income (expense), net |87||(1,146)||(1,014)||(391)| | | Other income (expense), net |(384)||55||138||(518)| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Total other income (expense), net |(297)||(1,091)||(876)||(909)| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Net loss before taxes||(68,328)||(74,471)||(50,684)||(28,321)| |Income tax provision||(1,375)||(3,149)||(1,766)||(1,059)| |Net loss||(69,703)||(77,620)||(52,450)||(29,380)| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted(2)||$||(2.57)||$||(2.33)||$||(1.63)||$||(0.80)| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Weighted-average shares used to calculate net loss per share attributable to common stockholders - basic and diluted(2)||27,096,379||33,384,438||32,104,638||36,726,992| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Pro forma net loss per share attributable to common stockholdersbasic and diluted(2)||$||(0.65)||$||(0.24)| | | | | | | | | |Weighted-average shares used to compute pro forma net loss per share attributable to common stockholdersbasic and diluted(2)||118,775,776||122,130,925| | | | | | | | | 12 |(1)|| | Stock-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations data above was as follows: |Year Ended December 31,||Six Months and administrative||3,306||18,450||11,806||9,169| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Total stock compensation expense||$||8,963||$||31,618||$||20,603||$||16,484| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |(2)|| | See Note 2 and Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for an explanation of the calculations of our net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted and the weighted-average shares used to compute these amounts. Pro forma basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted is computed to give effect to the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock into an aggregate of 85,391,338 and 85,403,933 shares of common stock immediately prior to the completion of this offering, as of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, respectively, with the June 30, 2021 balance representing the common stock amount immediately prior to the completion of this offering. Incremental stock-based compensation incurred in connection with the completion of this offering is immaterial. |As of June The pro forma balance sheet data gives effect to the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock into an aggregate of 85,403,933 shares of our common stock which will occur immediately prior to the completion of this offering, resulting in an aggregate of 122,927,466 outstanding shares of our common stock. Incremental stock-based compensation incurred in connection with the completion of this offering is immaterial. |(2)|| | The pro forma as adjusted column in the balance sheet data table above gives effect to (a) the pro forma adjustments described in footnote (1) above and (b) the issuance and sale of shares of common stock in this offering at the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. |(3)|| | Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase or decrease, as applicable, the pro forma as adjusted amount of each of our cash and cash equivalents, total assets and stockholders deficit by $ million, assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Similarly, each increase or decrease of 1.0 million shares in the number of shares offered by us at the assumed initial public offering price would increase or decrease, as applicable, each of our cash and cash equivalents, total assets, and stockholders deficit by $ million. The pro forma as adjusted information set forth above is illustrative only and will depend on the actual initial public offering price and other terms of this offering determined at pricing. 13 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Risks related to our business and operations We have a history of losses, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We incurred net losses of $69.7 million and $77.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and net losses of $52.5 million and $29.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively, and, as of June 30, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $407.9 million. We expect our losses to continue as we make significant investments towards growing our business and operating as a public company. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, substantial financial and other resources in developing our platform, including expanding our platform offerings, developing or acquiring new platform features and services, expanding into new markets and geographies, and increasing our sales and marketing efforts. These expenditures will make achieving and maintaining profitability more difficult, and these efforts may also be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. Any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. As a result, we can provide no assurance as to whether or when we will achieve profitability. If we are not able to achieve and maintain profitability, the value of our company and our common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose some or all of your investment. We have a limited history and operate in an emerging and dynamic market, which makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and future results of operations. We commenced operations in 2010 and the market for online learning solutions is relatively new. These factors may make it difficult to accurately assess our future prospects and the risks, challenges, and uncertainties that we may encounter. These risks include: ||| | maintaining and increasing a base of learners, instructors, and UB customers using our platform; ||| | successfully competing with existing and future participants in the market for online learning solutions; ||| | successfully expanding our business in existing markets and entering new markets and geographies; ||| | anticipating and responding to market and broader economic conditions; ||| | avoiding interruptions or disruptions in the service of our platform; ||| | accurately forecasting our revenue and operating expenses on a quarterly and annual basis; ||| | maintaining and enhancing the value of our reputation and brand; ||| | attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel to manage our operations and further develop our platform; ||| | effectively managing rapid growth in our operations, including personnel; and ||| | successfully implementing and executing our business strategies. 14 Additionally, because we have limited historical financial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more established and predictable market. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks, challenges, and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies. If our assumptions regarding any of these risks, challenges, or uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address them successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to a wide range of factors, which makes our future results difficult to predict. Our results of operations have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that our results of operations will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include, but are not limited to: ||| | our ability to attract and retain learners, instructors, and enterprises that use our platform in a cost-effective manner; ||| | our ability to accurately forecast revenue and operating expenses; ||| | the effects of increased competition on our business; ||| | our ability to successfully expand in existing markets and successfully enter new markets; ||| | changes in learner or customer behavior with respect to online learning solutions; ||| | increases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and acquire new learners, instructors, and customers; ||| | the revenue mix between our consumer and UB offerings; ||| | the impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer and business spending on online learning solutions; ||| | our ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage that growth; ||| | the effects of changes in search engine placement and prominence; ||| | our ability to keep pace with technology changes in our industry; ||| | the success of our sales and marketing efforts; ||| | our ability to protect, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights; ||| | costs associated with defending claims, including intellectual property infringement claims, and related judgments or settlements; ||| | changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business; ||| | interruptions in service and any related impact on our business, reputation, or brand; ||| | the attraction and engagement of qualified employees and key personnel; ||| | our ability to choose and effectively manage third-party service providers; ||| | the effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events; ||| | the impact of a pandemic or an outbreak of disease or similar public health concern, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or fear of such an event; 15 ||| | potential volatility in our gross margins, including due to revenue mix shifts between our enterprise and consumer segments, changes in our pricing policies, increased use of subscriptions in our consumer segment, and timing differences between recognition of revenue and related content costs for courses; ||| | the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting; ||| | the impact of payment processor costs and procedures; and ||| | changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities. The unpredictability of our results of operations could cause our results to vary from period to period or to fall below expected levels for a given period, which will adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our rapid growth may not be sustainable and depends on our ability to attract new learners, instructors, and organizations and retain existing ones. Our success depends, in part, on growing the number of learners and instructors engaging with our platform. We believe the increase in the number of instructors increases the quality and quantity of the content available on our platform, in turn making our platform more appealing and engaging to learners in both our consumer and enterprise segments. This increase in learners then attracts more instructors to our platform. This dynamic marketplace model takes time to build and may grow at a slower pace than we expect. In addition, although the number of individual and UB learners and instructors engaging with our platform has grown in recent years, there can be no assurance that this growth will continue at its current pace or at all. For example, in 2020, we experienced a significant increase in engagement with our platform, in part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the shelter in place orders and other efforts that were deployed by governments to mitigate its spread. While the COVID-19 pandemic may be accelerating an ongoing, long-term shift towards online learning, in the short term this level of demand from learners, instructors and organizations may decline as vaccines become more widely distributed and government restrictions are lifted. If we fail to grow or maintain the number of learners and instructors engaging with our platform, the value of our platform will diminish and our revenue will decline. We believe that many of our new learners find us by word of mouth and other non-paid referrals from existing learners. If existing learners are dissatisfied with their experience on our platform, they may stop accessing our content and referring others to us. Likewise, if existing learners do not find our content appealing and engaging, whether because of a negative experience with, declining interest in or relevancy of the content, they may stop referring others to us. In turn, if instructors perceive that our platform lacks an adequate learner audience, instructors may be less willing to provide content for our platform, and the experience of learners could be further negatively impacted. The willingness or ability of instructors to provide content for our platform could also be negatively impacted by other factors, such as: ||| | complaints or negative publicity about us or our platform, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents; ||| | changes to our terms and policies that our instructors find, or even perceive, to be unpopular or that are not clearly articulated to them; or ||| | our failure to enforce our policies fairly and transparently. In addition, the costs associated with retaining learners and instructors are substantially lower than those associated with acquiring new learners and instructors. As a result, if we are unable to retain existing learners and instructors, even if such losses are offset by an increase in revenue resulting from new learners and instructors, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Consequently, if we are unable to retain existing learners and instructors and attract new learners and instructors who contribute and engage with our platform, our growth prospects would be harmed and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 16 Our platform relies on a limited number of instructors who create a significant portion of the most popular content on our platform, and the loss of these instructor relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As part of our instructor community, we strive to build meaningful connections with instructors, ranging from those that are well known and have created extensively to those that have just begun the process of creating courses. As of June 30, 2021, we had relationships with over 65,000 instructors. Although we view the breadth and diverse expertise of our instructor base and the content they create as one of our competitive advantages, a significant portion of the most popular content on our platform, and as a result a significant portion of our revenue, is attributable to a limited number of our instructors. For example, 5% of our instructors generated 71% and 70% of our paid marketplace enrollments during 2020 and the first half of 2021, respectively. Moreover, because instructors may unpublish content or leave the Udemy platform altogether, subject to our right to continue offering such content to new learners on the consumer marketplace for 60 days afterwards and in our subscription offerings for 12 months afterwards, we may need to source replacement content by a different instructor on short notice. Although we do not believe the loss of any one of these instructors would materially impact our business, the loss of multiple existing instructors, as well as any failure to attract additional instructors, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations by adversely affecting our ability to provide high-quality, engaging, and relevant content for one or more subject matters and the pace at which we provide such content, which in turn could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to learners and customers. If we fail to maintain and expand our relationships with UB customers, our ability to grow our business and revenue will suffer. Revenue from our enterprise segment represented 18% and 24% of our revenue during 2019 and 2020, respectively, and 22% and 31% of our revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to grow this offering, both by retaining and expanding our relationship with existing customers and attracting new customers. Many customers initially use our platform within specific groups or departments within their organizations, or for specific use cases. Our ability to grow our UB business depends, in part, on our ability to persuade these customers to expand their use of our platform to address additional use cases. Further, to continue to grow our business, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions when existing contracts expire and that we expand our relationships with our existing customers. Customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions, and they may decide not to renew their subscriptions with a similar contract period, at the same prices and terms, with the same or a greater number of users, or at all. We have had some customers elect not to renew their subscriptions with us in the past, and it is difficult to accurately predict whether we will have future success in retaining customers or expanding our relationships with them. We have experienced significant growth in the number of customers subscribing to our UB offerings, but we do not know whether we will continue to achieve similar growth, or achieve any growth at all, in the future. Our ability to retain UB customers and expand our deployments with them may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customers satisfaction with our platform, the quality and timeliness of our customer success and customer support services, our prices, the prices and features of competing solutions, reductions in customers spending levels, insufficient adoption of our platform by our customers constituents, and new feature releases. If customers do not purchase additional subscriptions or renew their existing subscriptions, renew on less favorable terms, or fail to continue to expand their engagement with us, our revenue may decline or grow less quickly than anticipated, which would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We operate in a highly competitive market, and we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. We operate in a highly competitive environment, as the market for online learning is relatively new, highly fragmented, and rapidly evolving, with limited barriers to entry. We compete for learners, enterprise customers, and instructors: ||| | Learners: We compete for learners based on our course catalog, instructors, and learning tools. 17 ||| | UB customers: We compete for customers based on our up-to-date content, the breadth and depth of that content across the full range of core business functions, and advanced product features that optimize self-paced learning and enable organizations to effectively drive programmatic learning. ||| | Instructors: We compete for instructors based on our ability to promote monetization opportunities. Our competition includes corporate training offerings (such as those from Pluralsight, Skillsoft, and LinkedIn Learning), direct-to-consumer training offerings (such as those from Coursera and edX), specialized content training offerings (such as those from A Cloud Guru and Skillshare), and free online resources used to gather and share knowledge and skills. We expect our existing competitors and new entrants to the online learning market to continually evolve and improve their business models. If these or other market participants introduce new or improved delivery of online education and technology-enabled services that are more compelling or widely accepted than ours, our ability to grow our revenue and achieve profitability could suffer. Several new and existing companies in the online education industry provide or may provide offerings similar to what we offer on our platform, and, despite any exclusivity arrangements we have with our instructors, these companies may nonetheless pursue relationships with our instructors that may reduce, or stop altogether, the content our instructors produce for our platform. In addition, customers may choose to continue using or develop their own online learning or training solutions in-house rather than pay for our platform. We believe that our competitiveness depends on a range of factors, both within and beyond our control, including: ||| | the availability or development of alternative online learning platforms that are more compelling to learners, instructors, or organizations than ours; ||| | changes in pricing policies and terms offered by our competitors or by us; ||| | the ability to adapt to new technologies and changes in requirements of our learners, instructors, and UB customers; ||| | costs associated with acquiring and retaining learners, instructors, and UB customers; ||| | the ability of our current and future competitors to establish relationships with customers; and ||| | industry consolidation and the number and rate of new entrants. Current and potential competitors (including any new entrants into the market) may enjoy substantial competitive advantages over us, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, market- or industry-specific knowledge, more successful marketing capabilities, and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources than we have. Our current or new competitors may adopt certain aspects of our business model, which could reduce our ability to differentiate our services. Furthermore, online educational content is not typically marketed exclusively through any single channel and, accordingly, our competitors could aggregate a set of online learning courses similar to ours. Competition may intensify as our competitors raise additional capital or as new participants, including established companies, enter the markets in which we compete. Our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability could be impaired if we cannot compete successfully. The market for online learning solutions is relatively new and may not grow as we expect, which may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our future success will depend in part on the growth, if any, in the demand for online learning solutions. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the demand for online learning solutions from both individuals and businesses alike, the online learning market is less mature than the market for in-person instruction and continues to evolve rapidly. There can be no assurance that the heightened levels of demand for online learning solutions experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic will continue as the effects of the pandemic, such as limitations on 18 in-person activities, abate. Consequently, it is difficult to predict demand for and continued use of our platform by learners, instructors, and UB customers, the rate at which existing learners and instructors expand their engagement with our platform, the size and growth rate of the market for our platform, the entry of competitive offerings into the market, or the success of existing competitive offerings. Furthermore, even if learners or UB customers want to adopt an online learning solution, it may take them a substantial amount of time to fully transition to this type of learning solution or they could be delayed due to budget constraints, weakening economic conditions, or other factors. Even if market demand for online learning solutions generally increases, we cannot assure you that adoption of our platform will also increase. If the market for online learning solutions does not grow as we expect or our platform does not achieve widespread adoption, it could result in reduced learner and customer spending, reduced engagement from instructors, attrition by learners, instructors, and UB customers, and decreased revenue, any of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Adherence to our values and our focus on long-term sustainability may negatively impact our short- or medium-term financial performance. Our values motivate everything we do, and we accordingly intend to focus on the long-term sustainability of our business and platform. We may take actions that we believe will benefit our business and our ecosystem and, therefore, our stockholders over a period of time, even if those actions do not maximize short- or medium-term financial results. However, these longer-term benefits may not materialize within the timeframe we expect or at all. For example: ||| | we may choose to prohibit certain content from our platform that we believe is inconsistent with our values even though we could benefit financially from the sale of that content; ||| | we may choose to revise our policies in ways that we believe will be beneficial to our learners, instructors, and UB customers in the long term even though the changes are perceived unfavorably among our existing learners, instructors, and customers; or ||| | we may take actions, such as locating our servers in low-impact data centers, that reduce our environmental footprint even though these actions may be more costly than other alternatives. The COVID-19 pandemic could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in volatile and unpredictable ways. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the outbreak of COVID-19 was a global pandemic. To limit the spread of the virus, governments have imposed various restrictions, including emergency declarations at the federal, state, and local levels, school and business closings, quarantines, shelter at home orders, restrictions on travel and trade, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other social distancing measures. The full extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, financial condition, and results of operations depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable, including the duration and scope of the pandemic (including any potential future waves of the pandemic domestically and globally); governmental, business, and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic, including the availability, adoption, and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines; the effect on our learners, instructors, and UB customers; disruptions or restrictions on our employees ability to work and travel; the availability and cost to access capital markets; and interruptions related to our cloud networking and mobile app infrastructure that impact our learners, instructors, and customers. We have taken precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of COVID-19 to our employees, including transitioning the majority of our employees to remote work and restricting business travel. As we continue to actively monitor issues arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, we may take further actions that alter our business operations, including as may be required by federal, state, local, or foreign authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, learners, instructors, UB customers, business partners, and stockholders. 19 We have also seen significant and rapid shifts in the traditional models of education and training as the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed. Although we believe the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need or willingness of businesses, governments, institutions, and individuals to adopt remote, online, and asynchronous learning and training, we cannot predict whether this trend will continue as the pandemic subsides, restrictions ease and the risk and barriers associated with in-person learning and training decrease. Learners and UB customers may choose to revert to more traditional, in-person learning and training solutions following the pandemic, which could adversely affect the demand for our platform and our revenue. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact the financial resources available to learners and UB customers, which could in turn negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may need to change our pricing model for our platforms offerings, which in turn could adversely impact our results of operations. We have in the past, and expect that we may in the future, need to change our pricing model or target contract length from time to time, which could impact our financial results. As the market for our learning platform develops, as new competitors introduce competitive applications or services, or as we enter into new international markets, we may be unable to attract new learners or UB customers at the same price or based on the same pricing models we have historically used, or for contract lengths consistent with our historical averages. In addition, as we develop and roll out new products, such as our recently launched consumer subscription model, or improve existing ones, we will need to develop pricing and contract models for these products that appeal to consumer learners over time, and we may not be successful in doing so. Pricing and contract length decisions may also impact the mix of adoption among our offerings and negatively impact our overall revenue. Competition may also require us to make substantial price concessions. Moreover, our pricing model and methodology has been, and may in the future become, subject to legal challenge under applicable federal or state laws, regulations, and guidelines relating to promotional pricing practices. For example, in August 2021, a putative class action complaint was filed against us alleging violations of Californias unfair competition and false advertising statutes as well as the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act in connection with our pricing practices. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by any of the foregoing, and we may have increased difficulty achieving or maintaining profitability. Failure to effectively expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our base of learners and UB customers and achieve broader market acceptance. Our ability to broaden our base of both consumer learners and UB customers, and achieve broader market acceptance of our marketplace platform, will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our sales and marketing organizations to work together to drive our sales pipeline and cultivate customer relationships. Our marketing efforts include the use of search engine optimization, paid search, email marketing, and television. We have invested in and plan to continue expanding our sales and marketing organizations, both domestically and internationally. Identifying, recruiting, and training sales personnel will require significant time, expense, and attention. If we are unable to hire, develop, and retain talented sales or marketing personnel, if our new sales or marketing personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time (including as a result of working remotely in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic), or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective, our ability to broaden our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform could be harmed. In addition, the investments we make in our sales and marketing organizations will occur in advance of experiencing benefits from such investments, making it difficult to determine in a timely manner if we are efficiently allocating our resources in these areas. If we fail to effectively adapt and respond to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, and changing customer needs or requirements, our platform may become less competitive. The markets in which we compete are and will continue to be characterized by constant change and innovation. Our success is predicated on our ability to identify and anticipate the needs of learners, instructors, and UB 20 customers and design a scalable learning experience platform that allows them to easily create and access high-quality, in-demand educational content. Our ability to attract new and retain existing learners, instructors and UB customers to our platform, and to deepen their relationships with our platform, depends in large part on our ability to continue improving and enhancing our offerings. We may experience difficulties with software development that could delay or prevent the development, introduction or implementation of platform modifications and enhancements. Software development involves a significant amount of time for our technology team, as it can take developers months to update, code, and test new and upgraded features and integrate them into our platform. We must also continually update, test, and enhance our platform. The continual improvement and enhancement of our platform requires significant investment and we may not have the resources to continue making these investments. Further, there can be no assurance that the platform modifications and enhancements in which we invest will result in additional revenue sufficient to cover the cost of developing those modifications and enhancements, if any. If we are not able to improve and enhance our platform in an effective manner, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected. If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our reputation and business may suffer. We believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand recognition is critical to our ability to attract and retain learners, instructors, UB customers, and partners, and that the importance of our reputation and brand recognition will continue to increase as competition in the markets in which we operate continues to develop. Our success in this arena will depend on a range of factors, both within and beyond our control. Factors affecting our reputation and brand recognition that are within our control include our ability to: ||| | market our platform effectively and efficiently; ||| | maintain a useful, innovative, and reliable platform; ||| | maintain a high satisfaction among learners, instructors, and UB customers; ||| | provide a high quality and perceived value for our platform; ||| | successfully differentiate our platform from competing offerings; ||| | maintain a consistently high level of customer service; and ||| | prevent any actual or perceived data breach or data loss, or misuse or perceived misuse of our platform. Additionally, our reputation and brand recognition may be affected by factors that are beyond our control, such as: ||| | the actions of competitors or other third parties; ||| | the quality and quantity of, as well as the nature and subject matter of, content available from instructors on our platform; ||| | positive or negative publicity, including with respect to events or activities attributed to us, our employees, instructors, or our commercial partners; ||| | interruptions, delays, or attacks on our platform; and ||| | litigation or legal developments. Damage to our reputation and brand, from the factors listed above or otherwise, may reduce demand for our platform and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, any attempts to rehabilitate our reputation and brand recognition may be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that any such efforts will ultimately be successful. We could face liability, or our reputation might be harmed, as a result of courses posted to our platform. Instructors at times post courses and related materials to our platform that contain content owned by third parties, and we do not proactively review content for potential infringement of intellectual property rights. Although we maintain and enforce terms and policies requiring instructors to respect the intellectual property rights of others, 21 the laws governing the fair use of these third-party materials are imprecise and adjudicated on a case-by-case basis, which makes it challenging to adopt and implement appropriately balanced institutional policies governing these practices. As a result, we are subject to potential liability to third parties for the unauthorized duplication, distribution, or other use of this material. In addition, third parties have alleged, and in the future may allege, misappropriation, plagiarism, or similar claims related to content appearing on our platform. Any such claims, including claims of defamation, disparagement, negligence, warranty, misappropriation, or personal harm, could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel, regardless of whether the claims have merit. Moreover, there can be no assurance that measures taken under our terms and policies in response to complaints by third-party content owners regarding intellectual property violations, such as taking down courses subject to a valid complaint or banning instructors who violate our repeat infringer policy, will be sufficient to protect us from claims of intellectual property infringement. Our various liability insurance coverages may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter or cease our uses of such material, which may include removing course content or altering the functionality of our platform, or be required to pay monetary damages. While we rely on a variety of statutory and common law frameworks and defenses, including those provided by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, or the DMCA, the Communications Decency Act, or the CDA, the fair-use doctrine in the United States and the E-Commerce Directive in the European Union, or the E.U., differences between statutes, limitations on immunity, requirements to maintain immunity, and moderation efforts in the many jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our ability to rely on these frameworks and defenses, or create uncertainty regarding liability for content posted to our platform. As an example, Article 17 of the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market was passed in the E.U., which affords copyright owners some enforcement rights that may conflict with U.S. safe harbor protections afforded to us under the DMCA. Member states in the E.U. are in the process of determining how Article 17 will be implemented in their particular country. In addition, the E.U. is also reportedly reviewing the regulation of digital services, and it has been reported that the E.U. plans to introduce the Digital Services Act, a package of legislation intended to update the liability and safety rules for digital platforms, products, and services, which could negatively impact the scope of the limited immunity provided to us by the E-Commerce Directive. In countries in Asia and Latin America, generally there are not similar statutes to the CDA or E-Commerce Directive. The laws of countries in Asia and Latin America generally provide for direct liability if a platform is involved in creating such content or has actual knowledge of the content without taking action to take it down. Further, laws in some Asian countries also provide for primary or secondary liability, which can include criminal liability, if a platform failed to take sufficient steps to prevent such content from being uploaded. Although these and other similar legal provisions provide limited protections from liability for platforms like ours, if we are found not to be protected by the safe harbor provisions of the DMCA, CDA, or other similar laws, or if we are deemed subject to laws in other countries that may not have the same protections or that may impose more onerous obligations on us, including Article 17 or other proactive obligations to filter or review content for potential infringement of intellectual property, we may owe substantial damages and our brand, reputation, and financial results may be harmed. Moreover, regulators in the United States and in other countries in which we operate may introduce new regulatory regimes that increase potential liability for information or content available on or through our platform, or which impose additional obligations to monitor such information or content, which could increase our costs. Failure of our resellers or other commercial partners to use acceptable ethical business practices or comply with applicable laws could negatively impact our business. In certain jurisdictions, such as Japan, we rely on third-party resellers and other commercial partners to distribute and market our offerings. We expect these resellers and partners to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, but we cannot control their conduct. If any of our resellers or partners violates applicable laws or implements business practices that are regarded as unethical, the distribution of our platform in those jurisdictions could be interrupted, usage of our platform could decline, our reputation could be damaged and we may be subject to liability. Any of these events could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 22 Our revenue, results of operations, and financial condition could be negatively affected by general economic conditions. Our business is sensitive to trends in the general economy, which is unpredictable. Therefore, our operating results, to the extent they reflect changes in the broader economy, may be subject to significant fluctuations. Since online learning is generally dependent on discretionary spending, negative general economic conditions could significantly reduce the overall amount that learners and organizations spend on, and the frequency of, online learning. Any or all of these factors could reduce the demand for our services, reducing our revenues. In addition, the occurrence of any of these events could increase our need to make significant expenditures to continue to attract learners and UB customers to our platform. Our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, or other catastrophic events. Our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected in the event of earthquakes, floods, fires, telecommunications failures, blackouts, or other power losses, break-ins, acts of terrorism, political crises, inclement weather, public health crises, pandemics or endemics, or other catastrophic events. In particular, our corporate headquarters are located in San Francisco, California, an earthquake-sensitive area and one that has been increasingly vulnerable to wildfires, and damage to or total destruction of our executive offices resulting from earthquakes may not be covered in whole or in part by any insurance we may have. If floods, fire, inclement weather including extreme rain, wind, heat, or cold, or accidents due to human error were to occur and cause damage to our properties, or if our operations were interrupted by telecommunications failures, blackouts, acts of terrorism, political or geopolitical crises, or public health crises, our results of operations would suffer, especially if such events were to occur during peak periods. We may not be able to effectively shift our operations due to disruptions arising from the occurrence of such events, and our business could be affected adversely as a result. Our business could be harmed if we fail to manage our growth effectively. The rapid growth we have experienced, and may continue to experience, in our business places significant demands on our operational infrastructure. The scalability and flexibility of our platform depends on the functionality of our technology and network infrastructure and our ability to handle increased traffic and demand for bandwidth. The growth in the number of learners and instructors using our platform and the amount of educational content available through our platform has increased the amount of data and requests that we process. Any problems with the transmission of increased data and requests could result in harm to our brand or reputation. Moreover, as our business grows, we will need to devote additional resources to improving our operational infrastructure and continuing to enhance our scalability in order to maintain the performance of our platform. Our growth has placed, and will likely continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial, and other resources. We have grown from 230 full-time employees in May 2016 to 1,013 full-time employees in June 2021. We intend to further expand our overall business, including headcount, with no assurance that our revenues will continue to grow. As we grow, we will be required to continue to improve our operational and financial controls and reporting procedures and we may not be able to do so effectively. As such, we may be unable to manage our expenses effectively in the future, which may negatively impact our gross profit or operating expenses. Our future success depends on our ability to retain our senior management team and other highly skilled employees and to attract, retain, and motivate our qualified personnel. We depend on the continued services and performance of our senior management team, key technical employees, and other key personnel. Although we have entered into employment agreements with senior management team members, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time or not be able to perform the services we require in the future. We do not maintain key person insurance for any of our executives or other employees. Similarly, third parties may attempt to encourage our senior management team or other key 23 employees to leave for other employment. The loss of one or more of the members of our senior management team or other key personnel for any reason could disrupt our operations, create uncertainty among investors, adversely impact employee retention and morale and significantly harm our business. To execute our growth plan, we must hire many employees over the next few years. In addition, we must retain our highly qualified employees. Competition for highly qualified employees is intense, particularly from other high growth technology companies and in the San Francisco, California labor market, where our corporate headquarters are located. From time to time we have experienced, and may continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with the appropriate level of qualifications. The companies with which we compete for qualified employees may have greater resources than we have and may offer compensation packages that are perceived to be better than ours. Additionally, changes in our compensation structure may be negatively received by employees and result in attrition or cause difficulty in the recruiting process. If we fail to attract new employees or fail to retain and motivate our current employees, our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected. Any failure to successfully execute and integrate future acquisitions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We have in the past acquired, and may in the future pursue acquisitions of, businesses, technologies, services and other assets and strategic investments that complement our business. For example, in August 2021, we announced our acquisition of CUX (d/b/a CorpU), or CorpU, an online leadership development platform. We have limited experience as an organization with successfully executing and integrating acquisitions. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: ||| | difficulties in integrating and managing the combined operations, technology platforms, or offerings of any company we acquire and realizing the anticipated economic, operational and other benefits of the acquisition in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays, and failure to execute on the intended strategy and synergies; ||| | failure of the acquired businesses to achieve anticipated revenue, earnings, or cash flow; ||| | diversion of managements attention or other resources from our existing business; ||| | our inability to maintain the key customers, business relationships, suppliers, and brand potential of acquired businesses; ||| | uncertainty of entry into businesses or geographies in which we have limited or no prior experience or in which competitors have stronger positions; ||| | unanticipated costs associated with pursuing acquisitions or greater than expected costs in integrating the acquired businesses; ||| | responsibility for the liabilities of acquired businesses, including those that were not disclosed to us or exceed our estimates, such as liabilities arising out of the failure to maintain effective privacy, data protection and cybersecurity controls, and liabilities arising out of the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including tax laws; ||| | difficulties in or costs associated with assigning or transferring to us or our subsidiaries the acquired companies intellectual property or its licenses to third-party intellectual property; ||| | inability to maintain our culture and values, ethical standards, controls, procedures, and policies; ||| | challenges in integrating the workforce of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies; 24 ||| | challenges in integrating and auditing the financial statements of acquired companies that have not historically prepared financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP; and ||| | potential accounting charges to the extent goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with an acquisition, such as trademarks, customer relationships, or intellectual property, are later determined to be impaired and written down in value. We may not succeed in addressing these or other risks in connection with acquisitions. The inability to integrate successfully, or in a timely fashion, the business, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of any acquired business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may need to raise additional funds to pursue our growth strategy or continue operations, and we may be unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund our growth, enhance our platform, respond to competitive pressures, or make acquisitions or other investments. Our business plans may change, general economic, financial or political conditions in our markets may deteriorate or other circumstances may arise, in each case that have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and the anticipated cash needs of our business. Any of these events or circumstances could result in significant additional funding needs, requiring us to raise additional capital. We cannot predict the timing or amount of any such capital requirements at this time. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or at all, we may be unable to expand its business at the rate desired and our results of operations may suffer. We operate internationally and we plan to continue expanding our international operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in international operations. Managing a global organization requires significant resources and management attention. We currently maintain offices outside of the United States in Turkey and Ireland, and we plan to expand our international operations in the future. We generated 59% and 61% of our revenue outside North America in 2019 and 2020, respectively, and 60% and 61% during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively, and, based on our instructor registration records, we estimate that a majority of our instructors are located outside the United States. Any further international expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be as successful as we expect or at all. Additionally, conducting international operations subjects us to risks that we have not generally faced in the United States. These risks include: ||| | the cost and resources required to localize our services, which requires the translation of our websites into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements; ||| | competition with local market participants who understand the local market better than we do or who have pre-existing relationships with our potential learners and UB customers in those markets; ||| | legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the content and services provided by our instructors, including as a result of local laws or a lack of clear precedent of applicable law; ||| | the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and legal standards; ||| | lack of familiarity with and unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements; ||| | adapting to variations in payment forms from learners and UB customers; ||| | difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; ||| | fluctuations in currency exchange rates; 25 ||| | potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; ||| | increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities and difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls; ||| | political, social, and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks, and security concerns in general; ||| | reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and ||| | higher telecommunications and internet service provider costs. Operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. The investment and additional resources required to establish operations and manage growth in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenue or profitability. Our strategic and other relationships with partners overseas may also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny in the United States and other jurisdictions. For example, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. has continued to apply a more stringent review of certain foreign investment in U.S. companies, and has made inquiries to us with respect to equity investments in us by foreign investors. Further, as we continue to expand internationally, we could also become subject to increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, repatriating money without adverse tax consequences, and risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We have not engaged in currency hedging activities to limit risk of exchange rate fluctuations, and while we may decide to do so in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited. Changes in exchange rates affect our costs and earnings, and may also affect the book value of our assets located outside the United States and the amount of our stockholders equity. We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that affect our business. As a global platform with learners and instructors in over 180 countries, we are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations regarding consumer protection, advertising, electronic marketing, privacy, data protection and cybersecurity, data localization requirements, online services, freedom of speech, labor, real estate, taxation, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, export and national security, tariffs, anti-corruption and telecommunications, all of which are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly laws outside the U.S., and compliance with laws, regulations and similar requirements may be burdensome and expensive. Because these laws and regulations are subject to change over time, we must continue to dedicate resources to monitoring developments in the law and ensuring compliance. Laws and regulations may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and certain jurisdictions may impose more stringent regulatory requirements than the U.S., which may increase the cost of compliance and doing business and expose us to possible litigation, penalties, or fines. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could make our platform less attractive to learners, instructors, or enterprise customers or cause us to change or limit our ability to make available our platform. We have policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but we cannot assure you that we will not experience violations of such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures. Any such violations could subject us to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a 26 significant diversion of managements attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. We are subject to governmental export and import controls and regulations that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. Our business activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export and similar laws and regulations, including trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control and, in some cases, the U.S. Department of Commerces Export Administration Regulations. The U.S. export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale of certain services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons, and entities which in some cases might apply to our activities. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technology and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to provide learners access to our platform or could limit our learners ability to access or use our services in those countries. Although we take precautions to prevent our platform from being provided in violation of such laws, our platform could be provided inadvertently in violation of such laws, despite the precautions we take. Complying with these laws and regulations could be particularly difficult because our products are widely available worldwide, in some cases, by providing only minimal information at registration. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges and fines. We also may be adversely affected through penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. In addition, various countries regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform or could limit our learners ability to access our platform in those countries. Changes in our platform, or future changes in export and import regulations, may prevent our international learners or instructors from using our platform or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platform to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions, or related legislation or changes in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform. Failure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws, and similar laws, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, and possibly other anti-bribery laws and anti-money laundering laws in countries outside of the United States in which we conduct our activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees, agents, representatives, business partners, and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. We sometimes engage third parties to sell our products and conduct our business abroad. We and our employees, agents, representatives, business partners, or third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these employees, agents, representatives, business partners, or third-party intermediaries even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. We cannot assure you that none of our employees and agents will take actions in violation of applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase. These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance 27 with such laws, we cannot assure you that none of our employees, agents, representatives, business partners, or third-party intermediaries will take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. Any allegations or violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Responding to any investigation or action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of managements attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. We are from time to time involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and other proceedings that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are involved in litigation matters from time to time, such as matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including intellectual property, commercial, employment, class action, whistleblower, accessibility, and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert managements attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability, or require us to change our business practices. In addition, the expense of litigation and the timing of these expenses from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Because of the potential risks, expenses, and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement agreements. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Increased scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers, employees, and others regarding our environmental, social and governance practices and reporting could cause us to incur additional costs, devote additional resources and expose us to additional risks, which could adversely impact our reputation, customer acquisition and retention, access to capital and employee retention. Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance, or ESG, practices and reporting. Investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders have focused increasingly on ESG practices and placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments, purchases and other interactions with companies. For example, many investment funds focus on positive ESG business practices and sustainability scores when making investments and may consider a companys ESG or sustainability scores as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers and if a company is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with such company to improve ESG disclosure or performance and may also make voting decisions on this basis. With this increased focus and demand, public reporting regarding ESG practices is becoming more broadly expected. If our ESG practices and reporting do not meet investor, customer, or employee expectations, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation, and learner and UB customer retention may be negatively impacted. Any disclosure we make may include our policies and practices on a variety of ESG matters, including corporate governance, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital management, and workforce inclusion and diversity. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG reporting, our ESG practices or our speed of adoption. We could also incur additional costs and devote additional resources to monitor, report and implement various ESG practices. If we fail, or are perceived to be failing, to meet the standards included in any sustainability disclosure or the expectations of our various stakeholders, it could negatively impact our reputation, UB customer and learner acquisition and retention, access to capital and employee retention. 28 Risks related to technology, privacy, and cybersecurity Changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection, or cybersecurity, including those relating to the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations could adversely affect our business. We receive, transmit, and store personally identifiable information and other data relating to our learners, instructors, and other individuals, such as our employees. Numerous local, municipal, state, federal, and international laws and regulations address privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of certain types of data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, Canadas Anti-Spam Legislation, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (restricting telemarketing and the use of automated SMS text messaging), Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA. These laws, rules, and regulations evolve frequently and their scope may continually change, through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation, and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. For example, the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, has resulted and will continue to result in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies like ours. The GDPR regulates our collection, control, processing, sharing, disclosure, and other use of data that can directly or indirectly identify a living individual that is a resident of the E.U. and imposes stringent data protection requirements with significant penalties and the risk of civil litigation, for noncompliance. Failure to comply with the GDPR may result in fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the infringer, whichever is greater. It may also lead to civil litigation, with the risks of damages, injunctive relief, or regulatory orders adversely impacting the ways in which our business can use personal data. In addition, in January 2021, the United Kingdom transposed the GDPR into domestic law with a United Kingdom version of the GDPR (combining the GDPR and the United Kingdom Data Protection Act of 2018), referred to as the U.K. GDPR, which provides for fines of up 17.5 million British pounds sterling or 4% of global turnover, whichever is greater. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the E.U. in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear. An example is the regulation of data transfers between E.U. member states and the United Kingdom and the role of the United Kingdoms Information Commissioners Office with respect to the E.U. On June 28, 2021, the European Commission announced a decision of adequacy concluding that the United Kingdom ensures an equivalent level of data protection to the GDPR, which provides some relief regarding the legality of continued personal data flows from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to the United Kingdom Some uncertainty remains, however, as this adequacy determination must be renewed after four years and may be modified or revoked in the interim. We cannot fully predict how the Data Protection Act, the U.K. GDPR, and other United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations may develop in the medium to longer term nor the effects of divergent laws and guidance regarding how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated. Changes with respect to any of these matters may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. Additionally, we are or may become subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including those relating to transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area, or the EEA. Recent legal developments have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the EEA to the U.S. and other jurisdictions. For example, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, invalidated the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, or the Privacy Shield, under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to U.S. entities that had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield), it noted that reliance on them may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. In addition to other mechanisms (particularly standard contractual clauses), in limited circumstances we may rely on Privacy 29 Shield certifications of third parties (for example, vendors and partners). The European Commission released a draft of revised standard contractual clauses, or SCCs, addressing the CJEU concerns in November 2020, and on June 4, 2021, published new SCCs. These developments regarding cross-border data transfers have created uncertainty and increased the risk around our international operations and may require us to review and amend the legal mechanisms by which we make or receive personal data transfers to the U.S. and other jurisdictions. We may, among other things, be required to implement additional contractual and technical safeguards for any personal data transferred out of the EEA, which may increase compliance costs, lead to increased regulatory scrutiny or liability, may require additional contractual negotiations, and may adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. The CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, among other things, requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers the ability to opt out of certain types of data sharing and sales of their personal information. The CCPA also prohibits covered businesses from discriminating against consumers (for example, charging more for services) for exercising their rights. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Additionally, in November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020, or the CPRA. The CPRA further expands the CCPA with additional data privacy compliance requirements that may impact our business and establishes a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing those requirements. Aspects of the interpretation and enforcement of the CCPA and CPRA remain uncertain. The enactment of the CCPA has prompted a wave of similar legislative developments in other states in the U.S., which creates the potential for a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws and could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, in March 2021, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, or CDPA, a comprehensive privacy statute that becomes effective on January 1, 2023 (at the same time as the CPRA) and shares similarities with the CCPA, the CPRA, and legislation proposed in other states, and in June 2021, Colorado enacted a similar law, the Colorado Privacy Act, or CPA, that becomes effective on July 1, 2023. The effects of these state statutes and other similar state or federal laws are significant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses. Additionally, many laws and regulations relating to privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of certain types of data are subject to varying degrees of enforcement and new and changing interpretations by courts. These laws and other changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity, particularly any new or modified laws or regulations, or changes to the interpretation or enforcement of such laws or regulations, that require enhanced protection of certain types of data or new obligations with regard to data retention, transfer, or disclosure, could greatly increase the cost of providing our platform, require significant changes to our operations, or even prevent us from providing our platform in jurisdictions in which we currently operate and in which we may operate in the future. Additionally, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards, or contractual obligations. Publication of our privacy statement and other policies regarding privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity may subject us to investigation or enforcement actions by regulators if those statements or policies are found to be deficient, lacking transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices. We are also bound by contractual obligations related to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful or may have other negative consequences. The various privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity legal obligations that apply to us may evolve in a manner that relates to our practices or the features of our mobile apps or website and we may need to take additional measures to comply with the new and evolving legal obligations, including but not limited to training efforts for our employees, contractors and third party partners. Such efforts may not be successful or may have other negative consequences. In particular, with laws and regulations such as the CCPA, CPRA, CDPA, and CPA imposing new and relatively burdensome obligations and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other laws and regulations, we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do 30 so. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and cybersecurity, it is possible that our interpretations of the law, practices, policies, or platform or other services or offerings could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations, or obligations. Any failure, or consequences associated with our efforts to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or cybersecurity, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of data relating to learners, instructors, or other individuals, or the perception that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing learners, instructors, and UB customers from using our platform, or result in fines, investigations, or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Even if not subject to legal challenge, the perception of concerns relating to privacy, data protection, or cybersecurity, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. A cybersecurity attack or other security breach or incident could delay or interrupt service to our learners, instructors, and UB customers, harm our reputation or subject us to significant liability. Our platform involves the processing of significant amounts of data relating to the learners, instructors, and UB customers interacting with our platform, including personal data and personal information. Additionally, we collect and store certain sensitive and proprietary information, and personal data and personal information, in the operation of our business, including trade secrets, intellectual property, employee data, and other confidential data. We engage third-party service providers to store and otherwise process certain data, including sensitive and personal information. Our service providers have been, and in the future may be, the targets of cyberattacks, malicious software, phishing schemes, fraud, and other risks to the confidentiality, security, and integrity of their systems and the data they process for us. Our ability to monitor our service providers cybersecurity is limited, and, in any event, third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures, resulting in the unauthorized access to, misuse, disclosure, loss, or destruction of data they process for us, including sensitive and personal information. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks, and we cannot guarantee that our or our third-party providers systems and networks have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third parties that support us and our services. While we have taken measures to protect our own proprietary and confidential information, as well as the personal information, personal data, and confidential information that we otherwise obtain, and measures to protect our platform, we, the networks and systems used in our business, including those of third-party service providers, we and our third-party service providers have experienced, and we, our service providers and our platform may in the future experience, cybersecurity attacks or other security breaches or incidents. Cybersecurity attacks may take the form of denial of service attacks, attacks using ransomware or other malware or other attacks, and can come from individual hackers, criminal groups, and state-sponsored organizations. These sources can also implement social engineering techniques to induce our employees, contractors, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to data, and we and our platform otherwise may be subject to security breaches and incidents resulting from employee or contractor error or malfeasance. We may be more susceptible to cyberattacks and other security breaches and other security incidents while social distancing measures restricting the ability of our employees to work at our offices are in place to combat the COVID-19 pandemic because we have less capability to implement, monitor, and enforce our information security and data protection policies. More generally, we cannot guarantee that applicable recovery systems, security protocols, network protection mechanisms, and other procedures of ourselves of our third-party service providers are or will be adequate to prevent network and service interruption, system failure or loss, corruption, or unauthorized access to, or disclosure or acquisition of, data, including personal data, personal information, and other sensitive information 31 that we or they process or maintain. Moreover, our platform could be breached or disrupted if vulnerabilities in our platform are exploited by unauthorized third parties. Since techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and the size of cybersecurity attacks and of security breaches and incidents are increasing, we and our third-party service providers may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures or stop the attacks while they are occurring. A cybersecurity attack or security breach or incident could delay or interrupt service to our learners, instructors, or organizations and may deter learners, instructors, or organizations from using our platform, and we and our service providers may face difficulties or delays in identifying, remediating, and otherwise responding to any cybersecurity attack or other security breach or incident. In addition, any actual or perceived cybersecurity attack or security breach or incident could damage our reputation and brand, expose us to a risk of claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, or other proceedings and possible fines, penalties, or other liability and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems caused by the cybersecurity attack or security breach or incident. We incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security breaches and other security-related incidents, and we expect our costs will increase as we make improvements to our systems and processes to prevent future breaches and incidents. Some jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data. Such mandatory disclosures could lead to negative publicity and any such disclosures, or any belief that a cybersecurity attack, or a security breach or incident, has impacted us, our platform, or our service providers may cause our learners, instructors, or UB customers to lose confidence in the security of our platform and the effectiveness of the cybersecurity measures we and our service providers utilize. Further, any limitations of liability provisions in our customer and user agreements, contracts with third-party service providers, or other contracts may not be enforceable or adequate or otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security breach or incident or other security-related matter. While our insurance policies include liability coverage for certain of these matters, subject to applicable deductibles, if we experienced a cybersecurity attack or other security breach or other incident, we could be subject to claims or damages that exceed our insurance coverage. If such an attack or other breach or incident occurred, our insurance coverage might not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, such insurance may not continue to be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all, and insurers may deny us coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation. Interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our continued growth partially depends on the ability of learners and instructors to access our platform at any time. Our platform has encountered, and may in the future encounter, disruptions, outages, and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, introductions of new capabilities, human or technology errors, distributed denial of service attacks, or other security related incidents. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems in a timely manner. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve the performance of our platform as it grows and becomes more complex, and in the future we may be required to allocate significant resources to augment and update our technology and network infrastructure. If learners or instructors are unable to access our platform within a reasonable amount of time, or at all, our business will be harmed. Our business depends significantly on continued access to the internet and mobile networks. Our learners and instructors rely on access to the internet and mobile networks to access our platform. Internet service providers may choose to disrupt or degrade our access to our platform or increase the cost of such access. Internet service providers or mobile network operators could also attempt to charge us for providing access to our platform. In 2015, rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, went into 32 effect that prohibited internet service providers from charging content providers higher rates in order to deliver their content over certain fast traffic lanes; however, those rules were repealed in June 2018, and efforts to challenge the repeal in the courts have failed to reverse the FCCs 2018 decision, and in October 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a mixed ruling that did not reverse the FCCs 2015 decision in its entirety. Although this recent court ruling allows states to enact their own net neutrality rules, the repeal of federal protections may make it more difficult or costly for many buyers or instructors to access our platform and may result in increased costs for us, which could significantly harm our business. Outside the United States, government regulation of the internet, including the idea of network neutrality, may be developing or non-existent. It is possible that governments of one or more foreign countries may seek to censor content available on our platform or may even attempt to block access to our platform. If we are restricted from operating in one or more countries, our ability to attract and retain learners, instructors, and customers may be adversely affected and we may not be able to grow our business as we anticipate. We rely on Amazon Web Services for a substantial portion of our platform services. Any disruption of, or interference with, our use of Amazon Web Services could negatively impact our business and operations. Amazon Web Services provides distributed computing infrastructure platforms for business operations, commonly referred to as cloud computing services. We currently run a significant portion of our platforms computing on Amazon Web Services, and any significant disruption of, or interference with, our use of Amazon Web Services would negatively impact our operations and our business would be seriously harmed. If learners or instructors are unable to access our platform through Amazon Web Services or encounter difficulties in doing so, we may lose learners, instructors, and UB customers. The level of service provided by Amazon Web Services may also impact the adoption and perception of our platform. If Amazon Web Services experiences interruptions in service regularly or for a prolonged basis, or other similar issues, our business would be seriously harmed. Hosting costs will also increase if and as our base of learners, instructors, and UB customers grows, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to grow our revenues faster than the cost of using Amazon Web Services or similar providers increases. Amazon Web Services may take actions beyond our control that could seriously harm our business, including discontinuing or limiting access to Amazon Web Services, increasing pricing terms, terminating our contract, establishing more favorable relationships or pricing terms with one or more of our competitors, and modifying or interpreting its terms of service or other policies in a manner that impacts our ability to administer our business and operations. Our payments system depends on third-party providers and is subject to evolving laws and regulations. We rely on third-party payment processors to process payments made by learners and customers, and to instructors, on our platform. We have engaged third-party service providers to perform underlying card processing, currency exchange, identity verification, and fraud analysis services. If these service providers do not perform adequately or if they terminate their relationships with us or refuse to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, we will need to find an alternate payment processor and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment processors in an acceptable time frame. Further, the software and services provided by our third-party payment processors may not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised, or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments, make payments to our instructors or conduct other payment transactions, any of which could make our platform less convenient and attractive and harm our ability to attract and retain learners, instructors, and customers. In addition, if these providers increase the fees they charge us, our operating expenses could increase. The laws and regulations related to payments are complex and vary across different jurisdictions in the United States and globally. As a result, we are required to spend significant time and effort to comply with those laws and regulations. Any failure or claim of our failure to comply, or any failure by our third-party service providers to 33 comply, could cost us substantial resources, result in liabilities, or force us to stop offering certain third-party payment services. In addition, as we expand our international operations, we will need to accommodate international payment method alternatives. As we expand the availability of new payment methods in the future, including internationally, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements. Further, through our agreement with our third-party credit card processors, we are indirectly subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We are also subject to rules governing electronic funds transfers. Any change in these rules and requirements could make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to additional fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our learners and UB customers, process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. The use of our platform could be adversely affected if our mobile solutions are not effective. Learners have been increasingly accessing our platform on mobile devices through our Udemy and UB apps in recent years. The smaller screen size and reduced functionality associated with some mobile devices may make the use of our platform more difficult. Those accessing our platform primarily on mobile devices may not enroll in the courses offered on our platform as often as those accessing our platform through personal computers, which could result in less revenue for us. If we are not able to provide a rewarding experience on mobile devices, our ability to attract learners to our platform could be impaired, and consequently our business may suffer. As new mobile devices and mobile features are released, we may encounter problems in developing or supporting apps for them. In addition, supporting new devices and mobile device operating systems may require substantial time and resources. The success of our mobile apps could also be harmed by factors outside our control, including: ||| | actions taken by mobile app distributors, including the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store; ||| | unfavorable treatment received by our mobile apps, especially as compared to competing apps, such as the placement of our mobile apps in a mobile app download store; ||| | increased costs in the distribution and use our mobile app; or ||| | changes in mobile operating systems, such as iOS and Android, that degrade the functionality of our mobile website or mobile apps or that give preferential treatment to competitive offerings. If our learners encounter difficulty accessing or using, or if they choose not to use, our mobile platform, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Internet search engines drive traffic to our platform and, if we fail to appear prominently in search results, our growth rate could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Many learners find our website through internet search engines, like Google. A critical factor in attracting learners to our website is how prominently we are displayed in response to search queries. Search engine companies typically provide two types of search results: algorithmic listings and paid advertisements. We rely on both types of search results to attract visitors to our website. Algorithmic search result listings are determined and displayed in accordance with a set of proprietary formulas or algorithms developed by particular search engine companies. From time to time, these companies revise their algorithms without notice. In some instances, these modifications have caused our website to be listed less prominently in search results. In addition, search engine companies retain broad discretion to remove from search results any company whose marketing practices are deemed to be inconsistent with the search engine companies guidelines. If our marketing practices violate or appear to violate 34 search engine company guidelines, we may, without warning, not appear in search result listings at all. If we are listed less prominently or fail to appear in search result listings for any reason, visits by prospective learners to our website would likely decline. We may not be able to replace this traffic and any attempt to do so may require us to increase our sales and marketing expenditures, which may not be offset by additional revenue and could adversely affect our operating results. Risks related to our intellectual property We may be unable to adequately obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary information, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is critical to our success. We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names, copyrights, and trademarks to protect our competitive advantage, all of which offer only limited protection. The steps we take to protect our intellectual property, including physical, operational, and managerial protections of our confidential information, contractual obligations of confidentiality, assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, license agreements, and the prosecution and maintenance of registrations and applications for registration of intellectual property rights, require significant resources and may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our competitive advantage if we are unable to establish, protect, maintain, or enforce our rights or if we do not detect or are unable to address unauthorized use of our intellectual property. We may be required to use significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy portions or all of our platform and use information that we regard as proprietary to create services that compete with ours. Some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer, and disclosure of our proprietary information may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions. As of June 30, 2021, we held 12 registered trademarks in the United States and 22 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and pending trademark applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.udemy.com and some other variations. Competitors may adopt service names or domain names similar to ours, thereby harming our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to user confusion. In addition, our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names could be declared generic, and there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other trademarks that are similar to our trademarks. If our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build and maintain name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected. Effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which our products are made available, in every class of goods and services in which we operate, and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract. Further, we hold a small number of issued patents and thus have a limited ability to exclude or prevent our competitors from implementing technology, methods, and processes similar to our own. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope of our rights and the proprietary rights of others. Further, we may not timely or successfully apply for a patent or register its trademarks or otherwise secure rights in our intellectual property. We expect to continue to expand internationally and, in some foreign countries, the mechanisms to establish and enforce intellectual property rights may be inadequate to protect our technology, which could harm our business. It is our policy to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with the parties with whom we have strategic relationships. No assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to our proprietary information and trade secrets. The confidentiality agreements on which we rely to protect certain technologies 35 may be breached, may not be adequate to protect our confidential information, trade secrets, and proprietary technologies, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, trade secrets, or proprietary technology. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors or others from independently developing products that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and confidential information, and in such cases we may not be able to assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Additionally, we may from time to time be subject to opposition or similar proceedings with respect to applications for registrations of our intellectual property, including trademarks. While we aim to acquire adequate protection of our brand through trademark registrations in key markets, occasionally third parties may have already registered or otherwise acquired rights to identical or similar marks for services that also address our market. We rely on our brand and trademarks to identify our platform and to differentiate our platform and services from those of our competitors, and if we are unable to adequately protect our trademarks, third parties may use our brand names or trademarks similar to ours in a manner that may cause confusion in the market, which could decrease the value of our brand and adversely affect our business and competitive advantages. Our intellectual property rights and the enforcement or defense of such rights may be affected by developments or uncertainty in laws and regulations relating to intellectual property rights. Moreover, many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of our intellectual property or marketing of competing products in violation of our intellectual property rights generally. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property and misappropriation of our technology and trade secrets is difficult and we may not always be aware of such unauthorized use or misappropriation. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to use, copy, or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our technology or otherwise develop services with the same or similar functionality as our platform. If our competitors infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights and we are not adequately protected, or if our competitors are able to develop a platform with the same or similar functionality as ours without infringing our intellectual property, our competitive advantage and results of operations could be harmed. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. As a result, we may be aware of infringement by our competitors but may choose not to bring litigation to protect our intellectual property rights due to the cost, time, and distraction of bringing such litigation. Furthermore, if we do decide to bring litigation, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits challenging or opposing our right to use and otherwise exploit particular intellectual property, services, and technology or the enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our managements attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our solutions, impair the functionality of our platform, prevent or delay introductions of new or enhanced solutions, result in us substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform, or injure our reputation. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to developing and protecting their technology or intellectual property rights than we do. Intellectual property litigation, including litigation related to content available on our platform, could result in significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation. Companies in the technology industry are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We periodically receive notices that claim we have infringed, misappropriated, or misused other parties intellectual property rights, including with respect to content made available on our platform by instructors and other third parties. As we gain greater public recognition, we may face 36 a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property claims. Any intellectual property claims against us, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert the attention of our management. Some of our competitors have extensive portfolios of issued patents. Many potential litigants, including some of our competitors and patent holding companies, have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights. Litigation regarding intellectual property rights is inherently uncertain due to the complex issues involved, and we may not be successful in defending ourselves in such matters. Furthermore, we may not qualify for the safe harbors established by laws in the United States and other countries protecting online service providers from claims related to content posted by users, or those laws could change in a manner making them difficult or impossible to qualify for such protection, increasing our exposure. While our Terms of Use, Instructor Terms and Trust & Safety policies require instructors to respect the intellectual property rights of others, we have limited ability to influence the behavior of third parties, and there can be no assurance that these terms and policies will be sufficient to dissuade or prevent infringing activity by third parties on our platform. For more information, see Risks related to our business and operationsWe could face liability, or our reputation might be harmed, as a result of courses posted to our platform. Any claims successfully brought against us could subject us to significant liability for damages and we may be required to stop using technology or other intellectual property alleged to be in violation of a third partys rights. We also might be required to seek a license for third-party intellectual property. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties or submit to unreasonable terms, which would increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit our service and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results could harm our business. Our platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our platform. We use open source software in our platform and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. In addition, we contribute software source code to open source projects under open source licenses or release internal software projects under open source licenses and anticipate continuing to do so in the future. Additionally, under some open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, certain proprietary software (including our own software) or other intellectual property rights could become subject to obligations to be disclosed in source code form and licensed, including for the purpose of enabling further modification and distribution, and at no charge or for only a nominal fee. Third parties may also seek to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license through litigation which, if successful, could subject us to liability and require us to make our proprietary software source code available under an open source license, seek to purchase a license (which, if available, could be costly), and cease offering the implicated products or services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources, and we may not be able to complete it successfully. Many of the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our products or services. While we try to insulate our proprietary code from the effects of such open source license provisions, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful, that all open source software is reviewed prior to use in our products, that our developers have not incorporated open source software into our products in potentially disruptive ways, or that they will not do so in the future. In addition to risks related to open source license requirements, use of certain open source software may pose greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, since open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 37 Risks related to financial reporting, taxation, and operations as a public company We are an emerging growth company, and any decision to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including: ||| | our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected; ||| | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and annual report on Form 10-K; and ||| | exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information that they may deem important. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of: ||| | the last day of the fiscal year in which we have at least $1.07 billion in annual revenue; ||| | the last day of the fiscal year in which we qualify as a large accelerated filer, with at least $700.0 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; ||| | the date on which we have issued, in any three-year period, more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or ||| | the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. So long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we may elect not to provide you with certain information that we would otherwise have been required to provide in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our company. As a result, investor confidence in our company and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected. Further, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on any of the exemptions afforded emerging growth companies. If some investors find our common stock less attractive because we rely on any of these exemptions, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the market price of our common stock may be more volatile and may decline. If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, lead to a decline in the market price of our common stock. As a public company, we will be required to comply with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and 38 regulations of Nasdaq. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, among other things, requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we will be required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with our second annual report on Form 10-K, and, once we cease to be an emerging growth company and if we are deemed to be an accelerated filer or large accelerated filer for purposes of the Exchange Act, we will be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with these requirements within the prescribed time period, we will be engaging in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which we anticipate will be costly, challenging, and time consuming. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants, and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented, and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. There is a risk that we will not be able to conclude, within the prescribed period or at all, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on Nasdaq. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Moreover, our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal additional deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. Any failure to implement and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, including the identification of one or more material weaknesses, could cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements and reports, which would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC, and other regulatory authorities. Following this offering, we will incur increased costs and administrative burdens as a public company, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Following this offering, we will incur increased legal, accounting, administrative, and other costs and expenses as a public company that we do not incur as a private company, and these expenses may increase even more after we are no longer an emerging growth company. As a public company, we will be subject to additional reporting and other obligations, such as the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the applicable listing standards of Nasdaq. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among other things, we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and increase demand on our systems, particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company. In addition, as a public company, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract management, and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a result of disclosure of information in this prospectus and in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors. Many members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies, and certain members joined us more recently. Our management team may not successfully or 39 efficiently manage our transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents will require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities, including as a result of our international operations or implementation of new tax rules, could harm our future results of operations. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, including Brazil, India, Ireland, Japan, and Turkey. Our effective tax rate could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, rates, treaties, and regulations or the interpretation of the same, changes to the financial accounting rules for income taxes, the outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations or administrative appeals, certain non-deductible expenses, any decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Increases in our effective tax rate would reduce profitability or increase losses. Forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty, and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates. In addition, we are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. Changes in tax and trade laws, treaties, or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could have a material adverse effect on our tax position. We made significant judgments and assumptions in the interpretation of new laws and in our calculations reflected in our financial statements. As we expand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the United States or foreign taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. On an ongoing basis, we are subject to examination by federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities on income, employment, sales, and other tax matters. While we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for taxes, there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority would not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We believe our income, employment, and transactional tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles, but an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. Certain risks relating to employment taxes and sales taxes are described in more detail under Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or remitted, or in the future should collect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes, or employment, payroll, or withholding taxes, and may successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations, or inaccuracies could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Recently, the Biden administration proposed to adjust the U.S. corporate tax rate, along with other tax measures, such as international business operations reform and/or imposition of a global minimum tax. Many countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are also actively considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws, such as those relating to digital tax, that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business. Any of these developments or changes in federal, state, or international tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results. 40 Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or remitted, or in the future should collect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes, or employment, payroll, or withholding taxes, and may successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations, or inaccuracies could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The application of non-income, or indirect, taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, business tax, and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours is a complex and evolving issue. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax obligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business. In addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes. Such taxes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to indirect taxes, such as sales, use, value-added, and goods and services taxes, in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, and we do not collect and remit indirect taxes in all jurisdictions in which we operate on the basis that such indirect taxes are not applicable to us. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect and remit such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest, could discourage learners, instructors, or organizations from using our platform, could increase the cost for consumers using our platform, or could otherwise harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, even where we are collecting taxes and remitting them to the appropriate authorities, we may fail to accurately calculate, collect, report, and remit such taxes. Additionally, one or more states, localities, or other taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose additional reporting, record-keeping, or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours. For example, taxing authorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate, collect, and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the internet, and are considering related legislation. After the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., certain states have enacted laws that would require tax reporting, collection, or tax remittance on items sold online, even where the online seller lacks a physical presence or nexus in that state. Requiring tax reporting or collection could decrease learner or instructor activity, which would harm our business. These state laws could require us to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated with tax calculation, collection, and remittance and audit requirements, which could make our offerings less attractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Also, tax rules of certain countries, including the United States, generally require payors to report payments to unrelated parties to the applicable taxing authority and to withhold a percentage of certain amounts and remit such amounts to the applicable taxing authority. Failure to comply with such reporting and withholding obligations with respect to payments we make to our instructors could result in the imposition of liabilities for the underwithheld amounts, fines, and penalties. In addition, a tax authority could assert that we should be withholding employment or other taxes from payments to instructors. In 2020, we began approaching the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, to address our historical withholding amounts for instructors. Due to our large number of instructors and the amounts paid to each, process failures with respect to these reporting obligations could result in financial liability and other consequences to us if we were unable to remedy such failures in a timely manner. As a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and any such difference may adversely affect our results of operations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is determined. 41 Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. As of December 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income of approximately $167.0 million. The $85.4 million of federal NOLs generated in taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 2018 begin expiring in 2030 if not utilized. The $81.6 million of federal NOLs generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 have an indefinite carryforward period. Realization of these NOLs depends on our future profitability. We have incurred net losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur net losses in the near future. As such, there is a risk that our existing NOLs generated before 2018 could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities if we never achieve profitability. This may require us to pay federal income taxes in future years even if our NOLs were otherwise sufficient to offset our federal taxable income in such years. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Our NOLs may be similarly impaired under state laws. For example, California recently enacted legislation limiting our ability to use our state NOLs for taxable years 2020, 2021 and 2022. We have recorded a full valuation allowance related to our NOLs and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of these assets. If our NOLs and other tax attributes expire before utilization or are subject to limitations, our business and financial results could be harmed. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporations ability to use its pre-change NOLs and federal tax credit carryforwards to offset its post-change taxable income, or reduce its federal income tax liability, may be limited. In general, an ownership change occurs when there is a cumulative change in our equity ownership by 5 percent shareholders that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. We may be limited as to the amount of our current NOLs and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized each year as a result of previous ownership changes. We have performed a Section 382 study to determine any potential Section 382 limitations on the utilization of our NOLs and tax credit carryforwards and have determined that our company experienced two ownership changes: one in connection with our Series A and A-1 preferred stock offering in September 2011, and another in connection with our Series B preferred stock offering in November 2012. We have estimated that the gross U.S. federal NOLs from 2010 to 2012 that would be subject to limitation are approximately $3.6 million. If it is determined that we have in the past experienced additional ownership changes, or if we experience one or more ownership changes as a result of this offering, future transactions in our stock, some of which are outside our control, or both, our ability to use our NOLs and federal tax credit carryforwards to reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be further limited. Similar limitations may apply under state tax laws. Our results of operations, which we report in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected if currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future. We conduct our business across more than 180 countries around the world. As we continue to expand our international operations, we will become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies and operating in foreign countries where the functional currency is the local currency. In 2020, 43% of our sales were denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, including euros, Indian rupees, British pounds sterling, Brazilian reais, and Japanese yen. Our expenses, by contrast, are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, any increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies could cause our revenue to decline relative to our costs, thereby decreasing our gross margins. Because we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars, but report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, we also face remeasurement exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could hinder our ability to predict our future results and earnings and could materially impact our results of operations. We do not currently maintain a program to hedge exposures to non-U.S. dollar currencies. 42 Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in generally accepted accounting principles. Generally accepted accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which could negatively affect our reported results of operations. Risks related to ownership of our common stock The trading price of our common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for shares of our common stock. The initial public offering price of our common stock will be determined through negotiation among us and the underwriters. This price does not necessarily reflect the price at which investors in the market will be willing to buy and sell shares of our common stock following this offering. In addition, the trading price of our common stock following this offering is likely to be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock since you might be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid in this offering. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include the following: ||| | price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time; ||| | volatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks; ||| | changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular; ||| | sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders; ||| | failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; ||| | the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet those projections; ||| | announcements by us or our competitors of new services or platform features; ||| | the publics reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC; ||| | rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry; ||| | actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations; ||| | actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors businesses, or the competitive landscape generally; ||| | litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors; ||| | actual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents; ||| | developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights; ||| | announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies by us or our competitors; ||| | new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; 43 ||| | changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles; ||| | any significant change in our management; ||| | general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; ||| | other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public health concerns or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, or responses to these events; and ||| | our anticipated uses of net proceeds from this offering. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources. An active trading market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained, and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the initial public offering price, or at all. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. Although we expect that our common stock will be approved for listing on Nasdaq, an active trading market for our shares may never develop or be sustained following this offering. The initial public offering price for our common stock was determined through negotiations with the underwriters, and the negotiated price may not be indicative of the market price of the common stock after the offering. This initial public offering price may vary from the market price of our common stock after the offering. As a result of these and other factors, you may be unable to resell your shares of our common stock at or above the initial public offering price. If you purchase our common stock in this offering, you will incur immediate and substantial dilution. The initial public offering price is substantially higher than the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately following this offering based on the total value of our tangible assets less our total liabilities. Therefore, if you purchased our common stock in this offering, at the initial public offering price of $ per share, you would experience an immediate dilution of $ per share, the difference between the price per share you pay for our common stock and our pro forma net tangible book value per share as of June 30, 2021, after giving effect to the issuance by us of shares of our common stock in this offering. See Dilution for additional information. A significant portion of our common stock is restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future, which could depress the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders, a large number of shares of our common stock becoming available for sale, or the perception in the market that such sales could occur. Upon the closing of this offering, we will have approximately shares of common stock outstanding, assuming no exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option. All of the shares of common stock sold in this offering will be freely transferable without restriction or additional registration under the Securities Act. All of our executive officers and directors and the holders of substantially all of our equity securities are subject to lock-up agreements with the underwriters of this offering that restrict the equityholders ability to transfer shares of our common stock for periods of at least 180 days from the date of this prospectus, with the exception of certain employees of ours with a title below senior vice president, who will be released from this restriction with respect to 25% of such employees vested equity 90 days from the date of this prospectus. See Underwriters for additional information. Subject to the restrictions under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, shares of common stock outstanding after this offering will be eligible for resale 180 days after the date of this prospectus upon the expiration of lock-up 44 agreements or other contractual restrictions. In addition, at any time with or without public notice, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC may in its discretion release shares subject to such lock-up agreements prior to the expiration of this 180-day lock-up period. See Shares eligible for future sale for additional information. As these resale restrictions end, the market price of our common stock could decline if the holders of those shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. In addition, based on our capitalization as of June 30, 2021, 20,173,022 shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options will also be eligible for sale upon expiration of the 180-day lock-up period, which excludes 103,663 outstanding stock appreciation rights that will be settled in cash upon exercise. We intend to register all of the shares underlying outstanding options and any shares underlying other equity incentives we may grant in the future for public resale under the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance to the extent permitted by any applicable vesting requirements and the lock-up agreements described above. Sales of stock by these stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Holders of 109,132,406 shares of our common stock have registration rights. For more information, see Description of capital stockRegistration rights. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by our affiliates as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, which are subject to the limitations of Rule 144. Sales of securities by any of these stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and cause the price of our common stock to decline. We may issue additional common stock, convertible securities, or other equity following the completion of this offering. We also expect to issue common stock to our employees, directors, and other service providers pursuant to our equity incentive plans. Such issuances will be dilutive to investors and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. New investors in such issuances could also receive rights senior to those of holders of our common stock. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business or our industry, or if they change their recommendation regarding our common stock adversely, the market price and trading volume of our common stock could decline. The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. The analysts estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If any of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets and demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the price and trading volume of our common stock to decline. We do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. We have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their shares of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. 45 We have broad discretion over the use of net proceeds from this offering and may not use them effectively. We cannot specify with any certainty the particular uses of the net proceeds that we will receive from this offering. Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from this offering, including for any of the purposes described in Use of proceeds, and you will not have the opportunity as part of your investment decision to assess whether the net proceeds are being used appropriately. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of the net proceeds from this offering, their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use. The failure by our management to apply these proceeds effectively could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Pending their use, we may invest our proceeds in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. Our investments may not yield a favorable return to our investors and may negatively impact the price of our common stock. Our directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders beneficially own a substantial percentage of our common stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval. After this offering, our directors, executive officers, and holders of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, together with their respective affiliates, will beneficially own shares representing approximately % of our outstanding common stock, or % of our common stock if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full. As a result, these stockholders, if they act together, will be able to influence our management and affairs and all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company and might affect the market price of our common stock. Delaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws might delay, discourage or prevent a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will contain provisions that may make any acquisition of our company more difficult or delay or prevent changes in control of our management. Among other things, these provisions will: ||| | provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; ||| | authorize our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval; ||| | provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors; ||| | provide that all vacancies on our board of directors and all newly created directorships may only be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, except as otherwise required by law, our governing documents or resolution of our board of directors, and subject to the rights of the holders of our preferred stock; ||| | establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving staggered three-year terms; ||| | provide that a director may only be removed from the board of directors by the stockholders for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors; 46 ||| | prohibit cumulative voting (therefore allowing the holders of a plurality of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose); ||| | require that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not be taken by written consent; ||| | require that stockholders give advance notice to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings; ||| | provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the board of directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by the majority of the entire board of directors, the Chairperson of the board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer or our President; ||| | provide that, unless we otherwise consent in writing, a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and our amended and restated bylaws, or (4) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine; ||| | provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act; and ||| | require a super-majority vote of stockholders to amend some of the provisions described above. These provisions, alone or together, could delay, discourage, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. Our amended and restated bylaws will provide, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States are the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, stockholders, or employees and, in turn, discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers, or employees. Our amended and restated bylaws will provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, stockholders, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders; any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation, or our bylaws; and any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision would not apply to any action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts of the United States have exclusive jurisdiction. Our amended and restated bylaws will also provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States will be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. The enforceability of similar exclusive federal forum provisions in other companies organizational 47 documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and while the Delaware Supreme Court and certain other state courts have ruled that this type of exclusive federal forum provision is facially valid under Delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether other courts would enforce such provisions and that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. This exclusive federal forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts of the United States have exclusive jurisdiction. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our current or former directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our current and former directors, officers, stockholders, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find either exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 48 [Special note regarding forward-looking statements ] This prospectus contains forward-looking statements.

Forecasts and other forward-looking information with respect to industry, business, market, and other data are subject to the same qualifications and additional uncertainties regarding the other forward-looking statements in this prospectus. See Special note regarding forward-looking statements for additional information. Among others, we refer to estimates and other information compiled by the following sources: ||| | Arizton, a market research and intelligence company; ||| | SIL International, a non-profit linguistics research organization; ||| | HolonIQ, a company that provides market intelligence research on the global education market; and ||| | The World Economic Forum, an international non-governmental organization. 51 We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of the shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $ million, or approximately $ million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, based upon the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share would increase or decrease, as applicable, the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately $ million, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Similarly, each increase or decrease of 1.0 million shares in the number of shares offered by us would increase or decrease, as applicable, the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately $ million, assuming the assumed initial public offering price remains the same, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to support our operations, establish a public market for our common stock, and facilitate our future access to the public capital markets. We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures. Additionally, we may use a portion of the net proceeds we receive from this offering to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services, or technologies. However, we do not have agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions or investments at this time. We cannot specify with certainty the particular uses of the net proceeds that we will receive from this offering. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in using these proceeds. Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering primarily in short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit, or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. 52 We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, general business conditions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. 53 The following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents and capitalization as of June 30, 2021: ||| | on an actual basis; ||| | on a pro forma basis, giving effect to (1) the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock into an aggregate of 85,403,933 shares of common stock immediately prior to the completion of this offering and (2) the filing and effectiveness of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation immediately prior to the completion of this offering; and ||| | on a pro forma as adjusted basis to reflect (1) the pro forma adjustments set forth above and (2) our issuance and sale of shares of common stock in this offering at the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The pro forma as adjusted information set forth below is illustrative only and will depend on the actual initial public offering price and other terms of this offering determined at pricing. You should read this information in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this prospectus, as well as in Selected consolidated financial and other data and Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. |As of June 30, 2021| |Actual||Pro | forma |Pro forma | as adjusted(1) |(in except per share | amounts) |Cash and cash equivalents||$||163,198||$||163,198||$| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Redeemable convertible preferred stock, $0.00001 par value, 86,348,646 shares authorized; 85,403,933 shares issued and outstanding, actual; no shares authorized, issued and outstanding, pro forma and pro forma as adjusted |274,267||| |Stockholders (deficit):| | Common stock, $0.00001 par value; shares authorized, 37,523,533 shares issued and outstanding, actual; 950,000,000 shares authorized, 122,927,466 shares issued and outstanding, pro forma; shares authorized, shares issued and outstanding, pro forma as adjusted |||1| | | Preferred stock, $0.00001 par value; no shares authorized, issued and outstanding, actual; 50,000,000 shares authorized, no shares issued and outstanding, pro forma and pro forma as adjusted |||| | | Additional paid-in capital |141,112||415,378| | | Accumulated deficit |(407,883||)||(407,883||)| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Total stockholders (deficit) equity||(266,771||)||7,496| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Total capitalization |$||7,496||$||7,496||$| | | | | | | | | | | | | |(1)|| | Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase or decrease, as applicable, each of our pro forma as adjusted cash and cash equivalents, additional paid-in capital, total stockholders (deficit) equity and total capitalization by approximately $ million, assuming that the number of shares of common stock offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Similarly, each increase or decrease of 1.0 million shares in the number of shares of common stock offered by us would increase or decrease, as applicable, each of our pro forma as adjusted cash and cash equivalents, additional paid-in capital, total stockholders (deficit) equity and total capitalization by approximately $ million, assuming the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, remains the same, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full, our pro forma as adjusted cash and cash equivalents, additional paid-in capital, total stockholders (deficit) equity, and total capitalization as of June 30, 2021, would be $ million, $ million, $ million, and $ million, respectively. 54 The number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, pro forma and pro forma as adjusted in the table above is based on 122,927,466 shares of our common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2021, and excludes: ||| | 20,173,022 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of options outstanding as of June 30, 2021 with a weighted-average exercise price of $7.39 per share, which excludes 103,663 stock appreciation rights outstanding that will be settled in cash upon exercise; ||| | 772,900 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, or our 2010 Plan, as of June 30, 2021, provided that we will cease granting awards under our 2010 Plan upon the effectiveness of our 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, or our 2021 Plan; ||| | 13,800,000 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2021 Plan, which will become effective in connection with this offering; ||| | 2,800,000 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or our 2021 ESPP, which will become effective in connection with this offering; and ||| | 61,300 shares issued by us in August 2021 to a former stockholder of CorpU in connection with our acquisition of CorpU. Our 2021 Plan and our 2021 ESPP each will provide for annual automatic increases in the number of shares reserved thereunder, and our 2021 Plan will also provide for increases to the number of shares that may be granted thereunder based on awards under our 2010 Plan that expire, are forfeited, or otherwise repurchased by us, as more fully described in Executive compensationEmployee benefit and stock plans. 55 If you invest in our common stock in this offering, your ownership interest will be diluted immediately to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price per share of our common stock and the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after this offering. Our historical net tangible book value (deficit) as of June 30, 2021 was $(320.9) million, or $(8.55) per share of our common stock. Our historical net tangible book value (deficit) is the amount of our total tangible assets less our total liabilities and redeemable convertible preferred stock, which is not included within our stockholders (deficit) equity. Historical net tangible book value (deficit) per share represents historical net tangible book value (deficit) divided by the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2021. Our pro forma net tangible book value (deficit) as of June 30, 2021 was $(46.6) million, or $(0.38) per share of our common stock. Pro forma net tangible book value represents the amount of our total tangible assets less our total liabilities. Pro forma net tangible book value per share represents pro forma net tangible book value divided by the total number of shares outstanding as of June 30, 2021, after giving effect to the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock as of June 30, 2021 into an aggregate of 85,403,933 shares of our common stock immediately prior to the completion of this offering as if such conversion had occurred on June 30, 2021. After giving further effect to our sale of shares of common stock in this offering at the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of June 30, 2021 would have been approximately $ million, or approximately $ per share. This represents an immediate increase in pro forma net tangible book value per share of approximately $ to our existing stockholders and an immediate dilution in pro forma net tangible book value per share of approximately $ to investors purchasing shares of common stock in this offering. Dilution per share to investors purchasing shares of common stock in this offering is determined by subtracting pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering from the assumed initial public offering price per share paid by investors purchasing shares of common stock in this offering. The following table illustrates this dilution on a per share basis to new investors (without giving effect to any exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares): |Assumed initial public offering price per share||$| | | Historical net tangible book value (deficit) per share as of June 30, 2021 |$||(8.55||)| | | Pro forma increase in net tangible book value per share as of June 30, 2021 |$||8.17| | | | | | | | | | | Pro forma net tangible book value per share as of June 30, 2021 |$||(0.38||)| | | Increase in pro forma net tangible book value per share attributable to investors purchasing shares of common stock in this offering | | | | | | | | |Pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share| |Dilution per share to investors participating in this offering||$| Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase or decrease, as applicable, the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering by approximately $ per share and the dilution to investors purchasing shares of common stock in this offering by approximately $ per share, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Similarly, each increase of 1.0 million shares in the number of shares offered by us would increase the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this 56 offering by approximately $ and decrease the dilution per share to investors purchasing shares of common stock in this offering by approximately $ , assuming no change in the assumed initial public offering price and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Each decrease of 1.0 million shares in the number of shares offered by us would decrease the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering by approximately $ and increase the dilution per share to investors purchasing shares of common stock in this offering by approximately $ , assuming no change in the assumed initial public offering price and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of common stock in this offering in full at the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering would be approximately $ per share, and the dilution per share to investors purchasing shares of common stock in this offering would be approximately $ per share. The following table summarizes, on the pro forma as adjusted basis described above, as of June 30, 2021, the number of shares of common stock purchased from us, the total consideration paid, or to be paid, and the weighted-average price per share paid, or to be paid, by existing stockholders and by investors purchasing shares in this offering at the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, before deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. |Shares purchased||Total consideration|| | Weighted- average price per share |(dollar amounts in thousands, except per | share amounts) |Number||Percent||Amount||Percent| |Existing stockholders before this offering||%||$||%||$| |Investors purchasing shares in this offering||$| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Total |100%||$||100%| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | The table above assumes no exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares in this offering. If the underwriters option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full, the number of shares of our common stock held by existing stockholders would be reduced to % of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding after this offering, and the number of shares of common stock held by investors purchasing shares of common stock in the offering would be increased to % of the total number of shares outstanding after this offering. Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase or decrease, as applicable, the total consideration paid by investors purchasing shares in this offering by approximately $ million, assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same. Similarly, each increase or decrease of 1.0 million shares in the number of shares offered by us would increase or decrease, as applicable, the total consideration paid by investors purchasing shares in this offering by approximately $ million, assuming no change in the assumed initial public offering price. The foregoing tables and calculations (other than the historical net tangible book value calculation) are based on 122,927,466 shares of our common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2021, and excludes: ||| | 20,173,022 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of options outstanding as of June 30, 2021 with a weighted-average exercise price of $7.39 per share, which excludes 103,663 stock appreciation rights outstanding that will be settled in cash upon exercise; 57 ||| | 772,900 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2010 Plan as of June 30, 2021, provided that we will cease granting awards under our 2010 Plan upon the effectiveness of our 2021 Plan; ||| | 13,800,000 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2021 Plan, which will become effective in connection with this offering; ||| | 2,800,000 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2021 ESPP, which will become effective in connection with this offering; and ||| | 61,300 shares issued by us in August 2021 to a former stockholder of CorpU in connection with our acquisition of CorpU. Our 2021 Plan and our 2021 ESPP each will provide for annual automatic increases in the number of shares reserved thereunder, and our 2021 Plan will also provide for increases to the number of shares that may be granted thereunder based on awards under our 2010 Plan that expire, are forfeited, or otherwise repurchased by us, as more fully described in Executive compensationEmployee benefit and stock plans. To the extent that any outstanding options are exercised or new options are issued under the equity benefit plans, or we issue additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of our capital stock in the future, there will be further dilution to investors purchasing shares of common stock in this offering. 58 [Selected consolidated financial and other data ] The following tables summarize our selected consolidated financial and other data for the periods and as of the dates indicated.

In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risk and uncertainties described under Risk factors and elsewhere in this prospectus. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations has been updated for the immaterial restatement referenced in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. Overview Our mission is to create new possibilities for people and organizations everywhere by connecting them to the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in a changing world. Our marketplace platform, with thousands of up-to-date courses in dozens of languages, provides the tools that learners, instructors, and organizations need to achieve their goals and reach their full potential. We believe traditional education and training methods are fast becoming outdated. Technological advancements and novel industries have significantly altered the types of skills required of workers, and lifelong training and continuous skills acquisition are becoming the norm. There is a clear need to expand access to learning across traditional barriers such as geography and social demographics. Udemy operates a two-sided marketplace where our instructors develop content to meet learner demand. Courses can be accessed through our direct-to-consumer or Udemy Business, or UB, offerings. Our platform provides over 44 million learners with access to over 183,000 courses in over 75 languages and 180 countries. Since inception, more than 73 million users have registered with Udemy. Udemy courses address learning objectives such as reskilling or upskilling in technology and business, enhancing soft skills, and personal development. We analyze platform data to better determine our learners needs, helping us match individuals with relevant courses and, within UB, learning paths for a more personalized experience. Our learners also receive access to interactive learning tools such as quizzes, exercises, and instructor questions-and-answers, or Q&A. Within our marketplace and UB catalog, we provide learners with high-quality content by prioritizing courses based on factors such as learner feedback and ratings, topic relevance, content quality, and instructor engagement. Our business has experienced rapid growth. From 2019 to 2020, our revenue grew 56% to $429.9 million, which includes over 100% growth in enterprise revenue, although we incurred net losses of $69.7 million and $77.6 million during 2019 and 2020, respectively. From the six months ended June 30, 2020 to the six months ended June 30, 2021, our revenue grew 24% to $250.6 million, which includes 79% growth in enterprise revenue, although we incurred net losses of $52.5 million and $29.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $378.5 million and $407.9 million, respectively. 65 Our history The following is a timeline of certain key events in our history: Our business model Our platform allows learners all over the world to access a wide breadth of affordable and relevant content from over 65,000 instructors, many of which are subject-matter experts in their field and/or experienced industry practitioners. We combine high-quality content, insights and analytics, and technology into a single, unified platform that is purpose-built to meet the specific needs of both consumers and enterprises. Our consumer segment targets individual learners seeking to obtain hands-on learning, gain valuable job skills to advance their professional careers, or learn a new personal skill through our consumer offering. Our enterprise segment focuses on helping business and government customers upskill and reskill their employees and public servants through our UB offering. Consumer. Consumer learners come to Udemy for relevant, affordable, and high-quality content. Our global platform helps address the learning objectives of over 41 million consumer learners, which include reskilling or upskilling, enhancing soft skills, and personal enhancement. Consumer learners can purchase lifetime access to individual courses on our online platform or they can subscribe to a consumer subscription offering. We analyze data gathered on our platform to better determine our learners most relevant needs, helping us match them with relevant courses and learning paths, driving higher satisfaction. Learners from across the world have access to global and local instructors, providing learning skills that may be unique to their particular geographies. Once a learner enrolls in a course, we strive to provide an effective learning experience through assessments, labs, Q&As, and interactive exercises. 66 Substantially all of our consumer revenue is derived from consumer learners enrollment to individual courses on our online platform. Our payment terms generally require advance payment through the use of a credit card. Once a successful course enrollment purchase transaction is completed, we grant the learner lifetime access to the purchased course content on the online platform, which can be accessed and consumed by the learners on an on-demand basis even if an instructor later unpublishes the course. We recognize consumer revenue for single course purchases ratably over an estimated four-month service period for a learners consumption of marketplace course content. In 2019 and 2020, 82% and 76%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from our consumer offering. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021, 78% and 69%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from our consumer offering. Udemy Business. UB helps over 8,600 global customers, including companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies, achieve the learning needs of their talent bases, drawn by the real-world expertise and experience of our instructors. Out of our platforms deep content catalog, we have curated over 11,000 of the most highly engaging and relevant courses, purposely selected to meet the needs and standards of these companies, organizations and agencies. We undergo a rigorous selection process across a wide set of criteria in determining the courses that will be offered as part of our UB offerings, including learner feedback and rating, relevancy of topic covered, quality of the content, and instructor experience. Revenue from our UB offering is derived from the sale of subscriptions to our UB customers, which provide on-demand access to a catalog of courses over a subscription term, as well as additional features and functionalities such as single sign-on, analytics and strategic learning path management functionality. The majority of our customers subscribe to our UB offering through one-year contracts, although a growing number of our customers subscribe through multi-year contracts. Subscription fees are primarily based on the number of license seats. We source our customer leads through a combination of field marketing and leveraging our existing learner base. Our growing consumer learner base and course offerings allow us to identify customer prospects, provide data and insights, increase operating scale, improve search engine optimization performance and provide an effective and efficient way to identify quality courses for our UB offerings. We sell subscriptions to our platform to customers primarily through our direct sales team, who identify and engage with potential customers. Once a customer has adopted our platform, we focus not only on driving continued use of our offerings by that customer, but also expanding the relationship by increasing the number of license seats sold to that customer. In 2019 and 2020, 18% and 24%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from our UB offering. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021, 22% and 31% of our revenue was derived from our UB offering. 67 Key business metrics In addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the key business metrics identified below to help us assess the health of our community, evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. Monthly average buyers A buyer is a consumer who purchases a course or subscription through our direct-to-consumer offering. Monthly average buyers is calculated as the average of monthly buyers during a particular period, such as a fiscal year. Our monthly average buyer count is not intended as a measure of active engagement, as not all buyers are active at any given time or over any given period. We believe that the number of monthly average buyers in a given period is an important indicator of the growth of our business and potential future revenue trends. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had 962 and 1,439 thousand monthly average buyers, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021, we had 1,521 and 1,364 thousand monthly average buyers, respectively. 68 Udemy Business customers We count the total number of UB customers at the end of each period. To do so, we generally count unique customers using the concept of a domestic ultimate parent, defined as the highest business in the family tree that is in the same country as the contracted entity. In some cases, we deviate from this methodology, defining the contracted entity as a unique customer despite existence of a domestic ultimate parent. This often occurs where the domestic ultimate parent is a financial owner, government entity, or acquisition target where we have contracted directly with the subsidiary. We define a UB customer as a customer who purchases Udemy via our direct sales force, reseller partnerships or through our self-service platform. We believe that the number of UB customers and our ability to increase this number is an important indicator of the growth of our UB and future revenue trends. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had 5,174 and 7,300 UB customers, respectively. As of June 30, 2020 and 2021, we had 6,396 and 8,669 customers, respectively. 69 Udemy Business Annual Recurring Revenue We disclose our UB Annual Recurring Revenue, or ARR, as a measure of our enterprise revenue growth. ARR represents the annualized value of our UB customer contracts on the last day of a given period. Only revenue from closed UB contracts with active seats as of the last day of the period are included. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, our ARR was $75.1 million and $137.6 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2020 and 2021, our ARR was $100.8 million and $181.9 million, respectively. Udemy Business Net Dollar Retention Rate We disclose our UB Net Dollar Retention Rate, or NDRR, as a measure of our enterprise revenue growth. We believe NDRR is an important metric that provides insight into the long-term value of our subscription agreements and our ability to retain, and grow revenue from, our UB customers. We calculate NDRR as the total annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, at the end of a trailing twelve-month period divided by the total ARR at the beginning of a trailing twelve-month period for the cohort of UB customers active at the beginning of the trailing twelve-month period. Total ARR at the end of a trailing twelve-month period is calculated as ARR at the beginning of a trailing twelve-month period that is then adjusted for upsells, downsells, and churns for the same cohort of customers during that period. ARR is the total annualized run-rate revenue of all UB customers with active licenses. Our NDRR is expected to fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including the growth of our revenue base, the penetration within our learner base, expansion of products and features, and our ability to retain our UB customers. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, our NDRR was 132% and 118%, respectively. As of June 30, 2020 and 2021, our NDRR was 123% and 121%, respectively. Segment Revenue and Segment Gross Profit Our revenue is generated from our consumer and UB offerings, each of which is an individual segment of our business. Segment Revenue represents the revenue recognized from each of these offerings and is a key measure of the performance of our platform, and in turn drives our financial performance. We also monitor Segment Gross Profit as a key metric to help evaluate the financial performance of our individual segments and our business as a whole. Segment Gross Profit is defined as Segment Revenue less Segment Costs of Revenue, which include content costs, hosting and platform costs, customer support services, and payment processing fees 70 that are allocable to each segment. Segment Gross Profit excludes amortization of capitalized software, depreciation, and stock-based compensation allocated to cost of revenues as our chief operating decision maker does not include the information in his measurement of the performance of the operating segments. Content costs, which are payments made to our instructors, are the largest individual component of Segment Cost of Revenue. We expect to increase the percentage of our revenue derived from our enterprise segment over time, which we expect will improve our gross margins. |Year Ended December 31,|| | Six Months Ended June 30, |2019||2020||2020||2021| | | | | | | | | |Segment Revenue and Segment Gross Profit||(in thousands)||(in thousands)| | | Consumer Segment Revenue |$||225,500||$||326,454||$||157,257||$||171,837| | | Consumer Segment Gross Profit |106,831||160,650||71,394||90,474| | | Enterprise Segment Revenue |50,827||103,445||44,111||78,806| | | Enterprise Segment Gross Profit |31,921||67,926||29,070||51,393| Key factors affecting our performance We believe that the growth of our business and our future success are dependent upon many factors. While each of these factors presents significant opportunities for us, these factors also pose challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and enhance our results of operations. Ability to attract and engage new learners and Udemy Business customers To grow our business, we must attract new learners and UB customers efficiently and increase engagement on our platform over time. From inception through June 30, 2021, we registered over 44 million learners from more than 180 countries, attracted over 8,600 UB customers, and facilitated 594 million course enrollments. We added over 13 million new learners during 2020, representing annual growth of our total learner base of 53%. We added over 7 million and over 6 million new learners during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively. We added fewer new learners during the six months ended June 30, 2021 in comparison to the same period in the prior period due to accelerated growth in the number of learners and UB customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the second quarter of 2020. We acquire a substantial portion of our learners via organic channels and also use paid marketing to further enhance the growth of our learner base. Our organic channels include those outside of our paid market efforts, such as a Udemy brand name internet search. Once we bring new learners onto our platform, we work to create a best-in-class experience to encourage engagement and drive learning and career outcomes. Ability to retain and expand our existing learner and customer relationships Our efforts to grow our existing relationships with our consumer learners are focused on increasing their engagement and converting free learners into buyers. New learners to our platform typically begin to engage with our free courses, which serve as a funnel to grow our total learner base and drive referrals to our paid other offerings. 83% of consumer learner course enrollments on our platform were free, resulting in 456 million cumulative free course enrollments and over 28 million hours of free courses consumed. We constantly analyze data gathered on our platform to better determine our learners most relevant needs, which helps us match learners with relevant courses and learning paths, driving higher satisfaction, increasing enrollments, and converting learners into buyers. We highlight key features that encourage conversion to our paid offerings through our marketing efforts, which include campaigns targeting existing learners, personalized recommendations, and performance marketing across leading social media platforms. Once a learner enrolls in a course, we strive to provide an effective learning experience through labs, and the ability for learners to communicate with instructors for expedient answers to their questions and through interactive exercises. Our efforts to grow our UB offering are focused primarily on corporate and government customers. We deploy a land-and-expand strategy with our UB customers that focuses on acquiring new customers and efficiently growing 71 our relationships with existing customers, beginning with either individual users or departmental deployments. Historically, we have expanded from individual to department to multi-department to enterprise-wide sales as our value is proven. Building upon this success, we believe a significant opportunity exists for us to acquire new UB customers and expand our existing UB customers use of our platform by identifying new use cases and increasing the size of existing deployments. We often enter into customized contractual arrangements with our UB customers in which we offer more favorable pricing terms in exchange for larger total contract values that accompany larger deployments. As we drive a greater portion of our revenue through our deployments with UB customers, we expect that our revenue will continue to grow significantly, but the price we charge UB customers per seat may decline, which could reduce margins in the future. Our business and results of operations will depend on our ability to continue to drive higher usage of our platform within our existing customer base and our ability to add new customers. Ability to source in-demand content from our instructors We believe that learners and UB customers are attracted to Udemy largely because of the high quality and wide selection of content our instructors offer. Continuing to source in-demand content and credentials from our instructors will be an important factor in attracting learners and UB customers and growing our revenue over time. As of June 30, 2021, we attracted over 65,000 instructors from around the world to our platform. Instructors share their knowledge on Udemy for a myriad of reasons, from financial to brand-building to giving back. We believe instructors are attracted to Udemy because we offer access to a global market with over 44 million learners. Our model allows instructors who elect to charge for courses to share directly in the economic upside of the course content they contribute and the growth of our platform. We have an aligned incentive model where payments to instructors are proportional to course sales on our platform. In 2020, our paid instructors earned $161.4 million from Udemy for their courses, with average paid instructor earnings of $2,950 and over 9,000 global instructors receiving more than $1,000 in earnings. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, our paid instructors earned $86.8 million from Udemy for their courses, with average paid instructor earnings of $1,574 and over 6,000 global instructors receiving more than $1,000 in earnings. The breadth of instructors and courses contributes to the wide variety of content topics available on our platform, as well as meaningful depth within most content categories. We believe that this combination of breadth and depth helps foster competition and choice on our platform and attracts learners and enterprise customers. We enable instructors to innovate and engage on our platform by giving instructors proprietary tools including marketplace insights, the ability to review feedback from learners, and dashboards to help generate more relevant content and manage their brand and course marketing. When we offer content as part of the UB and consumer subscription offerings, our instructors agree to contribute such content exclusively through our platform, as discussed elsewhere in this prospectus, which we believe demonstrates our ability to increase the value of our platform through unique content. We experienced minimal turnover among top instructors in 2019, 2020, and the six months ended June 30, 2021. Impact of mix of consumer and enterprise segments Our mix of business among our consumer and enterprise segments is shifting, and this shift will affect our financial performance. We incur content costs in the form of payments to our instructors, generally determined as a percentage of total revenue generated from their content. These costs totaled $109.2 million in 2019, $161.4 million in 2020, and $81.1 million and $86.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively, or 40%, 38%, 40%, and 35% of total revenue, respectively. Content costs, which are included in our cost of revenue, vary significantly for our different offerings. For our enterprise segment, content costs are incurred based on a percentage of total subscription revenue which is allocated to instructors pro rata based on consumption of their content. Content costs in our consumer segment were historically primarily driven by whether the learner is acquired organically, through Udemys marketing efforts, or by an instructor coupon. Beginning in May 2021, content costs for our consumer segment will be the same whether learners are acquired organically or through Udemys marketing efforts. Content costs historically have been and will continue to be substantially highest for learners acquired by instructor coupon compared to learners acquired through Udemys 72 marketing efforts. Content costs for our enterprise segment are lower relative to our consumer segment. The mix of customer acquisition methods in our consumer segment will substantially impact our financial performance. In 2020, content costs as a percentage of revenue were 42% for our consumer segment and 25% for our enterprise segment. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, content costs as a percentage of revenue were 39% for our consumer segment and 25% for our enterprise segment. We presently expect that revenue from our enterprise segment will grow faster than our consumer segment, which will be beneficial to our overall margins. Ability to expand our international footprint We generated 59% and 61% of our revenue outside North America in 2019 and 2020, respectively, and 60% and 61% during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively. We see a significant opportunity to expand our offerings into regions with large underserved adult learning populations. We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in personnel and marketing efforts to support our international growth and expand our international operations as part of our strategy to grow our customer and learner base, particularly among our UB customers. Our investment in growth We are actively investing in our business as we believe that we are only beginning to penetrate our market opportunity, and we intend to continue to invest in our future growth. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase as we continue to build our sales and marketing efforts, expand our course catalog, expand our employee base, and invest in our technology development. The investments we make in our platform are designed to address relevant topics for our existing learners and to attract new learners to our platform to grow our revenue opportunity and to improve our operating results in the long term. Any investments we make in our sales and marketing organization, in encouraging the development of new content, and in expanding our platform offerings and capabilities, will occur in advance of the benefits from such investments, making it difficult to determine if we are efficiently allocating our resources in these areas. Pace of adoption of cloud-based skill development solutions Our ability to grow our learner base and drive market adoption of our platform is affected by the overall demand for cloud-based skill development solutions. The market for cloud-based skill development is less mature than the market for in-person, instructor-led-training, and potential customers may be slow or unwilling to migrate from these legacy approaches. We believe that as technology becomes increasingly critical to business operations, the need for cloud-based skill development solutions, particularly an integrated enterprise-grade platform such as ours, will increase, and our customer base and the breadth and deployment of usage in our customer base will also increase. Furthermore, we believe that we have established a leadership position in the market for cloud-based technology learning. However, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand, the future growth rate and size of the market for cloud-based skill development solutions, or the entry of competitive solutions. Impact of COVID-19 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. To limit the spread of the virus, governments have imposed various restrictions, including emergency declarations at the federal, state and local levels, school and business closings, quarantines, shelter at home orders, restrictions on travel and trade, limitations on social or public gatherings and other social distancing measures. We have taken precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of COVID-19 to our employees, including transitioning the majority of our employees to remote work and restricting business travel, which have contributed to immaterial decreases in our operating expenses, primarily travel and entertainment expense. We believe that our ability to meet the needs of our customers, end users and instructors has not been materially affected by these precautions. We have not incurred any material increases in our operating expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant increase in the adoption of online learning solutions, a trend we believe will continue over the long-term. We believe that this heightened demand for online learning 73 solutions from individuals and businesses contributed in part to the significant increase in revenue we experienced beginning in the second quarter of 2020. However, we are not able to quantify the proportion of the increase in revenue that is attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic as opposed to other factors contributing to our growth in recent periods. Furthermore, the circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our business during the COVID-19 pandemic may not continue in the future, and the growth rate of our revenue, as well as our learner and customer base, may decline in future periods as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic abate. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business depends on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. For more information, see Risk factorsRisks related to our business and operationsThe COVID-19 pandemic could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in volatile and unpredictable ways. Components of results of operations Revenues We derive revenues from contracts with paid consumer learners and UB customers from access to our online learning platform. We recognize revenue from both our paid consumer learners and UB customers. Consumer revenue consists of individual course content purchases made by individual learners, as well as our consumer subscription offerings. Consumer revenue includes the gross transaction value paid by the learner at checkout, net of (a) actual and estimated refunds and (b) passthrough taxes collected from learners and remitted to governmental authorities. After a successful checkout, consumer learners receive a non-exclusive lifetime license to the digital course content in addition to stand-ready access to the Udemy platform hosting services needed to access the content. Access to the online content on the Udemy platform represents a series of distinct services as we continually provide access to and fulfill our hosting obligation to the learner. This series of distinct services represents a single performance obligation that is satisfied over the estimated service period. Revenue is recognized ratably over the estimated service period for consumer marketplace revenue, which is four months from the date of enrollment and over the contractual subscription term for consumer subscription customers. Enterprise revenue primarily relates to enterprise license subscription contracts with annual or multi-year subscription terms. Enterprise subscriptions are generally billed in advance on a quarterly or annual basis. Subscription revenue excludes any taxes to be remitted to governmental authorities. Access to the Udemy platform represents a series of distinct services as we continually provide access to course content and fulfill our obligation to the UB customer over the subscription term. Because the series of distinct services represents a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time, we recognize revenue ratably over the contractual subscription term. We are the principal with respect to revenue generated from sales to consumer and UB customers as we control the performance obligation and are the primary obligor with respect to delivering access to content to our customers. Cost of revenues Cost of revenues primarily consists of content costs, which are the payments to our instructors. Content costs are driven by the means by which we acquired the learner consuming the content. For courses offered on Udemys consumer marketplace, instructors earn a specific percentage of the net sale amount when a learner purchases the instructors course. For courses offered through Udemy Business or a consumer subscription offering, instructors earn a pro-rata share of a monthly instructor payments pool for that subscription offering. Each month, Udemy calculates the revenue for each subscription offering, with a fixed percentage allocated as an instructor payments pool. Instructors whose content is included in the collection earn a prorated portion of this pool based on the number of minutes of consumption their courses achieved that month. 74 Content costs as a percentage of revenue for our UB and consumer subscription offerings are lower relative to individual course content purchases in our consumer offering. As a result, shifts in the mix between our two offerings is expected to be a significant driver of our content costs. Content costs are recorded as cost of revenue in the period earned by our instructors. For consumer single course purchases, content costs are incurred at the time of purchase. As consumer course content revenue is recognized ratably over an estimated service period of four months, consumer gross margins are lower in the period of purchase, and higher in the remaining periods of the estimated service period over which revenue is recognized. For our subscription based UB offering, content costs are incurred based on monthly subscription fees, and margins are more stable from period to period. Cost of revenue also includes payment and mobile processing fees, costs associated with hosting digital content, and employee related expenses for our customer support organization, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, facilities and other expenses, depreciation of network equipment, and amortization of capitalized software. We expect cost of revenue to generally decrease as a percentage of revenue as we increase the percentage of revenue derived from our UB offering. Operating expenses Operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of our operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and commissions. Our operating expenses also include allocated costs of facilities, information technology, depreciation, and amortization. Although our operating expenses may fluctuate from period to period, we currently expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars over time. Sales and marketing Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of direct advertising and promotions costs, as well as personnel and personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation and costs related to customer and instructor acquisition, customer support efforts, and brand marketing. Sales and marketing expenses also consist of costs incurred for hosting and customer support services related to providing our platform to free learners. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. In addition, we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue to vary from period to period but generally decrease over the long term. Research and development Our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation and costs related to the ongoing management, maintenance, and expansion of features and services offered on our platform. Research and development costs also include contracted services, supplies, and other miscellaneous expenses. We believe that continued investment in our platform is important to our future growth and to maintain and attract learners to our platform. As a result, we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars. In addition, we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue to vary from period to period but generally decrease over the long term. General and administrative Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation and costs related to our executive, legal, finance, and human resources departments, as well as charges for indirect tax reserves, bad debt expense, professional fees, and other corporate expenses. Following the closing of this offering, we expect to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, costs related to compliance and reporting obligations, and increased expenses for insurance, investor relations, and professional services. We expect general and administrative expenses to 75 increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. In addition, we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to vary from period to period but generally decrease over the long term. Interest income (expense), net Interest income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. It also includes amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts related to our marketable securities. Interest income varies each reporting period based on our average balance of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities during the period and market interest rates. Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense recorded related to certain indirect tax reserves. Interest income and interest expense were each immaterial for the periods presented. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Income tax provision Our income tax provision consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We have a full valuation allowance against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as the realization of the full amount of these deferred tax assets is uncertain, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits related primarily to research and development. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance until it becomes more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.

Revenue increased by $49.3 million, or 24%, compared to the same period in the prior year. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, consumer and enterprise revenues were $171.8 million and $78.8 million, respectively, representing 69% and 31% of total revenue, respectively, compared to $157.3 million and $44.1 million, respectively, representing 78% and 22% of total revenue, respectively, for the same period in the prior year. The increase in revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily driven by the significant growth in our UB customers. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, total consumer revenue increased by $14.6 million, or 9%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in consumer revenue was driven by a $10.5 million increase in revenue recognized in the period deferred from course purchases in the prior fiscal year. The remaining increase in consumer revenue was driven by an increase in the average purchase price of courses when compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by a 10% decrease in monthly average buyers. We experienced a significant acceleration in the growth of our monthly average buyers during the second quarter of 2020 due in part to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the ratable recognition of our consumer revenue over a four month estimated service period, we expect that total consumer revenue recognized in the third quarter of 2021 will decrease when compared with the third quarter of 2020. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, total enterprise revenue increased by $34.7 million, or 79%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in enterprise revenue was primarily driven by a 36% increase in the number of UB customers to 8,669 as of June 30, 2021 from 6,396 as of June 30, 2020, as well as an increase in the average deal size per new customer and net expansions in our existing UB customer base for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Pricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenue. Cost of revenues, gross profit and gross margin |Six months ended June Cost of revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was $113.9 million, compared to $104.7 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in revenue resulted in an overall increase of $5.6 million in costs related to content costs. Content costs for the consumer and enterprise segments were $67.3 million and $19.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to $70.2 million and $10.9 million for the same period in the prior year, respectively. Content costs as a percentage of segment revenue for the consumer and enterprise segments were 39% and 25% for the six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 45% and 25% for the same period in the prior year, respectively. In our consumer segment, credit card and mobile processing fees decreased by $2.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the same period in the prior year. In our enterprise segment, customer support costs increased by $3.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Additionally, there was a $0.4 million increase in third-party cloud hosting costs and an increase of $1.0 million in amortization expense of capitalized software. Gross margin was 55% for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to 48% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a shift in mix of revenue toward our enterprise business, which has comparatively lower content costs as a percentage of revenue relative to the consumer segment. 78 Operating expenses |Six months ended June 30,||Change| |2020||2021||$||%| |Operating expenses:||(dollars in thousands)| | | Sales and marketing |$||96,176||$||104,141||$||7,965||8%| | | Research and development |24,295||30,196||5,901||24%| | | General and administrative |26,035||29,802||3,767||14%| | | | | | | | | | | | | |Total operating expenses||$||146,506||$||164,139||$||17,633||12%| | | | | | | | | | | | | Sales and marketing.

The increase in revenue in 2020 was primarily driven by the significant expansion of our learner base, which resulted in a substantial number of additional buyers, as well as significant growth in our UB customers. These trends were accelerated in part due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For 2020, total consumer revenue increased by $101.0 million, or 45%, compared to 2019. The increase in consumer revenue was primarily driven by a 50% increase in monthly average buyers. Pricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenue.

changes in revenues The overall increase in revenue over the quarters presented was primarily driven by the significant expansion of our learner base, which resulted in a substantial number of additional buyers, as well as significant growth in our UB customers. These trends were accelerated in part due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic during the second quarter of 2020. Pricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenue. Quarterly changes in cost of revenues, gross profit and gross margin Cost of revenue has generally increased sequentially in each of the quarters presented primarily due to increased content costs, credit card and mobile processing fees, and customer support costs. Gross margin and gross profit have generally increased overall during the last ten quarters presented. The increase is attributable to a shift in the mix of revenue toward our enterprise business and a shift in the mix of content costs toward the enterprise segment, which as a percentage of revenue are lower relative to content costs for the consumer segment. Quarterly changes in operating expenses Operating expenses have generally increased sequentially in each of the quarters presented primarily due to increased headcount and other related costs to support our growth. However, after the outbreak of COVID-19, we have seen slower growth in certain operating expenses due to reduced business travel, deferred hiring for some positions, and the virtualization or cancellation of customer and employee events. We intend to continue to make significant investments in research and development as we add features and enhance our platform. We also intend to invest in our sales and marketing organization to drive future revenue growth. Included in general and administrative operating expenses are sales tax, other indirect tax, and instructor withholding tax reserve charges that decreased beginning in 2020 due to the implementation of enhanced collection, withholding, and reporting processes related to the matters underlying the tax reserve charges. We expect that these expenses will decline in future periods. For more information, see Critical accounting policies and estimatesInstructor withholding tax obligations.

As Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use this measure for business planning purposes. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash expenses and certain variable charges. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to common stockholders, adjusted to exclude: ||| | interest expense (income), net; ||| | provision for income taxes; ||| | amortization; ||| | stock-based compensation expense; and ||| | other expense (income), net. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures, should be considered as supplemental in nature and are not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our definition may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. Other companies may not disclose similar metrics. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin have certain limitations in that they exclude the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations that are necessary to run our business. The limitations include the following: ||| | Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect the components of other interest income (expense), net, which consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts related to our marketable securities, and interest expense recorded related to certain indirect tax reserves; ||| | Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes; ||| | Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin exclude certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, and although these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; ||| | Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin exclude stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy; and ||| | Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect the components of other expense (income), net, which consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. The above items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable. 85 The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA: |Year Ended Ended June thousands)||(in thousands)| | | Net loss |$||(69,703)||$||(77,620)||$||(52,450)||$||(29,380)| | | Adjusted to exclude the following: | | Interest expense (income), net |(87)||1,146||1,014||391| | | Provision for income taxes |1,375||3,149||1,766||1,059| | | Depreciation and amortization |8,740||11,055||5,071||6,457| | | Stock-based compensation expense |8,963||31,618||20,603||16,484| | | Other expense (income), net |384||(55)||(138)||518| | | | | | | | | | | Adjusted EBITDA |$||(50,328)||$||(30,707)||$||(24,134)||$||(4,471)| | | | | | | | | Included in Adjusted EBITDA are sales tax, other indirect tax, and instructor withholding tax reserve charges of $11.7 million and $2.8 million for 2019 and 2020, respectively, and $0.6 million and ($0.3) million for the six months ending June 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2020, we implemented enhanced collection, withholding, and reporting processes related to the matters underlying the tax reserve charges, and as a result we expect that these expenses will decline in future years. For more information, see Critical accounting policies and estimatesInstructor withholding tax obligations. The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss margin, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA Margin: |Year Ended December 31,||Six Months Ended June 30,| |2019||2020||2020||2021| | | | | | | | | |(dollars in thousands, except percentages)||(dollars in thousands, except percentages)| | | Revenue |$||276,327||$||429,899||$||201,368||$||250,643| | | Net loss |$||(69,703||)||$||(77,620||)||$||(52,450||)||$||(29,380||)| | | Net loss margin |(25||)%||(18||)%||(26||)%||(12||)%| | | Revenue |$||276,327||$||429,899||$||201,368||$||250,643| | | Adjusted EBITDA |$||(50,328||)||$||(30,707||)||$||(24,134||)||$||(4,471||)| | | Adjusted EBITDA margin |(18||)%||(7||)%||(12||)%||(2||)%| Net loss increased by $7.9 million in 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year and Adjusted EBITDA increased by $19.6 million in 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to strong revenue growth in both our consumer and UB offerings in excess of the growth of our expenses. Net loss decreased by $23.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior period and Adjusted EBITDA increased by $19.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior period primarily due to strong revenue growth in both our consumer and UB offerings in excess of the growth of our expenses. In 2020, we benefited from an acceleration of UB and consumer revenue growth beginning the second quarter due to an increase in the number of learners and UB customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continued to benefit from higher levels of consumer and UB revenue compared to the same period in the prior year as these new learners and UB customers continued their usage of our platform during the third and fourth quarters. Liquidity and capital resources Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from our redeemable convertible preferred stock issuances, as well as from revenue. We have generated significant net losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $378.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and $407.9 million as of June 30, 2021. We have incurred operating losses and generated negative cash flows from operations as we 86 have invested to support the growth of our business. Since our inception through June 30, 2021, we have raised aggregate net proceeds of $274.3 million through the sale of our redeemable convertible preferred stock. Our principal use of cash is to fund our operations to support our growth. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and our expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our remaining non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents have been earmarked for indefinite investment in our operations outside the U.S., thus no U.S. current or deferred taxes have been accrued. Over the longer term, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our sales and marketing and research and development expenditures, the continuing market acceptance of our offerings, and any investments or acquisitions we may choose to pursue in the future. To execute on our strategic initiatives and continue to grow our business, we may incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations in the future, and as a result, we may require additional capital resources. In the event that we need to borrow funds or issue additional equity, we cannot assure you that any such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, any future borrowings may result in additional restrictions on our business and any issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to investors. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and on terms acceptable to us, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Cash flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: |Year Ended thousands)| |Net provided by (used in):| | | Operating activities |$||(16,455||)||$||9,624||$||13,222||$||(5,486||)| | | Investing activities |14,611||(14,537||)||(6,990||)||(9,791||)| | | Financing activities |11,265||131,093||46,867||3,444| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash||$||9,421||$||126,180||$||53,099||$||(11,833||)| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Operating activities Cash provided by (used in) operating activities mainly consists of our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred sales commissions, as well as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities during each period. Our main source of operating cash is payments received from our customers. Our primary use of cash from operating activities are for personnel-related expenses, instructor payments, marketing and advertising expenses, indirect taxes, and third-party cloud infrastructure expenses. For the six months ended June 30, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $13.2 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $52.5 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $28.7 million and net cash inflows of $37.0 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The main drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were a $36.6 million increase in deferred revenue, resulting primarily from our enterprise business growth, a $11.9 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $5.7 million increase in accounts receivable and a $6.3 million increase in deferred contract costs. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, cash used in operating activities was $5.5 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $29.4 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $30.3 million and net cash outflows of $6.5 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The main drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were a $21.6 million increase in deferred revenue, resulting primarily from our enterprise business 87 growth and a $3.3 million decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by a $8.4 million decrease accrued compensation and benefits, a $1.3 million decrease in content costs payable due to the growth of our business, and a $15.7 million increase in deferred contract costs. Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $18.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020, primarily due to our business growth and the timing of payment of sales and other indirect tax liabilities. For 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $16.5 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $69.7 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $21.5 million and net cash inflows of $31.7 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The main drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were a $25.3 million increase in deferred revenue, resulting primarily from our enterprise business growth, a $17.7 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $10.6 million increase in accounts receivable and a $10.7 million increase in deferred contract costs. For 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $9.6 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $77.6 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $50.4 million and net cash inflows of $36.9 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The main drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were a $54.7 million increase in deferred revenue, resulting primarily from our enterprise business growth, a $10.8 million increase accrued compensation and benefits, and a $6.6 million increase in content costs payable due to the growth of our business, partially offset by a $19.6 million increase in accounts receivable and a $18.9 million increase in deferred contract costs. Cash provided by operating activities increased by $26.1 million during 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to our business growth. Investing activities For the six months ended June 30, 2020, cash used in investing activities was $7.0 million, primarily as a result of capital expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized software costs. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $9.8 million, primarily as a result of capital expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized software costs. For 2019, net cash provided by investing activities was $14.6 million, primarily as a result of net sales and maturities of marketable securities, offset by capital expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized software costs. For 2020, cash used in investing activities was $14.5 million, primarily as a result of capital expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized software costs. Financing activities For the six months ended June 30, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $46.9 million, primarily as a result of proceeds from our issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock and issuance of common stock following employee stock option exercises. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $3.4 million, primarily as a result of proceeds from issuance of common stock following employee stock option exercises, offset by payments of redeemable convertible preferred stock issuance costs and deferred offering costs. For 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $11.3 million, primarily as a result of proceeds from issuance of common stock following employee stock option exercises. 88 For 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $131.1 million, primarily as a result of proceeds from our issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock and issuance of common stock following employee stock option exercises. Contractual obligations and commitments Set forth below is information concerning our contractual commitments and obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands): |Payments Due by Period| |(in thousands)||Total|| | Less than 1 Year |1-3 Years||3-5 More than 5 Years |Operating lease commitments||$||25,298||$||6,210||$||12,669||$||6,009||$||410| |Purchase commitments(1)||9,037||8,075||888||74||| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Total||$||34,335||$||14,285||$||13,557||$||6,083||$||410| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |(1)|| | Relates to non-cancelable commitments for network and cloud services in the ordinary course of business with varying expiration terms through October 31, 2022. Our operating lease obligations as of December 31, 2020 were $25.3 million, which consist of payments related to leased facilities under operating lease agreements expiring through 2025. We have office facility operating leases in the United States, Ireland, and Turkey. Our purchase commitments as of December 31, 2020 were $9.0 million, which consisted of commitments related to cloud infrastructure providers, network service providers, and paid advertising vendors. Of the $8.1 million purchase commitments due in less than 1 year as of December 31, 2020, $7.5 million is related to a one-year agreement with a cloud hosting provider that we entered into in December 2020, with a committed spend of $7.5 million during 2021. We did not have material obligations or commitments with any other individual vendors as of December 31, 2020. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, we entered into additional noncancelable purchase commitments with a variety of software-as-a-service, cloud infrastructure, and compliance-related vendors. This resulted in additional purchase commitments totaling $7.9 million, $4.7 million, and $0.5 million for the remainder of 2021, fiscal 2022, and fiscal 2023, respectively, which are not reflected in the table above. There were no material changes to our operating lease commitments during the six months ended June 30, 2021. Off-balance sheet arrangements During the period presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical accounting policies and estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. 89 The critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus for a description of our other significant accounting policies. Revenue recognition We derive revenue from contracts with customers for access to our online learning platform and related services. We derive our revenue from consumer and UB customer arrangements. Consumer revenueWe generate revenue by selling access to course content on the Udemy platform to general consumers. Consumer offerings consist of (i) single course purchases and (ii) consumer subscription offerings. All contracts with consumer customers are billed in advance and require payment by the customer prior to accessing any course content. Consumers who purchase individual courses gain access to course content by making a purchase on our marketplace platform. After checkout, consumers who purchase an individual course receive a non-exclusive lifetime license to the digital course content in addition to stand-ready access to the Udemy platform hosting services needed to access the content. Access to the online content on the Udemy platform represents a series of distinct services as we continually provide access to and fulfills its hosting obligation to the learner. The series of distinct services represents a single performance obligation that is satisfied over the estimated service period. Because consumers who purchase an individual course receive lifetime access to their purchased content, we believe the estimated service period best represents the time period during which learners access the online course content on the platform. The estimated service period for single course purchases is four months from the date of enrollment. Consumer subscriptions are typically one-month in duration and paid in advance, with new customers able to sign up for a 7-day free trial period. Subscribers have continuous access to enroll in and consume an unlimited number of curated courses included in the subscription catalogue on our platform during the subscription term. Subscribers retain access to the courses in which they enroll for the duration of their subscriptions (including any renewal period), even if the instructor subsequently elects to remove the course from Udemys subscription programs. The continual access to the platform represents a series of distinct services, as we continually provide access to, and fulfill our obligation to, the customer over the contract term. As a result, revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term. Consumer subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each month. Customers may cancel the renewal of their subscription at any point but will retain their access to the platform until the end of the current subscription term. Enterprise revenueWe sell subscription licenses to business, government, and university customers that provide users the ability to enroll in courses and receive certifications upon completion. UB contracts are typically between one and three years in length and consist of a fixed quantity of seat licenses, which allows each seat to access an unlimited number of course enrollments during the contract term. Subscribers retain access to the courses in which they enroll for the duration of their subscriptions (including any renewal period), even if the instructor subsequently elects to remove the course from Udemys subscription programs. We recognize revenue ratably over the contracted period, after access has been granted to the UB customer, as learners have unlimited access to the course content during the contracted period. We have determined that we are the principal to customers who purchase access to online individual course content or through a subscription offering, as we control the promised goods or services (i.e., access to course content via the Udemy platform) before it is transferred to the customer and are primarily responsible for fulfillment with respect to delivering access to course content. We also have substantial discretion to determine the pricing of our offerings. We therefore report revenue related to these arrangements based on the gross purchase price paid by customers. 90 Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of promised services is transferred. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services. We determine revenue recognition in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 606 through the following five steps: |1)|| | Identify the contract with a customer We determine a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is approved, each partys rights regarding the services to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We apply judgment in determining the customers ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customers historical payment experience if available. Consumer customers are generally required to pay in advance using a credit card. Generally, UB customers are billed upfront annually for contracts with terms of one year or longer or in advance quarterly or semi-annually for contracts with terms of less than one year. |2)|| | Identify the performance obligations in the contract Performance obligations committed in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services and the products is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Customers do not have the ability to take possession of the software supporting the platform and, as a result, contracts are accounted for as service arrangements. The non-exclusive lifetime access license associated with single course purchases and the licensed content associated with subscriptions are not considered distinct from the Udemy platform, because the course content is significantly integrated, and highly interdependent and interrelated with the platform. Specifically, the learner does not obtain control of the course contents functionality without the Udemy platform. Accordingly, we have concluded there is a single, combined performance obligation, which is customers access to the online content on the Udemy platform, representing a series of distinct services as we continually provide access to and fulfills our obligation to allow access to licensed content and platform functionality to the learner. |3)|| | Determine the transaction price The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. The prices for consumer and UB contracts are fixed at contract inception and do not contain significant estimates related to variable consideration. With respect to single course purchases, consumers may request a full refund within 30 days after the initial purchase transaction. We estimate and establish a refund reserve based on historical refund rates, which has historically been immaterial. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales and other indirect taxes). |4)|| | Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on each performance obligations relative standalone selling price. As access to content is not considered distinct from the Udemy platform hosting services, the transaction price is allocated to a single performance obligation. 91 |5)|| | Recognize revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of the promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. We have a stand ready obligation to deliver our services continually throughout the requisite contract period, which is either lifetime access for consumer customers or the contractual subscription term for UB and consumer subscription customers. As such, we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis as we satisfy our performance obligation, using an estimated service period for individual consumers enrollments and the contractual subscription term for UB and consumer subscription customers. Other than the circumstances noted below, no significant judgment has historically been required in determining the amount and timing of revenue from our contracts with customers. Principal vs. agentIn order to determine if consumer and enterprise revenues should be reported gross or net of payments to third-party instructors, we evaluated whether Udemy acts as the principal in sales of its online course offerings. An entity is the principal if it controls a good or service before it is transferred to the end customer. Key indicators that we evaluated in determining gross versus net treatment included but are not limited to: ||| | the nature of our promise to our customer, as well as the distinct performance obligation identified; ||| | the underlying contract terms and conditions between the parties to the transaction; ||| | which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service to the end customer; ||| | which party has inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to the end customer; and ||| | which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. Based on an evaluation of the above indicators, we have determined that Udemy is the principal to learners who purchase access to online course content via our consumer or UB offerings. Udemy controls the promised goods or services (i.e., access to course content via the Udemy platform) before it is transferred to the customer and is primarily responsible for fulfillment with respect to delivering access to course content. Udemy is the entity which licenses content to learners as the agreements with our instructors grant us the right to sub-license content to our learners at our discretion. We also have substantial discretion to determine the pricing of our offerings. Therefore, we report the gross purchase price paid by the customer related to these arrangements in the revenues caption of the consolidated statements of operations, and the payments paid to instructors are reported within cost of revenues. Estimated service term for consumer single course purchasesWe consider a variety of data points when determining the estimated service period for a consumer learners consumption of a single course purchase, including, the weighted-average number of days between a learners first and last day that content is accessed on the platform, the average total hours consumed, the average number of days in which learner activity stabilizes, and the weighted-average number of days between learners enrollment and the last date the course content is accessed online. We also consider known online trends, the service periods of historical course content on our online platform, and, to the extent publicly available, the service periods of our competitors content that is similar in nature to Udemys. We believe that considering these factors enables us to determine the best representation of the time period during which our consumer learners access the online course content on our platform and therefore the service period over which we provide services to our learners. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires managements judgment. Future usage patterns may differ from historical usage patterns, and therefore the estimated service period may change in the future. The estimated service period for single course purchase transactions is four months from the date of enrollment. 92 Common stock valuations The fair value of the common stock underlying our stock-based awards has historically been determined by our board of directors, with input from management and corroboration from contemporaneous third-party valuations. We believe that our board of directors has the relevant experience and expertise to determine the fair value of our common stock. Given the absence of a public trading market of our common stock, and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock at each grant date. These factors include: ||| | contemporaneous valuations of our common stock performed by independent third-party specialists; ||| | the prices, rights, preferences, and privileges of our redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; ||| | the prices paid for redeemable convertible preferred stock sold to third-party investors by us and prices paid in secondary transactions of common stock, including any tender offers; ||| | the lack of marketability inherent in our common stock; ||| | our actual operating and financial performance; ||| | our current business conditions and projections; ||| | the hiring of key personnel and the experience of our management; ||| | our history and the introduction of new offerings; ||| | our stage of development; ||| | the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering, a merger, or acquisition of our company given prevailing market conditions; ||| | the operational and financial performance of comparable publicly traded companies; and ||| | the U.S. and global capital market conditions and overall economic conditions. Our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock by first determining the enterprise value of our business, and then allocating the value among the various classes of our equity securities to derive a per share value of our common stock. For valuations conducted prior to March 31, 2021, the enterprise value of our business was primarily estimated by reference to the closest round of equity financing preceding the date of the valuation. Valuations conducted as of March 31, 2021, and onward utilized multiple valuation approaches, including a market approach, income approach, and a market transaction method approach considering secondary stock sale or tender offer transactions in our common stock. A market approach relies on an analysis of publicly traded companies similar in industry and/or business model to us. This methodology uses guideline companies to develop relevant market multiples and ratios for key metrics (such as revenue), which are then applied to the corresponding financial metrics to derive enterprise value. Since no two companies are perfectly comparable, premiums or discounts may also be applied to the metrics, for example, if its position in its industry is significantly different from the position of the guideline companies. An income approach estimates enterprise value based on the estimated present value of future cash flows that the business is expected to generate over its remaining life. The estimated present value is calculated using a discount rate reflective of the risks associated with an investment in a company in a similar industry or having similar operational and growth characteristics. 93 For valuations conducted prior to March 31, 2021, the enterprise value of our business as determined above was then allocated to common stock using the option-pricing method, or the OPM, which models each class of stock as a call option with a unique claim on our assets. Valuations conducted as of March 31, 2021, and onward used a combination of the OPM and probability weighted expected return method, or the PWERM, to allocate the enterprise value of our business among the various classes of stock. Under the PWERM, the value of a companys particular equity class is estimated based on an analysis of future values for the entire enterprise assuming discrete future outcomes, such as an initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock and other non-IPO outcomes. Share value is based upon the probability-weighted present value of these expected outcomes, as well as the rights of each class of preferred and common stock. Determining the fair value of the enterprise using the PWERM requires us to develop assumptions and estimates for both the probability of an IPO liquidity event and non-IPO outcomes, as well as the values we expect those outcomes could yield. In addition, we considered any secondary transactions and tender offers involving our capital stock. In our evaluation of those transactions, we considered the facts and circumstances of each transaction to determine the extent to which they represented a fair value exchange and assigned the transactions an appropriate weighting in the valuation of our common stock. Factors considered include the nature of the transactions, the level of company involvement in the transactions, number of different buyers and sellers, transaction volume, timing relative to the valuation date, whether the transactions occurred between willing and unrelated parties, and whether the transactions involved investors with access to our financial information. Application of these approaches and methodologies involves the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses, and future cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable public companies, and the probability of and timing associated with possible future events. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions or the relationships between those assumptions impact our valuations as of each valuation date and may have a material impact on the valuation of our common stock. For valuations after the closing of this offering, our board of directors will determine the fair value of each share of underlying common stock based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of grant. Future expense amounts for any particular period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or market conditions. Stock-based compensation We calculate the fair value of employee stock-based awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The expense is recognized over the service period for awards expected to vest. We recognize forfeitures as they occur. We estimate the fair value of stock-based compensation utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which is dependent upon several variables, such as the expected option term, expected volatility of our stock price over the expected term, expected risk-free interest rate over the expected option term, and expected dividend yield rate over the expected option term. These amounts are estimates and, thus, may not be reflective of actual future results, nor amounts ultimately realized by recipients of these grants. We recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period for each award. 94 A summary of the weighted-average assumptions we utilized to record compensation expenses for stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 is as follows: |Year Ended December dividend yield||||%||%||%||%| The assumptions above are estimated as follows. Each of these assumptions is subjective and generally requires significant judgment to determine. Fair value of common stockBecause our common stock is not yet publicly traded, the fair value was determined by our board of directors or a committee thereof. The board of directors or committee considers numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock each time awards are approved. Refer to Common stock valuations above. Expected term The expected term of our options represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We have elected to use the midpoint of the stock options vesting term and contractual expiration period to compute the expected term, as we does not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. Risk-free interest rateThe risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the options expected term. Expected volatility Since we do not have a trading history of our common stock, we estimated volatility for option grants by evaluating the average historical volatility of a peer group of companies for the period immediately preceding the option grant for a term that is approximately equal to the options expected term. Dividend rateThe expected dividend was assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to do so. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense. Instructor withholding tax obligations We conduct operations in many tax jurisdictions throughout the United States and the rest of the world. We have an obligation to comply with information reporting and tax withholding requirements with regards to certain payments made to our U.S. and non-U.S. instructors. Under U.S. federal income tax rules, in the case where we withhold less than the correct amount of tax, we are liable for the correct amount that we were required to withhold, plus interest and potential penalties. We may be entitled to relief on certain payments if we can obtain documentation (e.g., taxpayer identification forms) from instructors establishing that the instructor payee qualifies for reduced withholding tax rates, or that the instructor payee reported the payments and paid the corresponding taxes owed. Beginning in March 2020, we began collecting appropriate taxpayer identification forms from our instructors, assessing whether the forms justified a reduced rate of withholding or withholding exemption, and remitting withholding tax payments to the IRS where required. Prior to March 2020, we had not obtained appropriate taxpayer identification forms from instructors, nor remitted applicable tax withholding amounts to the IRS where 95 required. In accordance with GAAP, we recorded a provision for our tax exposure when it was both probable that a liability had been incurred and the amount of the exposure could be reasonably estimated. Total accrued obligations related to withholding taxes, including estimated interest, were $20.9 million and $22.2 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and $22.5 million as of June 30, 2021. Changes to the withholding tax reserve and estimated interest are recorded in general and administrative expense and interest income (expense), respectively, in our consolidated statements of operations. Evaluating potential outcomes for instructor withholding taxes is inherently uncertain and requires us to utilize various judgments, assumptions and estimates in determining our reserves. The instructor withholding provision estimate includes several key assumptions including, but not limited to, the tax characterization of our payments made to instructors, the historical lookback practices and scoping precedents of the IRS, the methods for sourcing of instructor payments to U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions, and managements estimate of the relief on certain instructor payments to which we will be entitled. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of our instructor withholding tax obligations may be greater or less than the amounts we have reserved. Income taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. We utilize the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and our reported amount in the consolidated financial statements, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received, as provided for under currently enacted tax law. A valuation allowance is established if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations, and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Recent accounting pronouncements See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements. JOBS Act transition period We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period under the JOBS Act for the adoption of certain accounting standards until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk We have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including the effects of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is described below. 96 Interest rate sensitivity As of June 30, 2021, we had $163.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, which include on demand deposits and amounts in transit from certain payment processors for credit and debit card transactions. In addition, we had $2.9 million of restricted cash as of June 30, 2021, primarily due to the outstanding letter of credit related to the operating lease agreement for our corporate headquarters. Our cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes. We did not hold any marketable securities or carry any fixed or variable rate debt as of and during 2020 or as of and during the six months ended June 30, 2021. Given the above facts and circumstances, hypothetical changes in interest rates of 10% would not result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. Foreign currency risk The reporting currency and functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our consolidated statement of operations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative financial instruments, although we may choose to do so in the future. As such, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in current exchange rates could result in additional income or expense of $6.0 million in 2020. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in current exchange rates would not have had a material impact on income or expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021. 97 [Letter from Eren Bali, Co-Founder ] The seeds of Udemy were first planted in the apricot orchards of rural Turkey. I know that sounds fanciful, but it happens to be the truth. I was born in Turkey and grew up in a small village in Malatya, where apricot farming was the main industry. My parents were idealistic teachers who moved home to the village when no other teachers wanted to work there. The conditions were less than ideal: my mother rotated between teaching five different grades and also tended to the maintenance of the one-room schoolhouse, and many of my classmates walked miles to get to school. Despite these circumstances, all of the kids, including my sisters and me, eagerly headed to school each day. Like the other kids, I helped with apricot farming and herding animals in the summers. I also began developing a serious interest in mathematics and chess. It was an obsession really, especially chess, and I would spend hours playing with the wooden chess pieces my father made for me. There is an incredible amount of talent everywhere in the world, but not enough opportunities for everyone to realize their potential. When you live in a small village far from any city or university, there are limits to what you can learn from people nearby. That was the case for me, and it only changed because my parents bought a used computer and internet access for my older sister. Suddenly I could tap into the world outside our village, and soon I was searching for math problems online. These problems were on a completely different level from the math problems at my school, so I had to work on them by myself and then try to find help from the online math community. It took effort, not to mention resolve, as a number of those who responded to my early efforts were less than kind. But others, even some professional mathematicians, were supportive, and I kept at it. Eventually I won a national mathematics competition and then a silver medal at the International Math Olympiad. Online learning profoundly changed my life, and I committed myself to creating a way for people everywhere to open up new possibilities for themselves and reach their full potential. While at university, I found myself thinking about the worlds experts, my small village, and how knowledge has historically been reserved for the few. Would it not be powerful to share that knowledge with everyone? What if we could fundamentally change access to expertise by tapping the internets vast potential? With the goal of realizing this dream, I moved to the United States, a place where both my passion for learning and my entrepreneurial spirit could flourish. In 2010, with my like-minded co-founders, Oktay Caglar and Gagan Biyani, we founded Udemy. To be sure, there were those who doubted that a marketplace approach to learning would work or that we could make learning viable outside a traditional educational setting. But we remained steadfast in our conviction that those who possess knowledge want to share it with those seeking knowledge. The first courses appeared on our site in 2011, and within three years we had more than a million learners. Udemy is now a global destination for learning and teaching online. In scale and scopemillions of learners, thousands of instructors, thousands of enterprise customersit far exceeds my early dreams. Even so, I believe we are only just beginning. When I hear from those whose lives were forever changed by their experience learning or teaching on Udemy, Im reminded of my own journey from a small village in Turkey to Silicon Valley. Believe me when I say that there truly is no limit to what people can accomplish when they can access the worlds knowledge and pursue their dreams. Eren Bali Co-Founder, Udemy, Inc.

Our marketplace platform, with thousands of up-to-date courses in dozens of languages, provides the tools that learners, instructors, and organizations need to achieve their goals and reach their full potential. We believe traditional education and training methods are fast becoming outdated. Technological advancements and novel industries have significantly altered the types of skills required of workers, and lifelong training and continuous skills acquisition are becoming the norm. There is a clear need to expand access to learning and make it available across traditional barriers such as geography and social demographics. Udemy operates a marketplace platform at the center of a vibrant knowledge network. We have created a new approach to learning that allows real-world experts to continuously create and update relevant content to our platform, where it becomes easily accessible to learners globally. Our platform provides over 44 million learners with access to over 183,000 courses in over 75 languages and 180 countries. We define learners as people who have engaged with content through Udemy. They consist of individuals who purchase or enroll for free in single courses or subscriptions through our direct-to-consumer offering as well as those who learn through UB, our employer-sponsored subscription offering. Since inception, more than 73 million users have registered with Udemy. Our over 65,000 instructors, supported by our platforms course feedback and analytical tools, create high quality content in online learningcontent that makes up our consumer and enterprise course catalogs. These instructors are expert industry practitioners for whom Udemy enables broad audience reach, and our aligned incentive model allows them to share in the economic upside of the course content they contribute because our instructor payments for course content are proportional to the sales of such course content on our platform. Udemy is a two-sided marketplace where our instructors develop content to meet learner demand. Courses can be accessed through our direct-to-consumer or UB offerings. Courses on both offerings address learning objectives such as reskilling or upskilling in technology and business, enhancing soft skills, and personal development. We analyze data gathered to better determine our learners needs, helping us match individuals with relevant courses and, within UB, learning paths for a more personalized experience. Our learners also receive access to interactive learning tools such as quizzes, exercises, and instructor questions-and-answers, or Q&A. Our UB offering helps over 8,600 global organizations, defined as companies of all sizes, nonprofits, and government agencies, whom we refer to as UB customers or enterprise customers, support employees professional growth and personal development through learning. The UB course catalog reflects the continuous curation of our broader platform content; we select for the most engaging, relevant, and high-quality courses that best fit the requirements of organizations. Our rigorous curation process considers factors such as learner feedback and ratings, topic relevance, content quality, and instructor engagement. Our business has experienced rapid growth. From 2019 to 2020, our revenue grew 55.6% to $429.9 million, which includes 103.5% growth in UB revenue, although we incurred net losses of $69.7 million and $77.6 million during 2019 and 2020, respectively. From the six months ended June 30, 2020 to the six months ended June 30, 2021, our revenue grew 24.5% to $250.6 million, which includes 78.7% growth in UB revenue, although we incurred net losses of $52.5 million and $29.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $378.5 million and $407.9 million, respectively. 99 Industry As technological advancements, new fields of study, and novel industries render existing skill sets obsolete, individuals and organizations alike struggle to keep their expertise up to date. Yet continuous proficiency in the latest technologies has become a prerequisite in many fields. The need for a new model for learning and sharing skills is urgent. According to the World Economic Forum, companies surveyed estimate that around 40% of workers will require short-cycle reskilling (i.e., six months or less), and 94% of business leaders report that they expect employees to pick up new skills on the job. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the need for skills training. According to a report by the World Economic Forum, 84% of employers surveyed report that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need to digitize. Adapting employees skills and roles to the post-pandemic ways of working is crucial to building operating-model resilience. The shift to online learning has been ongoing for years, and we expect this shift to continue to accelerate. Unfortunately, many of todays options have a number of shortcomings: ||| | Relevance: Traditional learning solutions rely on the so-called publisher model, which involves a lengthy, centralized, and expensive top-down development process by multiple levels of editors and reviewers. We believe a top-down publisher model disincentivizes continuous course creation or improvement post-publication because it limits the speed of course development, instructors creative oversight over their content, and the cost-effectiveness of localized content production. Yet the importance of timely access to relevant skills training will only increase. According to the World Economic Forum, 97 million new roles may emerge by 2025. ||| | Breadth: Due to the slower speed and higher costs associated with the publisher model, existing solutions tend to limit content to the most popular learning areas such as technical skills, creative skills, or personal development strategies. As a result, these training options may lack the content breadth, within topics and between topics, and the instructor diversity to meet the interdisciplinary objectives of modern learners. Existing solutions may not adequately address continuous and multidisciplinary learning needs. ||| | Quality: While large volumes of digital learning content exist globally, the quality of this content can be difficult to ascertain. Often traditional providers do not provide quality indicators such as ratings, reviews, and past performance. The modern learner needs an efficient way to access high-quality content. ||| | Scalability: Existing solutions have proven ineffective at operating on a global scale. Many rely primarily on in-person training, which is difficult to reproduce at scale and fundamentally limited by an instructors time and physical resources. Existing solutions have also been slow to leverage technology to expand their reach. Other digital solutions, despite being more scalable than in-person training, have also struggled to provide local content for international communities. ||| | Affordability: The high cost of learning solutions prevents many individual learners from advancing or upgrading their skills. Likewise, pricing for existing solutions is often standardized globally, further limiting access in many geographies. We offer a new approach, one that addresses these shortcomings and effectively connects the global ecosystem of learners to up-to-date knowledge from experts and practitioners around the world. We are creating a better learning experience. Our market opportunity According to a HolonIQ study, the global online and offline education market was $2.6 trillion across higher education, corporate training, and online learning in 2019. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of corporate training occurred offline, and we believe that online education is well placed to address the scalability and affordability limitations of offline education. With the increase of internet connectivity, technological advances, and interactive tools at a low cost, we expect a massive shift from offline to online. 100 Based on data from Arizton, we estimate our market opportunity in online learning to be $223 billion. We calculate this estimate by aggregating the global corporate opportunity of $71 billion and the global consumer opportunity of $152 billion in 2021. We believe that our market opportunity could grow to be multiples of todays estimate as learning continues to transition online. Further, we believe that online education can address the rising demand for lifelong learning in the rapidly evolving world economy, a development that would expand our market opportunity to include the majority of the global adult population. Our solution: the worlds learning platform Our platform allows individual learners and organizations all over the world to access affordable, relevant, and up-to-date content from experts and experienced practitioners in nearly every field. We combine this high-quality content with data insights and technology to create a platform purpose-built to meet the specific needs of learners, instructors, and organizations. In effect, our platform delivers a powerful flywheel of content creation, engagement, and continuous content optimization. Our expert instructors continuously generate new courses and update existing ones, while our marketplace encourages engagement on the most in-demand topics. The volume and frequency of these interactions allow us to generate meaningful insights and provide real-time feedback and analytics for our instructors. These data insights in turn improve content quality, enhance course personalization, and optimize productivity and satisfaction for our learners. One way that we foster access to courses for individual learners and organizations is through broad content distribution across our various channels. We leverage machine learning, or ML, to increase learner retention and conversion using enhanced personalization. At the same time, we believe our model encourages more relevant and engaging content through well-aligned incentives for our instructors, supported by consistent improvement from the feedback and data collected from individual learners and UB customers. Over 17,700 free courses are available on our platform. These free courses represent an important entry point for learners to experience our platform. Over 28 million consumer learners have enrolled in free courses on a wide range of topics taught by a diverse set of instructors in a variety of languages. Through this free content, we are able to build a large and cost-effective top of the funnel for both consumer and UB leads. Once learners interact with our platform, our ML algorithms recommend courses for learners to purchase based on topic, quality, instructor rating, number of enrollments, learners country of origin, and more. The algorithms help us maximize revenue while offering the best value to learners. Over 3.7 million free learners have converted to buyers. We also offer unlimited access to a curated catalog of courses through our Consumer, Enterprise, and Team plan subscriptions. The courses selected for the subscription offerings are among the highest quality, most relevant, and most popular on our platform. Pricing for our subscription plans typically begins at a range of $20-$30 per seat per month, subject to geographic variations. Our Consumer plans are offered on a monthly basis and provide a single seat with access to a catalog of over 5,000 of our top-rated courses. Pricing for Consumer plans varies based on jurisdiction and the course catalog for which the learner has subscribed. Our Consumer plans generally renew automatically for subsequent subscription terms. Learners can cancel to prevent renewal at the end of the then-current period. Our Team plan offers organizations access to over 6,000 top-rated courses for 5-20 seats at an annual rate starting at $360 per seat. Our Team plan offers an automatic renewal option for subsequent subscription terms. These customers can cancel to prevent renewal at the end of the then-current period. Team plan accounts can be customized to provide a unique, enterprise-specific URL and can incorporate the UB customers logo in the user interface. Our Team plan also permits learners to access the applicable course catalog through our UB app and provides enterprises with basic learner management tools. 101 Our Enterprise plan begins with the same offering as the Team plan for 21+ seats and supplements it with additional administrative tools, insights, learning playbooks, and additional courses through our language packages. Pricing for our Enterprise plans is based on volume, length of contract, and a number of other factors. Enterprise plans are available as both annual and multi-year subscriptions, with renewal and cancellation terms varying based on each customers specific contract. In addition to these subscriptions, we offer immersive learning experiences such as labs, skills assessments, and coding exercises in a range of verticals. These varied options help enable our sales and services teams to customize our approach to work for organizations of all sizes, from emerging companies with under 200 employees to large enterprises with over 5,000 employees. What we offer our learners We provide over 44 million learners with relevant, affordable, and high-quality content, and we do this on a platform that enables the constant improvement of our courses by leveraging the social validation of over 594 million course enrollments, as well as thousands of ratings and reviews. With Udemy, learners can fulfill objectives involving: ||| | Technical skills: Learners often seek to gain proficiency in the latest technology, which helps them stay competitive through upskilling or reskilling their capabilities. ||| | Business skills: Business and professional soft skills, such as negotiation strategy or team leadership, are in constant demand as individuals look to advance their careers, react to new workplace environments, or take on new responsibilities. ||| | Personal development: Learners like to complement their primary skills with discovery of new interests or hobbies such as music, drawing, and wellness. Learners on Udemy receive a comprehensive and immersive experience through interactive exercises and the ability to communicate directly with instructors through question-and-answer functionality. Our courses feature world-class instructors like Angela Yu, founder of the programming bootcamp London App Brewery, whose courses have approximately 1.1 million cumulative enrollments and an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.0 stars, and Jose Portilla, the Head of Data Science of Pierian Data, whose courses have approximately 3.3 million cumulative enrollments and an average rating of 4.5 out of 5.0 stars. We work to create a trusted and welcoming platform for learners by implementing policies and procedures intended to encourage respectful behavior. This includes requiring instructors to respect the intellectual property rights of others and prohibiting the posting of any inappropriate, offensive, false, or infringing content. As part of our publication process, we assess whether courses satisfy a checklist of technical criteria related to their audio, video, and course descriptions, and we reject courses on topics prohibited on our platform. Additionally, Udemy enables learners and other parties to easily report conduct that violates our policies, and our Trust & Safety team maintains processes to take action when we become aware of policy violations, which can range from the temporary disabling of communications features in cases of excessive use to the removal of content and termination of accounts in cases of more serious policy violations, such as the posting of infringing content. Our refund policy for courses purchased on our consumer marketplace offers learners the ability to request a cash or credit refund up to 30 days from their purchase, subject to certain refund policy guidelines. The decision to refund in either cash or credit is at our sole discretion. What we offer our UB customers We have over 8,600 global UB customers, including 42 of the Fortune 100. Companies such as Citi, Jaguar Land Rover, Tata, Booz Allen Hamilton, PayPal, Box, Sapient, and Eventbrite trust UB to help them achieve their learning and development goals, drawn by the real-world expertise and experience of our instructors. We are focused on helping UB customers upskill and reskill their teams to increase productivity, inspire innovation, address digital transformation, and drive talent retention, particularly in a post-COVID-19 world. UB customers typically express high satisfaction with their UB experience, resulting in our average net promoter score of 49 and an average course rating from UB learners of 4.5 out of 5.0 stars. 102 Our content is relevant to organizations across a variety of industries and includes courses in subjects like technology and business skills. Our curated UB offering begins with over 6,000 of the most engaging and relevant courses available on our platform, selected to meet the needs and standards of some of the worlds largest enterprises. As a part of this offering, we also offer an extensive non-English language collection, which includes courses in Spanish, Portuguese, German, Japanese, and French. We have continued to expand our course offering within UB with the launch of Arabic, Indonesian, Italian, Mandarin, and Turkish language packages in 2021, and we plan to launch Korean, Polish, and Russian language packages later in the year. We use a rigorous selection process across a wide set of criteria to determine the courses that will be offered as part of UB, including: ||| | User behavior: Learner feedback and ratings, as well as content searches, help us determine which courses to maintain or add to UB. ||| | Customer input: Specific content requests, prospects requests for proposal, and customer success stories are evaluated to identify new areas of focus that help ensure the continued strong relevance of our offering. ||| | Market research: Industry trends and instructor interviews help us determine relevant topics and new technologies valued by enterprises and their employees. ||| | Competitor analysis: We monitor market data and analyst reports on an ongoing basis to stay at the forefront of market demand and quickly address any applicable gaps within the topics offered. We constantly update and enhance the curated list of courses included in the UB course catalog in response to industry changes and technological advancement. As of June 30, 2021, the UB course catalog included over 74,000 hours of technical content and over 28,000 hours of business, personal and professional skills content. On average, during the first half of 2021, over 460 new courses were added each month. Our overall UB course catalog has increased from fewer than 2,500 courses in 2017 to over 11,000 today. In addition to high-quality content, we provide the tools and insights necessary for enterprise administrators, managers, and teams to create learning paths. These learning paths allow organizations to assemble customized learning series made up of Udemy courses, the organizations own material, and links to external resources. Learning paths are only visible within the organization that creates them, and offer a unique benefit to administrators and employees. As of June 30, 2021, our UB customers have generated over 360,000 learning paths. We also offer UB customers a comprehensive analytics dashboard and other powerful tools through which they gain high visibility into the progress, areas of focus, and feedback of their employees. This strong set of tools, which includes our learning playbooks, helps our UB customers better understand and optimize learning experiences for their employees and ensure they are delivering a strong and measurable return on their investment in learning skills. What we offer our instructors We offer instructors from around the world access to a global audience of over 44 million learners. Our model allows instructors who elect to charge for courses to share directly in the economic upside of the course content they contribute and the growth of our platform. We have an aligned incentive model where payments to instructors are proportional to course sales on our platform. In 2020, our paid instructors earned $161.4 million from Udemy for their courses, with average paid instructor earnings of $2,950 and over 9,000 global instructors earning more than $1,000. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, our paid instructors earned $86.8 million from Udemy for their courses, with average paid instructor earnings of $1,574 and over 6,000 global instructors receiving more than $1,000 in earnings. The breadth of instructors and courses contributes to the wide variety of content topics available on our platform, as well as meaningful depth within most content categories. We believe that this combination of breadth and depth helps foster competition and choice on our platform and attracts learners and enterprise customers. 103 We enable our instructors to drive innovation and ongoing engagement on our platform. We not only provide instructors access to millions of learners but also offer proprietary tools to help them generate more relevant and better content. Instructors are able to use platform insights, review feedback from learners, and harness analytics dashboards to manage their course content, brand, and course marketing. As instructors upgrade their courses, our performance marketing engine identifies and selects the best courses to be featured to each learner around the world. Our marketing engine targets and reaches millions of learners, many more times what instructors would be able to reach on their own. Through the promotional pricing program we offer to instructors, we programmatically control the list and promotional prices for each course an instructor offers through our consumer marketplace, based on course characteristics like category of content, hours of content, rating, and popularity. In addition, we offer instructors insight on the revenue opportunity and existing content for any given topic, and we provide auto-generated, translated captions from English to Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, and Polish, so instructors can better reach our global learner base. When an instructors course is added to the UB catalog, instructors are subject to an exclusivity clause for the use of their content on our platform, pursuant to which instructors agree, subject to limited exceptions, not to offer any on-demand content, such as pre-recorded courses, on any competing platform in a way that directly competes with or impairs the sales of such content on our platform. This exclusivity clause is effective for so long as an instructors content is included in the UB catalog, and we may continue to include content in the UB catalog for up to 12 months after an instructor elects to opt out of the UB catalog. We believe these exclusivity arrangements increase the value of our offerings by increasing the amount of unique content on Udemy and helping maintain our robust roster of expert instructors. We believe that, on average, the value we offer instructors ultimately delivers a far higher return on investment relative to other content creation and online learning competitors. Our competitive strengths We believe our business model benefits from several competitive advantages: Global distribution and reach with strong brand value: We consider our platform to be naturally borderless as it connects individual learners and enterprise customers with instructors across the world. This has enabled us to develop a global distribution platform targeting all of the constituents in the learning ecosystem. In 2020, 61% of our revenue was generated outside of North America. Our UB revenue is similarly global, with 47% of revenue from customers in North America, 29% from Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 21% from Asia Pacific, and 3% from Latin America for the twelve-month period through June 30, 2021. Because our online platform is available globally, curious learners and organizations can easily test our content. As these new learners and organizations begin to engage with us, we then have the opportunity to quickly and efficiently expand into these new markets by focusing our marketing, advertising, pricing, and language customization resources and expanding our payment options, which in turn allows us to grow our base of individual learners and enterprises on an ongoing basis and attract new instructors who create native language courses. We believe the scale of our platform and the increasing recognition of our brand create further avenues of growth. Robust content generation engine: ||| | Premium quality: We have effectively built a creator platform that allows instructors to develop content on virtually any topic, while having the flexibility to update courses as they incorporate feedback from millions of learners around the world. We believe this continuously updated content, along with personalized recommendations and advanced search capabilities, presents a better value proposition for learners who benefit from accessing the most up-to-date, high-quality content that is relevant to them. The constant feedback loop between learners and instructors ensures that we are able to maintain the high quality of our overall offering. 104 ||| | Relevance and speed to market: Our marketplace model motivates instructors to provide relevant content to learners quickly, whether by being first to address in-demand topics, refreshing existing topics, or finding new and better ways to serve the learner community on existing topics. Instructors who do so are more likely to have a first-mover advantage in attracting learners and enrollments to their courses, which in turn increases the likelihood of their course content being featured by our ML algorithms or included in our UB offerings, which also drives more enrollments and engagement from learners. We believe these structural inducements, coupled with our aligned incentive model, help drive our instructors to update their courses at a much higher rate than courses offered through competitors with a traditional publisher model. For example, 80% of courses in the UB course catalog were updated in the last two years. ||| | Breadth of content: We provide access to over 183,000 courses (over 17,700 of which were offered for free as of June 30, 2021), including over 70,000 courses in languages other than English. On average, instructors publish more than 5,000 courses a month on our platform. Our courses cover a wide range of subjects, with 34% addressing technology topics such as development and IT, 31% covering business topics such as leadership and design, and 35% teaching personal enrichment topics such as personal development, languages, and music. Many of our competitors specialize in a specific category, which proves to be a suboptimal solution for companies and their employees that require a blend of technical, business, and soft skills. Our diverse marketplace of courses allows us to offer learners and UB customers a solution that supplements technical and business content with personal enrichment courses in the wellness, music, and lifestyle categories, among others. ||| | Affordability: Our ML pricing algorithms determine how much we charge for our courses in our marketplace on a per-country basis, taking into account dozens of course characteristics, including category of content, hours of content, course rating, and popularity. Self-reinforcing flywheel with powerful network effects: We are one symbiotic, data-centric platform with over 500 million unique visitors from 2018 through 2020. We believe the growing number of individual learners and enterprises on our platform attracts instructors for whom our platform and global audience can create new income streams and help support their families and local communities. The increasing number of relevant, high-quality, and up-to-date courses offered by world-class subject matter experts and industry practitioners, in turn, attracts more individual learners and enterprises. Our direct-to-consumer offering is synergistic with UB. As individual learners experience firsthand the quality and benefits of Udemys platform, they realize the impact it could have on their teams and organizations, thus becoming evangelists for Udemy within their organizations at all levels. We have been very successful at driving high-converting leads to UB, with over 60% of leads coming from our direct-to-consumer platform in 2020. These leads have helped fuel UBs rapid growth from under $13 million in ARR in December 2017 to over $180 million in ARR in June 2021. Powerful data insights and analytics: With over 500 million unique visitors from 2018 through 2020, an average of 33 million monthly unique visitors during the first half of 2021, more than 594 million cumulative course enrollments (including 201 million enrollments just in 2020), and almost 11 billion minutes of learning in 2020 and 2.8 billion minutes of learning during the second quarter of 2021, we believe that the volume of the data our platform collects provides meaningful insights into the behaviors and needs of our learners and instructors. We leverage that data to provide personalization for learners as well as to promote high-quality and relevant content from instructors. We capture user behavioral data and focus on understanding the learning objectives and interests of our learners across multiple touchpoints during their learning journey to better address their needs and recommend the right courses. We also analyze enrollment data, market insights, and feedback from learners to identify needed skills or new topics of focus within our content catalog. We share this information with our instructors in real time so they can improve their course offerings. 105 Flexible technology platform: Our technology platform is modern, agile, accessible from a variety of online and mobile channels, and built to scale with our global growth. A deep reservoir of data with billions of data points helps our data scientists recommend better and more relevant content. We use advanced technology applications, such as personalized promotions, lifecycle marketing, and content personalization, to help tailor our platform for our learners. Our platforms ability to provide a personalized experience is further enhanced by the ML methodologies used to develop the algorithms included in our technology, which allow us to personalize each learners experience continuously and automatically. We regularly run tests to determine which product features, course recommendations, prices, and messaging will drive the best outcomes for our learners and Udemy as a whole. In addition, we have built our technology to be flexible to enable us to continuously test and add new features, such as interactive exercises and immersive learning experiences. Our growth strategies We are still in the early stages of our long-term growth strategy. We expect to continue expanding our consumer and UB customer base, instructor network, and content catalog while increasing our market opportunities through the following strategies: Accelerate the growth of our enterprise business through: ||| | Successfully executing on our land-and-expand strategy. Our strategy focuses on acquiring new customers and efficiently growing our relationships with existing customers, beginning with either individual users or departmental deployments. Historically, we have expanded from individual to department to multi-department to enterprise-wide sales as UBs value is proven and enterprise customers identify additional use cases. With fewer than 10% of total available seats contracted in our enterprise customer base, we consequently see a large opportunity for growth. We intend to continue to expand our sales team footprint globally and to improve our upselling tactics with the assistance of better tools and systems. In addition to inbound leads from our direct-to-consumer offering, we have developed a strong outbound lead-generation process with highly effective account-based marketing operations, allowing us to target, develop, and nurture key accounts in large organizations. ||| | Improving quality and relevance of our courses. We curate our enterprise catalog by selecting the highest-rated and most engaging courses from our consumer business. We intend to continue leveraging our large platform to source high-quality and relevant curricula. We will also continue to improve the speed and efficiency of our curation processes, enabling us to quickly discern the content most relevant to our enterprise customers. ||| | Integrating our UB offering with employees workflow. We provide easy-to-implement learning playbooks, which enable customers to combine UB courses with their own in-house training to create blended learning programs. UB learners can also take advantage of our personalized content recommendations, which we derive from the data we collect. We currently integrate with existing employee learning-and-development and HR workflows, including our customers learning management systems and learning experience platforms, to help enable a more robust offering for UB learners and greater employer visibility into learning. Examples of these integrations include Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, Slack, and ServiceNow. Integrations enable UB customers to incorporate learning in the flow of work: learners can discover, search, and consume our UB catalog. Leaders can sync, track, and report learning progress for employees across other HR systems and also encourage learning across the organization through reminders and sharing on existing company messaging platforms. Looking forward, we intend to expand our offering to integrate with additional employee learning-and-development and HR workflows, and to introduce additional services for employees, thus expanding usage within our UB customers. ||| | Deliver immersive learning experiences. Our platform currently offers powerful learning experiences including practice tests, coding exercises, and quizzes, which permit learners to prepare for certification exams and better retain what they have learned. We intend to expand our offerings to include deeper skills 106 | | assessments, labs, and cohort-based learning. Assessments increase learning efficiency by identifying further areas of study for learners. Labs enable learners to practice the skills they are learning in the applicable technical environments. Cohort-based learning combines synchronous and asynchronous learning together with reflections and virtual classroom time, enabling learning from ones peers and creating accountability to the cohort for course completion and live participation. We will also consider acquisitions to expand the immersive learning experiences we offer, with a goal of improving learner outcomes and ultimately increasing retention. Increase learner retention through: ||| | Building a global personalization engine. Since the beginning of 2020, we have invested considerable resources in developing a personalization-based technology platform, which includes: |-|| | State-of-the-art eventing platform to track and store every learner interaction with our site and apps; |-|| | Customer data platform to structure and analyze all of our learner data; |-|| | Lifecycle marketing platform to develop, train, and operationalize personalization algorithms; and |-|| | Campaign management platform to link personalization algorithms with customer-facing touch-points such as website placements, emails, and push notifications among others. Our personalization efforts are only beginning. We believe that these investments will yield high returns around customer engagement, retention, and lifetime value in the years to come. ||| | Expanding our subscription offering. In early 2021, we launched a direct-to-consumer subscription in beta testing. In its initial format, the subscription offering is similar to our Team plan offering focused on professional skills. Our objective is to provide consumers ongoing access to the platforms best content for a monthly fee. We believe there is broad demand for learning subscriptions, and we are uniquely positioned to provide a compelling and highly competitive product. We plan to test and launch additional forms of subscriptions including bootcamp-style courses with assessments and labs to help learners reach new levels of proficiency. We believe that consumer subscriptions, in the absence of employer-sponsored access, will increase the retention of individual learners who seek to continuously acquire new skills and value greater ongoing access to content. Offering different subscription packages based on area of expertise or added features, for example, will allow us to capture different types of individual learners at different price points, all while increasing their engagement with Udemy. Expand our geographic footprint through: ||| | Organic expansion. All of our courses are discoverable everywhere in the world. We enter new countries via courses taught in English, as they appeal to a broad audience globally. As the platform grows in popularity through organic levers such as word of mouth or search engine optimization, local instructors create courses in their native languages, increasing Udemys appeal to learners fluent in those languages. As of June 30, 2021, we offered over 70,000 courses in languages other than English. We will continue to invest in our technology and our brand to drive search engine optimization and word of mouth in order to continue the organic growth. ||| | Executing our international playbook. As the content catalog expands in each country, we start investing in additional growth levers such as local payment methods, local currency pricing, and local marketing. These investments drive higher traffic, enrollments, and revenue for our direct-to-consumer business, as well as leads for UB. Once we reach a steady volume of leads to UB, we build in-country go-to-market sales teams to grow and expand our UB customer base. We also may partner with local companies that have an interest in growing the adult learning market in their countries. We have executed our international playbook in a number of countries, including Brazil, India, and Japan, and we are in the process of similar investments in Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, and other key geographic markets. Our international playbook will continue to allow us to build a targeted list of countries in which we anticipate we will expand with a high likelihood of success. 107 Competition The market for developing skills is rapidly growing and highly competitive. We compete for individual learners, enterprise customers, and instructors on the following basis: ||| | Learners: We compete for learners based on our course catalog, instructors, and learning tools. We believe that we are positioned favorably because of our ability to attract instructors and support them with data and insights to create and refresh high-quality content. ||| | Udemy Business customers: We compete for customers based on our up-to-date content, the breadth and depth of that content across the full range of core business functions, and advanced product features that optimize self-paced learning and enable organizations to effectively drive programmatic learning. We believe that we are positioned favorably because of the synergies between our consumer and UB businesses, and the strategic partnerships we form with our UB customers that help them drive engagement in their learning programs and, in turn, business outcomes like employee retention and corporate productivity. ||| | Instructors: We compete for instructors based on our ability to provide monetization opportunities. We believe that we are positioned favorably because of our ability to attract learners across the globe, provide data and insights to help instructors to retain learners, and offer an attractive shared revenue model. We believe the competitive landscape is not well-suited to address the growing need for people to develop skills that are continuously and rapidly evolving. The traditional publisher model can be slow moving and reactive. Other niche marketplace models cannot serve the learner of today who is focused on developing both the hard and soft skills. We expect to gain market share as our marketplace platform offers the breadth of skills needed by learners and organizations. Competition can include: ||| | Corporate training offerings, such as those from Pluralsight, LinkedIn Learning, and Skillsoft ||| | Direct-to-consumer training offerings, such as those from Coursera and edX ||| | Specialized content training offerings, such as those from A Cloud Guru and Skillshare ||| | Online free resources used to gather and share knowledge and skills We believe our business model offers the following advantages over these competitors: ||| | Our marketplace model that has created a vibrant ecosystem of individual learners, organizations, and instructors ||| | Our learner base of over 44 million individuals ||| | Our network of over 65,000 instructors, many of whom are expert practitioners in their fields ||| | Our data and analytics platform that continuously improves as we scale ||| | Our ability to provide individual learners with relevant content based on their interests and objectives, with over 183,000 courses covering a broad array of subjects and over 70,000 courses in local languages as of June 30, 2021 ||| | Our global presence and brand recognition Sales and Marketing Consumers Our direct-to-consumer marketing strategy focuses on brand and performance marketing, strategic partnerships, and lifecycle monetization. Brand marketing increases awareness while performance marketing drives incremental traffic among potential learners. The strength of our community and brand drives significant organic acquisition, with the majority of our customers coming from unpaid channels. Our strategic partnerships aim to 108 increase reach by making Udemy courses discoverable on third-party websites and mobile apps. Finally, lifecycle marketing and monetization focuses on building personalization at scale, increasing learner retention and long-term value, optimizing prices and promotions, and testing new monetization models. Udemy Business Our consumer ecosystem helps drive UB marketing efficiency and provides leads for prospective UB customers. As we expand to new regions and countries, we first market to organizations to generate brand awareness and interest in our UB offering, and then our sales team identifies and engages with potential customers. We sell to our UB customers both directly, through our sales teams, and indirectly, through third-party channels. Once an organization signs on, our customer success team partners closely with that organization to track progress toward business outcomes and determine opportunities for expanding usage. Instructors Global experts learn about Udemy in a variety of ways including awareness campaigns and by coming to the platform as learners. Once onboard, our platform provides instructors with insights into learner demand and financial opportunity, incentivizing them to create new course content. Our Instructor Partnership team works closely with our top instructors to share plans and develop new products and services. Our policies for learners and instructors Terms of Use Our Terms of Use cover the basic rules for all account-holders on our platform, including provisions on how a user may open an account and enroll in courses, the rights of learners around refunds and lifetime access, rules for user-generated content and user behavior, the terms of the license from Udemy to learners, and certain other disclaimers and general legal terms. Instructor Terms Our Instructor Terms cover instructor-specific features of our platform. This includes obligations around content quality (requiring accuracy and sufficient expertise), respectful behavior (prohibiting inappropriate, offensive, or infringing content), and use of the Udemy platform (prohibiting unauthorized outreach to learners). The Instructor Terms alsoinclude provisions on the license that instructors grant to Udemy when uploading content, instructors indirect relationship with learners, policies for course pricing, policies for instructor royalty payments, and other general legal terms. Trust & Safety policies Our Trust & Safety policies detail the behaviors that are prohibited or required of our platforms users. These include behavior rules for learners and instructors, a list of prohibited course topics, quality standards for course descriptions and content, rules for the use of Udemys marketing and communications features, and policies regarding our instructor verification process. Technology and research and development Our technology consists of a global distribution platform designed to support all parties in the learning ecosystem. It features a modern architecture designed to support our continued growth at scale. Our goal is to provide world-class experiences across most screens and devices. We have a cross-functional, agile team of data scientists, ML engineers, software engineers, and product managers focused on continuously improving our platform to address evolving customer needs. Thus far, the team has built algorithmic and model-driven solutions at scale to provide the following capabilities: personalized and differentiated experiences for all learners, comprehensive instructor tools for content delivery and student engagement, and insights dashboards for enterprises to track employee training progress. 109 We have built a closed-loop user journey on top of a robust, enterprise-grade technology platform. Through data collection over time, we are able to continue perfecting our learner personalization. Personalized learner experiences begin with offering the correct product and pricing to users through marketing, multi-offering communications, and customer data platforms. Using ML-based tools, we then drive a highly personalized user experience for our learners that includes optimizing the offering, time, and frequency of each communication, recommending relevant content based on learner objectives and preferences, and offering tailored promotions to drive retention and engagement. We also capture learner interest, goals, and searches at different times during the user journey so we can provide the best possible recommendations for courses and learning paths. We continuously gather market research and leverage user data to optimize the content available on our platform. Through our deep understanding of learner needs, we aim to deliver the right learning content, packaged the right way, and offered at the right time. The data gathered also provides powerful insight tools and feedback to our instructors so they can improve their courses and ultimately preserve the high quality of our overall offering. Human capital resources We believe we have a world-class culture with a highly engaged global employee base. We have achieved 4.5 of 5.0 stars on Glassdoor, a platform which represents voluntary reviews among current and former employees, as of June 30, 2021. Additionally, our company has been recognized as a Bay Area Best Place to Work by San Francisco Business Times and as a #1 employer in Turkey on the Great Place to Work lists for three years in a row. As reflected in our annual employee survey, our employee engagement score is 83%, which is 12% above benchmark for companies at our size and stage. We are proud of our internal focus on learning and development and leverage the UB platform to drive upskilling and career growth within our organization. Always Learning is a key value for our company. We hold monthly Drop Everything and Learn hours to provide employees with dedicated time they can use to learn professional or personal skills offered on our platform. We also use UB to provide our team with access to a wide range of content, from important all-company meetings to a variety of management training courses developed by our own Learning & Development team. Our mission-driven approach to make knowledge opportunities accessible to learners around the world helps drive recruitment to our team. Udemy is the only digital learning company included in the Fortune 2020 Change the World list, and our employees enjoy the opportunity to be a part of a socially conscious brand benefiting all constituents. Overall, we are a leader in gender diversity among companies like ours, with 43% of our global workforce, 31% of our senior leadership, and 27% of our technical workforce identifying as women as of June 30, 2021. As of June 30, 2021, we had 1,013 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by unions. We consider the relationship with our employees to be strong and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements. Our environmental, social, and governance efforts As a mission-driven company, we strive to create a positive social and economic impact, balancing the needs of our learners, instructors, customers, employees, investors, and the environment. We enable anyone from anywhere in the world to create a course and to market it to consumer and enterprise learners. Our platform helps novices learn from experienced practitioners. Access and inclusion are at the very core of our business model. We believe that providing access to learning at scale supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, including: ||| | Goal 4 Lifelong Learning: We provide inclusive and equitable quality training and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. 38 million cumulative learners consumed almost 11 billion minutes of easy-to-access quality learning on our platform during 2020. 110 ||| | Goal 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth: During 2020, our paid instructors earned $161.4 million for their courses, with average paid instructor earnings of $2,950 and over 9,000 global instructors receiving more than $1,000 in earnings. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, our paid instructors earned $86.8 million from Udemy for their courses, with average paid instructor earnings of $1,574 and over 6,000 global instructors receiving more than $1,000 in earnings. We enable individuals from around the world to create new income streams and support their families and local communities. ||| | Goal 10 Reduced Inequalities: Any individual can be an instructor on our platform regardless of formal academic qualifications. Our platform eliminates barriers to teaching and enables practitioners to spread their knowledge globally. Learners tap our platform for affordable upskilling that unlock career opportunities regardless of prior formal education and geography. Essentially anyone can use our platform and learn. We offer over 17,700 free courses and our instructors distribute millions of instructor coupons globally to encourage individuals to try their courses for free. In 2020, 78% of consumer learner course enrollments on our platform were free. Beyond these United Nations SDGs, we reference the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or the SASB, in our impact reporting. An independent institution, the SASB provides a globally recognized framework for sustainability reporting across companies and industries. In July 2021, we received an ESG risk rating from Sustainalytics, a Morningstar company and an independent provider of ESG and corporate governance ratings, research and analysis. Our ESG goals and policies We are committed to pursuing sustainable business practices and have implemented ESG policies and goals throughout our company to fulfill this commitment. Environmental: We actively manage the environmental footprint of our operations. We use both hosted data centers and cloud computing providers for our operations.

Social: Our business impacts society through our relationships with our varied stakeholders, but it starts with our employees. We believe in the importance of fostering a diverse, inclusive, and safe workplace, recognizing that through diversity and inclusiveness we gain a variety of perspectives, views, and ideas that strengthen our ability to strategize, communicate, and deliver on our mission. Overall, as of December 31, 2020, 43% of our global workforce, 31% of our senior leadership, and 27% of our technical workforce identified as women. We established a board of directors that values diversity and representative governance. We are committed to increasing diversity and representation through our diversity, inclusion, equity, and belonging initiatives, and to disclosing our diversity statistics on an annual basis. We believe that building a better business means engaging with the communities in which we work and invest. We encourage and support community engagement. Our community program uses a global-and-local approach and is driven by the community involvement teams in many of our offices. Projects are organized locally and partner with various service organizations within our communities dedicated to causes encompassing public service, learning, environmental efforts, healthcare, and military veterans. We established a formalized charitable giving program with an employee matching component that contributed to over 50 charities since its inception. The Udemy Free Resource Center drove more than six million enrollments to over 700 free courses designed to enable learners to acquire the skills they need to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. 111 Governance: We created a governance structure to promote responsibility and accountability for ESG matters across our company. Our single-class capital structure adheres to best practices in corporate governance. The nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors will oversee ESG matters pursuant to its charter. For more information, see ManagementBoard committeesNominating and corporate governance committee. Prior to the completion of this offering, we will establish an employee-led ESG committee, with participation from executive management and senior members of our operations, finance, marketing, people, and legal teams. Our ESG committee will meet quarterly and report to executive management and to the board of directors. Data security and privacy are critically important to our operations. We have implemented extensive security practices designed to ensure appropriate physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect customer and employee data. This program includes a data registry and a data map of the systems where customer information is stored, and consumer-facing privacy policies that describe our data and privacy practices. The audit committee of the board of directors will oversee cybersecurity matters pursuant to its charter. For more information, see ManagementBoard committeesAudit committee. Properties Our corporate headquarters, consisting of approximately 59,000 square feet of office space in San Francisco, California, is leased through 2024, with an option to extend until 2029. We also lease additional office space in locations around the world, including Mountain View, California; Denver, Colorado; Ankara, Turkey; and Dublin, Ireland. We also maintain geographic hubs without office space in Austin, Texas; Boston, Massachusetts; Melbourne, Australia; New Delhi, India; Istanbul, Turkey; and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. We believe that our facilities are suitable to meet our current needs. We also anticipate that suitable additional or alternative space will be available at commercially reasonable terms for future expansion. Legal proceedings California class action complaint In August 2021, a putative class action complaint captioned Williams v. Udemy, Inc., Case No. 3:21-CV-06489, was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging violations of Californias unfair competition and false advertising statutes as well as the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act in connection with our pricing practices. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, unspecified damages, restitution and disgorgement of profits. We are in the process of investigating the claims alleged in the complaint and have not yet answered. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter. Other legal proceedings We are subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business from time to time, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. In addition, third parties may from time to time assert claims against us in the form of letters and other communications. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would, in our opinion, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves and our business partners and to determine the scope, enforceability, and validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish our proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. 112 Executive officers and directors The following table sets forth the names and positions of our executive officers and directors and their ages as of June 30, 2021: |Name||Age||Position| |Executive officers:| | | Gregg Coccari |68||President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson of the Board of Directors| | | Sarah Blanchard |45||Chief Financial Officer| | | Velayudhan (Venu) | | Cara Brennan Allamano |43||Senior Places and Learning| | |41||Senior Vice |47||Director| | | Lydia Paterson(3) |49||Director| |(1)|| | Member of the nominating and corporate governance committee (as of completion of this offering). |(2)|| | Member of the compensation committee (as of completion of this offering). |(3)|| | Member of the audit committee (as of completion of this offering).

After the completion of this offering, the number of directors will be fixed from time to time by our board of directors, subject to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws. Each of our current directors will continue to serve as a director until the election and qualification of his, her, or their successor, or until his, her, or their earlier death, resignation, or removal. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that our board of directors will be divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms.

This classification of our board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control of our company. Director independence Upon the completion of this offering, we anticipate that our common stock will be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Under the rules of Nasdaq, independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed companys board of directors within one year of the completion of this offering. In addition, the rules of Nasdaq require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed companys audit, compensation and corporate governance and nominating committees be independent. Audit committee members and compensation committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 and Rule 10C-1, respectively, under the Exchange Act. Under the rules of Nasdaq, a director will only qualify as an independent director if, in the opinion of that companys board of directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. To be considered to be independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 and under the rules of Nasdaq, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his, her, or their capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors or any other board committee: (1) accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries or (2) be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries. To be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10C-1 and under the rules of Nasdaq, the board of directors must affirmatively determine that each member of the compensation committee is independent, including a consideration of all factors specifically relevant to determining whether the director has a relationship to the company which is material to that directors ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a compensation committee member, including: (1) the source of compensation of such director, including any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee paid by the company to such director and (2) whether such director is affiliated with the company, a subsidiary of the company or an affiliate of a subsidiary of the company. Our board of directors undertook a review of its composition, the composition of its committees and the independence of our directors and considered whether any director has a material relationship with us that could compromise his, her, or their ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his, her, or their responsibilities. Based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his, her, or their background, employment, and affiliations, including family relationships, our board of directors has determined that Eren Bali, Kenneth Fox, Heather Hiles, Lawrence Illg, Jeffrey Liberman and Lydia Paterson, representing six of our seven directors following completion of this offering, do not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is independent as that term is defined under the rules of . In making these determinations, our board of directors considered the current and prior relationships that each non-employee director has with our company and all other facts and circumstances our board of directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director, and the transactions involving them described in Certain relationships and related party transactions. Board leadership structure Gregg Coccari, our President and Chief Executive Officer, also serves as Chairperson of the Board of Directors. Our board of directors believes that this leadership structure, coupled with a strong emphasis on independence of the board of directors, provides effective independent oversight of management while allowing both the board of directors and management to benefit from Mr. Coccaris leadership and business experience. As Chairperson of 117 the Board of Directors and President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Coccari has been the director most capable of effectively identifying strategic priorities and vision, coordinating the board of directors agenda to focus on discussions critical to the success of our company and executing our strategy and business plans. We believe this experience, together with the outside experience, oversight and expertise of our independent directors, allows for differing perspectives and roles regarding strategy development that benefit our stockholders. Further, our board of directors believes that Mr. Coccaris combined role enables decisive leadership, ensures clear accountability and enhances our ability to communicate its message and strategy clearly and consistently to its stockholders, employees and customers. Prior to the completion of this offering, our corporate governance guidelines will provide that one of our independent directors will serve as the lead independent director at any time when the chairperson is not independent. Our board of directors has appointed Jeffrey Lieberman to serve as our lead independent director in light of Mr. Coccaris leadership as our combined President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson of the Board of Directors. As lead independent director, Mr. Lieberman will be responsible for calling separate meetings of the independent directors, determining the agenda for, and serving as chairperson of, meetings of independent directors, and providing feedback to our chief executive officer and chairperson from executive sessions.

Cash compensation Following the completion of this offering, non-employee directors will be entitled to receive the following cash compensation for their services under the compensation policy: ||| | $35,000 per year for service as a board member; ||| | $15,000 per year for service as a lead independent director; ||| | $20,000 per year for service as chair of the audit committee; ||| | $10,000 per year for service as a member of the audit committee; ||| | $14,000 per year for service as chair of the compensation committee; ||| | $7,000 per year for service as a member of the compensation committee; ||| | $8,000 per year for service as chair of the nominating and governance committee; and ||| | $4,000 per year for service as a member of the nominating and governance committee. Each non-employee director who serves as the chair of a committee will receive only the additional annual cash fee as the chair of the committee, and not the annual fee as a member of the committee, but each non-employee director who serves as the lead independent director will receive the annual fee for service as a board member and an additional annual fee as the lead independent director. All cash payments to non-employee directors are paid quarterly in arrears on a pro-rated basis. Equity compensation Initial award. Each person who first becomes a non-employee director after the effective date of the policy will receive, on the first trading date on or after the date on which the person first becomes a non-employee director, an initial award of restricted stock units, or the Initial Award, covering a number of shares of our common stock having a value equal to $360,000, with any resulting fraction rounded down to the nearest whole share. 1/3rd of the shares subject to the Initial Award will be scheduled to vest each year following the date of grant on the same day of the month as the date of grant (or, if there is no corresponding day in a particular month, then the last day of the month), in each case subject to the non-employee director continuing to be a non-employee director through the applicable vesting date. If the person was a member of our board of directors and also an employee, becoming a non-employee director due to termination of employment will not entitle them to an Initial Award. 121 Annual award. Each non-employee director automatically will receive, on the date of each annual meeting of our stockholders following the effective date of the policy, an annual award of restricted stock units, or an Annual Award, covering a number of shares of our common stock having a value of $180,000, but the first annual award granted to an individual who first becomes a non-employee director following the effective date of the policy will have a value equal to the product of (A) $180,000 multiplied by (B) a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is equal to the number of fully completed days between the non-employee directors initial start date and the date of the first annual meeting of our stockholders to occur after such individual first becomes a non-employee director, and (ii) the denominator of which is 365, with any resulting fraction rounded down to the nearest whole share. Each Annual Award will vest in full on the earlier of (i) the one-year anniversary of the grant date or (ii) the date of the next annual meeting of our stockholders following the grant date, in each case subject to the non-employee director continuing to be a non-employee director through the applicable vesting date. For purposes of the annual limitation on non-employee director compensation, or the determination of the number of shares of our common stock that will be subject to each Initial Award or Annual Award, the value of equity awards is based on the grant date fair value (determined in accordance with GAAP), or such other methodology as our board of directors or a designated committee of our board of directors may determine prior to an equity award becoming effective. In the event of a change in control (as defined in our 2021 Plan), each non-employee director will fully vest in their outstanding equity awards issued under the director compensation policy, including any Initial Award or Annual Award, immediately prior to the consummation of the change in control if the non-employee director continues to be a non-employee director through such date. Compensation committee interlocks and inside participation None of the members of our compensation committee is or has been an officer or employee of our company. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past fiscal year has served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee (or other board committee performing equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire board of directors) of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors or compensation committee. Code of business conduct and ethics Prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we intend to adopt a written code of business conduct and ethics that will apply to our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller or persons performing similar functions. Following this offering, the code of business conduct and ethics will be available on our website at www.udemy.com. We intend to disclose future amendments to such code, or any waivers of its requirements, applicable to any principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller or persons performing similar functions or our directors on our website identified above or in a current report on Form 8-K. Information contained on the website is not incorporated by reference into this prospectus and should not be considered to be part of this prospectus. 122 Our named executive officers for 2020, which consist of each person who served as our principal executive officer during 2020 and our next two most highly compensated executive officers during 2020, are: ||| | Gregg Coccari, our President and Chief Executive Officer; ||| | Greg Brown, our President, Udemy Business; and ||| | Llibert Argerich, our Senior Vice President, Marketing.

Potential payments upon termination or change in control Prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we intend to enter into a change in control and severance agreement with Messrs. Coccari, Brown and Argerich and certain other of our key employees, subject to the approval of our board of directors. Each named executive officers change in control and severance agreement provides for a 3 year term, subject to automatic renewal on each three year anniversary of the agreements effective date for an additional 3 year term unless either party provides the other with written notice of nonrenewal at least 60 days prior to such automatic renewal. 124 Pursuant to each named executive officers change in control and severance agreement, if, within the 3 month period prior to or the 12 month period following a change in control (as defined in the applicable agreement), we terminate the employment of the named executive officer without cause (excluding death or disability) or the named executive officer resigns for good reason (as such terms are defined in the applicable agreement), and within 60 days following such termination, the named executive officer executes a waiver and release of claims in our favor that becomes effective and irrevocable, the named executive officer will be entitled to receive (i) a lump sum payment equal to 12 months of the named executive officers then current annual base salary plus 100% of the named executive officers annual target bonus for the year of termination, (ii) reimbursement of premiums to maintain group health insurance continuation benefits pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, or COBRA, for the named executive officer and the named executive officers respective eligible dependents for up to 12 months, (iii) vesting acceleration as to 100% of the then-unvested shares subject to each of the named executive officers then outstanding equity awards (and in the case of awards with performance vesting, unless the applicable award agreement governing such award provides otherwise, all performance goals and other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at target levels of achievement), and (iv) with respect to Mr. Brown, the post-termination exercise period for each of his vested and outstanding stock options will extend to 1 year from the date of his termination of employment (not to exceed the expiration date of any such option). Pursuant to each named executive officers change in control and severance agreement, if, outside of the 3 month period prior to or the 12 month period following a change in control, we terminate the employment of the named executive officer without cause (excluding death or disability) or the named executive officer resigns for good reason, and within 60 days following such termination, the named executive officer executes a waiver and release of claims in our favor that becomes effective and irrevocable, the named executive officer will be entitled to receive (i) (A) with respect to Mr. Coccari, a lump sum payment equal to 12 months of his then current annual base salary, (B) with respect to Mr. Brown, a lump sum payment equal to 12 months of his then current annual base salary plus an amount equal to the officers prorated annual target bonus for the year of termination, and (C) with respect to Mr. Argerich, a lump sum payment equal to 6 months of his then current annual base salary, (ii) reimbursement of premiums to maintain group health insurance continuation benefits pursuant to COBRA for the named executive officer and the named executive officers respective eligible dependents for up to 12 months, with respect to Messrs. Coccari and Brown, and 6 months, with respect to Mr. Argerich, and (iii) with respect to Mr. Brown, (A) the post-termination exercise period for each of his vested and outstanding stock options will extend to 1 year from the date of his termination of employment (not to exceed the expiration date of any such option), and (B) if the qualifying termination occurs prior to the first anniversary of his commencement of employment with us, a number of the then unvested and outstanding shares subject to Mr. Browns original stock option grant subject to time-based vesting will accelerate and fully vest, with such number equal to the product of (x) 25% of the shares originally subject to such option and (b) the quotient of the number of days between the date of the commencement of his employment with us and the date of the officers termination of employment divided by 365, rounded up to the nearest whole share. Pursuant to each named executive officers change in control and severance agreement, in the event any payment to a named executive officer would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, or the Code (as a result of a payment being classified as a parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code), the officer will receive such payment as would entitle the named executive officer to receive the greatest after-tax benefit, even if it means that we pay the named executive officer a lower aggregate payment so as to minimize or eliminate the potential excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code. Employee benefit and stock plans 2021 Equity Incentive Plan Prior to the effectiveness of this offering, we expect that our board of directors will adopt, and our stockholders will approve our 2021 Plan. We expect that our 2021 Plan will become effective on the business day immediately prior to the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. Our 2021 Plan will 125 provide for the grant of incentive stock options, within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, to our employees and any parent and subsidiary corporations employees, and for the grant of nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance awards to our employees, directors, eligible platform workers and consultants and our parent and subsidiary corporations employees, eligible platform workers and consultants. Our 2010 Plan will terminate one business day prior to effectiveness of our 2021 Plan with respect to the grant of future awards. Authorized shares. Subject to the adjustment provisions of and the automatic increase described in our 2021 Plan, a total of 13,800,000 shares of our common stock will be reserved for issuance pursuant to our 2021 Plan. In addition, subject to the adjustment provisions of our 2021 Plan, the shares reserved for issuance under our 2021 Plan also will include any shares subject to awards granted under our 2010 Plan that, on or after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised or issued in full, are tendered to or withheld by us for payment of an exercise price or for satisfying tax withholding obligations, or are forfeited to or repurchased by us due to failure to vest (provided that the maximum number of shares that may be added to our 2021 Plan pursuant to outstanding awards under our 2010 Plan is 22,000,000 shares). Subject to the adjustment provisions of our 2021 Plan, the number of shares available for issuance under our 2021 Plan will also include an annual increase on the first day of each fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2023 and ending on (and including) January 1, 2031, in an amount equal to (i) five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares on the last day of the immediately preceding calendar year or (B) such lesser amount (including zero) that the administrator determines for purposes of the annual increase for that year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of shares that may be delivered in the aggregate pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options granted under the 2021 Plan shall not exceed five times the initial number of shares reserved under the 2021 Plan plus, to the extent allowable under Section 422 of the Code, any shares that become available for issuance under the 2021 Plan pursuant to the following paragraph. If a stock option or stock appreciation right granted under our 2021 Plan expires or becomes unexercisable without having been exercised in full or is surrendered pursuant to an exchange program or, with respect to restricted stock, RSUs or stock settled performance awards, is forfeited to, or repurchased by, us due to failure to vest, then the unpurchased shares (or for awards other than stock options or stock appreciation rights, the forfeited or repurchased shares) which were subject thereto will become available for future grant or sale under our 2021 Plan (unless our 2021 Plan has terminated). With respect to stock appreciation rights, only the net shares actually issued will cease to be available under our 2021 Plan and all remaining shares under stock appreciation rights will remain available for future grant or sale under our 2021 Plan (unless our 2021 Plan has terminated). Shares that have actually been issued under our 2021 Plan under any award will not be returned to our 2021 Plan; provided, however, that if shares issued pursuant to awards of restricted stock, RSUs or performance awards are repurchased or forfeited to us due to failure to vest, such shares will become available for future grant under our 2021 Plan. Shares used to pay the exercise price of an award or to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to an award will become available for future grant or sale under our 2021 Plan. To the extent an award is paid out in cash rather than shares, the cash payment will not result in a reduction in the number of shares available for issuance under our 2021 Plan. Plan administration. We expect that our compensation committee will administer our 2021 Plan and may further delegate authority to one or more subcommittees or officers to the extent such delegation complies with applicable laws. Subject to the provisions of our 2021 Plan, the administrator will have the power to administer our 2021 Plan and make all determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering our 2021 Plan, including but not limited to: the power to determine the fair market value of our common stock; select the service providers to whom awards may be granted; determine the number of shares covered by each award; approve forms of award agreements for use under our 2021 Plan; determine the terms and conditions of awards (including, but not limited to, the exercise price, the times or times at which the awards may be exercised, any vesting acceleration or waiver or forfeiture restrictions, and any restriction or limitation regarding any award or the shares relating thereto); construe and interpret the terms of our 2021 Plan and awards granted under it, including but not limited to determining whether and when a change in control has occurred; establish, amend, and rescind rules and 126 regulations relating to our 2021 Plan, and adopt sub-plans relating to our 2021 Plan; interpret, modify or amend each award, including but not limited to the discretionary authority to extend the post-termination exercisability period of awards; allow participants to satisfy tax withholding obligations in any manner permitted by our 2021 Plan; delegate ministerial duties to any of our employees; authorize any person to take any steps and execute, on our behalf, any documents required for an award previously granted by the administrator to be effective; temporarily suspend the exercisability of an award if the administrator deems such suspension to be necessary or appropriate for administrative purposes, provided that, unless prohibited by applicable laws, such suspension shall be lifted in all cases not less than 10 trading days before the last date that the award may be exercised; allow a participant to defer the receipt of payment of cash or the delivery of shares that would otherwise be due to such participant under an award; and make any determinations necessary or appropriate under the adjustment provisions of our 2021 Plan. The administrator also has the authority to allow participants the opportunity to transfer outstanding awards to a financial institution or other person or entity selected by the administrator and to institute an exchange program by which outstanding awards may be surrendered or canceled in exchange for awards of the same type which may have a higher or lower exercise price and/or different terms, awards of a different type and/or cash, or by which the exercise price of an outstanding award is increased or reduced. The administrators decisions, interpretations, and other actions will be final and binding on all participants to the full extent permitted by law. Stock options. Our 2021 Plan permits the grant of options. The exercise price of options granted under our 2021 Plan must be at least equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, except that options may be granted with a lower exercise price to a service provider who is not a U.S. taxpayer, or pursuant to certain transactions. The term of an option is determined by the administrator, provided that the term of an incentive stock option may not exceed ten years. With respect to any participant who owns more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of our outstanding stock, the term of an incentive stock option granted to such participant must not exceed five years and the exercise price must equal at least 110% of the fair market value on the grant date. The administrator determines the methods of payment of the exercise price of an option, which may include cash, check or wire transfer, cashless exercise, net exercise, promissory note, shares, or other consideration or method of payment acceptable to the administrator, to the extent permitted by applicable law. After the termination of service of an employee, director, or consultant, they may exercise their option for the period of time stated in their option agreement. In the absence of a specified time in an award agreement, if termination is due to death or disability, the option will remain exercisable for six months. In all other cases, in the absence of a specified time in an award, the option will remain exercisable for thirty days. These exercise periods may be tolled in certain circumstances, for example if exercise prior to the end of the applicable period is not permitted because of applicable laws. However, in no event may an option be exercised later than the expiration of its term. Stock appreciation rights. Our 2021 Plan permits the grant of stock appreciation rights. Stock appreciation rights allow the recipient to receive the appreciation in the fair market value of our common stock between the exercise date and the date of grant. The term of stock appreciation rights is determined by the administrator. After the termination of service of an employee, director, or consultant, they may exercise their stock appreciation right for the period of time stated in their stock appreciation rights agreement. In the absence of a specified time in an award agreement, if termination is due to death or disability, the stock appreciation rights will remain exercisable for six months. In all other cases, in the absence of a specified time in an award agreement, the stock appreciation rights will remain exercisable for thirty days following the termination of service. These exercise periods may be tolled in certain circumstances, for example if exercise prior to the end of the applicable period is not permitted because of applicable laws. However, in no event may a stock appreciation right be exercised later than the expiration of its term. Subject to the provisions of our 2021 Plan, the administrator determines the other terms of stock appreciation rights, including when such rights become exercisable and whether to pay any increased appreciation in cash or with shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, except that the per share exercise price for the shares to be issued pursuant to the exercise of a stock appreciation right must be no less than 100% of the fair market value per share on the date of grant. 127 Restricted stock. Our 2021 Plan permits the grant of restricted stock. Restricted stock awards are grants of shares of our common stock that vest in accordance with terms and conditions established by the administrator. The administrator determines the number of shares of restricted stock granted to any employee, director, or consultant and, subject to the provisions of our 2021 Plan, determines the terms and conditions of such awards. The administrator has the authority to impose whatever conditions to vesting it determines to be appropriate (for example, the administrator will be able to set restrictions based on the achievement of specific performance goals or continued service to us); provided, however, that the administrator, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed. Recipients of restricted stock awards generally have voting and dividend rights with respect to such shares upon grant without regard to vesting, unless the administrator provides otherwise. Shares of restricted stock that do not vest will be subject to our right of repurchase or forfeiture. Restricted stock units. Our 2021 Plan permits the grant of RSUs. Each RSU will represent an amount equal to the fair market value of one share of our common stock. Subject to the provisions of our 2021 Plan, the administrator determines the terms and conditions of RSUs, including the vesting criteria and the form and timing of payment. The administrator has the authority to set vesting criteria based upon the achievement of company-wide, divisional, business unit, or individual goals (including, but not limited to, continued employment or service), or any other basis determined by the administrator in its discretion. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned RSUs in the form of cash, in shares, or in some combination of both. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the administrator, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the vesting, or reduce or waive the criteria that must be met for vesting, of the RSUs or the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed. Performance awards. Our 2021 Plan permits the grant of performance awards. Performance awards are awards that will result in a payment to a participant only if performance goals established by the administrator are achieved or the awards otherwise vest. The administrator may establish performance objectives or other vesting criteria in its discretion, which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number and/or the value of performance awards to be paid out to participants. The administrator has the authority to set performance objectives based on the achievement of company-wide, divisional, business unit, or individual goals (including, but not limited to, continued employment or service), or any other basis determined by the administrator in its discretion. Each performance awards threshold, target, and maximum payout values are established by the administrator on or before the grant date. After the grant of a performance award, the administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance criteria or other vesting provisions for such performance award. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned performance awards in the form of cash, in shares, or in some combination thereof. Non-employee directors. Our 2021 Plan provides that all outside (non-employee) directors will be eligible to receive all types of awards (except for incentive stock options) under our 2021 Plan. In order to provide a maximum limit on the awards that can be made to our non-employee directors, our 2021 Plan provides that in any given fiscal year, a non-employee director will not be granted awards having a grant-date fair value greater than $750,000, but this limit is increased to $1,500,000 in connection with his, her, or their initially joining our board of directors (in each case, excluding awards granted to him, her, or them as a consultant or employee). The grant-date fair values will be determined according to GAAP. The maximum limits do not reflect the intended size of any potential grants or a commitment to make grants to our outside directors under our 2021 Plan in the future. Non-transferability of awards. Unless the administrator provides otherwise, our 2021 Plan generally does not allow for the transfer of awards and only the recipient of an award may exercise an award during his, her, or their lifetime. If the administrator makes an award transferrable, such award will contain such additional terms and conditions as the administrator deems appropriate. Certain adjustments. If any extraordinary dividend or other extraordinary distribution (whether in cash, shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, reclassification, repurchase, or exchange of shares of our common 128 stock or other of our securities, other change in our corporate structure affecting the shares, or any similar equity restructuring transaction affecting our shares occurs (including a change in control), the administrator, to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be provided under our 2021 Plan, will adjust the number and class of shares that may be delivered under our 2021 Plan and/or the number, class, and price of shares covered by each outstanding award, and the numerical share limits set forth in our 2021 Plan. The conversion of any of our convertible securities and ordinary course repurchases of our shares or other securities will not be treated as an event that will require adjustment under our 2021 Plan. Dissolution or liquidation. In the event of our proposed liquidation or dissolution, the administrator will notify participants as soon as practicable and, to the extent not exercised, all awards will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed transaction. Merger or change in control. Our 2021 Plan provides that in the event of a merger or change in control, as defined under our 2021 Plan, each outstanding award will be treated as the administrator determines, without a requirement to obtain a participants consent, including, without limitation, that such award will be continued by the successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of the successor corporation. An award generally will be considered continued if, following the transaction, (i) the award gives the right to purchase or receive the consideration received in the transaction by holders of our shares or (ii) the award is terminated in exchange for an amount of cash and/or property, if any, equal to the amount that would have been received upon the exercise or realization of the award at the closing of the transaction, which payment may be subject to any escrow applicable to holders of our common stock in connection with the transaction or subjected to the awards original vesting schedule. The administrator will not be required to treat all awards or portions thereof the vested and unvested portions of an award, or all participants similarly. In the event that a successor corporation or its parent or subsidiary does not continue an outstanding award, then such award will fully vest, all restrictions on such award will lapse, all performance goals or other vesting criteria applicable to such award will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels, and such award will become fully exercisable, if applicable, for a specified period prior to the transaction, unless specifically provided for otherwise under the applicable award agreement or other written agreement with the participant. The award will then terminate upon the expiration of the specified period of time. If an option or stock appreciation right is not continued, the administrator will notify the participant in writing or electronically that such option or stock appreciation right will be exercisable for a period of time determined by the administrator in its sole discretion and the option or stock appreciation right will terminate upon the expiration of such period. With respect to awards granted to an outside director, in the event of a change in control, all of his, her, or their options and stock appreciation rights, if any, will vest fully and become immediately exercisable, all restrictions on his, her, or their restricted stock and RSUs will lapse, and all performance goals or other vesting requirements for his or her performance awards will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels, and all other terms and conditions met. Clawback. Awards will be subject to any clawback policy that we are required to adopt pursuant to the listing standards of any national securities exchange or association on which our stock is listed or as otherwise required by applicable laws, and the administrator will also be able to specify in an award agreement that the participants rights, payments, and/or benefits with respect to an award will be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, and/or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events. Amendment; termination. The administrator will have the authority to amend, alter, suspend, or terminate our 2021 Plan, provided we will obtain stockholder approval of any amendment to the extent necessary or desirable to comply with applicable laws. However, no amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of our 2021 Plan or an Award under it may, taken as a whole, materially impair the existing rights of any participant without the participants consent. Our 2021 Plan will continue in effect until it is terminated, provided that incentive stock options may not be granted after the ten year anniversary of the date our board of directors approved our 2021 129 Plan, and the automatic annual share increase will end on the ten year anniversary of the date our board of directors approved our 2021 Plan. 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Prior to the effectiveness of this offering, we expect that our board of directors will adopt, and our stockholders will approve our 2021 ESPP. We expect that our 2021 ESPP will be effective on the business day immediately prior to the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. However, no offering period or purchase period under our 2021 ESPP will begin unless and until otherwise determined by our board of directors. Authorized shares. A total of 2,800,000 shares of our common stock will be available for sale under our 2021 ESPP. The number of shares of our common stock that will be available for sale under our 2021 ESPP also includes an annual increase on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with the 2023 fiscal year, equal to the least of: ||| | one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year; ||| | three (3) times the initial number of shares reserved under the 2021 ESPP as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence; or ||| | a lesser amount as the administrator may determine. ESPP administration. We expect that the compensation committee of our board of directors will administer our 2021 ESPP and will have full and exclusive discretionary authority to construe, interpret, and apply the terms of our 2021 ESPP, delegate ministerial duties to any of our employees, designate separate offerings under our 2021 ESPP, designate our subsidiaries and affiliates as participating in our 2021 ESPP, determine eligibility, adjudicate all disputed claims filed under our 2021 ESPP, and establish procedures that it deems necessary for the administration of our 2021 ESPP, including, but not limited to, adopting such procedures and sub-plans as are necessary or appropriate to permit participation in our 2021 ESPP by employees who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States. The administrators findings, decisions and determinations are final and binding on all participants to the full extent permitted by law. Eligibility. Generally, all of our employees will be eligible to participate if they are customarily employed by us, or any participating subsidiary or affiliate, for at least 20 hours per week and more than five months in any calendar year. The administrator, in its discretion, may, prior to an enrollment date, for all options to be granted on such enrollment date in an offering, determine that an employee who (1) has not completed at least two years of service (or a lesser period of time determined by the administrator) since his, her, or their last hire date, (2) customarily works not more than 20 hours per week (or a lesser period of time determined by the administrator), (3) customarily works not more than five months per calendar year (or a lesser period of time determined by the administrator), (4) is a highly compensated employee within the meaning of Section 414(q) of the Code, or (5) is a highly compensated employee within the meaning of Section 414(q) of the Code with compensation above a certain level or is an officer or subject to disclosure requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, is or is not eligible to participate in such offering period. However, an employee may not be granted rights to purchase shares of our common stock under our 2021 ESPP if such employee: ||| | immediately after the grant would own capital stock and/or hold outstanding options to purchase such stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of capital stock of ours or of any parent or subsidiary of ours; or ||| | holds rights to purchase shares of our common stock under all employee stock purchase plans of ours or any parent or subsidiary of ours that accrue at a rate that exceeds $25,000 worth of shares of our common stock for each calendar year in which such rights are outstanding at any time. 130 Offering periods. Our 2021 ESPP will include a component that allows us to make offerings intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Code and a component that allows us to make offerings not intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Code to designated companies, as described in our 2021 ESPP. Our 2021 ESPP will provide for overlapping 24-month offering periods generally comprised of four 6-month purchase periods. The offering periods will be scheduled to start on the first trading day on or after May 20 and November 20 of each year, except the first offering period will commence on the first trading day on or after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and will end on the first trading day on or before November 20, 2023, and the second offering period will commence on the first trading day on or after May 20, 2022. Contributions. Our 2021 ESPP will permit participants to purchase shares of our common stock through contributions (in the form of payroll deductions or otherwise to the extent permitted by the administrator) of up to fifteen percent (15%) of their eligible compensation. A participant may purchase a maximum of 5,000 shares of our common stock during a purchase period. Exercise of purchase right. If our board of directors authorizes an offering and purchase period under our 2021 ESPP, amounts contributed and accumulated by the participant during any offering period will be used to purchase shares of our common stock at the end of each purchase period. The purchase price of the shares will be eighty five percent (85%) of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock on the first trading day of the offering period or on the exercise date. Participants may end their participation at any time during an offering period and will be paid their accrued contributions that have not yet been used to purchase shares of our common stock. Participation ends automatically upon termination of employment with us. Non-transferability. A participant may not transfer rights granted under our 2021 ESPP (other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution, or as otherwise provided under our 2021 ESPP). Merger or change in control. Our 2021 ESPP will provide that in the event of a merger or change in control, as defined under our 2021 ESPP, a successor corporation may assume or substitute each outstanding purchase right. If the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the outstanding purchase right, the offering period then in progress will be shortened, and a new exercise date will be set that will be before the date of the proposed merger or change in control. The administrator will notify each participant that the exercise date has been changed and that the participants option will be exercised automatically on the new exercise date unless prior to such date the participant has withdrawn from the offering period. Amendment; termination. The board will have the authority to suspend or terminate our 2021 ESPP and the administrator will have the authority to amend our 2021 ESPP, except that, subject to certain exceptions described in our 2021 ESPP, no such action may adversely affect any outstanding rights to purchase shares of our common stock under our 2021 ESPP. Our 2021 ESPP automatically will terminate in 2041, unless we terminate it sooner. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan Our 2010 Plan allows us to provide incentive stock options, within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock units (each, an award, and the recipient of such award, a participant) to eligible employees, directors and consultants, including employees and consultants of any of our parent or subsidiary companies. It is expected that as of one business day prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, our 2010 Plan will terminate and we will not grant any additional awards under our 2010 Plan thereafter. However, our 2010 Plan will continue to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards previously granted under our 2010 Plan. As of June 30, 2021, stock options covering 20,173,022 shares of our common stock, and 103,663 stock appreciation rights were outstanding under our 2010 Plan. There were no restricted stock awards or restricted stock units outstanding under our 2010 Plan. 131 Plan administration. Our board of directors or a committee thereof appointed by our board of directors administers our 2010 Plan. Different committees may administer our 2010 Plan with respect to different service providers. The administrator has all authority and discretion necessary or appropriate to administer our 2010 Plan and to control its operation, including the authority to construe and interpret the terms of our 2010 Plan and the awards granted under our 2010 Plan. The administrators decisions are final and binding on all participants and any other persons holding awards. The administrators powers include the power to institute an exchange program (without stockholder approval) under which (1) outstanding awards are surrendered or cancelled in exchange for awards of the same type (which may have higher or lower exercise prices and different terms), awards of a different type and/or cash, (2) participants would have the opportunity to transfer any outstanding awards to a financial institution or other person or entity selected by the administrator, and/or (3) the exercise price of an outstanding award is increased or reduced. The administrators powers also include the power to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to our 2010 Plan, to modify or amend each award and to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering our 2010 Plan. Eligibility. Employees, directors, and consultants, including employees and consultants of any of our parent or subsidiary companies, are eligible to receive awards. Only our employees or employees of our parent or subsidiary companies are eligible to receive incentive stock options. Stock options. Stock options have been granted under our 2010 Plan. Subject to the provisions of our 2010 Plan, the administrator determines the term of an option, the number of shares subject to an option, and the time period in which an option may be exercised. The term of an option is stated in the applicable award agreement, but the term of an option may not exceed 10 years from the grant date. The administrator determines the exercise price of options, which generally may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date, except as provided for in our 2010 Plan. However, an incentive stock option granted to an individual who directly or by attribution owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all of our classes of stock or of any our parent or subsidiary companies will have a term of no longer than five years from the grant date and will have an exercise price of at least 110% of the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. In addition, to the extent that the aggregate fair market value of the shares with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time by an employee during any calendar year (under all plans of ours and any of our parent or subsidiary companies) exceeds $100,000, such options will be treated as nonstatutory stock options. The administrator determines how a participant may pay the exercise price of an option, and the permissible methods are generally set forth in the applicable award agreement. If a participants status as a service provider (as defined in our 2010 Plan) terminates, that participant may exercise the vested portion of his, her, or their option for the period of time stated in the applicable award agreement. If a participant does not exercise his, her, or their option within the time specified in the award agreement, the option will terminate. Except as described above, the administrator has the discretion to determine the post-termination exercisability periods for an option. Non-transferability of awards. Unless determined otherwise by the administrator, awards may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. In addition, during an applicable participants lifetime, only that participant may exercise their award. Certain adjustments. If there is a dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, exchange of shares or our other securities, or other change in our corporate structure affecting the shares, the administrator will make proportionate adjustments to the number and class of shares that may be delivered under our 2010 Plan or the number, class, and price of 132 shares covered by each outstanding award. The administrators determination regarding such adjustments will be final, binding and conclusive. Dissolution or liquidation. In the event of our proposed dissolution or liquidation, the administrator will notify each participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action. Merger and change in control. In the event of our merger with or into another corporation or entity or a change in control (as defined in our 2010 Plan), each outstanding award will be treated as the administrator determines without a participants consent, including, without limitation, that (1) awards will be assumed, or substantially equivalent awards will be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof) with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and prices; (2) upon written notice to a participant, the participants awards will terminate upon or immediately prior to the consummation of such merger or change in control; (3) outstanding awards will vest and become exercisable, realizable or payable, or restrictions applicable to an award will lapse, in whole or in part, prior to or upon consummation of such merger or change in control, and, to the extent the administrator determines, terminate upon or immediately prior to the effectiveness of such merger or change in control; (4) (a) the termination of an award in exchange for an amount of cash or property, if any, equal to the amount that would have been attained upon the exercise of such award or realization of the participants rights as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction the administrator determines in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise of such award or realization of the participants rights, then such award may be terminated by us without payment) or (b) the replacement of such award with other rights or property selected by the administrator in its sole discretion; or (5) any combination of the foregoing. The administrator will not be obligated to treat all awards, all awards a participant holds, or all awards of the same type, similarly. Amendment and termination. Our board of directors may, at any time, amend, alter, suspend, or terminate our 2010 Plan in any respect. To the extent necessary and desirable to comply with applicable laws, we will obtain stockholder approval of any amendment to our 2010 Plan. No amendment, alteration, suspension, or termination of our 2010 Plan will impair the rights of a participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the participant and the administrator in writing. As noted above, it is expected that as of one business day prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, our 2010 Plan will be terminated, and we will not grant any additional awards under our 2010 Plan thereafter. Employee Incentive Compensation Plan We expect our board of directors to approve our Employee Incentive Compensation Plan, or our Master Bonus Plan, which will become effective on the date it is approved. Our board of directors or a committee appointed by our board of directors will administer the Master Bonus Plan, provided that unless and until our board of directors determines otherwise, our compensation committee will administer the Master Bonus Plan. The Master Bonus Plan allows the administrator to provide awards to employees selected for participation, who may include our named executive officers, which awards may be based upon performance goals established by the administrator. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may establish a target award for each participant under the Master Bonus Plan, which may be expressed as a percentage of the participants average annual base salary for the applicable performance period, a fixed dollar amount, or such other amount or based on such other formula as the administrator determines to be appropriate. Under the Master Bonus Plan, the administrator determines the performance goals, if any, applicable to any target award (or portion thereof) for a performance period, which may include, without limitation, goals related to: bookings; capital raising; cash flow; cash position; contract awards or backlog; corporate transactions; customer penetration; customer net dollar retention or any other measure of customer retention; earnings (which may include any calculation 133 of earnings including but not limited to earnings before interest and taxes, earnings before taxes, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization); earnings per share; expenses; expense reduction; financial milestones; gross margin; gross margin expansion; growth in stockholder value relative to an index; internal rate of return; leadership development or succession planning; logo retention; market share; net income; net profit; net sales; new product or business development; new product invention or innovation; number of enterprise or subscription customers; number of monthly average buyers; operating cash flow; operating expenses; operating income; operating margin; or other return on equity; revenue growth; sales results; sales growth; savings; segment performance (including, but not limited to, revenue and gross profit); stock price; time to market; total stockholder return; working capital; unadjusted or adjusted actual contract value; unadjusted or adjusted total contract value; and individual objectives such as peer reviews or other subjective or objective criteria. As determined by the administrator, the performance goals may be based on GAAP or non-GAAP results and any actual results may be adjusted by the administrator for one-time items or unbudgeted or unexpected items and/or payments of awards under the Master Bonus Plan when determining whether the performance goals have been met. The performance goals may be based on any factors the administrator determines relevant, including without limitation on an individual, divisional, portfolio, project, business unit, segment, or company-wide basis. Any criteria used may be measured on such basis as the administrator determines, including without limitation: (a) in absolute terms, (b) in combination with another performance goal or goals (for example, but not by way of limitation, as a ratio or matrix), (c) in relative terms (including, but not limited to, results for other periods, passage of time, and/or against another company or companies or an index or indices), (d) on a per-share basis, (e) against our performance as a whole or a segment, and/or (f) on a pre-tax or after-tax basis. The performance goals may differ from participant to participant and from award to award. Failure to meet the applicable performance goals will result in a failure to earn the target award, subject to the administrators discretion to modify an award. The administrator also may determine that a target award (or portion thereof) will not have a performance goal associated with it but instead will be granted (if at all) as determined by the administrator. The administrator may, in its sole discretion and at any time, increase, reduce, or eliminate a participants actual award, and/or increase, reduce or eliminate the amount allocated to the bonus pool for a particular performance period. The actual award may be below, at or above a participants target award, at the administrators discretion. The administrator may determine the amount of any increase, reduction, or elimination on the basis of such factors as it deems relevant, and it is not required to establish any allocation or weighting with respect to the factors it considers. Actual awards under the Master Bonus Plan generally will be paid in cash (or its equivalent) in a single lump sum only after they are earned and approved by the administrator, provided that the administrator reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to settle an actual award with a grant of an equity award with such terms and conditions, including vesting requirements, as determined by the administrator in its sole discretion. Unless otherwise determined by the administrator, to earn an actual award, a participant must be employed by us (or an affiliate of us, as applicable) through the date the bonus is paid. Payment of bonuses occurs as soon as administratively practicable after the end of the applicable performance period, but in no case after the later of (i) the 15th day of the third month of the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year in which the bonuses vest and (ii) March 15 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the bonuses vest. Awards under our Master Bonus Plan will be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment in accordance with any clawback policy that we adopt pursuant to the listing standards of any national securities exchange or association on which our securities are listed or as is otherwise required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or other applicable laws. In addition, the administrator may impose such other clawback, recovery, or recoupment provisions with respect to an award under the Master Bonus Plan as the administrator determines necessary or appropriate, including without limitation a reacquisition right in respect of previously acquired cash, stock, or other property provided with respect to an award. The administrator will have the authority to amend or terminate the Master Bonus Plan. However, such action may not materially alter or materially impair the existing rights of any participant with respect to any earned bonus 134 without the participants consent. The Master Bonus Plan will remain in effect until terminated in accordance with the terms of the Master Bonus Plan. 401(k) plan We maintain a 401(k) retirement savings plan for the benefit of our employees, including our named executive officers who remain employed with us, and who satisfy certain eligibility requirements. Under the 401(k) plan, eligible employees may elect to defer a portion of their compensation, within the limits prescribed by the Code, on a pre-tax or after-tax (Roth) basis, through contributions to the 401(k) plan. The 401(k) plan authorizes employer safe harbor contributions. The 401(k) plan is intended to qualify under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code. As a tax-qualified retirement plan, pre-tax contributions to the 401(k) plan and earnings on those pre-tax contributions are not taxable to the employees until distributed from the 401(k) plan, and earnings on Roth contributions are not taxable when distributed from the 401(k) plan. We match 25% of an employees contribution up to 6% of the employees compensation, with a cap of $500 annually, subject to a two-year graded vesting schedule that vests 50% after an employees first year of employment and 100% after two years of employment. Limitation of liability and indemnification Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, each to be effective upon the completion of this offering, will provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, and may indemnify our employees and other agents, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law prohibits our amended and restated certificate of incorporation from limiting the liability of our directors for the following: ||| | any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to us or to our stockholders; ||| | acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; ||| | unlawful payment of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; and ||| | any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If Delaware law is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of a director, then the liability of our directors will be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, as so amended. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not eliminate a directors duty of care and, in appropriate circumstances, equitable remedies, such as injunctive or other forms of non-monetary relief, remain available under Delaware law. This provision also does not affect a directors responsibilities under any other laws, such as the federal securities laws or other state or federal laws. Under our amended and restated bylaws, we will also be empowered to purchase insurance on behalf of any person whom we are required or permitted to indemnify. In addition to the indemnification required in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, we intend to enter into an indemnification agreement with each member of our board of directors and each of our officers prior to the completion of the offering. These agreements provide for the indemnification of our directors and officers for certain expenses and liabilities incurred in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or alternative dispute resolution mechanism or hearing, inquiry or investigation that may lead to the foregoing, to which they are a party, or are threatened to be made a party, by reason of the fact that they are or were a director, officer, employee, agent, or fiduciary of our company, or any of our subsidiaries, by reason of any action or inaction by them while serving as an officer, director, agent, or fiduciary, or by reason of the fact that they were serving at our request as a director, officer, employee, agent, or fiduciary of another entity. In the case of an action or proceeding by or in the right of our company or any of our subsidiaries, no indemnification will be provided for any claim where a court determines that the indemnified party is prohibited from receiving indemnification. We believe that these charter and bylaw provisions and indemnification agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers. 135 The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duties. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and our stockholders. Moreover, a stockholders investment may be harmed to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. There is no pending litigation or proceeding naming any of our directors or officers as to which indemnification is being sought, nor are we aware of any pending or threatened litigation that may result in claims for indemnification by any director or officer. 136 [Certain relationships and related party transactions ] Other than compensation arrangements, including employment, termination of employment, and change in control arrangements, with our directors and executive officers, including those discussed in Management and Executive compensation and the registration rights described in Description of capital stockRegistration rights, the following is a description of each transaction since January 1, 2018 and each currently proposed transaction in which: ||| | we have been or are to be a participant; ||| | the amount involved exceeded or exceeds $120,000; and ||| | any of our directors, executive officers or holders of more than 5% of our outstanding capital stock, or any immediate family member of, or person sharing the household with, any of these individuals or entities, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Investors rights agreement We are party to an investors rights agreement, as amended, with certain holders of our capital stock, including Stripes III, LP, or Stripes; Norwest Venture Partners XII, LP, or Norwest; entities affiliated with Insight Venture Partners, or Insight; entities affiliated with MHS Capital, or MHS; entities affiliated with MIH Edtech Investments B.V., or Naspers; and Eren Bali, a member of our board of directors and one of our co-founders. See Description of capital stockRegistration rights for additional information regarding these registration rights. Kenneth Fox, a member of our board of directors, is the founder and a managing partner of Stripes. Parker Barrile, a member of our board of directors, is a partner at Norwest. Jeffrey Lieberman, a member of our board of directors, is Managing Director at Insight. Lawrence Illg, a member of our board of directors, is Chief Executive Officer, Food and EdTech, of Prosus N.V., or Prosus, an affiliate of Naspers. Lydia Paterson, a member of our board of directors, is the Chief Financial Officer of OLX Global B.V., or OLX Group, an affiliate of Naspers. Right of first refusal Pursuant to our 2010 Plan and certain agreements with our stockholders, including a right of first refusal and co-sale agreement, as amended, with certain holders of our capital stock, including Stripes, Norwest, entities affiliated with Insight, entities affiliated with MHS, Naspers, and Eren Bali, we or our assignees have a right to purchase shares of our capital stock which stockholders propose to sell to other parties. This right will terminate upon the completion of this offering. Voting agreement We are party to a voting agreement, as amended, with certain holders of our capital stock, including Stripes, Norwest, entities affiliated with Insight, entities affiliated with MHS, Naspers, and Mr. Bali. The parties to the voting agreement have agreed, subject to certain conditions, to vote the shares of our capital stock held by them so as to elect the following individuals as directors: (1) two individuals designated by the holders of a majority of our Series B preferred stock (on an as-converted basis), currently Mr. Lieberman and Mx. Hiles, (2) one individual designated by Norwest, currently Mr. Barrile, (3) one individual designated by Stripes, currently Mr. Fox, (4) two individuals designated by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, currently Gregg Coccari and Mr. Bali, provided that one such designee shall always be our then-serving Chief Executive Officer, (5) one individual designated by Naspers, currently Mr. Illg, and (6) one individual designated by the majority of the other members of our board of directors, currently Ms. Paterson. Upon the consummation of this offering, the obligations of the parties to the voting agreement to vote their shares so as to elect these nominees, as well as the other rights and obligations under this agreement, will terminate and none of our stockholders will have any special rights regarding the nomination, election, or designation of members of our board of directors. Our existing certificate of incorporation contains provisions regarding election of members of the board of directors that correspond to the voting agreement; however, such provisions will be removed in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation that will be effective at the closing of this offering. 137 Indemnification agreements We have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers, in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws. The indemnification agreements and our amended restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws that will be in effect upon the closing of this offering require us to indemnify our directors, executive officers, and certain controlling persons to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. See Executive compensationLimitation of liability and indemnification for additional information. Tender offer In March 2020, we facilitated a third-party tender offer for the purchase of shares of our common stock from certain of our securityholders at a cash purchase price of $11.22 per share. Llibert Argerich and Cara Brennan Allamano, two of our executive officers, sold shares of our common stock in the tender offer. An aggregate of 891,265 shares of our common stock were tendered pursuant to the tender offer for an aggregate purchase price of $9.99 million. Other transactions We have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers. See Executive compensationEmployment arrangements with our named executive officers for a description of these agreements. We have granted stock options to our executive officers and certain of our non-employee directors. See Executive compensation and ManagementDirector compensation for a description of these grants. Ms. Paterson, a member of our board of directors, is Chief Financial Officer of OLX Group, an affiliate of Naspers, which is a customer of ours. Naspers is affiliated with OLX Group, where Ms. Paterson serves as Chief Financial Officer, and Prosus, where Mr. Illg serves as Chief Executive Officer, Food and EdTech. Naspers is a UB customer. During 2018, 2019, and 2020, we recorded approximately $0.5 million, $0.8 million, and $1.3 million, respectively, in revenue from subscription services provided to Naspers, representing less than 1% of our revenues for each such year, and during the six months ended June 30, 2021, we recorded approximately $0.6 million in revenue from services provided to Naspers, representing less than 1% of revenues for such period. We believe that Ms. Patersons and Mr. Illgs interests in these transactions are de minimis. Insight, where Mr. Lieberman is Managing Director, is affiliated with Sift Science. We have contracted with Sift Science for certain technology and software solutions since 2020. During 2020, we recorded approximately $0.3 million in general and administrative expenses for these solutions, representing less than 1% of our general and administrative expenses for the year, and during the six months ended June 30, 2021, we recorded approximately $0.2 million in general and administrative expenses for these solutions, representing less than 1% of our general and administrative expenses for such period. We believe that the interest of Mr. Lieberman in these transactions is de minimis. We did not contract with Sift Science during 2018 or 2019. From February 2019 to November 2019, we were party to an arrangement with the Stripes Group pursuant to which we received services from Jeff Pedersen, an Operating Partner of the Stripes Group, as our interim Chief Financial Officer. The Stripes Group is affiliated with Stripes. During 2019, we recorded $0.3 million in general and administrative expenses for these services, representing less than 1% of our general and administrative expenses for the year. No related services were provided in 2018 or 2020. Related party transaction policy Our audit committee will have the primary responsibility for reviewing and approving or disapproving related party transactions, which are transactions between us and related persons in which the aggregate amount involved 138 exceeds or may be expected to exceed $120,000 and in which a related person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. The charter of our audit committee will provide that our audit committee shall review and approve in advance any related party transaction. Prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we intend to adopt a formal written policy providing that we are not permitted to enter into any transaction that exceeds $120,000 and in which any related person has a direct or indirect material interest without the consent of our audit committee. In approving or rejecting any such transaction, our audit committee is to consider the relevant facts and circumstances available and deemed relevant to our audit committee, including whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related persons interest in the transaction. 139 The following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of June 30, 2021 by: ||| | each of our named executive officers; ||| | each of our directors; ||| | all of our current executive officers and directors as a group; and ||| | each person, or group of affiliated persons, who is known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our common stock. We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC, and thus it represents sole or shared voting or investment power with respect to our securities. Unless otherwise indicated below, to our knowledge, the persons and entities named in the table have sole voting and sole investment power with respect to all shares that they beneficially own, subject to community property laws where applicable. The information does not necessarily indicate beneficial ownership for any other purpose, including for purposes of Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Exchange Act. We have based our calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership prior to this offering on 122,927,466 shares of our common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2021, after giving effect to the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock into 85,403,933 shares of our common stock immediately prior to the completion of this offering. We have based our calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership after this offering on shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after the completion of this offering, assuming no exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. We have deemed shares of our common stock subject to stock options that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of June 30, 2021 to be outstanding and to be beneficially owned by the person holding the stock option for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of that person. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each beneficial owner listed in the table below is c/o Udemy, Inc., 600 Harrison Street, 3rd Floor, San Francisco, California 94107. | | | | | | | | Percentage of Shares Beneficially Owned |Name of Beneficial Owner||Number of Shares | Beneficially Owned | | | Before the | Offering | After the | Offering |Named Executive All current executive officers and directors as a group (14 persons)(9) |64,461,219||52.0| |5% Stockholders:| |Entities LP(13)||6,903,905||5.6| 140 |*|| | Represents beneficial ownership of less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of our common stock. |(1)|| | Consists of 477,230 shares subject to stock options exercisable within 60 days of June 30, 2021. |(2)|| | Consists of (i) 63,875 shares held of record by Mr. Argerich and (ii) 38,300 shares subject to stock options exercisable within 60 days of June 30, 2021. |(3)|| | Consists of 1,841,158 shares held of record by Mr. Bali. |(4)|| | Consists of shares held of record by Norwest Venture Partners XII, LP, identified in footnote 12 below. |(5)|| | Consists of shares held of record by Stripes III, LP, or Stripes, identified in footnote 13 below. |(6)|| | Consists of 25,000 shares subject to stock options exercisable within 60 days of June 30, 2021. |(7)|| | Consists of shares held of record by entities affiliated with Insight Venture Partners, identified in footnote 10 below. |(8)|| | Consists of 41,666 shares subject to stock options exercisable within 60 days of June 30, 2021. |(9)|| | Consists of (i) 63,313,830 shares beneficially owned by our executive officers and directors and (ii) 1,147,389 shares subject to stock options exercisable within 60 days of June 30, 2021. |(10)|| | Consists of (i) 1,088,764 shares held of record by Grace Software Cross Fund Holdings, LLC, or Grace, (ii) 11,778,259 shares held of record by Insight Venture Partners (Cayman) VII, L.P., or Insight Cayman, (iii) 1,692,351 shares held of record by Insight Venture Partners (Delaware) VII, L.P., or Insight Delaware, (iv) 619,269 shares held of record by Insight Venture Partners VII (Co-Investors), L.P., or Insight Co-Investors, and (v) 26,755,331 shares held of record by Insight Venture Partners VII, L.P., or Insight Venture.

Copies of these documents will be filed with the SEC as exhibits to our registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. The descriptions of the common stock and preferred stock reflect changes to our capital structure that will occur upon the completion of this offering. Immediately prior to the completion of this offering and the filing of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be effective upon completion of this offering, our authorized capital stock will consist of 950,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.00001 per share. Immediately prior to the completion of this offering, all the outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock will automatically convert into an aggregate of shares of our common stock. Based on 37,523,533 shares of common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2021, and after giving effect to the automatic conversion of all of our outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock into an aggregate of 85,403,933 shares of common stock immediately prior to the completion of this offering and the issuance of shares of common stock in this offering, there will be shares of common stock outstanding upon the completion of this offering. As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 471 stockholders of record. Common stock Voting rights Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, including the election of directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws to be in effect upon the completion of this offering do not provide for cumulative voting rights. Because of this, the holders of a plurality of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors can elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose. With respect to matters other than the election of directors, at any meeting of the stockholders at which a quorum is present or represented, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, except as otherwise required by law. The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of the stockholders. Dividends Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any then-outstanding preferred stock, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors out of legally available funds. Liquidation In the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, holders of our common stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities and the satisfaction of any liquidation preference granted to the holders of any then-outstanding shares of preferred stock. Rights and preferences Holders of our common stock have no preemptive, conversion, subscription, or other rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to our common stock. The rights, preferences, and privileges of 142 the holders of our common stock are subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of shares of any series of our preferred stock that we may designate in the future. Fully paid and nonassessable All of our outstanding shares of common stock are, and the shares of common stock to be issued in this offering, upon payment and delivery in accordance with the underwriting agreement, will be fully paid and nonassessable. Preferred stock Upon the completion of this offering, our board of directors will have the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. These rights, preferences and privileges could include dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights, liquidation preferences, sinking fund terms, and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of such series, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and the likelihood that such holders will receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in our control or other corporate action. Upon the completion of this offering, no shares of preferred stock will be outstanding, and we have no present plan to issue any shares of preferred stock. Options As of June 30, 2021, we had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 20,173,022 shares of our common stock, with a weighted-average exercise price of $7.39 per share, under our 2010 Plan. This excludes 103,663 stock appreciation rights outstanding as June 30, 2021 that will be settled in cash upon exercise. Registration rights After the completion of this offering, under our investors rights agreement, as amended, the holders of 109,132,406 shares of common stock or their transferees, will have the right to require us to register the offer and sale of their shares or to include their shares in any registration statement we file, in each case as described below. Demand registration rights After the completion of this offering, the holders of up to 109,132,406 shares of our common stock will be entitled to certain demand registration rights. At any time beginning after 180 days following the date of effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, the holders of at least 30% of the shares having registration rights can request that we file a registration statement to register the offer and sale of their shares. We are only obligated to effect up to two such registrations. Each such request for registration must cover securities the anticipated aggregate gross proceeds of which, before deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, is at least $10 million. These demand registration rights are subject to specified conditions and limitations, including the right of the underwriters to limit the number of shares included in any such registration under certain circumstances. If we determine that it would be materially detrimental to us and our stockholders to effect such a demand registration, we have the right to defer such registration, not more than once in any twelve-month period, for a period of up to 90 days. Form S-3 registration rights After the completion of this offering, the holders of up to 109,132,406 shares of our common stock will be entitled to certain Form S-3 registration rights. At any time after the completion of this offering when we are eligible to file a registration statement on Form S-3, the holders of the shares having these rights can request that we register the offer and sale of their shares of our common stock on a registration statement on Form S-3 so long as the request covers securities of which the anticipated aggregate public offering price is at least $1.0 million. These 143 stockholders may make an unlimited number of requests for registration on a registration statement on Form S-3. However, we will not be required to effect a registration on Form S-3 if we have effected two such registrations within the twelve-month period preceding the date of the request. These Form S-3 registration rights are subject to specified conditions and limitations, including the right of the underwriters to limit the number of shares included in any such registration under certain circumstances. Additionally, if we determine that it would be seriously detrimental to us and our stockholders to effect such a demand registration, we have the right to defer such registration, not more than once in any twelve-month period, for a period of up to 90 days. Piggyback registration rights After the completion of this offering, the holders of up to 109,132,406 shares of our common stock will be entitled to certain piggyback registration rights. If we propose to register the offer and sale of shares of our common stock under the Securities Act, the holders of these shares can request that we include their shares in such registration, subject to certain marketing and other limitations, including the right of the underwriters to limit the number of shares included in any such registration statement under certain circumstances. As a result, whenever we propose to file a registration statement under the Securities Act, other than with respect to (1) a registration related to any employee benefit plan or a corporate reorganization or other transaction covered by Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act, (2) a registration relating to the offer and sale of debt securities, (3) a registration on any registration form that does not permit secondary sales, or (4) a registration pursuant to the demand or Form S-3 registration rights described in the preceding two paragraphs above, the holders of these shares are entitled to notice of the registration and have the right, subject to certain limitations, to include their shares in the registration. Expenses of registration We will pay all expenses relating to any demand registrations, Form S-3 registrations, and piggyback registrations, subject to specified exceptions. Termination The registration rights terminate upon the earlier of (1) the closing of certain liquidation events or (2) the date that is five years after the closing of this offering. Anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and our amended and restated bylaws Certain provisions of Delaware law and certain provisions that will be included in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws summarized below may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, deter, or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider to be in its best interests, including attempts that might result in a premium being paid over the market price for the shares held by stockholders. Preferred stock Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will contain provisions that permit our board of directors to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, shares of preferred stock in one or more series and, with respect to each such series, to fix the number of shares constituting the series and the designation of the series, the voting rights (if any) of the shares of the series and the powers, preferences or relative, participation, optional and other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations, or restrictions, of the shares of such series. Classified board Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide for the division of our board of directors into three classes, designated Class I, Class II, and Class III. Each class will be an equal number of directors, as nearly as 144 possible, consisting of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire board of directors. The term of initial Class I directors shall terminate on the date of the 2022 annual meeting, the term of the initial Class II directors shall terminate on the date of the 2023 annual meeting, and the term of the initial Class III directors shall terminate on the date of the 2024 annual meeting. At each annual meeting of stockholders beginning in 2022, the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting will be subject to reelection for a three-year term. Removal of directors Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that stockholders may remove a director only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors. Director vacancies and newly created directorships Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that all vacancies and newly created directorships may only be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, except as otherwise required by law, our governing documents or resolution of our board of directors, and subject to the rights of holders of our preferred stock. No cumulative voting Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that stockholders do not have the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors. Special meetings of stockholders Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will provide that, except as otherwise required by law, special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by our board of directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by the majority of the entire board of directors, by the Chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer, or our President. Advance notice procedures for director nominations Our amended and restated bylaws will provide that stockholders seeking to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders must provide timely notice thereof in writing. To be timely, a stockholders notice generally will have to be delivered to and received by our corporate secretary at our principal executive offices before notice of the meeting is issued by our corporate secretary, with such notice being served not less than 90 nor more than 120 days before the meeting. Although the amended and restated bylaws will not give the board of directors the power to approve or disapprove stockholder nominations of candidates to be elected at an annual meeting, the amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed or may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company. Action by written consent Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will provide that any action to be taken by the stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by written consent. Exclusive jurisdiction Our amended and restated bylaws will provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, stockholders, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and our amended and restated bylaws or (4) any other action asserting a claim that is 145 governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware), except for, as to each of (1) through (4) above, any claim as to which such court determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of such court (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of such court within ten days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than such court or for which such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction. This provision would not apply to any action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act and inclusive of rules and regulations thereunder. Our amended and restated bylaws will also provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States will be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Although we believe these provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law for the specified types of actions and proceedings, the provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us or our directors and officers. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding or owning (or continuing to hold or own) any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing bylaw provisions. Stockholders will not be deemed to have waived compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder as a result of these exclusive forum provisions. Amending our certificate of incorporation and bylaws Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be amended or altered in any manner provided by the DGCL, except for any amendment or alteration relating to (1) the issuance of preferred stock, (2) the prohibition against cumulative voting, (3) the classification, election, resignation, and vacancies of directors, (4) annual or special meetings of the stockholders, and (5) the voting thresholds to amend or alter the certificate of incorporation, all which would require approval of a majority of our entire board and the affirmative vote of a two-thirds majority of our then outstanding common stock. Our amended and restated bylaws may be adopted, amended, altered, or repealed by stockholders only upon approval of at least a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of the common stock, except for any amendment or alteration of the provisions described above relating to (1) the classification, election, resignation, and vacancies of directors, (2) the indemnification of officers and directors, (3) forum selection, and (4) the voting thresholds to amend or alter the bylaws, all which would require the approval of a two-thirds majority of our then outstanding common stock. Additionally, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that our bylaws may be amended, altered, or repealed by the board of directors. Authorized but unissued shares Our authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock will be available for future issuances without stockholder approval, except as required by the listing standards of Nasdaq, and could be used for a variety of corporate purposes, including future offerings to raise additional capital, acquisitions, and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of our company by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger, or otherwise. Business combinations with interested stockholders We are governed by Section 203 of the DGCL. Subject to certain exceptions, Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a public Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination (as defined in such section) with an interested stockholder (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation or any person affiliated with such person) for a period of three years following the time that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless (1) prior to such time the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; (2) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder 146 becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced (excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock of such corporation outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) those shares owned (a) by persons who are directors and also officers of such corporation and (b) by employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer); or (3) at or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of stockholders (and not by written consent) by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder. Indemnification of directors and officers Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws will provide that we must indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL. We are expressly authorized to, and do, carry directors and officers insurance providing coverage for our directors, officers, and certain employees for some liabilities. We believe that these indemnification provisions and insurance policies are useful to attract and retain qualified directors and executive officers. The limitation on liability and indemnification provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. In addition, your investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions. Listing We have applied to list our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol UDMY. Transfer agent and registrar Upon completion of this offering, the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock will be American Stock Transfer & Trust Company. The transfer agent and registrars address is 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11219. 147 [Shares eligible for future sale ] Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock, and although we expect that our common stock will be approved for listing on Nasdaq, we cannot assure investors that there will be an active public market for our common stock following this offering. We cannot predict what effect, if any, sales of our shares in the public market or the availability of shares for sale will have on the market price of our common stock. Future sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding options, or the perception that such sales may occur, however, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and also could adversely affect our future ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or other equity-related securities of ours at times and prices we believe appropriate. Upon completion of this offering, based on our shares outstanding as of June 30, 2021 and after giving effect to the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, shares of our common stock will be outstanding, or shares of common stock if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full. All of the shares of common stock expected to be sold in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act unless held by our affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The remaining outstanding shares of our common stock will be deemed restricted securities as that term is defined under Rule 144. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if their offer and sale is registered under the Securities Act or if the offer and sale of those securities qualify for an exemption from registration, including exemptions provided by Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act, which are summarized below. As a result of the lock-up agreements and market stand-off provisions described below and the provisions of Rules 144 or 701, the shares of our common stock that will be deemed restricted securities will be available for sale in the public market following the completion of this offering as follows: ||| | no shares will be eligible for sale on the date of this prospectus; and ||| | shares will be eligible for sale upon expiration of the lock-up agreements and market stand-off provisions described below, following the date that is 180 days after the date of this prospectus. Lock-up agreements and market stand-off agreements Our officers, directors, and the holders of substantially all of our capital stock and options have entered into market stand-off agreements with us and have entered into or will enter into lock-up agreements with the underwriters, subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of their common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock during the period from the date of this prospectus continuing through the date 180 days after the date of this prospectus, except with the prior consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC. See Underwriters for additional information. Rule 144 Rule 144, as currently in effect, generally provides that, once we have been subject to the public company reporting requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act for at least 90 days, a stockholder who is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at any time during the preceding 90 days and who has beneficially owned the shares of our capital stock proposed to be sold for at least six months is entitled to sell such shares in reliance upon Rule 144 without complying with the volume limitation, manner of sale, or notice conditions of Rule 144. If such stockholder has beneficially owned the shares of our capital stock proposed to be sold for at least one year, then such person is entitled to sell such shares in reliance upon Rule 144 without complying with any of the other conditions of Rule 144. 148 Rule 144 also provides that a stockholder who is deemed to have been one of our affiliates at any time during the preceding 90 days and who has beneficially owned the shares of our common stock proposed to be sold for at least six months is entitled to sell such shares in reliance upon Rule 144 within any three-month period beginning 90 days after the date of this prospectus a number of such shares that does not exceed the greater of the following: ||| | 1% of the number of shares of our capital stock then outstanding, which will equal shares immediately after the completion of this offering, assuming no exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares; or ||| | the average weekly trading volume of our common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to such sale. Sales of our capital stock made in reliance upon Rule 144 by a stockholder who is deemed to have been one of our affiliates at any time during the preceding 90 days are also subject to the current public information, manner of sale, and notice conditions of Rule 144. Rule 701 Rule 701 generally provides that, once we have been subject to the public company reporting requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act for at least 90 days, a stockholder who purchased shares of our common stock pursuant to a written compensatory benefit plan or contract and who is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at any time during the preceding 90 days may sell such shares in reliance upon Rule 144 without complying with the current public information or holding period conditions of Rule 144. Rule 701 also provides that a stockholder who purchased shares of our common stock pursuant to a written compensatory benefit plan or contract and who is deemed to have been one of our affiliates during the preceding 90 days may sell such shares under Rule 144 without complying with the holding period condition of Rule 144.

This summary is based upon the provisions of the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative rulings, and judicial decisions, all as of the date hereof. These authorities may be changed, possibly retroactively, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those set forth below. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with such statements and conclusions. This summary also does not address the tax considerations arising under the laws of any non-U.S., state or local jurisdiction, under U.S. federal gift and estate tax rules or under any applicable tax treaty. In addition, this discussion does not address tax considerations applicable to an investors particular circumstances or to investors that may be subject to special tax rules, including, without limitation: ||| | banks, insurance companies, or other financial institutions; ||| | persons subject to the alternative minimum tax or the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income; ||| | tax-exempt accounts, organizations, or governmental organizations; ||| | pension plans and tax-qualified retirement plans; ||| | controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; ||| | brokers or dealers in securities or currencies; ||| | traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings; ||| | persons that own, or are deemed to own, more than 5% of our common stock (except to the extent specifically set forth below); ||| | certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States; ||| | partnerships (or entities or arrangements classified as such for U.S. federal income tax purposes), other pass-through entities, and investors therein; ||| | persons who hold our common stock as a position in a hedging transaction, straddle, conversion transaction, or other risk reduction transaction; ||| | persons who hold or receive our common stock pursuant to the exercise of any option or otherwise as compensation; ||| | persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to our common stock being taken into account in an applicable financial statement as defined in Section 451(b) of the Code; ||| | persons who do not hold our common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment); or ||| | persons deemed to sell our common stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code. In addition, if a partnership (or other entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) or other flow-through entity holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership or owner of other such entity generally will depend on the status of the partner or owner and upon the activities of the partnership or other such entity. A partner in a partnership, or owner of other such entity, that will hold our 150 common stock should consult his, her, their, or its own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our common stock through the partnership or other such entity, as applicable. You are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to your particular situation, as well as any tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, and disposition of our common stock arising under the U.S. federal gift or estate tax rules or under the laws of any state, local, non-U.S., or other taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty. Non-U.S. holder defined For purposes of this discussion, you are a non-U.S. holder if you are a beneficial owner of our common stock that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is not a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership and the equity holders therein) or: ||| | an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; ||| | a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof, or otherwise treated as such for U.S. federal income tax purposes; ||| | an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or ||| | a trust (1) whose administration is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and that has one or more U.S. persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) that has made a valid election under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person within the meaning of the Code. Distributions As described in Dividend policy, we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends following the completion of this offering. However, if we do make distributions on our common stock, those payments will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. To the extent those distributions exceed both our current and our accumulated earnings and profits, the excess will constitute a return of capital and will first reduce your basis in our common stock (determined separately with respect to each share of our common stock), but not below zero, and then will be treated as gain from the sale of stock as described below in Gain on disposition of common stock. Subject to the discussions below on effectively connected income and in Backup withholding and information reporting and Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), any dividend paid to you generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax either at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the dividend or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty between the United States and your country of residence. Under applicable Treasury Regulations, the applicable withholding agent may withhold up to 30% of the gross amount of the entire distribution even if the amount constituting a dividend, as described above, is less than the gross amount. In order to receive a reduced treaty rate, you must provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E or other appropriate version of IRS Form W-8 certifying qualification for the reduced rate. If you hold our common stock through a financial institution or other agent acting on your behalf, you generally will be required to provide appropriate documentation to the agent, which then may be required to provide certification to us or our paying agent, either directly or through other intermediaries. If you are eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal withholding tax pursuant to an income tax treaty, you may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. You should consult your tax advisor regarding your entitlement to benefits under any applicable tax treaty. Dividends received by you that are treated as effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base 151 maintained by you in the United States) are generally exempt from the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, subject to the discussions below in Backup withholding and information reporting and Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). In order to obtain this exemption, you must provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI or other applicable IRS Form W-8 properly certifying such exemption. Such effectively connected dividends, although not subject to U.S. federal withholding tax, are taxed at the same rates applicable to U.S. persons, net of certain deductions and credits and subject to an applicable income tax treaty providing otherwise. In addition, if you are a corporate non-U.S. holder, dividends you receive that are effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by you in the United States) may also be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty between the United States and your country of residence. You should consult your tax advisor regarding any applicable tax treaties that may provide for different rules. Gain on disposition of common stock Subject to the discussions in Backup withholding and information reporting and Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), you generally will not be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other disposition of our common stock unless: ||| | the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by you in the United States); ||| | you are an individual who is present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the calendar year in which the sale or disposition occurs and certain other conditions are met; or ||| | our common stock constitutes a United States real property interest by reason of our status as a United States real property holding corporation, or USRPHC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding your disposition of our common stock or your holding period for our common stock, or the applicable testing period. If you are a non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet above, you will be required to pay tax on the gain derived from the sale or other disposition of our common stock (net of certain deductions and credits) under regular U.S. federal income tax rates, and a corporate non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet above also may be subject to the branch profits tax at a 30% rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. If you are an individual non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet above, you will be subject to tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on the gain derived from the sale or other disposition of our common stock, which gain may be offset by U.S. source capital losses for the year, provided you have timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses. You should consult your tax advisor regarding any applicable income tax or other treaties that may provide for different rules. We believe that we are not currently and will not become a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the remainder of this discussion so assumes. However, because the determination of whether we are a USRPHC depends on the fair market value of our U.S. real property interests relative to the fair market value of our U.S. and worldwide real property interests plus our other business assets, there can be no assurance that we will not become a USRPHC in the future. However, even if we are or become a USRPHC, our common stock will not constitute a United States real property interest if our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market and you hold no more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, directly, indirectly or constructively, at all times during the applicable testing period. If we are a USRPHC at any time within the applicable testing period and either our common stock is not regularly traded on an established securities market or you hold more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, directly, indirectly or constructively, at any time during the applicable testing period, you will generally be taxed on any gain realized upon the sale or other disposition of our common stock in the same manner as gain that is effectively connected with the conduct of a 152 U.S. trade or business, except that the branch profits tax generally will not apply. If we are a USRPHC at any time within the applicable testing period and our common stock is not regularly traded on an established securities market, your proceeds received on the disposition of shares will also generally be subject to withholding at a rate of 15%. You are encouraged to consult your own tax advisors regarding the possible consequences to you if we are, or were to become, a URSPHC. Backup withholding and information reporting Generally, we or the applicable agent must report annually to the IRS the amount of dividends paid to you, your name and address, and the amount of tax withheld, if any. A similar report will be sent to you. Pursuant to applicable income tax treaties or other agreements, the IRS may make these reports available to tax authorities in your country of residence. Payments of dividends on or of proceeds from the disposition of our common stock made to you may also be subject to backup withholding at a current rate of 24% and additional information reporting unless you establish an exemption, for example, by properly certifying your non-U.S. status on a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E or another appropriate version of IRS Form W-8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, backup withholding and information reporting may apply if the applicable withholding agent has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that you are a U.S. person. Backup withholding is not an additional tax; rather, the U.S. federal income tax liability of persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund or credit may generally be obtained from the IRS, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) Subject to the following paragraph, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, Treasury Regulations issued thereunder and official IRS guidance with respect thereto, or, collectively, FATCA, generally impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on dividends on and the gross proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our common stock paid to a foreign financial institution (as specially defined under these rules), unless otherwise provided by the Treasury Secretary or such institution (i) enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to, among other things, withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or (ii) otherwise establishes an exemption. Subject to the following paragraph, FATCA also generally imposes a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on dividends on and the gross proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our common stock paid to a non-financial foreign entity (as specially defined under these rules), unless otherwise provided by the Treasury Secretary or such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the substantial direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity, certifies that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or otherwise establishes an exemption. The withholding tax will apply regardless of whether the payment otherwise would be exempt from U.S. nonresident and backup withholding tax, including under the other exemptions described above. Under certain circumstances, a non-U.S. holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify the requirements described in this section. Prospective investors should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the application of FATCA withholding to their investment in, and ownership and disposition of, our common stock. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued proposed Treasury Regulations that, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate withholding under FATCA with respect to payments of gross proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our common stock. In the preamble to such proposed Treasury Regulations, the Treasury Secretary stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed Treasury Regulations until final regulations are issued. 153 The preceding discussion of U.S. federal tax considerations is for general information only. It is not tax advice to investors in their particular circumstances. Each prospective investor should consult its own tax advisor regarding the particular U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. tax considerations of purchasing, holding and disposing of our common stock, including the consequences of any proposed change in applicable laws. 154 Under the terms and subject to the conditions in an underwriting agreement dated the date of this prospectus, the underwriters named below, for whom Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are acting as representatives, have severally agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to sell to them, severally, the number of shares indicated below: |Name||Number | of shares |Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC| |J.P. Morgan Securities LLC| |Citigroup |William Company, L.L.C.| W. Baird & Co. Incorporated| |Needham & Company, LLC| | | | | |Total| | | | | The underwriters are offering the shares of common stock subject to their acceptance of the shares from us and subject to prior sale. The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the several underwriters to pay for and accept delivery of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus are subject to the approval of certain legal matters by their counsel and to certain other conditions. The underwriters are obligated to take and pay for all of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus if any such shares are taken. However, the underwriters are not required to take or pay for the shares covered by the underwriters option to purchase additional shares described below. The underwriters initially propose to offer part of the shares of common stock directly to the public at the offering price listed on the cover page of this prospectus and part to certain dealers at the public offering price less a concession not to exceed $ per share. After the initial offering of the shares of common stock, the offering price and other selling terms may from time to time be varied by the representatives. The offering of the shares by the underwriters is subject to the receipt and acceptance and subject to the underwriters right to reject any order in whole or in part. We have granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to additional shares of common stock at the public offering price listed on the cover page of this prospectus, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The underwriters may exercise this option solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments, if any, made in connection with the offering of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus. To the extent the option is exercised, each underwriter will become obligated, subject to certain conditions, to purchase about the same percentage of the additional shares of common stock as the number listed next to the underwriters name in the preceding table bears to the total number of shares of common stock listed next to the names of all underwriters in the preceding table. 155 The following table shows the per share and total public offering price, underwriting discounts and commissions, and proceeds before expenses to us. These amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters option to purchase up to an additional shares of common stock. | | Without exercise of option to purchase additional shares | | With exercise of full option to purchase additional shares | | | | | | | | |Per share||$||$| |Total||$||$| The estimated offering expenses payable by us, exclusive of the underwriting discounts and commissions, are approximately $ . We have agreed to reimburse the underwriters for expenses relating to clearance of this offering with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. up to $ . The underwriters have informed us that they do not intend sales to discretionary accounts to exceed 5% of the total number of shares of common stock offered by them. We have applied to list our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol UDMY. In connection with this offering, we and all directors and officers and the holders of all of our outstanding equity securities have agreed that, without the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC on behalf of the underwriters, we and they will not, and will not publicly disclose an intention to, during the period ending 180 days after the date of this prospectus, or the restricted period: ||| | offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, make any short sale, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of common stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable (directly or indirectly) for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of common stock, which we refer to as other securities; ||| | file any registration statement with the SEC relating to the offering of any shares of common stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock; or ||| | enter into any swap, hedging transaction or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the common stock, whether any such transaction described above is to be settled by delivery of common stock or other securities, in cash or otherwise. In addition, we and each such person agrees that, without the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC on behalf of the underwriters, we or such other person will not, during the restricted period, make any demand for, or exercise any right with respect to, the registration of any shares of common stock or any other security. Each such person also agrees that the foregoing precludes such person from engaging in any hedging or other transaction designed or intended, or which could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in, a sale or disposition of any shares of common stock or other securities, even if any such sale or disposition transaction or transactions would be made or executed by or on behalf of someone other than such person. The restrictions described in the immediately preceding paragraph do not apply to transfers in the following transactions: ||| | the sale of shares to the underwriters; or ||| | transactions relating to shares of common stock or other securities acquired from the underwriters in this offering or in open market transactions after the completion of this offering, provided that no filing under the Exchange Act shall be required or shall be voluntarily made during the restricted period in connection with subsequent sales of common stock or other securities acquired in such transactions; or 156 ||| | transfers of shares of common stock or other securities (i) as a bona fide gift, (ii) for bona fide estate planning purposes, (iii) upon death or by will, testamentary document or intestate succession, (iv) to an immediate family member of the undersigned or to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the undersigned or the immediate family of the undersigned (for purposes of this paragraph, immediate family shall mean any spouse or domestic partner and relationship by blood, current or former marriage or adoption, not more remote than first cousin), (v) if the undersigned is a trust, to any beneficiary of the undersigned or the estate of any such beneficiary, (vi) to a partnership, limited liability company or other entity of which the undersigned and the immediate family of the undersigned are the legal and beneficial owner of all of the outstanding equity securities or similar interests, or (vii) to a nominee or custodian of a person or entity to whom a disposition or transfer would be permissible under clauses (b)(i) through (vi) above, provided that in the case of any transfer or disposition pursuant to this clause (b), each transferee or donee shall sign and deliver a lock-up agreement to the underwriters and no filing under the Exchange Act, reporting a reduction in beneficial ownership of shares of common stock, shall be required or shall be voluntarily made during the restricted period (other than a filing on a Form 5); or ||| | distributions of shares of common stock or other securities without consideration to stockholders, current or former partners (general or limited), members, beneficiaries or other equity holders, or to the estates of any such stockholders, partners, beneficiaries or other equity holders, provided that each distributee shall sign and deliver a lock-up agreement to the underwriters and no filing under the Exchange Act, reporting a reduction in beneficial ownership of shares of common stock, shall be required or shall be voluntarily made during the restricted period; or ||| | to another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, trust or other business entity that is an affiliate, or to any investment fund or other entity controlling, controlled by, managing or managed by or under common control with the transferor or affiliates of the transferor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where the transferor is a partnership, to its general partner or a successor partnership or fund, or any other funds managed by such partnership), provided that each affiliate entity shall sign and deliver a lock-up agreement to the underwriters and no filing under the Exchange Act, reporting a reduction in beneficial ownership of shares of common stock, shall be required or shall be voluntarily made during the restricted period; or ||| | the transfer of common stock or other securities that occurs by operation of law pursuant to a qualified domestic order in connection with a divorce settlement or other court order, provided that no public announcement or filing under the Exchange Act, or any other public filing or disclosure, shall be made during the restricted period, unless such filing is required and clearly indicates in the footnotes thereto that the transfer is by operation of law, court order, or in connection with a divorce settlement; or ||| | (i) the receipt from us of shares of common stock or other securities upon the exercise of options or settlement of restricted stock units or other equity awards, or (ii) the transfer of shares of common stock or any securities convertible into common stock to us upon a vesting or settlement event of our restricted stock units or upon the exercise of options to purchase our securities on a cashless or net exercise basis to the extent permitted by the instruments representing such securities, options, or restricted stock units so long as such cashless exercise or net exercise is effected solely by the surrender of outstanding securities, options, or restricted stock units to us and our cancellation of all or a portion thereof to pay the exercise price and/or withholding tax and remittance obligations; provided (x) the shares of common stock received upon exercise or settlement of the security, option, or restricted stock unit are subject to the terms of the lock-up agreement, and (y) that in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), any filing under the Exchange Act shall clearly indicate in the footnotes thereto that (A) the filing relates to the circumstances described in clauses (i) or (ii), as the case may be, (B) no shares were sold by the reporting person and (C) in the case of clause (i), the shares of common stock received upon exercise or settlement of the option or restricted stock unit are subject to a lock-up agreement with the underwriters; provided, further, that no such filing under the Exchange Act shall be made on a voluntary basis during the restricted period; or ||| | to us in connection with any contractual arrangement that provides for the repurchase of common stock or other securities by us upon death, disability or termination of service, in each case, of such service provider; 157 | | provided that no public announcement or filing under the Exchange Act, or any other public filing or disclosure, shall be made during the restricted period, unless such filing is required and clearly indicates in the footnotes thereto the nature and conditions of such transfer; or ||| | the conversion of our outstanding preferred stock into shares of common stock in connection with the consummation of this offering, provided that any such shares of common stock received upon such conversion shall be subject to the terms of the lock-up agreement with the underwriters summarized herein; or ||| | facilitating the establishment of a trading plan on behalf of any of our shareholders, officers or directors pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act for the transfer of shares of common stock, provided that (i) such plan does not provide for the transfer of common stock during the restricted period and (ii) to the extent a public announcement or filing under the Exchange Act, if any, is required of or voluntarily made by or on behalf of such shareholder, officer or director or us regarding the establishment of such plan, such announcement or filing shall include a statement to the effect that no transfer of common stock may be made under such plan during the restricted period; or ||| | the transfer of shares of common stock or other securities in connection with a bona fide third-party tender offer, merger, consolidation or other similar transaction, that is approved by our board of directors, made to all holders of common stock involving a Change of Control (as defined below), provided that in the event that the tender offer, merger, consolidation or other such transaction is not completed, the common stock or other securities shall remain subject to the restrictions contained in the lock-up agreement. For the purposes of this clause, Change of Control means the transfer (whether by tender offer, merger, consolidation or other similar transaction), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or group of affiliated persons (other than the underwriters pursuant to this offering), of shares of common stock or other securities if, after such transfer, our stockholders immediately prior to such transfer do not own at least fifty percent (50%) of our (or the surviving entitys) outstanding voting securities. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, in its sole discretion, may release the common stock and other securities subject to the lock-up agreements described above in whole or in part at any time. In addition, and notwithstanding the foregoing, if the individual signing the lock-up agreement is an employee of ours with a title below senior vice president, as determined by us as of the Early Release Date, or an Early Release Employee, then the restricted period shall expire with respect to a number of shares of common stock equal to 25% of the aggregate number of vested shares of common stock (including shares of common stock underlying vested or exercisable other securities) owned by (i) such Early Release Employee, (ii) any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of such Early Release Employee and/or (iii) an immediately family member of such Early Release Employee, in each case measured as of the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part (and excluding any unvested equity awards granted to such Early Release Employee on such date), on the 91st day after the date of this prospectus, or the Early Release Date. None of our directors or executive officers shall be deemed to be an Early Release Employee. In order to facilitate the offering of the common stock, the underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the common stock. Specifically, the underwriters may sell more shares than they are obligated to purchase under the underwriting agreement, creating a short position. A short sale is covered if the short position is no greater than the number of shares available for purchase by the underwriters under the option to purchase additional shares. The underwriters can close out a covered short sale by exercising the option to purchase additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to close out a covered short sale, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the open market price of shares compared to the price available under the option to purchase additional shares. The underwriters may also sell shares in excess of the option to purchase additional shares, creating a naked short position. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering. As an additional means of facilitating this offering, the underwriters may bid for, and purchase, shares of common stock in the open market to stabilize the price of the common stock. These activities may raise 158 or maintain the market price of the common stock above independent market levels or prevent or retard a decline in the market price of the common stock. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time. We and the underwriters have agreed to indemnify each other against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on websites maintained by one or more underwriters, or selling group members, if any, participating in this offering. The representatives may agree to allocate a number of shares of common stock to underwriters for sale to their online brokerage account holders. Internet distributions will be allocated by the representatives to underwriters that may make internet distributions on the same basis as other allocations. The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory and investment banking services for us, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. In addition, in the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investment and securities activities may involve our securities and instruments. The underwriters and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments. Pricing of the offering Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. The initial public offering price was determined by negotiations between us and the representatives. Among the factors considered in determining the initial public offering price were our future prospects and those of our industry in general, our sales, earnings and certain other financial and operating information in recent periods, and the price-earnings ratios, price-sales ratios, market prices of securities, and certain financial and operating information of companies engaged in activities similar to ours. Directed share program At our request, the underwriters have reserved up to shares of common stock, or % of the shares offered by this prospectus for sale, at the initial public offering price through a directed share program to eligible instructors on our platform. Instructors in good standing with our Trust & Safety team who have had at least 100 enrolled learners as of , 2021 are potentially eligible for the program. Instructors must also reside in the U.S. or selected international jurisdictions to be potentially eligible for the program. If demand for the program exceeds capacity in a particular jurisdiction, we may invite instructors to participate based on lifetime earnings through our platform. The number of shares of common stock available for sale to the general public will be reduced to the extent that these individuals purchase such reserved shares. Any reserved shares that are not so purchased will be offered by the underwriters to the general public on the same basis as the other shares offered by this prospectus. Participants in this directed share program will not be subject to lockup or market standoff restrictions with respect to any shares purchased through the directed share program. 159 Other than the underwriting discount described on the front cover of this prospectus, the underwriters will not be entitled to any commission with respect to shares of common stock sold pursuant to the directed share program.

[Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and ] Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm | | |Page| | |[Consolidated Statements of Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and Stockholders Deficit](#fin163445_5) F-1 [Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ] To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Udemy, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Udemy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders deficit, and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP San Francisco, California May 25, 2021 (July 9, 2021 as to the effects of the immaterial restatement discussed in Note 15) We have served as the Companys auditor since 2019.

F-9 Udemy, Inc. [Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ] |1.|| | Organization and Description of Business Udemy, Inc. (Udemy or the Company) was incorporated in January 2010 under the laws of the state of Delaware. Udemy is a global marketplace platform for teaching and learning, connecting millions of learners to the skills they need to succeed. The Companys platform allows learners all over the world to access affordable and relevant content from expert instructors. Udemy combines high-quality content, insights and analytics, and technology into a single, unified platform that is purpose-built to meet the specific needs of both individual learners and enterprise customers. The Company is headquartered in San Francisco, California, and maintains offices in Mountain View, California; Denver, Colorado; Ankara, Turkey; and Dublin, Ireland. Risks and UncertaintiesAs of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company had cumulative stockholders deficit of $225.6 million and $260.7 million, respectively, and negative net working capital of $99.5 million and $26.8 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2021 (unaudited), the cumulative stockholders deficit and negative net working capital balances were $266.8 million and $40.1 million, respectively. The negative net working capital balances as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, and June 30, 2021 (unaudited), included deferred revenue totaling $87.7 million, $142.4 million, and $164.0 million respectively, derived from both the Companys Consumer and Enterprise customers (as defined in Note 2 under the Revenue Recognition heading). During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company incurred net losses of $69.7 million and $77.6 million, respectively, and had cash used in operations of $16.5 million and cash provided by operations of $9.6 million, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited), the Company incurred net losses of $52.5 million and $29.4 million, respectively, and had cash provided by operations of $13.2 million and cash used in operations of $5.5 million, respectively. The Company has incurred operating and net losses since inception. Such losses have primarily resulted from the costs incurred in the development, operation, and marketing of the Companys products, platform and services. The Company expects to continue to make investments in order to develop and promote new offerings as well as to support existing offerings. The Company may require future financing to perpetuate its business model. The Company believes it will be able to maintain adequate liquidity to meet the Companys liquidity needs over the next twelve months from the issuance date of the audit report. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease named COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has created and may continue to create significant uncertainty in global financial markets. This uncertainty may positively or adversely impact certain aspects of the business, including but not limited to customer demand and spending, the ability to raise capital, impairment of assets, and cash collections. As of December 31, 2020, and through the date of issuance of the financial statements, management is not aware of any significant, adverse conditions or circumstances pertaining to COVID-19 that would require updating or revising the Companys estimates, judgments or carrying value of assets or liabilities. While the Company has not experienced a material negative impact to its business, results of operations, financial position, and liquidity, the future duration, impact, and disruption of the COVID-19 outbreak to the Companys operations is uncertain. F-10 |2.|| | Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Consolidation and PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Segment InformationThe Company defines its segments as those operations the chief operating decision maker (CODM), determined to be the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, regularly reviews to allocate resources and assess performance. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and the six months ended June 30, 2021 (unaudited), the Company operated under two operating and reportable segments: Consumer and Enterprise. The Company continually monitors and reviews its segment reporting structure in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 280, Segment Reporting, to determine whether any changes have occurred that would impact its reportable segments. For further information on the Companys segment reporting, see Note 15 Segment and Geographic Information. Use of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the results of operations during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in the consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property and equipment, capitalization of internally developed software and associated useful lives, valuation of stock option grants, determination of the income tax valuation allowance and the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions, estimated instructor withholding tax obligations, estimated period of consumption for Consumer learners single course purchases, fair value of the Companys common stock and convertible preferred stock, and the period of benefit for deferred commissions. Management periodically evaluates such estimates and assumptions for continued reasonableness. Actual results may ultimately differ from managements estimates and such differences could be material to the financial position and results of operations. Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial InformationThe accompanying interim consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2021, the consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021, and the related footnote disclosures are unaudited. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In managements opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary to state fairly the Companys financial position as of June 30, 2021 and its results of operations and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021. The financial data and the other information disclosed in these notes to the consolidated financial statements related to these six-month periods are unaudited. The results for the six months ended June 30, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year ending December 31, 2021 or any future period. Revenue RecognitionOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method. The Companys two sources of revenues are its Consumer and Enterprise business channels. Consumer revenues: The Company generates revenue by selling access to course content on the Udemy platform directly to individual learners. Consumer revenues consist of (i) single course purchases and (ii) Consumer subscriptions. All contracts with Consumer customers are billed in advance and require payment by the customer prior to accessing any course content, or in the case for new Consumer subscription customers, upon expiration of the 7-day free trial. F-11 After checkout, Consumer customers purchasing a single course receive a lifetime access license to the digital course content in addition to stand-ready access to the Udemy platform online services needed to access the content. Consumer subscription plans offer on-demand access to a library of courses over a subscription term, as well as additional features and functionalities. Consumer revenue transactions are governed by Udemys standard terms of use. The time between a customers payment and the receipt of funds is not significant. Payment terms are generally fixed and do not include variable consideration. Consumer revenues are recorded net of actual and estimated refunds and exclude any taxes that are collected from learners and remitted to governmental authorities. Consumer revenue arrangements do not include significant obligations associated with warranties. Consumer subscriptions are typically one-month in duration and paid in advance, with new customers able to sign up for a 7-day free trial period. Subscribers have continuous access to enroll in and consume an unlimited number of curated courses included in the subscription catalogue on the platform during the subscription term. Subscribers retain access to the courses in which they enroll for the duration of their subscriptions (including any renewal period), even if the instructor subsequently elects to remove the course from the Companys subscription programs. The continual access to the platform represents a series of distinct services, as the Company continually provides access to, and fulfills its obligation to, the customer over the contract term. Consumer subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each month. Customers may cancel renewal of their subscription at any point but will retain their access to the platform until the end of the current subscription term. Revenues recognized from Consumer subscriptions was not material for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, as well as the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited). Enterprise revenues: The Company generates revenue by selling subscription licenses to a variety of enterprise and government customers. The Companys subscription contracts with Enterprise customers generally have annual or multi-year contractual terms and consist of a fixed quantity of seat licenses, which allows each seat to access an unlimited number of course enrollments during the contract term. Subscribers retain access to the courses in which they enroll for the duration of their subscriptions (including any renewal period), even if the instructor subsequently elects to remove the course from the Companys subscription programs. Enterprise contracts are typically evidenced by a fully executed Master Services Agreement and, with an accompanying executed Order Form specifying the contractual subscription term and pricing. Revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contractual subscription term beginning on the date that the platform is made available to the customer. Standard subscription agreements have auto-renewal clauses, which allow the agreement to continue after the expiration of the initial term. The Companys standard billing terms are to invoice upfront annually for contracts with terms of one year or longer. For contracts that are less than one year, the Company generally bills in advance on a quarterly or semi-annual basis. The Company recognizes unbilled receivables that relate to consideration for services completed but not billed as of period end. The unbilled receivables are recorded in accounts receivable, net, and are not material for any period presented. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of promised services is transferred. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services. The Company accounts for revenue contracts with customers using the five-step model under ASC Topic 606: |1.|| | Identify the contract with a customer Udemy determines a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is approved, each partys rights regarding the services to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, the Company evaluates whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one F-12 performance obligation. The Company applies judgment in determining the customers ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customers historical payment experience if available. Consumer customers are generally required to pay in advance using a credit card. Generally, Enterprise customers are billed upfront annually for contracts with terms of one year or longer or in advance quarterly or semi-annually for contracts with terms of less than one year. |2.|| | Identify the performance obligations in the contract Performance obligations committed in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or Udemy, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services and the products is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Customers do not have the ability to take possession of the software supporting the Udemy platform and, as a result, contracts are accounted for as service arrangements. The non-exclusive lifetime access license associated with single course purchases and the licensed content associated with subscriptions are not considered distinct from the Udemy platform, because the course content is significantly integrated, and highly interdependent and interrelated with the platform. Specifically, the learner does not obtain control of the course contents functionality without the Udemy platform. Accordingly, management concluded there is a single, combined performance obligation, which is customers access to the online content on the Udemy platform, representing a series of distinct services as the Company continually provides access to and fulfills its obligation to allow access to licensed content and platform functionality to the learner. |3.|| | Determine the transaction price The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which Udemy expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. The prices for Consumer and Enterprises contracts are fixed at contract inception and do not contain significant estimates related to variable consideration. With respect to single course purchases, customers may request a full refund within 30 days after the initial purchase transaction. The Company estimates and establishes a refund reserve based on historical refund rates, which has historically been immaterial. None of the Companys contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales and other indirect taxes). |4.|| | Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on each performance obligations relative standalone selling price. As access to content is not considered distinct from the Udemy platform hosting services, the transaction price is allocated to a single performance obligation |5.|| | Recognize revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of the promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that Udemy expects to receive in exchange for those services. Udemy has a stand ready obligation to deliver its services continually throughout the requisite contract period, which is either lifetime access for Consumer customers or the contractual subscription term for Enterprise and Consumer subscription customers. As such, the Company recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis as it satisfies the performance obligation, using an estimated service period for individual Consumer enrollments and the contractual subscription term for Enterprise and Consumer subscription customers. Other than the circumstances noted below, no significant judgment has historically been required in determining the amount and timing of revenue from the Companys contracts with customers. F-13 Principal vs. AgentIn order to determine if Consumer and Enterprise revenues should be reported gross or net of payments to third-party instructors , the Company evaluated whether Udemy acts as the principal in sales of its online course offerings. An entity is the principal if it controls a good or service before it is transferred to the end customer. Key indicators that management evaluated in determining gross versus net treatment included but are not limited to: ||| | the nature of the Companys promise to the customer, as well as the distinct performance obligation identified. ||| | the underlying contract terms and conditions between the parties to the transaction. ||| | which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service to the end customer. ||| | which party has inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to the end customer. ||| | which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. Based on an evaluation of the above indicators, management determined that the Company is the principal to learners who purchase access to online course content via Consumer and Enterprise offerings. The Company controls the promised goods or services (i.e., access to course content via the Udemy platform) before it is transferred to the customer and is primarily responsible for fulfillment with respect to delivering access to course content. The Company is the entity which licenses content to learners as the agreements with instructors grant the Company the right to sub-license content to its learners at its discretion. The Company also has substantial discretion to determine the pricing of its offerings. Therefore, the Company reports the gross purchase price paid by the customer related to these arrangements in the revenues caption of the consolidated statements of operations and the payments to instructors as content costs within cost of revenues. Estimated service term for Consumer single course purchasesThe Company considers a variety of data points when determining the estimated service period for a Consumer learners consumption of an single course purchase, including, the weighted-average number of days between a learners first and last day that content is accessed on the platform, the average total hours consumed, the average number of days in which learner activity stabilizes, and the weighted-average number of days between learners enrollment and the last date the course content is accessed online. Management also considers known online trends, the service periods of historical course content available on the platform, and to the extent publicly available, service periods of competitors online content that is similar in nature to the Companys. The Company believes consideration of all of these factors enables the Company to determine the best representation of the time period during which Consumer learners access the online course content on the Companys platform and therefore the service period over which the Company provides services to learners. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires managements judgment. Future usage patterns may differ from historical usage patterns, and the estimated service period may change in the future. The estimated service period for Consumer single course purchase transactions is four months from the date of enrollment. The Company records contract liabilities when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance to deferred revenue. Deferred revenue primarily relates to the advance consideration allocated to remaining performance obligations received from customers. The price of subscriptions is fixed at contract inception and the Companys contracts do not contain significant estimates related to variable consideration. As a result, the amount of revenue recognized in the periods presented from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in prior periods was not material. In connection with the adoption of ASC 606, the Company recorded an increase in total assets of $6.7 million and a reduction of accumulated deficit of $6.7 million as of January 1, 2019, which is attributed to deferred contract costs. F-14 The Company applied the practical expedient in Topic 606 and did not evaluate contracts of one year or less for the existence of a significant financing component. Cost of RevenuesCosts of revenues are related to content costs (which are payments to instructors), payment and mobile processing fees, costs associated with the hosting of digital content, and employee related expenses for the customer support organization, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, facilities and other expenses, depreciation of network equipment, and amortization of capitalized software. Advertising CostsAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense is recorded in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and were $72.6 million and $110.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Advertising expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited), were $56.6 million and $49.6 million, respectively. Research and DevelopmentResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, facilities, office costs, contracted services, supplies, and other miscellaneous expenses. Stock-Based CompensationThe Company accounts for its stock-based compensation pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair values for all stock awards. The Company uses the Black-Scholes pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of stock options. For awards with service-based vesting conditions, the Company recognizes the resulting stock-based compensation on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is typically a vesting term of four years. Compensation cost for awards that are subject to performance conditions are attributed separately for each vesting tranche of the award. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur rather than estimating the number of awards that are expected to ultimately vest. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of subjective and complex assumptions, which determine the fair value of share-based awards, including the options expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock. The Company calculates the fair value of options granted by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: Expected TermThe expected term of the Companys options represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The Company has elected to use the midpoint of the stock options vesting term and contractual expiration period to compute the expected term, as the Company does not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. Risk-Free Interest RateThe risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the options expected term. Expected VolatilitySince the Company does not have a trading history of its common stock, the Company estimated volatility for option grants by evaluating the average historical volatility of a peer group of companies for the period immediately preceding the option grant for a term that is approximately equal to the options expected term. Dividend Yield The expected dividend was assumed to be zero as the Company has never paid dividends and has no current plans to do so. The Company records compensation expense related to stock options issued to nonemployees, including consultants based on the fair value of the stock options calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the grant date over the service performance period as the equity instruments vest. Prior to adoption of the Financial and Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2018-07 as of F-15 January 1, 2020, at each reporting date, the Company revalued the fair value and expense related to the unvested portion of such nonemployee awards. As a result, the fair value of the portion of unvested options granted to nonemployees was remeasured each reporting period over the options remaining vesting term and recognized as an expense over the remaining period the services are rendered. Upon adoption of ASU No. 2018-07, the unsettled portions of nonemployee awards shall be remeasured to fair value as of the adoption date and recognized as expense over the period the services are rendered, but no further remeasurement at each reporting period thereafter is required. The Company also grants cash-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) to certain employees. Because the SARs are settled in cash upon the exercise of the SARs, the Company accounts for the SARs in the other liabilities caption in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Vested and outstanding SARs are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the assumptions described above, and any change in fair value is recognized as a component of operating expenses. The Company adjusts the liability fair value for vested and outstanding SARs until the earlier of the exercise or expiration of the SARs. Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), which requires an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Under this method, the tax provision includes taxes currently due plus the net change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refund received, as provided for under currently enacted tax law. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, is not expected to be realized. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under this guidance, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes. There was no accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits, nor was any interest expense recognized during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited). The Company does not currently anticipate that any significant increase or decrease to unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded during the next twelve months. Translation of Foreign CurrencyThe functional currency of the Companys foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, each foreign subsidiary remeasures monetary assets and liabilities at period-end exchange rates, while nonmonetary items are remeasured at historical rates. Revenue and expense accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate prevailing during the year. Remeasurement adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as transaction gains or losses in the period of occurrence as other income (expense). Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common StockholdersBasic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed in conformity with the two-class method required for participating securities. The Company considers all series of its redeemable convertible preferred stock to be participating securities as the holders of such stock have the right to receive nonforfeitable dividends on a pari passu basis in the event that a dividend is paid on common stock. Under the two-class method, the net loss attributable to common stockholders is not allocated to the redeemable convertible preferred stock as the preferred stockholders do not have a contractual obligation to share in the Companys losses. F-16 Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents to the extent they are dilutive. For purposes of this calculation, redeemable convertible preferred stock, common stock options, early exercised common stock options subject to repurchase, and redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants are considered to be common stock equivalents but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as their effect is anti-dilutive for the periods presented. Comprehensive Income (Loss)Comprehensive loss consists of two components, net loss and other comprehensive loss, net of tax. Other comprehensive loss, net of tax, refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of stockholders deficit but are excluded from net loss. The Companys other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of changes in unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale securities. The Company recorded no other comprehensive income or loss for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company recorded no other comprehensive income or loss for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited). Cash and Cash EquivalentsAs of December 31, 2019 and 2020, and June 30, 2021 (unaudited), cash and cash equivalents include on demand deposits and money market funds with banks which have remaining maturities at the date of purchase of less than ninety days. Cash equivalents also include amounts in transit from certain payment processors for credit and debit card transactions, which typically settle within five business days. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Restricted CashRestricted cash primarily consists of cash restricted in connection with lease agreements for the Companys facilities. Restricted cash is included in current assets for leases that expire within one year from the balance sheet date and in non-current assets for leases that expire in more than one year from the balance sheet date. |As of December 31,||As of June 30,| |Reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and cash equivalents||$||49,139||$||175,031||$||163,198| |Restricted cash, current||112||||| |Restricted cash, non-current||2,500||2,900||2,900| | | | | | | | | | | | | |Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash||$||51,751||$||177,931||$||166,098| | | | | | | | | | | | | Marketable SecuritiesThe Companys marketable securities comprise of asset-backed securities, U.S. treasury securities, corporate debt securities and commercial paper. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. The Company has classified and accounted for its marketable securities as available-for-sale securities as the Company may sell these securities at any time for use in its current operations or for other purposes, even prior to maturity. As a result of sales and maturities of the Companys previously outstanding investment portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2019, there are no marketable securities within the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, and as of June 30, 2021 (unaudited). Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful AccountsAccounts receivable represent amounts owed to the Company for Enterprise subscriptions. Also included in accounts receivable are amounts due from payment processors or mobile application store partners that settle over a period longer than five business days. Accounts receivable balances are recorded at the invoiced amount and are non-interest-bearing. Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts. Management assesses the Companys ability to collect outstanding receivables and records allowances when collection becomes doubtful. The provision for bad debt is recorded in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated F-17 statements of operations. These estimates are based on the assessment of the credit worthiness of the Companys customers based on multiple sources of information and analysis of such factors as the Companys historical collection experience and industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk. Accounts receivable deemed to be uncollectible are written off, net of any amounts that may be collected. |Balance at | beginning of period |Charged to | expenses |Charges | utilized / write-offs |Balance at | end of period |Allowance for doubtful accounts| |Year Ended December 31, 2019||$||422||$||642||$||(482||)||$||582| |Year Ended December 31, 2020||$||582||$||182||$||(121||)||$||643| |Six months ended June 30, 2021 (unaudited)||$||643||$||170||$||(310||)||$||503| Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. For cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, the Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the financial institutions to the extent the amounts recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are in excess of federal insurance limits. The Company generally does not require collateral or other security in support of accounts receivable. To reduce credit risk, management performs ongoing evaluations of its customers financial condition. The Company analyzes the need for reserves for potential credit losses and records allowances for doubtful accounts when necessary. The Company had no customer which accounted for more than 10% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, and as of June 30, 2021 (unaudited). No customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited). Deferred Offering CostsDeferred offering costs consist of direct and incremental legal, accounting, and other fees related to the Companys proposed initial public offering (IPO). These costs are capitalized in the prepaid expenses and other current assets caption on the consolidated balance sheets. The deferred offering costs will be offset against IPO proceeds upon the consummation of an IPO. In the event the planned IPO is terminated, the deferred offering costs will be expensed. The Company had no deferred offering costs as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Total deferred offering costs as of June 30, 2021 (unaudited) were $2.2 million. Deferred Contract CostsSales commissions earned by the Companys sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit which is determined to be four years. The Company determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration the length of terms in its customer contracts, changes and enhancements in course offerings, and other factors. Amounts expected to be recognized within one year of the consolidated balance sheet dates are recorded as deferred contract costs, current, while the remaining portion is recorded as deferred contract costs, non-current in the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred contract costs are periodically analyzed for impairment. Amortization expense is included in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The following table represents a rollforward of the Companys deferred contract costs (in thousands): |Balance at | beginning of period |Additions||Amortization | expense |Balance at | end of period costs| ended 6/30/2021 (unaudited)||$||25,837||$||15,724||$||(7,233||)||$||34,328| | | | | F-18 Property and Equipment, NetProperty, equipment, and purchased software are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are generally three years for computers, purchased software, and equipment, and five years for furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the term of the related lease. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Upon disposition or retirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is reflected as operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Capitalized Software, NetThe Company capitalizes costs to develop software for internal use incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, qualifying internal and external costs are capitalized until the software feature is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalized qualifying costs are amortized on a straight-line basis when the software is ready for its intended use over an estimated useful life, which is generally three years. The Company evaluates the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsThe Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset, including disposition, are less than the carrying value of the asset. The impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets. The Company did not identify any impairment losses on long-lived assets for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited). Deferred RevenueThe Company records contract liabilities to deferred revenue for amounts billed to customers in advance of the performance obligations being satisfied, and primarily consists of the unearned portion of Enterprise and Consumer services. The Company also recognizes an immaterial amount of contract assets, or unbilled receivables, primarily relating to consideration for services completed but not billed at the reporting date. Unbilled receivables are classified as receivables when the Company has the right to invoice the customer. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company recognized revenues that were included in the deferred revenue balances at the beginning of the year of $62.4 million and $83.4 million, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited), the Company recognized revenues that were included in the deferred revenue balances at the beginning of the year of $73.1 million and $104.2 million, respectively. The below table presents a summary of deferred revenue balances by reportable segment (in thousands): |As of December 31,||As |2019||2020||2021| | | Enterprise |$||40,686||$||84,241||$||109,043| | | Consumer |47,023||58,135||54,928| | | | | | | | | | | | | |Total deferred revenue||$||87,709||$||142,376||$||163,971| | | | | | | | | | | | | Remaining performance obligations represent the aggregate amount of the transaction price in contracts for performance obligations not delivered, or partially undelivered, as of the end of the reporting period. Remaining performance obligations relate to unearned revenue from consumer single course purchase arrangements and unearned and un-billed revenue from multi-year enterprise subscription contracts with future installment payments at the end of any given period. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate transaction price for remaining F-19 performance obligations was $192.4 million, of which 81% is expected to be recognized during 2021 and the remainder thereafter. As of June 30, 2021 (unaudited), the aggregate transaction price for remaining performance obligations was $233.1 million, of which 78% is expected to be recognized during the twelve months ending June 30, 2022, and the remainder thereafter. Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe Company considers fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability, an exit price, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value are either observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entitys pricing based on their own market assumptions. The Company utilizes the following three-level fair value hierarchy to establish the priorities of the inputs used to measure fair value: Level 1Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and market-corroborated inputs which are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data; and Level 3Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable. The carrying amounts of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and accounts receivable, as well as accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the relatively short-term maturities and are classified as short-term assets and liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The fair value measurements of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows (in thousands): | | As of convertible preferred stock warrants |$||||$||||$||108| | | Cash settled stock appreciation rights |||||36| | | | | | | | | | | | | |Total financial liabilities||$||||$||||$||144| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | As of |Fair convertible preferred stock warrants |$||||$||||$||160| | | Cash settled stock appreciation rights |||||268| | | | | | | | | | | | | |Total financial liabilities||$||||$||||$||428| | | | | | | | | | | | | |As Cash settled stock appreciation rights |||||791| | | | | | | | | | | | | |Total financial liabilities||$||||$||||$||791| | | | | | | | | | | | | F-20 Warrants issued for the Companys redeemable convertible preferred stock are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized as a component of other income (expense), net. The Company adjusts the liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of the exercise or expiration of the warrants or the completion of a liquidation event, including the closing of a qualifying initial public offering, at which time all redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants would be converted into warrants to purchase common stock and, accordingly, the liability would be reclassified to stockholders deficit. The Company measures the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants using Level 3 unobservable inputs within the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company used various key assumptions, such as the fair value of redeemable convertible preferred stock, volatility, the risk-free interest rate, and expected term (remaining contractual term of the warrants). The Company monitors the fair value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants annually, with subsequent gains and losses from remeasurement of Level 3 financial liabilities recorded through other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Generally, increases (decreases) in the fair value of the underlying stock and estimated term would result in a directionally similar impact to the fair value measurement. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesStock-Based Compensation for the valuation methodology and inputs used to measure the fair value of the stock appreciation rights. In January 2010, the Company issued warrants to purchase up to 1,562,689 shares of the Companys Series A-1 redeemable convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of $0.196 per share. The initial term of the warrant was five years from the issuance of Series A-1, which occurred in September 2011, and had an automatic extension for an additional five years if the Company was not public by the original expiration date. Prior to the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, 1,550,094 of the warrants had been exercised. As of December 31, 2019, and 2020, 12,595 warrants remained outstanding and were carried at fair value in the other liabilities and the accrued expenses caption and other current liabilities caption, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. The remaining outstanding 12,595 warrants were exercised on January 20, 2021 for an immaterial amount of cash proceeds, at which time the Company reclassified the $0.2 million (unaudited) fair value of the warrants into Series A-1 redeemable convertible preferred stock on the consolidated balance sheet. The change in fair value of the warrants between December 31, 2020 and the exercise date was immaterial (unaudited). A summary of the changes in the fair value of Level 3 financial instruments, of which changes in warrant fair value and vesting and remeasurement of stock appreciation rights are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations, is as follows (in thousands): |Warrants||SARs||Total| |BalanceJanuary 1, 2019||$||50||$||||$||50| | | Change in fair value of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants |58||||58| | | Vesting and remeasurement of stock appreciation rights |||36||36| | | | | | | | | | | | | |BalanceDecember 31, 2019||$||108||$||36||$||144| | | | | | | | | | | | | |Change in fair value of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants||52||||52| | | Vesting and remeasurement of stock appreciation rights |||232||232| | | | | | | | | | | | | |BalanceDecember 31, 2020||$||160||$||268||$||428| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Exercise of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants (unaudited) |(160||)||||(160||)| | | Vesting and remeasurement of stock appreciation rights (unaudited) |||523||523| | | | | | | | | | | | | |BalanceJune 30, 2021 (unaudited)||$||||$||791||$||791| | | | | | | | | | | | | Redeemable Convertible Preferred StockThe redeemable convertible preferred stock issued by the Company provides the preferred stockholders certain rights regarding events that are outside the control of the Company. This includes the right to redeem the preferred stock upon a specified passage of time or upon the F-21 occurrence of certain deemed liquidation events where the holders of the preferred stock are entitled to receive cash or other assets. As such, the redeemable convertible preferred stock is classified as mezzanine (or temporary) equity as it contains terms that could force the Company to redeem the shares for cash or other assets upon the occurrence of an event not solely within the Companys control. The Companys series of redeemable convertible preferred stock represent equity instruments in legal form, are not mandatorily redeemable financial instruments, and do not constitute unconditional obligations that may require issuance of a variable number of the Companys shares. Furthermore, since the series of redeemable convertible preferred stock are neither currently redeemable nor probable of becoming redeemable, no subsequent remeasurement of the amounts presented outside of stockholders deficit is required. Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2019, by applying the modified retrospective approach to all contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2019. The Company applied the practical expedient in Topic 606 and did not evaluate contracts of one year or less for the existence of a significant financing component. The Company recorded an increase in total assets of $6.7 million and a reduction of accumulated deficit of $6.7 million as of January 1, 2019, which is attributed to the deferral of sales commission costs. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows. The standard requires that the statements of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The Company adopted the ASU on January 1, 2019. As a result of adopting the ASU, the Company includes restricted cash with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts presented on the statements of consolidated cash flows. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-09, Codification Improvements, which clarifies, corrects errors in and makes improvements to several topics in the FASB Accounting Standard Codification. The transition and effective date guidance is based on the facts and circumstances of each amendment. Some of the amendments do not require transition guidance and were effective upon issuance of the ASU. This ASU is effective for the Company for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. The Company adopted the ASU on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Non-employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The updated guidance simplifies the accounting for non-employee share-based payment transactions. The amendments in the new guidance specify that Topic 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantors own operations by issuing share-based payment awards. This ASU is effective for the Company for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, with early adoption permitted. The Company early-adopted the ASU on January 1, 2020. The Company was required to remeasure any liability-classified nonemployee awards that have not been settled as of the adoption date through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820). ASU 2018-13 modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying, or adding certain disclosures. The ASU is effective for the Company beginning in its fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. The Company adopted the ASU on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. F-22 New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedThe Company is an emerging growth company (EGC), as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act). Under the JOBS Act, EGCs can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that it (i) is no longer an EGC or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, the consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This standard introduces the new leases standard that applies a right-of-use (ROU) model and requires a lessee to record, for all leases with a lease term of more than 12 months, an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a liability to make lease payments. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a practical expedient is available whereby a lessee may elect, by class of underlying asset, not to recognize a ROU asset or lease liability. At inception, lessees must classify all leases as either finance or operating based on five criteria. Balance sheet recognition of finance and operating leases is similar, but the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement, as well as the effect on the statement of cash flows, differs depending on the lease classification. In June 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-05 in 2020, Effective Dates for Certain Entities, which deferred the effective date for nonpublic entities, including EGCs, that had not yet adopted the original ASU. Under the amended guidance, the leasing standard will be effective for the Companys fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2021, and early adoption is still permitted. The Company is currently assessing whether these amendments will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected credit loss model and requires a financial asset measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The FASB issued ASU 2019-10 in November 2019, which established an effective date for the Company, given its status as an EGC, during its fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing whether these amendments will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customers Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. This standard requires a customer in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract to capitalize certain implementation costs as if the arrangement was an internal-use software project, which requires capitalization of certain costs incurred only during the application development stage and costs to be expensed during the preliminary project and post-implementation stage. This ASU is effective for the Company beginning in its fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of the new standard on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for income Taxes, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles of income taxes and reducing the cost and complexity in accounting for income taxes. The ASU is effective for the company beginning in its fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of the new standard on the Companys consolidated financial statements.

As of December 31, 2020, expected amortization expense over the remaining asset lives is as follows (in thousands): |2021||$||7,143| |2022||4,633| |2023||2,237| | | | | |Total expected amortization||$||14,013| | | | | As of June 30, 2021 (unaudited), expected amortization expense over the remaining asset lives is as follows (in thousands): | | Six months ending December 31, 2021 |$||4,541| |2022||7,184| |2023||4,788| |2024||966| | | | | |Total expected amortization||$||17,479| | | | | |6.|| | Accrued expenses and other current liabilities Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following current liabilities||488||1,375||1,235| | | | | | | | | | | | | |Accrued expenses and other current liabilities||$||46,128||$||46,778||$||43,378| | | | | | | | | | | | | Indirect tax payables relate to amounts collected from customers on behalf of third-party taxing authorities, primarily sales and use taxes owed on the Companys sales in various U.S. state jurisdictions, and indirect taxes owed on sales outside of the U.S. Indirect tax payables also include withholding taxes on payments made to the Companys instructors before remitting these amounts to the taxing authorities. Indirect tax reserves primarily relate to Sales and other Indirect Tax Reserves and Instructor Withholding Tax Reserves. Sales and other Indirect Tax ReservesThe Company determined that it was required to pay indirect tax in various domestic and international jurisdictions for the periods prior to January 1, 2020. Accordingly, the Company recorded an outstanding liability of $11.0 million and $3.4 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, for estimated amounts not collected from customers. The change in the sales and other indirect tax reserves liability during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of $4.2 million of additional estimated tax reserves, including penalties and interest, which were recorded as general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, offset by no payments made under voluntary disclosure agreements (VDAs) to the respective taxing authorities. The change in the sales and other indirect tax reserves liability during the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of $0.7 million of additional estimated tax reserves, which were recorded as general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, offset by $8.3 million of payments made under VDAs to the respective taxing authorities. F-25 The outstanding sales and other indirect tax reserves liability as of June 30, 2021 (unaudited) was $0.5 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited), the Company recorded $0.7 million and $(0.2) million, respectively, to general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The decrease in the reserve liability balance during the six months ended June 30, 2021 (unaudited) was due to $2.7 million in payments made under VDAs to the respective taxing authorities. No payments under VDAs were made during the six months ended June 30, 2020 (unaudited). The Company has continued the process of filing VDAs with certain jurisdictions and remitting the estimated indirect tax. If these jurisdictions determine that additional amounts are necessary, the Company will be required to pay accordingly. Instructor Withholding Tax ReservesThe Company conducts operations in many tax jurisdictions throughout the United States and the rest of the world. The Company has an obligation to comply with information reporting and tax withholding requirements with regards to certain payments made to its U.S. and non-U.S. instructors. Under United States Federal tax rules, in the case where the Company withholds less than the correct amount of tax or fails to report it, it is liable for the correct amount that it was required to withhold, plus interest and potential penalties. The Company may be entitled to relief on certain payments if the Company can obtain documentation (e.g. taxpayer identification forms) from instructors establishing that the instructor payee qualifies for reduced withholding tax rates, or that the instructor payee reported the payments and paid the corresponding taxes owed. Prior to March 2020, the Company had not obtained appropriate taxpayer identification forms from instructors, nor remitted applicable tax withholding amounts to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) where required. In accordance with GAAP, the Company recorded a provision for its tax exposure when it was both probable that a liability had been incurred and the amount of the exposure could be reasonably estimated. Given the significant quantity of instructor payments the Company makes in its operations, the Company has applied a statistical sampling approach that is analogous to methods commonly used by the IRS when determining the extent of withholding tax obligations during IRS audits for the historical instructor payments. The instructor withholding provision estimate includes several key assumptions including, but not limited to, the tax characterization of the Companys payments made to instructors, the historical lookback practices and scoping precedents of the IRS, the methods for sourcing of instructor payments to U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions, and managements estimate of the penalty relief on certain instructor payments it will be entitled to. Beginning in March 2020, the Company began collecting appropriate taxpayer identification forms from its instructors, assessing whether the forms justified a reduced rate of withholding or withholding exemption, and remitting withholding tax payments to the IRS where required. The Company also began reporting payments to its non-U.S. instructors and the IRS annually where required to do so. As of December 31, 2019, and 2020, the Company determined that it was probable that it would owe an estimate of $20.9 million and $22.2 million, respectively, for withholding taxes related to historical payments to its instructors. The Company has recorded this amount in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, of which $8.4 million and $2.8 million is recorded in general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The change in liability during the year ended December 31, 2020 also included a reduction due to $1.5 million of payments made to the IRS, as well as estimated interest of $1.2 million that is recorded in interest income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited), the Company recorded $1.0 million and $0.4 million of expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Included in those amounts are estimated interest of $0.9 million and $0.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited), respectively, which are recorded in interest income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. There were no payments or settlements in the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited). F-26 |Balance at | beginning of period |Charged to | expenses |Net | payments and settlements |Balance at | end of period |Instructor Withholding Tax Reserves| |Year Ended December 31, 2019||$||12,540||$||8,386||$||-||$||20,926| |Year Ended December 31, 2020||$||20,926||$||2,826||$||(1,586||)||$||22,166| |Six months ended June 30, 2021 (unaudited)||$||22,166||$||368||$||-||$||22,534| In 2020, the Company began approaching the IRS to address the historical withholding amounts for instructors. Final settlement of the matter could differ materially from the estimate recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and there exists a reasonable possibility that the Company could incur losses that are significantly more or significantly less than the Company has accrued as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. The Company estimated a potential range of loss between $7.9 million and $28.1 million as of December 31, 2020, and between $8.0 million and $28.6 million as of June 30, 2021 (unaudited). |7.|| | Commitments and contingencies Operating LeasesThe Company entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for its facilities that expire over the next five years. Certain operating leases contain provisions under which monthly rent escalates over time. When lease agreements contain escalating rent clauses or free rent periods, the Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2020, are as follows (in thousands): |Years Ending December 31,|| Lease | Commitments | | 2021 | | $ | | 6,210 | | | | 2022 | | | | 6,498 | | | | 2023 | | | | 6,171 | | | | 2024 | | | | 5,200 | | | | 2025 | | | | 809 | | | | Thereafter | | | | 410 | | | | | | | | Total lease commitments | | $ | | 25,298 | | | | | | As of June 30, 2021 (unaudited), there were no material changes to the Companys future minimum payments related to operating leases. The Company incurred $5.5 million and $5.5 million of rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and $2.6 million and $2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited), respectively. Noncancelable Purchase CommitmentsThe Company has contractual commitments with its cloud infrastructure provider, network service providers and paid advertising vendors that are noncancelable. Future noncancelable commitments under these arrangements as of December 31, 2020 are as follows (in thousands): | | Years Ending December 31, | Purchase | Commitments | | 2021 | | $ | | 8,075 | | | | 2022 | | | | 594 | | | | 2023 | | | | 294 | | | | Thereafter | | | | 74 | | | | | | | | Total purchase commitments | | $ | | 9,037 | | | | | | F-27 Future noncancelable commitments under these arrangements as of June 30, 2021 (unaudited) are as follows (in thousands): |Years Ending December months)||$||11,730| |Thereafter||74| | | | |Total purchase commitments||$||17,817| | | | | IndemnificationThe Company enters into indemnification provisions under agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business, including certain business partners, investors, contractors, and the Companys officers, directors, and certain employees. The Company has agreed to indemnify and defend the indemnified partys claims and related losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party resulting from actual or threatened third-party claims because of the Companys activities or, in some cases, non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by the Company. In general, the Company does not record any liability for these indemnities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the amounts cannot be reasonably estimated and are not considered probable. The Company does, however, accrue for losses for any known contingent liability, including those that may arise from indemnification provisions, when future payment is probable. To date, losses recorded in the Companys consolidated statements of operations in connection with the indemnification provisions have not been material. LitigationFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, investigations, and other proceedings, including claims of alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, and commercial, employment, and other matters. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company makes a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least annually and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. The outcome of such litigation is not expected to have a material effect on the financial position, results of operation and cash flows of the Company. |8.|| | Income taxes The domestic and foreign components of income (loss) before provision for income taxes consisted of the following as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 (in thousands): |2019||2020| | | Domestic | | $ | | (69,161 | | ) | | $ | | (77,212 | | ) | | Foreign | | | | 833 | | | | | | 2,741 | | | | | | | | | | | | Total net loss before taxes | | $ | | (68,328 | | ) | | $ | | (74,471 | | ) | | | | | | | | The provision for income taxes consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 (in thousands): |2019||2020| | | Current: | | Federal | | $ | | | | | | $ | | | | | | State | | | | 83 | | | | | | 63 | | | | Foreign | | | | 1,292 | | | | | | 2,937 | | | | | | | | | | | | Total current income tax expense | | | | 1,375 | | | | | | 3,000 | | | | | | | | | | F-28 |2019||2020| | | Deferred: | | Federal | | | | | | | | | | | | | | State | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Foreign | | | | | | | | | | 149 | | | | | | | | | | | | Total deferred income tax expense | | | | | | | | | | 149 | | | | | | | | | | | | Total provision for income taxes | | $ | | 1,375 | | | | $ | | 3,149 | | | | | | | | | | The Company had an effective tax rate of (2.00)% and (4.23)% for the periods ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The difference between the 21% statutory federal tax rate and the effective tax rate was primarily a result of foreign withholding tax, tax adjustments related to stock-based compensation, and change in valuation allowance. The reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax rate and the Companys effective tax rate as a percentage of loss before income taxes is as follows: |2019||2020| | | Federal tax expense | | | | 21.00 | | % | | | | 21.00 | | % | | State taxes, net of federal benefit | | | | 0.09 | | % | | | | 1.17 | | % | | Foreign rate differential | | | | 0.07 | | % | | | | (0.32 | | )% | | Withholding taxes | | | | (1.70 | | )% | | | | (3.06 | | )% | | Stock-based compensation | | | | (2.77 | | )% | | | | (1.94 | | )% | | Change in valuation allowance | | | | (18.76 | | )% | | | | (21.16 | | )% | | Other | | | | 0.07 | | % | | | | 0.08 | | % | | | | | | | | | | Effective tax rate | | | | (2.00 | | )% | | | | (4.23 | | )% | | | | | | | | Significant components of the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 consisted of the following (in thousands): |2019||2020| | | Deferred tax assets: | | Accruals and reserves | | $ | | 894 | | | | $ | | 2,540 | | | | Deferred revenue | | | | 1,440 | | | | | | 29,807 | | | | Net operating loss | | | | 49,782 | | | | | | 37,053 | | | | Stock-based compensation | | | | 887 | | | | | | 1,487 | | | | Indirect tax reserves | | | | 7,211 | | | | | | 5,682 | | | | Property and equipment, net | | | | 1,427 | | | | | | 1,665 | | | | Other | | | | | | | | | | 299 | | | | | | | | | | | | Gross deferred tax assets | | | | 61,641 | | | | | | 78,533 | | | | Valuation allowance | | | | (56,263 | | ) | | | | (69,766 | | ) | | | | | | | | | | Total deferred tax assets | | | | 5,378 | | | | | | 8,757 | | | | | | | | | | | | Deferred tax liabilities: | | Deferred contract costs | | | | (3,144 | | ) | | | | (5,774 | | ) | | Other deferred tax liabilities | | | | (2,234 | | ) | | | | (3,132 | | ) | | | | | | | | | | Total deferred tax liabilities | | | | (5,378 | | ) | | | | (8,906 | | ) | | | | | | | | | | Net deferred tax liabilities | | $ | | | | | | $ | | (149 | | ) | | | | | | | | A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets where the recoverability of the assets is uncertain. The determination to provide a valuation allowance is dependent upon the assessment of whether it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the deferred tax assets. F-29 As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company has established a valuation allowance of $56.3 million and $69.8 million, respectively, against its gross deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets. The change in total valuation allowance from 2019 to 2020 was an increase of $13.5 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $167.0 million of federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards. The $85.4 million of federal NOL carryforwards generated in taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 2018 begin expiring in 2030, if not utilized. The $81.6 million of federal NOL carryforwards generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 have an indefinite carryforward period, but are subject to the 80% deduction limitation based upon pre-NOL deduction taxable income. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $29.9 million of state NOL carryforwards. The state NOL carryforwards begin expiring in 2023, if not utilized. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had U.S. federal and state research and development (R&D) tax credit carryforwards of $5.2 million and $5.4 million, respectively. The federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will expire in various amounts beginning in 2030 while the state research and development tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely. The utilization of the Companys net operating losses may be subject to a limitation due to the ownership change provisions under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign provisions. Such limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards generated before 2018 before their utilization. The Company has performed a Section 382 study to determine any potential Section 382 limitations on the utilization of its net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards and has determined that the Company experienced two ownership changes with the Companys Series A and A-1 preferred stock offering in September 2011 and with the Companys Series B preferred stock offering in November 2012. The Company has estimated that the gross U.S. federal NOL carryforwards from 2010 to 2012 that would be subject to limitation are approximately $3.6 million. Uncertain Tax PositionsAs of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $0.1 million and $10.6 million, respectively, related to federal and state R&D tax credits. The Company has not performed a formal R&D tax credit analysis and thus has reserved against the entire amount of its federal and state R&D tax credit carryforwards. The Companys tax position of such credits is not more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. The Company has recorded an uncertain tax position related to the deferred tax asset recognized for these credits. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefit is as follows (in thousands): |2019||2020| |Gross unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of the year||$||146||$||146| |Increases related to prior year tax positions||||7,006| |Increases related to current year tax positions||||3,428| |Statute of limitations expirations||||| | | | | | | | | |Gross unrecognized tax benefits at the end of the year||$||146||$||10,580| | | | | | | | | The Company is currently unaware of uncertain tax positions that could result in significant additional payments, accruals, or other material deviation in the next 12 months. The Company currently does not record interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits. None of the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, if recognized in a future period, would affect the Companys effective tax rate. The Company files income tax returns in U.S. federal, and certain state and foreign jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. Due to NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, the statutes of limitations remain open for tax years from inception of the Company through 2020. There are currently no income tax audits underway by U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax authorities. F-30 The Company does not expect that future undistributed foreign earnings will be subject to U.S. federal or state, or foreign withholding tax since the Company intends to continue reinvesting such earnings outside the U.S. indefinitely. Intended to provide economic relief to those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted on March 27, 2020 and includes provisions, among others, addressing the carryback of net operating losses for specific periods, refunds of alternative minimum tax credits, temporary modifications to the limitations placed on the tax deductibility of net interest expenses, and technical amendments for qualified improvement property. Additionally, the CARES Act, in efforts to enhance business liquidity, provides for refundable employee retention tax credits and the deferral of the employer-paid portion of social security taxes. Under the CARES Act, the Company deferred $2.6 million related to the employer portion of social security taxes during the year ended December 31, 2020. For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (Unaudited) The provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into consideration in the relevant period. Each quarter, the Company updates the estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated tax rate changes, the Company records a cumulative adjustment to the provision. The Company had an effective tax rate of (3.5)% and (3.7)% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited), respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the valuation allowances on the Companys deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that some or all of the Companys deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of June 30, 2021 (unaudited), the Company has maintained a full valuation allowance against its federal and state deferred tax assets. Management continues to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance. If managements assessment of the deferred tax assets or the corresponding valuation allowance were to change, the Company would record the related adjustment to income during the period in which management makes the determination. The Company recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax benefits as part of the income tax provision. To date, the Company has not recognized any interest and penalties in its condensed consolidated statements of operations, nor has it accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties. |9.|| | Employee retirement plan The Company maintains a 401(k) retirement savings plan covering eligible employees. Employee contributions to the plan consist of a percentage based on eligible employee compensation. The Company matches 25% of an employees contribution up to 6% of the employees compensation, with a cap of $500 annually, subject to a two-year graded vesting schedule that vests 50% after an employees first year of employment and 100% after two years of employment. The Company contributed $0.2 million and $0.2 million to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited), respectively. |10.|| | Related party transactions Naspers Ltd.

Each share of redeemable convertible preferred stock will automatically be converted into shares of common stock at the then-effective conversion rate of such shares upon the earliest to occur of (i) the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of common stock of the Company to the public with offering proceeds to the Company in excess of $50 million (net of underwriters discounts, concessions, commissions, and expenses) or (ii) the consent of holders of at least 35% of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred and Series A-1 Preferred, voting together as a single class; the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred, voting as a separate class; the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred, voting as a separate class; the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred, voting as a separate class; the holders of at least 60% of the then outstanding shares of Series D Preferred, voting as a separate class; the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series E Preferred, voting as a separate class; and the holders of at least 80% of the then outstanding shares of Series F Preferred, voting as a separate class, all on an as-converted basis. In the event the Company sells its common stock in a firmly underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act in which all of the Series F Preferred Stock are to be converted to common stock, and the actual net initial offering price (the IPO Price) to the public is less than $24.13 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like), then the conversion price for each share of Series F Preferred Stock shall be adjusted immediately prior to the conversion of the Series F Preferred Stock into common stock to a price equal to the IPO Price (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like). LiquidationIn the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of the Company, the holders of the Series Preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, ratably, prior and in preference to any distribution of the assets or funds of the Company to the holders of the common stock, an amount equal to the issuance price per share as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations, and similar transactions, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends and any other declared but unpaid dividends (the Liquidation Preference). If the Company has insufficient assets to permit payment of the Liquidation Preference in full to all holders of Series Preferred, F-33 then the assets of the Company shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Series Preferred in proportion to the Liquidation Preference such holders would otherwise be entitled to receive. After payment of the Liquidation Preference to the holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock, the remaining assets of the Company shall be distributed ratably to the holders of common stock on a fully-converted basis. DividendsThe holders of Series Preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, out of any funds legally available, noncumulative dividends prior and in preference to any dividends paid on the common stock, as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, recapitalizations, and similar transactions, when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors. After payment of such dividends on the Series Preferred stock, any additional dividends or distributions shall be distributed among all holders of common stock in proportion to the number of shares of common stock that would be held by each such holder if all shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock were converted to common stock at the then-effective conversion rate. Such dividends are not cumulative. No dividends have been declared or paid on the Companys redeemable convertible preferred stock. RedemptionThe Company is obligated to redeem the Series Preferred at any time after November 13, 2026, at the election of, and notice by the holder at a price equal to the Series Preferred original issuance price, plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon. The Series Preferred may also be redeemed upon the occurrence of certain deemed liquidation events, as the majority of the holders could opt to redeem the shares at the liquidation preference upon certain events as defined by the Companys articles of incorporation, as amended, and include a merger, acquisition or sale of substantially all of the assets. Changes in the redemption value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock, if any, are recorded in the period occurred as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not adjust the carrying values of the redeemable convertible preferred stock to the redemption value until such time as a deemed liquidation event is probable of occurring. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, and June 30, 2021 (unaudited), the redeemable convertible preferred stock had not been adjusted to its redemption value as it was not probable whether or when a deemed liquidation event would occur. |12.|| | Common stock Common stockholders are entitled to one vote per share.

The 2010 Plan provides for the granting of incentive stock options (ISOs), non-statutory stock options (NSOs, collectively with ISOs, Options), SARs, restricted stock, and restricted stock units, and terminates automatically 10 years after the later of: (i) the date when the Board of Directors adopted the Plan; or (ii) the date when the Board of Directors approved the most recent increase in the number of Shares reserved. Option and SAR awards with service-based vesting conditions generally vest over a period of four years (together, the Service-Based Awards). F-34 The Companys Board of Directors approved an amended and restated 2010 Equity Incentive Plan as of January 27, 2021. The amended and restated plan did not change the number of equity awards available for future grant. The following is a summary of activity for Service-Based Awards under the 2010 Plan (amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts): |Number of | Shares Outstanding |Weighted | Average Exercise Price |Weighted | Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years) |Aggregate | Intrinsic Value |BalanceJanuary 1, 2019||17,669,878||$||2.65||8.22||$||8,308| | | Granted |11,561,101||3.12| | | Exercised |(4,024,143)||2.80| | | Cancelled |(7,342,434)||2.99| | | | | | | | | |BalanceDecember 31, 2019||17,864,402||2.78||8.28||67,804| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Granted |6,748,885||8.83| | | Exercised |(5,008,068)||2.08| | | Cancelled |(976,765)||3.43| | | | | | | | | |BalanceDecember 31, 2020||18,628,454||5.13||8.54||123,691| | | Granted (unaudited) |3,769,564||16.23| | | Exercised (unaudited) |(1,896,030)||3.32| | | | | | | | | | | Cancelled (unaudited) |(625,303)||7.40| | | | | | | | | |BalanceJune 30, 2021 (unaudited)||19,876,685||7.33||8.47||532,816| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Vested and expected to vest as of December 31, 2020||18,628,454||5.13||8.54||123,691| |Exercisable as of December 31, 2020||6,073,630||3.29||7.73||51,523| |Vested and expected to vest as of June 30, 2021 (unaudited)||19,876,685||7.33||8.47||532,816| |Exercisable as of June 30, 2021 (unaudited)||6,438,407||3.90||7.66||194,689| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | The weighted average grant date fair values of employee Service-Based Awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, were $1.66 and $5.43 per share, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair values of employee Service-Based Awards granted during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited), were $4.70 and $15.83 per share, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, total compensation cost related to unvested Service-Based Awards not yet recognized was $42.4 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years. As of June 30, 2021 (unaudited), total compensation cost related to unvested Service-Based Awards not yet recognized was $88.5 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.7 years. The grant date fair value was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, based on the following weighted average assumptions: |Year Ended December 31,||Six The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with maturities equivalent to the options expected term. The expected term of the Service-Based Awards granted was estimated by taking the average of the vesting period and the contractual term of the option as provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 107 and 110 because the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to estimate expected term. The Company estimated its future stock price volatility based upon the volatility of comparable public companies having securities with observable trading histories. The Company has never declared or paid cash dividends and does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future; therefore, the Company used an expected dividend yield of zero. Performance-Based AwardsUnder its 2010 Plan, the Company may grant share-based awards whose vesting is contingent on meeting various departmental or company-wide performance goals, such as the achievement of certain sales targets or an IPO event, in lieu of or in addition to a service-based vesting condition (Performance-Based Awards). Such awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock share on the date of grant and have a contractual term of 10 years. If vesting is dependent on satisfying a performance condition that is probable of being achieved, the Company estimates the expected term as the midpoint between the time at which the performance conditions are probable of being satisfied and the contractual term of the award. If vesting is dependent on satisfying a performance condition that is not probable of being achieved and the service period is not explicitly stated, the Company estimates the expected term as the contractual term. The remaining inputs to the Black-Scholes option pricing model used to determine grant date fair value, including risk-free interest, expected volatility, and expected dividend yield, are calculated using the same method as that used for Service-Based Awards. Grants for Performance-Based Awards are made out of the same pool of stock options available for future issuance under the 2010 Plan. Compensation expense for Performance-Based Awards is based on the grant date fair market value. The Company recognizes expense for Performance-Based Awards having either (a) multiple performance-based vesting conditions, or (b) performance and graded service-based vesting conditions, by separately attributing each vesting tranche of the award over the requisite service period applicable to each vesting condition. Managements estimate of the number of shares expected to vest is based on the anticipated achievement of the specified performance goals. If the performance-based vesting condition is considered probable of being achieved, the Company recognizes expense over the remaining service period based on the probable outcome of achievement. If the performance goals are not met, no compensation cost is recognized, and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. For awards with both performance and service-based vesting conditions where the performance condition is considered improbable of being achieved, the Company does not recognize expense until the performance condition is satisfied, after which time expense is recognized over the requisite service period. In 2019, 1,576,694 outstanding stock options with unsatisfied performance-based vesting conditions were forfeited upon termination of the two employee award holders. The Company had two Performance-Based Awards outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (unaudited). In 2018, the Company granted an award of 50,000 stock options that will become eligible to vest upon the closing of the Companys IPO occurring prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date the award was granted and subject to recipients continued service to the Company through the IPO closing date. Upon satisfaction of the IPO requirement, the options vest in 48 equal monthly installments thereafter, subject to the recipient continuing to provide service to the Company through each vesting date. In 2020, the Company modified the performance condition of the award to include a change in control event as defined in the Companys 2010 Plan. Prior to and after the modification, management considered the performance-based vesting conditions were improbable of being satisfied, as neither the IPO nor the change in control events had occurred at the modification date. The impact of the modification was not material to the consolidated financial statements. The contemplated offering is expected to satisfy the IPO requirement, and the Company expects to recognize an immaterial amount of stock-based compensation in the period in which the IPO requirement is satisfied. F-36 In 2020, the Company granted 350,000 stock options with performance-based vesting conditions, with 50% vesting when the Company achieves $230 million in annual recurring revenues (ARR) in Enterprise revenue, and the other 50% vesting when the Company achieves $330 million in ARR in Enterprise revenue. Management considered that both performance-based vesting conditions were probable of being satisfied during the performance period. As such, the Company began recognizing expense for each tranche of the award using the estimated time period by which the performance conditions are probable of being achieved.

As of December 31, 2020, total compensation cost related to unvested Performance-Based Awards not yet recognized was $2.5 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.6 years. As of June 30, 2021 (unaudited), total compensation cost related to unvested Performance-Based Awards not yet recognized was $1.7 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.3 years. Other Equity TransactionsDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company facilitated a tender offer for certain eligible employees to sell 300,000 vested stock options and outstanding shares of common stock to a new investor at a per share price of $10.00 per share. The Company recorded stock-based compensation of $2.1 million in its consolidated statements of operations for the difference between the price paid and the fair value of the Companys common stock on the date of the transaction. During the year ended December 31, 2020, and the six months ended June 30, 2020 (unaudited), the Company facilitated a tender offer for certain eligible employees to sell 891,265 vested stock options and outstanding shares of common stock to Benesse at a per share price of $11.22 per share. The Company recorded stock-based compensation of $3.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, and $3.5 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 (unaudited), in its consolidated statements of operations for the difference between the price paid and the fair value of the Companys common stock on the date of the transaction. F-37 During the six months ended June 30, 2021 (unaudited), the Company facilitated a tender offer for certain eligible employees to sell 236,086 vested stock options and outstanding shares of common stock to an existing investor at a per share price of $23.75 per share. The Company recorded stock-based compensation of $1.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2021 (unaudited) in its consolidated statements of operations for the difference between the price paid and the fair value of the Companys common stock on the date of the transaction. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited), the Company waived its right of first refusal and transfer restrictions with respect to certain transfers of outstanding common stock. Where the Company has concluded that such transfers included a deemed compensatory element as a result of both the Companys role in facilitating the transfers and the buyers of the shares transferred having a pre-existing economic interest in the Companys equity, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense in an aggregate amount of $1.7 million and $17.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and $13.1 million and $4.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited), respectively, for the difference between the price paid and the fair market value on the date of the transaction.

Segment and geographic information The Companys Chief Executive Officer is its CODM. The CODM reviews separate financial information presented for the Companys two segments, Consumer and Enterprise, in order to allocate resources and evaluate the Companys financial performance. The Consumer segment targets individual learners seeking to obtain hands-on learning, gain valuable job skills to advance their professional careers, or learn a new personal skill. The Enterprise segment is focused on helping business and government customers upskill and reskill their employees and public servants. The CODM measures the performance of each segment primarily based on segment revenue and segment gross profit. Segment gross profit, as presented below, is defined as segment revenue less segment cost of revenue. Segment cost of revenue includes content costs, hosting and platform costs, customer support services, and payment processing fees that are allocable to each segment. Segment gross profit excludes amortization of capitalized software, depreciation, and stock-based compensation allocated to cost of revenues as the CODM does not include the information in his measurement of the performance of the operating segments. Additionally, the Company does not allocate sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, and general and administrative expenses because the CODM does not include the information in his measurement of the performance of the operating segments. The Udemy platform supports the operations of each segment. The CODM does not use asset information by segments to assess performance and make decisions regarding allocation of resources, and the Company does not track its long-lived assets by segment. The geographic identification of these assets is set forth below. Financial information for each reportable segment was as follows (in thousands): |Year Ended December 31,||Six Months Ended June 30,| |2019||2020||2020||2021| |Revenue| | | Consumer |$||225,500||$||326,454||$||157,257||$||171,837| | | Enterprise |50,827||103,445||44,111||78,806| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Total revenue||$||276,327||$||429,899||$||201,368||$||250,643| |Segment cost of revenue| | | Consumer |118,669||165,804||85,863||81,363| | | Enterprise |18,906||35,519||15,041||27,413| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Total segment cost of revenue||$||137,575||$||201,323||$||100,904||$||108,776| F-39 |Year |Segment gross profit| | | Consumer |106,831||160,650||71,394||90,474| | | Enterprise |31,921||67,926||29,070||51,393| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Total segment gross profit||$||138,752||$||228,576||$||100,464||$||141,867| |Reconciliation of segment gross profit to gross profit| | | Amortization of capitalized software |4,909||6,894||3,236||4,188| | | Depreciation |727||618||339||415| | | Stock-based compensation |299||418||191||537| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Total reconciling items |5,935||7,930||3,766||5,140| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Total gross profit||132,817||220,646||96,698||136,727| Subsequent to the issuance of the Companys consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company identified an error in the classification of segment cost of revenue between the Consumer and Enterprise segments. Management corrected the error in the table above by decreasing Consumer segment cost of revenue and increasing Enterprise segment cost of revenue by $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and by decreasing Consumer segment cost of revenue and increasing Enterprise segment cost of revenue by $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Consumer segment gross profit increased by $4.1 million and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and Enterprise segment gross profit decreased by $4.1 million and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Management considers such corrections to be immaterial to the previously issued consolidated financial statements. Geographic Information Revenue: The following table summarizes the revenue by region based on the billing address of the Companys customers (in thousands): |Year Ended December | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Total revenue||$||276,327||$||429,899||$||201,368||$||250,643| The United States accounted for 37% and 35% of the Companys total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The United States accounted for 36% and 34% of the Companys total revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited). No other single country represented 10% or more of the Companys total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, or during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 (unaudited).

Where applicable, such events are appropriately reflected and/or disclosed in these consolidated financial statements. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company granted stock options to purchase 2,773,284 shares of common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $13.63 per share. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company facilitated a tender offer for certain eligible employees to sell vested stock options and outstanding shares of common stock to an existing investor. Further, there have been several secondary stock sale transactions including employees or former employees who sold their shares to third parties. Where the Company has concluded that such transfers include a deemed compensatory element, the Company has recorded stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the transaction occurred, equal to the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of the Companys common stock at the time of the transaction. 17. Subsequent events (unaudited) In preparing the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2021 and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021, the Company has evaluated subsequent events through September 17, 2021, the date the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements were available for issuance. On August 15, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with CUX (d/b/a CorpU), or CorpU, to acquire all outstanding shares of CorpU for approximately $30.4 million, payable in cash and 61,300 shares of Udemy restricted common stock. The merger transaction closed on August 24, 2021. CorpU operates an online learning platform and content catalogue focused on blended executive training. As of the date that the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements were available for issuance, the initial accounting for the Merger Agreement was not yet finalized. * * * * * * F-41 shares Common stock Part II Information not required in the prospectus Item 13.

Indemnification of directors and officers Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law empowers a corporation to indemnify its directors and officers and to purchase insurance with respect to liability arising out of their capacity or status as directors and officers, provided that the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in our best interests, and, with respect to any criminal action, had no reasonable cause to believe the persons actions were unlawful. The Delaware General Corporation Law further provides that the indemnification permitted thereunder shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the directors and officers may be entitled under the corporations bylaws, any agreement, a vote of stockholders or otherwise. The certificate of incorporation of the registrant to be in effect upon the completion of this offering provides for the indemnification of the registrants directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law. In addition, the bylaws of the registrant to be in effect upon the completion of this offering require the registrant to fully indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the registrant, or is or was a director or officer of the registrant serving at the registrants request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law permits a corporation to provide in its certificate of incorporation that a director of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except (1) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (2) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (3) for payments of unlawful dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions or (4) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. The registrants certificate of incorporation to be in effect upon the completion of this offering provides that the registrants directors shall not be personally liable to it or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director and that if the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended to authorize corporate II-1 action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of the registrants directors shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so amended. Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides, among other things, that a director who willfully or negligently approves of an unlawful payment of dividends or an unlawful stock purchase or redemption may be held liable for such actions. A director who was either absent when the unlawful actions were approved, or dissented at the time, may avoid liability by causing his, her, or their dissent to such actions to be entered in the books containing minutes of the meetings of the board of directors at the time such action occurred or immediately after such absent director receives notice of the unlawful acts. As permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the registrant has entered into separate indemnification agreements with each of the registrants directors and executive officers which would require the registrant, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities which may arise by reason of their status as directors or executive officers. The registrant expects to obtain and maintain insurance policies under which its directors and officers are insured, within the limits and subject to the limitations of those policies, against certain expenses in connection with the defense of, and certain liabilities which might be imposed as a result of, actions, suits or proceedings to which they are parties by reason of being or having been directors or officers. The coverage provided by these policies may apply whether or not the registrant would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These indemnification provisions and the indemnification agreements entered into between the registrant and the registrants officers and directors may be sufficiently broad to permit indemnification of the registrants officers and directors for liabilities (including reimbursement of expenses incurred) arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The underwriting agreement between the registrant and the underwriters filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this registration statement provides for the indemnification by the underwriters of the registrants directors and officers and certain controlling persons against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act with respect to information provided by the underwriters specifically for inclusion in the registration statement. The investors rights agreement with certain holders of our capital stock also provides for cross-indemnification in connection with the registration of the registrants common stock on behalf of such holders.

The offers, sales, and issuances of the securities described in Items 15(1), 15(2), 15(3), and 15(4) were exempt from registration under the Securities Act under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or Regulation D promulgated thereunder as transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering. The recipients of securities in each of these transactions acquired the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof and appropriate legends were affixed to the securities issued in these transactions. Each of the recipients of securities in these transactions was an accredited person and had adequate access, through employment, business, or other relationships, to information about the registrant. The offers, sales, and issuances of the securities described in Items 15(5), 15(6), and 15(7) were exempt from registration under the Securities Act under either (1) Rule 701 in that the transactions were under compensatory benefit plans and contracts relating to compensation as provided under Rule 701 or (2) Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering. The recipients of such securities were the registrants employees, consultants, or directors and received the securities under our 2010 Plan. The recipients of securities in each of these transactions represented their intention to acquire the securities for investment only and not with view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof and appropriate legends were affixed to the securities issued in these transactions. Item 16. Exhibit and financial statement schedules (a) Exhibits. See the exhibit index immediately preceding the signature page hereto for a list of exhibits filed as part of this registration statement on Form S-1, which exhibit index is incorporated herein by reference. (b) Financial statement schedules. Schedules have been omitted because the information required to be set forth therein is not applicable or is shown in the financial statements or notes thereto. Item 17. Undertakings The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the underwriting agreements, certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer, or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit, or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer, or II-3 controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The undersigned hereby undertakes that: |(1)|| | For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. |(2)|| | For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

ARTICLE IV Section 1. This Company is authorized to issue two classes of stock, to be designated, respectively, Common Stock and Preferred Stock. The total number of shares of stock that the Company shall have authority to issue is 1,000,000,000 shares, of which 950,000,000 shares are Common Stock, $0.00001 par value per share, and 50,000,000 shares are Preferred Stock, $0.00001 par value per share. Section 2. Each share of Common Stock outstanding as of the applicable record date shall entitle the holder thereof to one (1) vote on any matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders. Section 3. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series pursuant to a resolution or resolutions providing for such issue duly adopted by the Board of Directors (authority to do so being hereby expressly vested in the Board of Directors). The Board of Directors is further authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by law, to fix by resolution or resolutions the designations, powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of any series of Preferred Stock, including, without limitation, authority to fix by resolution or resolutions the dividend rights, dividend rate, conversion rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions), redemption price or prices, and liquidation preferences of any such series, and the number of shares constituting any such series and the designation thereof, or any of the foregoing. The Board of Directors is further authorized to increase (but not above the total number of authorized shares of the class) or decrease (but not below the number of shares of any such series then outstanding) the number of shares of any series, subject to the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof stated in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the resolution of the Board of Directors originally fixing the number of shares of such series. Except as may be otherwise specified by the terms of any series of Preferred Stock, if the number of shares of any series of Preferred Stock is so decreased, then the Company shall take all such steps as are necessary to cause the shares constituting such decrease to resume the status which they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series. Section 4. Except as otherwise required by law or provided in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon by law or pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock). Section 5. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, without a separate vote of the holders of the class or classes the number of authorized shares of which are being increased or decreased, unless a vote of any holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock is required pursuant to the terms of any certificate of designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL. ARTICLE V Section 1. Subject to the rights of holders of Preferred Stock, the number of directors that constitutes the entire Board of Directors of the Company shall be fixed only by resolution of the Board of Directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board. For the purposes of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the term Whole Board shall mean the total number of authorized directorships whether or not there exist any vacancies or other unfilled seats in previously authorized directorships. At each annual meeting of stockholders, directors of the Company shall be elected to hold office until the expiration of the term for which they are elected and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal; except that if any such meeting shall not be so held, such election shall take place at a stockholders meeting called and held in accordance with the DGCL. Section 2. From and after the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the directors of the Company (other than any who may be elected by holders of Preferred Stock under specified circumstances) shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in size as is practicable, hereby designated Class I, Class II and Class III. Directors already in office shall be assigned to each class at the time such classification becomes effective in accordance with a resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors.

At the second annual meeting of stockholders following the date hereof, the term of office - 2 - of the Class II directors shall expire and Class II directors shall be elected for a full term of three years.

At each succeeding annual meeting of stockholders, directors shall be elected for a full term of three years to succeed the directors of the class whose terms expire at such annual meeting. If the number of directors is changed, any newly created directorships or decrease in directorships shall be so apportioned hereafter among the classes as to make all classes as nearly equal in number as is practicable, provided that no decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. ARTICLE VI Section 1. From and after the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, only for so long as the Board of Directors is classified and subject to the rights of holders of Preferred Stock, any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause, and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors. Section 2. Except as otherwise provided for or fixed by or pursuant to the provisions of hereof in relation to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock to elect directors under specified circumstances or except as otherwise provided by resolution of a majority of the Whole Board, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors, created in accordance with the Bylaws of the Company, and any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other cause shall be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, or by a sole remaining director, and not by the stockholders. A person so elected by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship shall hold office until the next election of the class for which such director shall have been chosen until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, or until such directors earlier death, resignation or removal.

Section 3. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company. The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the Whole Board shall be required in order for the Board of Directors to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Companys Bylaws. The Companys Bylaws may also be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the above or any other provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws of the Company may not be amended, altered or repealed except in accordance with the provisions of the Bylaws relating to amendments to the Bylaws. No Bylaw hereafter legally adopted, amended, altered or repealed shall invalidate any prior act of the directors or officers of the Company that would have been valid if such Bylaw had not been adopted, amended, altered or repealed. - 3 - Section 4. The election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the Company shall so provide. Section 5. No stockholder will be permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors. ARTICLE VIII Section 1. From and after the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial public offering of securities of the Company pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and subject to the rights of holders of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Company must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders. Section 2. Subject to the terms of any series of Preferred Stock, special meetings of stockholders of the Company may be called only by the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the Board of Directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board, but a special meeting may not be called by any other person or persons and any power of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders is specifically denied.

Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of directors and of business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders of the Company shall be given in the manner and to the extent provided in the Bylaws of the Company. ARTICLE IX Section 1. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as the same exists or as may hereafter be amended from time to time, a director of the Company shall not be personally liable to the Company or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Company shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Section 2. Subject to any provisions in the Bylaws of the Company related to indemnification of directors of the Company, the Company shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any director of the Company who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a Proceeding) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any such Proceeding. The Company shall be required to indemnify a person in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if the Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors. Section 3. The Company shall have the power to indemnify, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any officer, employee or agent of the Company who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee - 4 - or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any such Proceeding. Section 4. Neither any amendment nor repeal of any Section of this Article IX, nor the adoption of any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company inconsistent with this Article IX, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article IX in respect of any matter occurring, or any Proceeding accruing or arising or that, but for this Article IX, would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision. ARTICLE X Meetings of stockholders may be held within or outside of the State of Delaware, as the Bylaws may provide.

No business proposed by a stockholder will be conducted at a stockholder meeting except in accordance with this Section 2.4. (iv) The chairperson of the applicable meeting of stockholders will, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these bylaws or that business was not properly brought before the meeting. If the chairperson of the meeting should so determine, then the chairperson of the meeting will so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination will be disregarded or such business will not be transacted, as the case may be. (v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.4, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear in person at the meeting to present a nomination or other proposed business, such nomination will be disregarded or such proposed business will not be transacted, as the case may be, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such nomination or business may have been received by the Company and counted for purposes of determining a quorum. For purposes of this Section 2.4, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting, and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting. (vi) Without limiting this Section 2.4, a stockholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of the 1934 Act with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.4, it being understood that (1) any references in these bylaws to the 1934 Act are not intended to, and will not, limit any requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to this Section 2.4; and (2) compliance with clause (4) of Section 2.4(a)(i) and with Section 2.4(b) are the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other business (other than as provided in Section 2.4(c)(vii)). (vii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.4, the notice requirements set forth in these bylaws with respect to the proposal of any business pursuant to this Section 2.4 will be deemed to be satisfied by a stockholder if (1) such stockholder has submitted a proposal to the Company in compliance with Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act; and (2) such stockholders proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Company to solicit proxies for the meeting of stockholders. Subject to Rule 14a-8 and other applicable rules and regulations under - 7 - the 1934 Act, nothing in these bylaws will be construed to permit any stockholder, or give any stockholder the right, to include or have disseminated or described in the Companys proxy statement any nomination of a director or any other business proposal. 2.5 NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDERS MEETINGS Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a notice of the meeting shall be given which shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.

At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the original meeting. 2.7 ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the Company may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting in accordance with Section 213(a) of the DGCL and Section 2.11 of these bylaws, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting. - 8 - 2.8 CONDUCT OF BUSINESS The chairperson of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of business and discussion as seem to the chairperson in order.

The chairperson of any meeting of stockholders shall have the power to adjourn the meeting to another place, if any, date or time, whether or not a quorum is present. 2.9 VOTING The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws, subject to Section 217 (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock) and Section 218 (relating to voting trusts and other voting agreements) of the DGCL.

Where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of such class or series or classes or series present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of such class or series or classes or series, except as otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation, these bylaws or the rules of the stock exchange on which the securities of the Company are listed. 2.10 STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING Subject to the rights of holders of preferred stock of the Company, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Company must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders. 2.11 RECORD DATES In order that the Company may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of - 9 - Directors and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance with the provisions of Section 213 of the DGCL and this Section 2.11 at the adjourned meeting. In order that the Company may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. 2.12 PROXIES Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders, or such stockholders authorized officer, director, employee or agent, may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy authorized by a document or by a transmission permitted by law filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212 of the DGCL. 2.13 LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE The Company shall prepare, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting; provided, however, if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. The Company shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is - 10 - provided with the notice of the meeting, or (b) during ordinary business hours, at the Companys principal place of business. In the event that the Company determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Company may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Company. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be examined by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then such list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. 2.14 INSPECTORS OF ELECTION Before any meeting of stockholders, the Company shall appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. The Company may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. Such inspectors shall: (a) ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each; (b) determine the shares represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots; (c) count all votes and ballots; (d) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors; and (e) certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting, and their count of all votes and ballots. The inspectors of election shall perform their duties impartially, in good faith, to the best of their ability and as expeditiously as is practical. If there are multiple inspectors of election, the decision, act or certificate of a majority is effective in all respects as the decision, act or certificate of all. Any report or certificate made by the inspectors of election is prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. ARTICLE III - DIRECTORS 3.1 POWERS The business and affairs of the Company shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise provided in the DGCL or the certificate of incorporation. 3.2 NUMBER OF DIRECTORS The Board of Directors shall consist of one or more members, each of whom shall be a natural person. Unless the certificate of incorporation fixes the number of directors, the number of directors shall be determined from time to time by resolution of a majority of the Whole Board. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that directors term of office expires. - 11 - 3.3 ELECTION, QUALIFICATION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until such directors successor is elected and qualified or until such directors earlier death, resignation or removal. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. The certificate of incorporation or these bylaws may prescribe other qualifications for directors. If so provided in the certificate of incorporation, the directors of the Company shall be divided into three classes. 3.4 RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES Any director may resign at any time upon notice given in writing or by electronic transmission to the Company. A resignation is effective when the resignation is delivered unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events. A resignation which is conditioned upon the director failing to receive a specified vote for reelection as a director may provide that it is irrevocable. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, when one or more directors resign from the Board of Directors, effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws or permitted in the specific case by resolution of the Board of Directors, and subject to the rights of holders of Preferred Stock, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and not by stockholders. If the directors are divided into classes, a person so chosen to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship shall hold office until the next election of the class for which such director shall have been chosen and until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. 3.5 PLACE OF MEETINGS; MEETINGS BY TELEPHONE The Board of Directors may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the State of Delaware. Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, members of the Board of Directors may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. - 12 - 3.6 REGULAR MEETINGS Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors. 3.7 SPECIAL MEETINGS; NOTICE Special meetings of the Board of Directors for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the chairperson of the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer, the president, the secretary or a majority of the Whole Board. Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be: (a) delivered personally by hand, by courier or by telephone; (b) sent by United States first-class mail, postage prepaid; (c) sent by facsimile; (d) sent by electronic mail; or (e) otherwise given by electronic transmission (as defined in Section 232 of the DGCL), directed to each director at that directors address, telephone number, facsimile number, electronic mail address or other contact for notice by electronic transmission, as the case may be, as shown on the Companys records. If the notice is (i) delivered personally by hand, by courier or by telephone, (ii) sent by facsimile, (iii) sent by electronic mail or (iv) otherwise given by electronic transmission, it shall be delivered, sent or otherwise directed to each director, as applicable, at least 24 hours before the time of the holding of the meeting. If the notice is sent by United States mail, it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least four days before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice may be communicated to the director. The notice need not specify the place of the meeting (if the meeting is to be held at the Companys principal executive office) nor the purpose of the meeting, unless required by statute. 3.8 QUORUM; VOTING At all meetings of the Board of Directors, a majority of the Whole Board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present. The affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. If the certificate of incorporation provides that one or more directors shall have more or less than one vote per director on any matter, except as may otherwise be expressly provided herein or therein and - 13 - denoted with the phrase notwithstanding the final paragraph of Section 3.8 of the bylaws or language to similar effect, every reference in these bylaws to a majority or other proportion of the directors shall refer to a majority or other proportion of the votes of the directors. 3.9 BOARD ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission. Any person (whether or not then a director) may provide, whether through instruction to an agent or otherwise, that a consent to action will be effective at a future time (including a time determined upon the happening of an event), no later than 60 days after such instruction is given or such provision is made and such consent shall be deemed to have been given for purposes of this Section 3.9 at such effective time so long as such person is then a director and did not revoke the consent prior to such time. Any such consent shall be revocable prior to its becoming effective. 3.10 FEES AND COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors. 3.11 REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS Any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed from office by stockholders of the Company in the manner specified in the certificate of incorporation and applicable law. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of such directors term of office. ARTICLE IV - COMMITTEES 4.1 COMMITTEES OF DIRECTORS The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the Whole Board, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Company. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors or in these bylaws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Company, and may authorize the seal of the Company to be affixed to all papers that may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority to (a) approve or adopt, or recommend to the stockholders, any action or matter (other than the election or removal of directors) expressly required by the DGCL to be submitted to stockholders for approval, or (b) adopt, amend or repeal any bylaw of the Company. - 14 - 4.2 COMMITTEE MINUTES Each committee and subcommittee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings. 4.3 MEETINGS AND ACTION OF COMMITTEES Meetings and actions of committees and subcommittees shall be governed by, and held and taken in accordance with, the provisions of: (a) Section 3.5 (place of meetings and meetings by telephone); (b) Section 3.6 (regular meetings); (c) Section 3.7 (special meetings and notice); (d) Section 3.8 (quorum; voting); (e) Section 3.9 (action without a meeting); and (f) Section 7.4 (waiver of notice) with such changes in the context of those bylaws as are necessary to substitute the committee or subcommittee and its members for the Board of Directors and its members. However, (i) the time and place of regular meetings of committees or subcommittees may be determined either by resolution of the Board of Directors or by resolution of the committee or subcommittee; (ii) special meetings of committees or subcommittees may also be called by resolution of the Board of Directors or the committee or the subcommittee; and (iii) notice of special meetings of committees and subcommittees shall also be given to all alternate members who shall have the right to attend all meetings of the committee or subcommittee. The Board of Directors may adopt rules for the government of any committee not inconsistent with the provisions of these bylaws. Any provision in the certificate of incorporation providing that one or more directors shall have more or less than one vote per director on any matter shall apply to voting in any committee or subcommittee, unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. 4.4 SUBCOMMITTEES Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, these bylaws or the resolutions of the Board of Directors designating the committee, a committee may create one or more subcommittees, each subcommittee to consist of one or more members of the committee, and delegate to a subcommittee any or all of the powers and authority of the committee. ARTICLE V - OFFICERS 5.1 OFFICERS The officers of the Company shall be a president and a secretary. The Company may also have, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, a chairperson of the Board of Directors, a vice chairperson of the - 15 - Board of Directors, a chief executive officer, a chief financial officer or treasurer, one or more vice presidents, one or more assistant vice presidents, one or more assistant treasurers, one or more assistant secretaries and any such other officers as may be appointed in accordance with the provisions of these bylaws. Any number of offices may be held by the same person. 5.2 APPOINTMENT OF OFFICERS The Board of Directors shall appoint the officers of the Company, except such officers as may be appointed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3 of these bylaws, subject to the rights, if any, of an officer under any contract of employment. 5.3 SUBORDINATE OFFICERS The Board of Directors may appoint, or empower the chief executive officer or, in the absence of a chief executive officer, the president, to appoint, such other officers as the business of the Company may require. Each of such officers shall hold office for such period, have such authority, and perform such duties as are provided in these bylaws or as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine. 5.4 REMOVAL AND RESIGNATION OF OFFICERS Subject to the rights, if any, of an officer under any contract of employment, any officer may be removed, either with or without cause, by the Board of Directors or, for the avoidance of doubt, any duly authorized committee or subcommittee thereof or by any officer who has been conferred such power of removal. Any officer may resign at any time by giving notice, in writing or by electronic transmission, to the Company. Any resignation shall take effect at the date of the receipt of that notice or at any later time specified in that notice. Unless otherwise specified in the notice of resignation, the acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. Any resignation is without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the Company under any contract to which the officer is a party. 5.5 VACANCIES IN OFFICES Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Company shall be filled by the Board of Directors or as provided in Section 5.3. 5.6 REPRESENTATION OF SECURITIES OF OTHER ENTITIES The chairperson of the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer, the president, any vice president, the treasurer, the secretary or assistant secretary of this Company or any other person authorized by the Board of Directors or the chief executive officer, the president or a vice president, is authorized to vote, represent and exercise on behalf of this Company all rights incident to any and all shares or other securities of any other entity or entities, and all rights incident to any management authority conferred on the Company in accordance with the governing documents of any entity or entities, standing in the name of this Company, including the right to act by written consent. The authority granted herein may be exercised either by such person directly or by any other person authorized to do so by proxy or power of attorney duly executed by such person having the authority. - 16 - 5.7 AUTHORITY AND DUTIES OF OFFICERS All officers of the Company shall respectively have such authority and perform such duties in the management of the business of the Company as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and, to the extent not so provided, as generally pertain to their respective offices, subject to the control of the Board of Directors. ARTICLE VI - STOCK 6.1 STOCK CERTIFICATES; PARTLY PAID SHARES The shares of the Company shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the Company. Unless otherwise provided by resolution of the Board of Directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of, the Company by any two officers of the Company representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Company with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. The Company shall not have power to issue a certificate in bearer form. The Company may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly-paid shares, or upon the books and records of the Company in the case of uncertificated partly-paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully-paid shares, the Company shall declare a dividend upon partly-paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon. 6.2 SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES If the Company is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the Company shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the DGCL, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the Company shall issue to represent such class or series of stock, a statement that the Company will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock, the registered owner thereof shall be given a notice, in writing or by electronic transmission, containing the information required to be set forth or stated on certificates pursuant to this Section 6.2 or Sections 156, 202(a), 218(a) - 17 - or 364 of the DGCL or with respect to this Section 6.2 a statement that the Company will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the rights and obligations of the holders of uncertificated stock and the rights and obligations of the holders of certificates representing stock of the same class and series shall be identical. 6.3 LOST CERTIFICATES Except as provided in this Section 6.3, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the Company and cancelled at the same time. The Company may issue a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Company may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owners legal representative, to give the Company a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares. 6.4 DIVIDENDS The Board of Directors, subject to any restrictions contained in the certificate of incorporation or applicable law, may declare and pay dividends upon the shares of the Companys capital stock. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the Companys capital stock, subject to the provisions of the certificate of incorporation. The Board of Directors may set apart out of any of the funds of the Company available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may abolish any such reserve. 6.5 TRANSFER OF STOCK Transfers of record of shares of stock of the Company shall be made only upon its books by the holders thereof, in person or by an attorney duly authorized, and, if such stock is certificated, upon the surrender of a certificate or certificates for a like number of shares, properly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority to transfer. 6.6 STOCK TRANSFER AGREEMENTS The Company shall have power to enter into and perform any agreement with any number of stockholders of any one or more classes of stock of the Company to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the Company of any one or more classes owned by such stockholders in any manner not prohibited by the DGCL. 6.7 REGISTERED STOCKHOLDERS The Company: (a) shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and notices and to vote as such owner; and - 18 - (b) shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of another person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware. ARTICLE VII - MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE AND WAIVER 7.1 NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDERS MEETINGS Notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be given in the manner set forth in the DGCL. 7.2 NOTICE TO STOCKHOLDERS SHARING AN ADDRESS Except as otherwise prohibited under the DGCL, without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Company under the provisions of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Company. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Company, within 60 days of having been given written notice by the Company of its intention to send the single notice, shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice. This Section 7.2 shall not apply to Sections 164, 296, 311, 312 or 324 of the DGCL. 7.3 NOTICE TO PERSON WITH WHOM COMMUNICATION IS UNLAWFUL Whenever notice is required to be given, under the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the Company is such as to require the filing of a certificate under the DGCL, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful. 7.4 WAIVER OF NOTICE Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. - 19 - ARTICLE VIII - INDEMNIFICATION 8.1 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS IN THIRD PARTY PROCEEDINGS Subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII, the Company shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as now or hereinafter in effect, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a Proceeding) (other than an action by or in the right of the Company) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company, or is or was a director or officer of the Company serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such Proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such persons conduct was unlawful. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such persons conduct was unlawful. 8.2 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS IN ACTIONS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE COMPANY Subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII, the Company shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as now or hereinafter in effect, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company, or is or was a director or officer of the Company serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such Proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. 8.3 SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE To the extent that a present or former director or officer (for purposes of this Section 8.3 only, as such term is defined in Section 145(c)(1) of the DGCL) of the Company has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described in Section 8.1 or Section 8.2, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. The - 20 - Company may indemnify any other person who is not a present or former director or officer of the Company against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person to the extent he or she has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any suit or proceeding described in Section 8.1 or Section 8.2, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein. 8.4 INDEMNIFICATION OF OTHERS Subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII, the Company shall have power to indemnify its employees and agents, or any other persons, to the extent not prohibited by the DGCL or other applicable law. The Board of Directors shall have the power to delegate to any person or persons identified in subsections (1) through (4) of Section 145(d) of the DGCL the determination of whether employees or agents shall be indemnified. 8.5 ADVANCED PAYMENT OF EXPENSES Expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by an officer or director of the Company in defending any Proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding upon receipt of a written request therefor (together with documentation reasonably evidencing such expenses) and an undertaking by or on behalf of the person to repay such amounts if it shall ultimately be determined that the person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VIII or the DGCL. Such expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents of the Company or by persons serving at the request of the Company as directors, officers, employees or agents of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Company deems appropriate. The right to advancement of expenses shall not apply to any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to these bylaws, but shall apply to any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) referenced in Section 8.6(b) or 8.6(c) prior to a determination that the person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to Section 8.8, no advance shall be made by the Company to an officer of the Company (except by reason of the fact that such officer is or was a director of the Company, in which event this paragraph shall not apply) in any Proceeding if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (a) by a vote of the directors who are not parties to such Proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (b) by a committee of such directors designated by the vote of the majority of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (c) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. - 21 - 8.6 LIMITATION ON INDEMNIFICATION Subject to the requirements in Section 8.3 and the DGCL, the Company shall not be obligated to indemnify any person pursuant to this Article VIII in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding): (a) for which payment has actually been made to or on behalf of such person under any statute, insurance policy, indemnity provision, vote or otherwise, except with respect to any excess beyond the amount paid; (b) for an accounting or disgorgement of profits pursuant to Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act, or similar provisions of federal, state or local statutory law or common law, if such person is held liable therefor (including pursuant to any settlement arrangements); (c) for any reimbursement of the Company by such person of any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation or of any profits realized by such person from the sale of securities of the Company, as required in each case under the 1934 Act (including any such reimbursements that arise from an accounting restatement of the Company pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), or the payment to the Company of profits arising from the purchase and sale by such person of securities in violation of Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), if such person is held liable therefor (including pursuant to any settlement arrangements); (d) initiated by such person, including any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by such person against the Company or its directors, officers, employees, agents or other indemnitees, unless (i) the Board of Directors authorized the Proceeding (or the relevant part of the Proceeding) prior to its initiation, (ii) the Company provides the indemnification, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Company under applicable law, (iii) otherwise required to be made under Section 8.7 or (iv) otherwise required by applicable law; or (e) if prohibited by applicable law. 8.7 DETERMINATION; CLAIM If a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article VIII is not paid in full within 90 days after receipt by the Company of the written request therefor, the claimant shall be entitled to an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction of his or her entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of expenses. The Company shall indemnify such person against any and all expenses that are actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any action for indemnification or advancement of expenses from the Company under this Article VIII, to the extent such person is successful in such action, and to the extent not prohibited by law. In any such suit, the Company shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, have the burden of proving that the claimant is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses. 8.8 NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or - 22 - advancement of expenses may be entitled under the certificate of incorporation or any statute, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such persons official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. The Company is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advancement of expenses, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL or other applicable law. 8.9 INSURANCE The Company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of the DGCL. 8.10 SURVIVAL The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this Article VIII shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. 8.11 EFFECT OF REPEAL OR MODIFICATION A right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses arising under a provision of the certificate of incorporation or a bylaw shall not be eliminated or impaired by an amendment to or repeal or elimination of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws after the occurrence of the act or omission that is the subject of the civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is sought, unless the provision in effect at the time of such act or omission explicitly authorizes such elimination or impairment after such action or omission has occurred. 8.12 CERTAIN DEFINITIONS For purposes of this Article VIII, references to the Company shall include, in addition to the resulting company, any constituent company (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent company, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the resulting or surviving company as such person would have with respect to such constituent company if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this Article VIII, references to other enterprises shall include employee benefit plans; references to fines shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to serving at the request of the Company shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted - 23 - in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interests of the Company as referred to in this Article VIII. ARTICLE IX - GENERAL MATTERS 9.1 EXECUTION OF CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS Except as otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the Board of Directors may authorize any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any document or instrument in the name of and on behalf of the Company; such authority may be general or confined to specific instances. Unless so authorized or ratified by the Board of Directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the Company by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount. 9.2 FISCAL YEAR The fiscal year of the Company shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors and may be changed by the Board of Directors. 9.3 SEAL The Company may adopt a corporate seal, which shall be adopted and which may be altered by the Board of Directors. The Company may use the corporate seal by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or in any other manner reproduced. 9.4 CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions in the DGCL shall govern the construction of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term person includes a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, and a natural person. Any reference in these bylaws to a section of the DGCL shall be deemed to refer to such section as amended from time to time and any successor provisions thereto. 9.5 FORUM SELECTION Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another State court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, stockholder, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Companys stockholders, (c) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time) or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (a) through (d) above, any claim - 24 - as to which such court determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of such court (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of such court within 10 days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than such court or for which such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any security of the Company shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Section 9.5. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Section 9.5 shall apply to any action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the 1934 Act or any successor thereto. ARTICLE X - AMENDMENTS These bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of outstanding voting securities, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders of the Company to alter, amend or repeal, or adopt any bylaw inconsistent with, the following provisions of these bylaws: Article II, Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.11 of Article III, Article VIII, Section 9.5 of Article IX or this Article X (including, without limitation, any such Article or Section as renumbered as a result of any amendment, alteration, change, repeal, or adoption of any other Bylaw).

RECITALS WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, certain of the Investors are purchasing shares of the Companys Series F Preferred Stock (the Series F Preferred and collectively with the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock, the Series D Preferred Stock and the Series E Preferred Stock, the Series Preferred) pursuant to that certain Series F Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) dated as of even date herewith (the Financing); WHEREAS, certain of the Investors and the Common Holders are parties to the Fourth Amended and Restated Investor Rights Agreement dated March 19, 2020 by and among the Company and the parties thereto (the Prior Agreement); WHEREAS, in connection with the consummation of the Financing, the parties to the Prior Agreement desire to amend and restate that agreement to provide those Investors purchasing shares of the Companys Series F Preferred with registration rights, information rights and other rights as set forth herein in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and WHEREAS, the obligations in the Purchase Agreement are conditioned upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: |Section|| | 1. GENERAL. 1.1 Definitions. As used in this Agreement the following terms shall have the following respective meanings: (a) Acquisition has the meaning set forth in the Certificate. (b) Affiliate means, with respect to any specified Person, any other Person who, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such Person, including, without limitation, any general partner, managing member, officer or director of such Person or any venture capital fund now or hereafter existing that is controlled by or under common control with one or more general partners or managing members of, or shares the same management company with, such Person. -1- (c) Asset Sale has the meaning set forth in the Certificate.

(x) Special Registration Statement shall mean (i) a registration statement relating to any employee benefit plan or (ii) with respect to any corporate reorganization or transaction under Rule 145 of the Securities Act, any registration statements related to the issuance or resale of securities issued in such a transaction or (iii) a registration related to stock issued upon conversion of debt securities. |Section|| | 2. REGISTRATION; RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER. 2.1 Restrictions on Transfer. (a) Each Holder agrees not to make any disposition of all or any portion of the Shares or Registrable Securities unless and until: (i) there is then in effect a registration statement under the Securities Act covering such proposed disposition and such disposition is made in accordance with such registration statement; or (ii) (A) The transferee has agreed in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, (B) such Holder shall have notified the Company of the proposed disposition and shall have furnished the Company with a detailed statement of the circumstances surrounding the proposed disposition, and (C) if reasonably requested by the Company, such Holder shall have furnished the Company with an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that such disposition will not require registration of such shares under the Securities Act and applicable state and foreign securities law. It is agreed that the Company will not require opinions of counsel for transactions made pursuant to Rule 144, except in unusual circumstances. After the Qualified Offering, the Company will not require any transferee pursuant to Rule 144 to be bound by the terms of this Agreement if the shares so transferred do not remain Registrable Securities hereunder following such transfer. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) above, no such restriction shall apply to a transfer by a Holder that is (i) a partnership transferring to its partners or former partners in accordance with partnership interests, (ii) a corporation transferring to any Affiliates of the Holder, (iii) a limited liability company transferring to its members or former members in accordance with their interest in the limited liability company, (iv) an individual transferring to the Holders family members or trust or other entity for the benefit of an individual Holder or his family members, or (v) a trust transferring to its grantors or beneficiaries; provided that in each case the transferee will agree in writing to be subject to the terms of this Agreement to the same extent as if he were an original Holder hereunder. -4- (c) Each certificate representing Shares or Registrable Securities shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with legends substantially similar to the following (in addition to any legend required under applicable state securities laws): THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE ACT) AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS AND UNTIL REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT OR UNLESS THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED AN OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY AND ITS COUNSEL THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED. THE SALE, PLEDGE, HYPOTHECATION OR TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A CERTAIN INVESTOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT BY AND BETWEEN THE STOCKHOLDER AND THE COMPANY AS MAY BE AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME. COPIES OF SUCH AGREEMENT MAY BE OBTAINED UPON WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE SECRETARY OF THE COMPANY. (d) The Company shall be obligated to reissue promptly unlegended certificates at the request of any Holder thereof if the Company has completed its Qualified Offering and the Holder shall have obtained an opinion of counsel (which counsel may be counsel to the Company) reasonably acceptable to the Company to the effect that the securities proposed to be disposed of may lawfully be so disposed of without registration, qualification and legend; provided that the second legend listed above shall be removed only at such time as the Holder of such certificate is no longer subject to any restrictions hereunder. (e) Any legend endorsed on an instrument pursuant to applicable state securities laws and the stop-transfer instructions with respect to such securities shall be removed upon receipt by the Company of an order of the appropriate blue sky authority authorizing such removal. 2.2 Demand Registration. (a) Subject to the conditions of this Section 2.2, if the Company shall receive a written request from the Investors holding at least thirty percent (30%) of the Registrable Securities then outstanding and held by the Investors (the Initiating Holders), that the Company file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the registration of all or any portion of the Registrable Securities then outstanding having -5- an aggregate offering price, after deduction of underwriting discounts and commissions, of at least $10,000,000, then the Company shall, within ten (10) days of the receipt thereof, give written notice of such request to all Holders, and subject to the limitations of this Section 2.2, effect, as expeditiously as reasonably possible, the registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable Securities that all Holders request to be registered. (b) If the Initiating Holders intend to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise the Company as a part of their request made pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any request pursuant to Section 2.4 and the Company shall include such information in the written notice referred to in Section 2.2(a) or Section 2.4(a), as applicable. In such event, the right of any Holder to include its Registrable Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such Holders participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holders Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. All Holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by the Company (which underwriter or underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities held by all Initiating Holders). If the underwriter advises the Company that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of securities to be underwritten (including Registrable Securities) then the Company shall so advise all Holders of Registrable Securities that would otherwise be underwritten pursuant hereto, and the number of shares that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated to the Holders of such Registrable Securities on a pro rata basis based on the number of Registrable Securities held by all such Holders (including the Initiating Holders) or in such other proportion as shall mutually be agreed to by all such selling Holders; provided, however, that the number of shares of Registrable Securities to be included in such underwriting and registration by the Investors shall not be reduced unless all other securities of the Company are first entirely excluded from the underwriting and registration. Any Registrable Securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from the registration. (c) The Company shall not be required to effect a registration pursuant to this Section 2.2: (i) prior to the earlier of (A) the five year anniversary of the date of this Agreement, or (B) six (6) months following the effective date of the registration statement of the Qualified Offering; (ii) after the Company has effected two (2) registrations pursuant to this Section 2.2, and such registrations have been declared or ordered effective; (iii) during the period starting with the date of filing of, and ending on the date one hundred eighty (180) days following the effective date of the registration statement pertaining to Company-initiated registration (or such longer period as may be determined pursuant to Section 2.11 hereof); provided, that the Company makes reasonable good faith efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; -6- (iv) if within thirty (30) days of receipt of a written request from Initiating Holders pursuant to Section 2.2(a), the Company gives notice to the Holders of the Companys intention to file a registration statement for its Qualified Offering within ninety (90) days, provided, that the Company is actively employing in good faith commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; (v) if the Company shall furnish to Holders requesting a registration statement pursuant to this Section 2.2 a certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board, it would be materially detrimental to the Company and its stockholders for such registration statement to be effected at such time, because such action would (i) materially interfere with a significant acquisition, corporate reorganization, or other similar transaction involving the Company; (ii) require premature disclosure of material information that the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential; or (iii) render the Company unable to comply with requirements under the Securities Act or Exchange Act, then the Company shall have the right to defer such filing for a period of not more than ninety (90) days after receipt of the request of the Initiating Holders; provided that such right to delay a request shall be exercised by the Company not more than once in any twelve (12) month period; (vi) if the Initiating Holders propose to dispose of shares of Registrable Securities that may be immediately registered on Form S-3 pursuant to a request made pursuant to Section 2.4 below; (vii) in any particular jurisdiction in which the Company would be required to execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such registration, qualification, or compliance, unless the Company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the Securities Act; (viii) if the Initiating Holders do not request that such offering be firmly underwritten by underwriters selected by the Initiating Holders (subject to the consent of the Company); or (ix) if the Company and the Initiating Holders are unable to obtain the commitment of the underwriter described in clause (c)(viii) above to firmly underwrite the offer. 2.3 Piggyback Registrations. The Company shall notify all Holders of Registrable Securities in writing at least fifteen (15) days prior to the filing of any registration statement under the Securities Act for purposes of a public offering of securities of the Company (including, but not limited to, registration statements relating to secondary offerings of securities of the Company, but excluding Special Registration Statements) and will afford each such Holder an opportunity to include in such registration statement all or part of such Registrable Securities held by such Holder. Each Holder desiring to include in any such registration statement all or any part of the Registrable Securities held by it shall, within fifteen (15) days after the above-described notice from the Company, so notify the Company in writing. Such notice shall state the intended method of disposition of the Registrable Securities by such Holder. If a Holder decides -7- not to include all of its Registrable Securities in any registration statement thereafter filed by the Company, such Holder shall nevertheless continue to have the right to include any Registrable Securities in any subsequent registration statement or registration statements as may be filed by the Company with respect to offerings of its securities, all upon the terms and conditions set forth herein. (a) Underwriting. If the registration statement of which the Company gives notice under this Section 2.3 is for an underwritten offering, the Company shall so advise the Holders of Registrable Securities. In such event, the right of any such Holder to include Registrable Securities in a registration pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be conditioned upon such Holders participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holders Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. All Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through such underwriting shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the underwriter determines in good faith that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, the number of shares that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated, first, to the Company; second, to the Holders who are Investors on a pro rata basis based on the total number of Registrable Securities held by such Holders; third to the Holders who are Common Holders on a pro rata basis based on the total Registrable Securities held by such Holders; and fourth, to any stockholder of the Company (other than a Holder) on a pro rata basis; provided, however, that no such reduction shall reduce the amount of securities of the selling Holders who are Investors included in the registration below twenty-five percent (25%) of the total amount of securities included in such registration, unless such offering is the Initial Offering and such registration does not include shares of any other selling stockholders, in which event any or all of the Registrable Securities of the Holders may be excluded in accordance with the immediately preceding clause. If the Holders are so limited, however, no party shall sell shares in such registration other than the Company. In no event will shares of any other selling stockholder be included in such registration that would reduce the number of shares which may be included by Holders without the written consent of Holders of not less than sixty-five percent (65%) of the Registrable Securities proposed to be sold in the offering. If any Holder disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, such Holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the Company and the underwriter, delivered at least ten (10) business days prior to the effective date of the registration statement. Any Registrable Securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be excluded and withdrawn from the registration. For any Holder which is a partnership, limited liability company, corporation, trust or natural person, the partners, retired partners, members, retired members, stockholders, beneficiaries, grantors and family members of such Holder, or the estates and family members of any such partners, retired partners, members, retired members, beneficiaries, grantors and family members and any trusts or other entities for the benefit of any of the foregoing persons shall be deemed to be a single Holder, and any pro rata reduction with respect to such Holder shall be based upon the aggregate amount of shares carrying registration rights owned by all entities and individuals included in such Holder, as defined in this sentence or as otherwise provided in Section 5.10. -8- (b) Right to Terminate Registration. The Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this Section 2.3 prior to the effectiveness of such registration, whether or not any Holder has elected to include securities in such registration, and shall promptly notify any Holder that has elected to include shares in such registration of such termination or withdrawal. The Registration Expenses of such withdrawn registration shall be borne by the Company in accordance with Section 2.5 hereof. 2.4 Form S-3 Registration. In case the Company shall receive from any Holder or Holders of Registrable Securities a written request or requests that the Company effect a registration on Form S-3 (or any successor to Form S-3) or any similar short-form registration statement and any related qualification or compliance with respect to all or a part of the Registrable Securities owned by such Holder or Holders, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to: (a) promptly give written notice of the proposed registration, and any related qualification or compliance, to all other Holders of Registrable Securities; and (b) as soon as practicable, effect such registration and all such qualifications and compliances as may be so requested and as would permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of all or such portion of such Holders or Holders Registrable Securities as are specified in such request, together with all or such portion of the Registrable Securities of any other Holder or Holders joining in such request as are specified in a written request given within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such written notice from the Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to effect any such registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to this Section 2.4: (i) if Form S-3 is not available for such offering by the Holders, or (ii) if the Holders, together with the holders of any other securities of the Company entitled to inclusion in such registration, propose to sell Registrable Securities and such other securities (if any) at an aggregate price to the public of less than one million dollars ($1,000,000), or (iii) if within thirty (30) days of receipt of a written request from any Holder or Holders pursuant to this Section 2.4, the Company gives notice to such Holder or Holders of the Companys intention to make a public offering within ninety (90) days, other than pursuant to a Special Registration Statement; (iv) if the Company shall furnish to the Holders a certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board, it would be materially detrimental to the Company and its stockholders for such Form S-3 registration to be effected at such time, because such action would (i) materially interfere with a significant acquisition, corporate reorganization, or other similar transaction involving the Company; (ii) require premature disclosure of material information that the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential; or (iii) render -9- the Company unable to comply with requirements under the Securities Act or Exchange Act, then the Company shall have the right to defer the filing of the Form S-3 registration statement for a period of not more than ninety (90) days after receipt of the request of the Holder or Holders under this Section 2.4; provided, that such right to delay a request shall be exercised by the Company not more than once in any twelve (12) month period; (v) if, in a given twelve (12) month period, the Company has effected two (2) such registrations; or (vi) in any particular jurisdiction in which the Company would be required to execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such registration, qualification, or compliance, unless the Company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the Securities Act. (c) Subject to the foregoing, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file a Form S-3 registration statement covering the Registrable Securities and other securities so requested to be registered as soon as practicable after receipt of the requests of the Holders. Registrations effected pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall not be counted as demands for registration or registrations effected pursuant to Section 2.2. All Registration Expenses incurred in connection with registrations requested pursuant to this Section 2.4, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, shall be paid by the Company, including the expense of one (1) special counsel of the selling stockholders up to a maximum of $75,000 per registration. 2.5 Expenses of Registration. Except as specifically provided herein, all Registration Expenses, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, incurred in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to Section 2.2, 2.3 or 2.4 herein shall be borne by the Company. All Selling Expenses incurred in connection with any registrations hereunder, shall be borne by the holders of the securities so registered pro rata on the basis of the number of shares so registered. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay for expenses of any registration proceeding begun pursuant to Section 2.2 or 2.4, the request of which has been subsequently withdrawn by the Initiating Holders or the S-3 Initiating Holders, as the case may be, unless (a) the withdrawal is based upon material adverse information concerning the Company of which the Initiating Holders were not aware at the time of such request or (b) the Investors holding a majority of Registrable Securities held by the Investors agree to deem such registration to have been effected as of the date of such withdrawal for purposes of determining whether the Company shall be obligated pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or 2.4(b), as applicable, to undertake any subsequent registration, in which event such right shall be forfeited by all Investors. If the Holders are required to pay the Registration Expenses, such expenses shall be borne by the holders of securities (including Registrable Securities) requesting such registration in proportion to the number of shares for which registration was requested. If the Company is required to pay the Registration Expenses of a withdrawn offering pursuant to clause (a) above, then such registration shall not be deemed to have been effected for purposes of determining whether the Company shall be obligated pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or 2.4(b), as applicable, to undertake any subsequent registration. -10- 2.6 Obligations of the Company. Whenever required to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, the Company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible use commercially reasonable efforts to: (a) prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective, and, upon the request of the Holders of sixty-five percent (65%) of the Registrable Securities registered thereunder, keep such registration statement effective for up to thirty (30) days or, if earlier, until the Holder or Holders have completed the distribution related thereto; provided, however, that at any time, upon written notice to the participating Holders and for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days thereafter (the Suspension Period), the Company may delay the filing or effectiveness of any registration statement or suspend the use or effectiveness of any registration statement (and the Initiating Holders hereby agree not to offer or sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration statement during the Suspension Period) if the Company reasonably believes that there is or may be in existence material nonpublic information or events involving the Company, the failure of which to be disclosed in the prospectus included in the registration statement could result in a Violation (as defined below). In the event that the Company shall exercise its right to delay or suspend the filing or effectiveness of a registration hereunder, the applicable time period during which the registration statement is to remain effective shall be extended by a period of time equal to the duration of the Suspension Period. The Company may extend the Suspension Period for an additional consecutive sixty (60) days with the consent of the holders of sixty-five percent (65%) of the Registrable Securities registered under the applicable registration statement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. No more than one (1) such Suspension Period shall occur in any twelve (12) month period. In no event shall any Suspension Period, when taken together with all prior Suspension Periods, exceed 120 days in the aggregate. If so directed by the Company, all Holders registering shares under such registration statement shall (i) not offer to sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement during the period in which the delay or suspension is in effect after receiving notice of such delay or suspension; and (ii) use their best efforts to deliver to the Company (at the Companys expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Holders possession, of the prospectus relating to such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to file, cause to become effective or maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement other than a registration statement on Form S-3 that contemplates a distribution of securities on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act; (b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement for the period set forth in subsection (a) above; -11- (c) furnish to the Holders such number of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act, and such other documents as they may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of Registrable Securities owned by them; (d) register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the Holders; provided that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions; (e) in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with the managing underwriter(s) of such offering. Each Holder participating in such underwriting shall also enter into and perform its obligations under such an agreement; (f) notify each Holder of Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing. The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to amend or supplement such prospectus in order to cause such prospectus not to include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing; and (g) furnish, on the date that such Registrable Securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale, if such securities are being sold through underwriters, (i) an opinion, dated as of such date, of the counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such registration, in form and substance as is customarily given to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and (ii) a letter, dated as of such date, from the independent certified public accountants of the Company, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering addressed to the underwriters. 2.7 Delay of Registration; Furnishing Information. (a) No Holder shall have any right to obtain or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any such registration as the result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or implementation of this Section 2. (b) It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to take any action pursuant to Section 2.2, 2.3 or 2.4 that the selling Holders shall furnish to the Company in writing such information regarding themselves, the Registrable Securities held by them and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall be reasonably necessary to effect the registration of their Registrable Securities. -12- (c) The Company shall have no obligation with respect to any registration requested pursuant to Section 2.2 or Section 2.4 if the number of shares or the anticipated aggregate offering price of the Registrable Securities to be included in the registration does not equal or exceed the number of shares or the anticipated aggregate offering price required to originally trigger the Companys obligation to initiate such registration as specified in Section 2.2 or Section 2.4, whichever is applicable. 2.8 Indemnification. In the event any Registrable Securities are included in a registration statement under Sections 2.2, 2.3 or 2.4: (a) To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, the partners, members, trustees, managers, officers and directors of each Holder, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) for such Holder and each Person, if any, who controls such Holder or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively a Violation) by the Company: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement or incorporated by reference therein, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state securities law in connection with the offering covered by such registration statement; and the Company will reimburse each such Holder, partner, member, trustee, manager, officer, director, underwriter or controlling Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if it is judicially determined that there was a Violation; provided however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 2.8(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, nor shall the Company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by such Holder, partner, member, trustee, manager, officer, director, underwriter or controlling Person of such Holder. -13- (b) To the extent permitted by law, each Holder will, if Registrable Securities held by such Holder are included in the securities as to which such registration, qualifications or compliance is being effected, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, its officers and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, any underwriter and any other Holder selling securities under such registration statement or any of such other Holders partners, trustees, managers, directors or officers or any Person who controls such Holder, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which the Company or any such director, officer, trustee, manager, controlling Person, underwriter or other such Holder, or partner, director, officer, trustee, manager, or controlling Person of such other Holder may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement or incorporated reference therein, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state securities law in connection with the offering covered by such registration statement (collectively, a Holder Violation), in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Holder Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such Holder under an instrument duly executed by such Holder and stated to be specifically for use in connection with such registration; and each such Holder will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer, controlling Person, underwriter or other Holder, or partner, trustee, manager, officer, director or controlling Person of such other Holder in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if it is judicially determined that there was such a Holder Violation; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 2.8(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided further, that in no event shall any indemnity under this Section 2.8 exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such Holder. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 2.8 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 2.8, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses thereof to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this Section 2.8 to the extent, and only to the extent, if materially prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 2.8. -14- (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 2.8 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall to the extent permitted by applicable law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the Violation(s) or Holder Violation(s) that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by a court of law by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, that in no event shall any contribution by a Holder hereunder exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such Holder. (e) The obligations of the Company and Holders under this Section 2.8 shall survive completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a registration statement and, with respect to liability arising from an offering to which this Section 2.8 would apply that is covered by a registration filed before termination of this Agreement, such termination. No indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. 2.9 Assignment of Registration Rights. The rights to cause the Company to register Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 2 may be assigned by a Holder to a transferee or assignee of Registrable Securities (for so long as such shares remain Registrable Securities) that is (a) any partner or retired partner of any holder which is a partnership, (b) any member or former member, of any holder which is a limited liability company, (c) any Affiliate of any Holder; (d) any family member or trust or other entity for the benefit of any individual holder or his family members, (e) any grantor or beneficiary of any holder which is a trust or (f) any transferee who acquires at least 500,000 shares of Registrable Securities (as adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, combination, or other recapitalization or reclassification effected after the date hereof); provided, however, (i) the transferor shall, within ten (10) days after such transfer, furnish to the Company written notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned and (ii) such transferee agrees in writing to be subject to all restrictions set forth in this Agreement. -15- 2.10 Limitation on Subsequent Registration Rights. Other than as provided in Section 5.10, after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the holders of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the then outstanding shares of Series Preferred, voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis (collectively, the Requisite Holders), enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the Company that would grant such holder rights to demand the registration of shares of the Companys capital stock, or to include such shares in a registration statement that would reduce the number of shares includable by the Holders. 2.11 Market Stand-Off Agreement. Each party to this Agreement hereby agrees that such party shall not lend, offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right, or warrant to purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable (directly or indirectly) for Common Stock during the 180-day period following the effective date of the Initial Offering (or such longer period, not to exceed 15 days after the expiration of the 180-day period, as the underwriters or the Company shall request in order to facilitate compliance with NASD Rules that are then applicable to the Company); provided, that all officers and directors of the Company and holders of at least one percent (1%) of the Companys voting securities are bound by and have entered into similar agreements. The obligations described in this Section 2.11 shall not apply to a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans on Form S-1 or Form S-8 or similar forms that may be promulgated in the future, or a registration relating solely to a transaction on Form S-4 or similar forms that may be promulgated in the future. 2.12 Agreement to Furnish Information. Each Holder agrees to execute and deliver such other agreements as may be reasonably requested by the Company or the underwriter that are consistent with the Holders obligations under Section 2.11 or that are necessary to give further effect thereto. In addition, if requested by the Company or the representative of the underwriters of Common Stock (or other securities) of the Company, each Holder shall provide, within ten (10) days of such request, such information as may be required by the Company or such representative in connection with the completion of any public offering of the Companys securities pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act. The obligations described in Section 2.11 and this Section 2.12 shall not apply to a Special Registration Statement. The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the shares of Common Stock (or other securities) subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of the 180-day or longer period specified in Section 2.11. Each Holder agrees that any transferee of any shares of Registrable Securities shall be bound by Sections 2.11 and 2.12. The underwriters of the Companys stock are intended third party beneficiaries of Sections 2.11 and 2.12 and shall have the right, power and authority to enforce the provisions hereof as though they were a party hereto. -16- 2.13 Rule 144 Reporting. With a view to making available to the Holders the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC which may permit the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to: (a) Make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in SEC Rule 144 or any similar or analogous rule promulgated under the Securities Act, at all times after the effective date of the first registration filed by the Company for an offering of its securities to the general public; (b) File with the SEC, in a timely manner, all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Exchange Act; and (c) So long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish to such Holder forthwith upon request: a written statement by the Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of said Rule 144 of the Securities Act, and of the Exchange Act (at any time after it has become subject to such reporting requirements); a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company filed with the Commission; and such other reports and documents as a Holder may reasonably request in connection with availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing it to sell any such securities without registration and which the Company is able to provide without unreasonable effort or expense.

Each Major Investor and its representatives (including without limitation, its lawyers and accountants) that is not a former officer or employee of, or consultant to, the Company shall have the right to visit and inspect any of the properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the Company or any of its subsidiaries with its officers, and to review such information as is reasonably requested all at such reasonable times and as often as may be reasonably requested; provided, however, that the Company (as determined in good faith by the Board) shall not be obligated under this Section 3.2 with respect to a competitor of the Company or with respect to information which the Board determines in good faith is confidential or attorney-client privileged and should not, therefore, be disclosed. 3.3 Confidentiality of Records. Each Investor agrees that such Investor will keep confidential and will not disclose, divulge, or use for any purpose (other than to monitor its investment in the Company) any information furnished to such Investor that the Company marked or identified orally or in writing as being confidential or proprietary (so long as such information is not in the public domain), except that such Investor may disclose such proprietary or confidential information (i) to any partner, member, grantor, beneficiary, family member, subsidiary or parent of such Investor as long as such partner, member, grantor, beneficiary, family member, subsidiary or parent is advised of and agrees or has agreed to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of this Section 3.3 or comparable restrictions; (ii) at such time as it enters the public domain through no fault of such Investor; (iii) that is communicated to it free of any obligation of confidentiality; (iv) that is developed by such Investor or its agents independently of and without reference to any confidential information communicated by the Company; or (v) as required by applicable law. The Company acknowledges that certain of the Investors are in the business of venture capital investing and therefore review business plans and related proprietary information of many enterprises, including enterprises that may have products or services that compete directly or indirectly with those of the Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude or in any way restrict any Investor from investing or participating in any particular enterprise, regardless of whether such enterprise has products or services that compete with those of the Company so long as such Investor otherwise complies with such Investors nondisclosure and nonuse obligations contained in this Section 3.3. 3.4 Reservation of Common Stock. The Company will at all times reserve and keep available, solely for issuance and delivery upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock, all Common Stock issuable from time to time upon such conversion. 3.5 Equity Incentive Grants; Stock Vesting.

With respect to restricted stock and stock issued as a result of early exercised options, the Companys repurchase option shall provide that, upon termination of the employment of the shareholder, with or without cause, the Company or its assignee (to the extent permissible under applicable securities law qualification) retains the option to repurchase at cost any unvested shares held by such stockholder. -19- 3.6 Increases to Equity Incentive Plan. Any increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Companys 2010 Equity Incentive Plan or the establishment of any new employee stock option plan, employee stock purchase plan, employee restricted stock plan or other similar stock plan shall require prior approval of the Board, including at least two (2) Preferred Directors. 3.7 Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement.

The Company hereby agrees that, to the extent permitted under applicable law, no VC Investor shall be liable to the Company for any claim arising out of, or based upon, (a) the investment by such VC Investor in any entity competitive with the Company, or (b) actions taken by any partner, officer or other representative of such VC Investor to assist any such competitive company, whether or not such action was taken as a member of the board of directors of such competitive company or otherwise, and whether or not such action has a detrimental effect on the Company; provided, however that the foregoing shall not relieve (x) such VC Investor or any party from liability associated with the willful misuse of the Companys confidential information obtained pursuant to Section 3.3, or (ii) any director or officer of the Company from any liability associated with his or her fiduciary duties to the Company. -20- 3.11 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Enforcement Actions.

No later than 90 days after the Initial Closing (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) the Company shall cause to be established, and will maintain, an audit and compensation committee, each of which shall consist solely of non-employee directors. 3.14 Termination of Covenants. All covenants of the Company contained in Section 3 of this Agreement (other than the provisions of Sections 3.3, 3.8 and 3.9) shall expire and terminate as to each Investor upon the effective date of the registration statement pertaining to the Qualified Offering. Section 4. RIGHTS TO FUTURE STOCK ISSUANCES. 4.1 Right of First Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 4 and applicable securities laws, each Major Investor that qualifies as an accredited investor under Regulation D of the Securities Act (a Qualified Investor) shall have a right of first offer to purchase its pro rata share of all Equity Securities (as defined below) that the Company may, from time to time, propose to sell and issue after the date of this Agreement, other than the Equity Securities excluded by Section 4.6 hereof. Each Qualified Investors pro rata share is equal to the ratio of (a) the number of shares of the Companys Common Stock (including all shares of Common Stock issuable or issued upon conversion of the Shares or upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options) of which such Qualified Investor is a holder or is deemed to be a holder (including by reason of the operation of Section 5.13 hereof) immediately prior to the issuance of such Equity Securities to (b) the total number of shares of the Companys outstanding Common Stock (including all shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the Shares or upon the exercise of any outstanding warrants or options) immediately prior to the issuance of the Equity Securities. The term Equity Securities shall mean (i) any Common Stock, Preferred Stock or other security of the Company, (ii) any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, with or without consideration, any Common Stock, Preferred Stock or other security (including any option to purchase such a convertible security), (iii) any security carrying any warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase any Common Stock, Preferred Stock or other security or (iv) any such warrant or right. -21- 4.2 Exercise of Rights. If the Company proposes to issue any Equity Securities, it shall give written notice to each Qualified Investor stating its intention to offer such Equity Securities, the number of such Equity Securities to be offered, and the price and the terms and conditions upon which the Company proposes to offer such Equity Securities. Each Qualified Investor shall have twenty (20) days from the giving of such notice to agree to purchase its pro rata share of the Equity Securities for the price and upon the terms and conditions specified in the notice by giving written notice to the Company and stating therein the quantity of Equity Securities to be purchased. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to offer or sell such Equity Securities to any Qualified Investor who would cause the Company to be in violation of applicable federal securities laws by virtue of such offer or sale. 4.3 Issuance of Equity Securities to Other Persons. If not all of the Qualified Investors elect to purchase their pro rata share of the Equity Securities, then the Company shall promptly notify in writing the Qualified Investors who do so elect and shall offer such Qualified Investors the right to acquire such unsubscribed shares on a pro rata basis. The Qualified Investors shall have five (5) days after receipt of such notice to notify the Company of its election to purchase all or a portion thereof of the unsubscribed shares. The Company shall have ninety (90) days thereafter to sell the Equity Securities in respect of which the Qualified Investors rights were not exercised, at a price not lower and upon general terms and conditions not materially more favorable to the purchasers thereof than specified in the Companys notice to the Qualified Investors pursuant to Section 4.2 hereof. If the Company has not sold such Equity Securities within such ninety (90) day period, the Company shall not thereafter issue or sell any Equity Securities, without first offering such securities to the Qualified Investors in the manner provided above. 4.4 Termination of Rights of First Offer. The rights of first offer established by this Section 4 shall not apply to, and shall terminate upon the earlier of, (i) the effective date of the registration statement pertaining to the Qualified Offering or (ii) an Acquisition or Asset Sale. 4.5 Assignment of Rights of First Offer. The rights of first offer of each Qualified Investor under this Section 4 may be assigned to the same parties, subject to the same restrictions as any transfer of registration rights pursuant to Section 2.9. 4.6 Excluded Securities. The rights of first offer established by this Section 4 shall have no application to (a) any Equity Securities excluded from the definition of Additional Shares of Common Stock in the Certificate or (b) the shares of Series F Preferred (or Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof) issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, as amended from time to time.

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT This Indemnification Agreement (this Agreement) is dated as of , 20 and is between Udemy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company), and (Indemnitee). RECITALS A. Indemnitees service to the Company substantially benefits the Company. B. Individuals are reluctant to serve as directors or officers of corporations or in certain other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance or indemnification against the risks of claims and actions against them arising out of such service. C. Indemnitee does not regard the protection currently provided by applicable law, the Companys governing documents and any insurance as adequate under the present circumstances, and Indemnitee may not be willing to serve as a director or officer without additional protection. D. In order to induce Indemnitee to continue to provide services to the Company, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company to contractually obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf of, Indemnitee as permitted by applicable law. E. This Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the indemnification provided in the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and this Agreement shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor shall this Agreement be deemed to limit, diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder. The parties therefore agree as follows: 1. Definitions. (a) A Change in Control shall be deemed to occur upon the earliest to occur after the date of this Agreement of any of the following events: (i) Acquisition of Stock by Third Party. Any Person (as defined below) becomes the Beneficial Owner (as defined below), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined voting power of the Companys then outstanding securities; (ii) Change in Board Composition. During any period of two consecutive years (not including any period prior to the execution of this Agreement), individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Companys board of directors, and any new directors (other than a director designated by a person who has entered into an agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described in Sections 1(a)(i), 1(a)(iii) or 1(a)(iv)) whose election by the board of directors or nomination for election by the Companys stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the members of the Companys board of directors; (iii) Corporate Transactions. The effective date of a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other entity, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than 50% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation and with the power to elect at least a majority of the board of directors or other governing body of such surviving entity; (iv) Liquidation. The approval by the stockholders of the Company of a complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Companys assets; and (v) Other Events. Any other event of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A (or in response to any similar item on any similar schedule or form) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, whether or not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement. For purposes of this Section 1(a), the following terms shall have the following meanings: (1) Person shall have the meaning as set forth in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; provided, however, that Person shall exclude (i) the Company, (ii) any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company, and (iii) any corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company. (2) Beneficial Owner shall have the meaning given to such term in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; provided, however, that Beneficial Owner shall exclude any Person otherwise becoming a Beneficial Owner by reason of (i) the stockholders of the Company approving a merger of the Company with another entity or (ii) the Companys board of directors approving a sale of securities by the Company to such Person. (b) Corporate Status describes the status of a person who is or was a director, trustee, general partner, managing member, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company or any other Enterprise. (c) DGCL means the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. (d) Disinterested Director means a director of the Company who is not and was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought by Indemnitee. (e) Enterprise means the Company and any other corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, trustee, general partner, managing member, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary.

(g) Independent Counsel means a law firm, or a partner or member of a law firm, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and neither presently is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent (i) the Company or Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party (other than as Independent Counsel with respect to matters concerning Indemnitee under this Agreement, or other indemnitees under similar indemnification agreements), or (ii) any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term Independent Counsel shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitees rights under this Agreement. (h) Proceeding means any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, arbitration, mediation, alternate dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, inquiry, administrative hearing or proceeding, whether brought in the right of the Company or otherwise and whether of a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative nature, including any appeal therefrom and including without limitation any such Proceeding pending as of the date of this Agreement, in which Indemnitee was, is or will be involved as a party, a potential party, a non-party witness or otherwise by reason of (i) the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the Company, (ii) any action taken by Indemnitee or any action or inaction on Indemnitees part while acting as a director or officer of the Company, or (iii) the fact that he or she is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, trustee, general partner, managing member, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company or any other Enterprise, in each case whether or not serving in such capacity at the time any liability or Expense is incurred for which indemnification or advancement of expenses can be provided under this Agreement.

Pursuant to this Section 2, Indemnitee shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on his or her behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. 3. Indemnity in Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company. The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3 if Indemnitee is, or is threatened -3- to be made, a party to or a participant in any Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this Section 3, Indemnitee shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitees behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. No indemnification for Expenses shall be made under this Section 3 in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be liable to the Company, unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or any court in which the Proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such expenses as the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. 4. Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly Successful. To the extent that Indemnitee is a party to or a participant in and is successful (on the merits or otherwise) in defense of any Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitees behalf in connection therewith. For purposes of this section, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter. 5. Indemnification for Expenses of a Witness. To the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, a witness in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not a party, Indemnitee shall be indemnified to the extent permitted by applicable law against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitees behalf in connection therewith. 6. Additional Indemnification. (a) Notwithstanding any limitation in Sections 2, 3 or 4, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law if Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any Proceeding (including a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor) against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on his or her behalf in connection with the Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein. (b) For purposes of Section 6(a), the meaning of the phrase to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law shall include, but not be limited to: (i) the fullest extent permitted by the provision of the DGCL that authorizes or contemplates additional indemnification by agreement, or the corresponding provision of any amendment to or replacement of the DGCL; and (ii) the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which a corporation may indemnify its officers and directors. -4- 7. Exclusions. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated under this Agreement to make any indemnity in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding): (a) for which payment has actually been made to or on behalf of Indemnitee under any statute, insurance policy, indemnity provision, vote or otherwise, except with respect to any excess beyond the amount paid; (b) for an accounting or disgorgement of profits pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or similar provisions of federal, state or local statutory law or common law, if Indemnitee is held liable therefor (including pursuant to any settlement arrangements); (c) for any reimbursement of the Company by Indemnitee of any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation or of any profits realized by Indemnitee from the sale of securities of the Company, as required in each case under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including any such reimbursements that arise from an accounting restatement of the Company pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), or the payment to the Company of profits arising from the purchase and sale by Indemnitee of securities in violation of Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), if Indemnitee is held liable therefor (including pursuant to any settlement arrangements); (d) initiated by Indemnitee, including any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or its directors, officers, employees, agents or other indemnitees, unless (i) the Companys board of directors authorized the Proceeding (or the relevant part of the Proceeding) prior to its initiation, (ii) the Company provides the indemnification, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Company under applicable law, (iii) otherwise authorized in Section 12(d) or (iv) otherwise required by applicable law; or (e) if prohibited by applicable law. 8. Advances of Expenses. The Company shall advance the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding prior to its final disposition, and such advancement shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than 90 days, after the receipt by the Company of a written statement or statements requesting such advances from time to time (which shall include invoices received by Indemnitee in connection with such Expenses but, in the case of invoices in connection with legal services, any references to legal work performed or to expenditure made that would cause Indemnitee to waive any privilege accorded by applicable law shall not be included with the invoice). Advances shall be unsecured and interest free and made without regard to Indemnitees ability to repay such advances. Indemnitee hereby undertakes to repay any advance to the extent that it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company. This Section 8 shall not apply to the extent advancement is prohibited by law and shall not apply to any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) for which indemnity is not permitted under this Agreement, but shall apply to any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) referenced in Section 7(b) or 7(c) prior to a determination that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company. 9. Procedures for Notification and Defense of Claim. (a) Indemnitee shall notify the Company in writing of any matter with respect to which Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification or advancement of Expenses as soon as reasonably practicable following the receipt by Indemnitee of notice thereof. The written notification to the Company shall include, in reasonable detail, a description of the nature of the Proceeding and the facts underlying the Proceeding. The failure by Indemnitee to notify the Company will not relieve the Company from any liability which it may have to Indemnitee hereunder or otherwise than under this Agreement, and any delay in so notifying the Company shall not constitute a waiver by Indemnitee of any rights, except to the extent that such failure or delay materially prejudices the Company. -5- (b) If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a Proceeding pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company has directors and officers liability insurance in effect that may be applicable to the Proceeding, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of the Proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the applicable policies. The Company shall thereafter take all commercially-reasonable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies. (c) In the event the Company may be obligated to make any indemnity in connection with a Proceeding, the Company shall be entitled to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel approved by Indemnitee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, upon the delivery to Indemnitee of written notice of its election to do so. After delivery of such notice, approval of such counsel by Indemnitee and the retention of such counsel by the Company, the Company will not be liable to Indemnitee for any fees or expenses of counsel subsequently incurred by Indemnitee with respect to the same Proceeding. Notwithstanding the Companys assumption of the defense of any such Proceeding, the Company shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of Indemnitees separate counsel to the extent (i) the employment of separate counsel by Indemnitee is authorized by the Company, (ii) counsel for the Company or Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there is a conflict of interest between the Company and Indemnitee in the conduct of any such defense such that Indemnitee needs to be separately represented, (iii) the Company is not financially or legally able to perform its indemnification obligations or (iv) the Company shall not have retained, or shall not continue to retain, counsel to defend such Proceeding. The Company shall have the right to conduct such defense as it sees fit in its sole discretion. Regardless of any provision in this Agreement, Indemnitee shall have the right to employ counsel in any Proceeding at Indemnitees personal expense. The Company shall not be entitled, without the consent of Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Company. (d) Indemnitee shall give the Company such information and cooperation in connection with the Proceeding as may be reasonably appropriate. (e) The Company shall not be liable to indemnify Indemnitee for any settlement of any Proceeding (or any part thereof) without the Companys prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. (f) The Company shall not settle any Proceeding (or any part thereof) in a manner that imposes any penalty or liability on Indemnitee without Indemnitees prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 10. Procedures upon Application for Indemnification. (a) To obtain indemnification, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and as is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification following the final disposition of the Proceeding. Any delay in providing the request will not relieve the Company from its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent such failure is prejudicial. (b) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 10(a), a determination with respect to Indemnitees entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case (i) if a Change in Control shall have occurred, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Companys board of directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (ii) if a Change in Control shall not have occurred, (A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Companys board of directors, (B) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote -6- of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Companys board of directors, (C) if there are no such Disinterested Directors or, if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Companys board of directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (D) if so directed by the Companys board of directors, by the stockholders of the Company. If it is determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten days after such determination. Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect to Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information that is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and that is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company, to the extent permitted by applicable law. (c) In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 10(b), the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 10(c). If a Change in Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Companys board of directors, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising him or her of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Companys board of directors, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply), and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. In either event, Indemnitee or the Company, as the case may be, may, within ten days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company or to Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection; provided, however, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of Independent Counsel as defined in Section 1 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within 20 days after the later of (i) submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 10(a) hereof and (ii) the final disposition of the Proceeding, the parties have not agreed upon an Independent Counsel, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the others selection of Independent Counsel and for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the court or by such other person as the court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 10(b) hereof. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement, the Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing). (d) The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of any Independent Counsel. 11. Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings. (a) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person, persons or entity making such determination shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, and the Company shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption. -7- (b) The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. (c) For purposes of any determination of good faith, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith to the extent Indemnitee relied in good faith on (i) the records or books of account of the Enterprise, including financial statements, (ii) information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, (iii) the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or its board of directors or counsel selected by any committee of the board of directors or (iv) information or records given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant, an appraiser, investment banker or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Enterprise or its board of directors or any committee of the board of directors. The provisions of this Section 11(c) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement. (d) Neither the knowledge, actions nor failure to act of any other director, officer, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement. 12. Remedies of Indemnitee. (a) Subject to Section 12(e), in the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 8 or 12(d) of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement within 90 days after the later of the receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification or the final disposition of the Proceeding, (iv) payment of indemnification pursuant to this Agreement is not made (A) within ten days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or (B) with respect to indemnification pursuant to Sections 4, 5 and 12(d) of this Agreement, within 30 days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, or (v) the Company or any other person or entity takes or threatens to take any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any litigation or other action or proceeding designed to deny, or to recover from, Indemnitee the benefits provided or intended to be provided to Indemnitee hereunder, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction of his or her entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at his or her option, may seek an award in arbitration with respect to his or her entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses, to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 12(a); provided, however, that the foregoing clause shall not apply in respect of a proceeding brought by Indemnitee to enforce his or her rights under Section 4 of this Agreement. The Company shall not oppose Indemnitees right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration in accordance with this Agreement. (b) Neither (i) the failure of the Company, its board of directors, any committee or subgroup of the board of directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders to have made a determination that indemnification of Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor (ii) an actual determination by the Company, its board of directors, any committee -8- or subgroup of the board of directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that Indemnitee has or has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 12 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, or arbitration, on the merits, and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination. In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 12, the Company shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, have the burden of proving Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be. (c) To the fullest extent not prohibited by law, the Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 12 that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement. If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 12, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitees statements not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law. (d) To the extent not prohibited by law, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses that are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any action for indemnification or advancement of Expenses from the Company under this Agreement or under any directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by the Company to the extent Indemnitee is successful in such action, and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than 90 days, after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor) advance such Expenses to Indemnitee, subject to the provisions of Section 8. (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no determination as to entitlement to indemnification shall be required to be made prior to the final disposition of the Proceeding. 13. Contribution. To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to Indemnitee, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amounts incurred by Indemnitee, whether for Expenses, judgments, fines or amounts paid or to be paid in settlement, in connection with any claim relating to an indemnifiable event under this Agreement, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding in order to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company and Indemnitee as a result of the events and transactions giving rise to such Proceeding; and (ii) the relative fault of Indemnitee and the Company (and its other directors, officers, employees and agents) in connection with such events and transactions. 14. Non-exclusivity. The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws, any agreement, a vote of stockholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise. To the extent that a change in Delaware law, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or advancement of Expenses than would be afforded currently under the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change, subject to the restrictions expressly set forth herein or therein. -9- Except as expressly set forth herein, no right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. Except as expressly set forth herein, the assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy. 15. [Primary Responsibility. The Company acknowledges that Indemnitee has certain rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by [name of fund] [and certain affiliates thereof] ([collectively,] the Secondary Indemnitor[s]). The Company agrees that, as between the Company and the Secondary Indemnitor[s], the Company is primarily responsible for amounts required to be indemnified or advanced under the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws or this Agreement and any obligation of the Secondary Indemnitor[s] to provide indemnification or advancement for the same amounts is secondary to those Company obligations. To the extent not in contravention of any insurance policy or policies providing liability or other insurance for the Company or any director, trustee, general partner, managing member, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company or any other Enterprise, the Company waives any right of contribution or subrogation against the Secondary Indemnitor[s] with respect to the liabilities for which the Company is primarily responsible under this Section 15. In the event of any payment by the Secondary Indemnitor[s] of amounts otherwise required to be indemnified or advanced by the Company under the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws or this Agreement, the Secondary Indemnitor[s] shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee for indemnification or advancement of expenses under the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws or this Agreement or, to the extent such subrogation is unavailable and contribution is found to be the applicable remedy, shall have a right of contribution with respect to the amounts paid; provided, however, that the foregoing sentence will be deemed void if and to the extent that it would violate any applicable insurance policy. The Secondary Indemnitor[s] [are][is an] express third-party [beneficiaries][beneficiary] of the terms of this Section 15.] 16. No Duplication of Payments. The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder (or for which advancement is provided hereunder) if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received payment for such amounts under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise. 17. Insurance. To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, trustees, general partners, managing members, officers, employees, agents or fiduciaries of the Company or any other Enterprise, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies to the same extent as the most favorably-insured persons under such policy or policies in a comparable position. 18. Subrogation. In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights. 19. Services to the Company. Indemnitee agrees to serve as a director or officer of the Company or, at the request of the Company, as a director, trustee, general partner, managing member, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of another Enterprise, for so long as Indemnitee is duly elected or appointed or until Indemnitee tenders his or her resignation or is removed from such position. Indemnitee may at any time and for any reason resign from such position (subject to any other contractual obligation or any obligation imposed by operation of law), in which event the Company shall have no obligation under this Agreement to continue Indemnitee in such position. This Agreement shall not be deemed an employment contract between the Company (or any of its subsidiaries or any Enterprise) and Indemnitee. -10- Indemnitee specifically acknowledges that any employment with the Company (or any of its subsidiaries or any Enterprise) is at will, and Indemnitee may be discharged at any time for any reason, with or without cause, with or without notice, except as may be otherwise expressly provided in any executed, written employment contract between Indemnitee and the Company (or any of its subsidiaries or any Enterprise), any existing formal severance policies adopted by the Companys board of directors or, with respect to service as a director or officer of the Company, the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws or the DGCL. No such document shall be subject to any oral modification thereof. 20. Duration. This Agreement shall continue until and terminate upon the later of (a) ten years after the date that Indemnitee shall have ceased to serve as a director or officer of the Company or as a director, trustee, general partner, managing member, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of any other Enterprise, as applicable; or (b) one year after the final termination of any Proceeding, including any appeal, then pending in respect of which Indemnitee is granted rights of indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder and of any proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 12 of this Agreement relating thereto. 21. Successors. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns, including any direct or indirect successor, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company, and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and Indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators. [The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company, by written agreement, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.] 22. Severability. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to require or shall be construed as requiring the Company to do or fail to do any act in violation of applicable law. The Companys inability, pursuant to court order or other applicable law, to perform its obligations under this Agreement shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including without limitation, each portion of any section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law; (ii) such provision or provisions shall be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto; and (iii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested thereby. 23. Enforcement. The Company expressly confirms and agrees that it has entered into this Agreement and assumed the obligations imposed on it hereby in order to induce Indemnitee to serve as a director or officer of the Company, and the Company acknowledges that Indemnitee is relying upon this Agreement in serving as a director or officer of the Company. 24. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written and implied, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided, however, that this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable law. -11- 25. Modification and Waiver. No supplement, modification or amendment to this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the parties hereto. No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement shall adversely affect any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his or her Corporate Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall constitute or be deemed a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. 26. Notices. All notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be mailed by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, sent by facsimile or electronic mail or otherwise delivered by hand, messenger or courier service addressed: (a) if to Indemnitee, to Indemnitees address, facsimile number or electronic mail address as shown on the signature page of this Agreement or in the Companys records, as may be updated in accordance with the provisions hereof; or (b) if to the Company, to the attention of the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Company at 600 Harrison Street, 3rd Floor, San Francisco, California 94107, or at such other current address as the Company shall have furnished to Indemnitee, with a copy (which shall not constitute notice) to Tony Jeffries, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C., 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304. Each such notice or other communication shall for all purposes of this Agreement be treated as effective or having been given (i) if delivered by hand, messenger or courier service, when delivered (or if sent via a nationally-recognized overnight courier service, freight prepaid, specifying next-business-day delivery, one business day after deposit with the courier), (ii) if sent via mail, at the earlier of its receipt or five days after the same has been deposited in a regularly-maintained receptacle for the deposit of the United States mail, addressed and mailed as aforesaid, or (iii) if sent via facsimile, upon confirmation of facsimile transfer or, if sent via electronic mail, upon confirmation of delivery when directed to the relevant electronic mail address, if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, or if not sent during normal business hours of the recipient, then on the recipients next business day. 27. Applicable Law and Consent to Jurisdiction. This Agreement and the legal relations among the parties shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Except with respect to any arbitration commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement, the Company and Indemnitee hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agree that any action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be brought only in the Delaware Court of Chancery, and not in any other state or federal court in the United States of America or any court in any other country, (ii) consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery for purposes of any action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, (iii) appoint, to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Delaware, The Corporation Trust Company, 1209 Orange Street, in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware 19801, as its agent in the State of Delaware as such partys agent for acceptance of legal process in connection with any such action or proceeding against such party with the same legal force and validity as if served upon such party personally within the State of Delaware, (iv) waive any objection to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (v) waive, and agree not to plead or to make, any claim that any such action or proceeding brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery has been brought in an improper or inconvenient forum. 28. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and -12- the same Agreement. This Agreement may also be executed and delivered by facsimile signature and in counterparts, each of which shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement. Only one such counterpart signed by the party against whom enforceability is sought needs to be produced to evidence the existence of this Agreement. 29. Captions.

Shares issued pursuant to Awards of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock 7 Units, or stock-settled Performance Awards that are reacquired by the Company due to failure to vest or are forfeited to the Company will become available for future issuance under the Plan.

If any portion of an Award under the Plan is paid to a Participant in cash rather than Shares, that cash payment will not reduce the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan. The numbers provided in this Section 3 will be adjusted as a result of changes in capitalization and any other adjustments under Section 13. If the Administrator grants Awards in substitution for equity compensation awards outstanding under a plan maintained by an entity that is acquired by or that becomes a part of any member of the Company group, the grant of those substitute Awards will not decrease the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan. The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as will be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan. 4. Administration of the Plan. (a) Procedure. (i) The Plan will be administered by the Board or a Committee (the Administrator). Different Administrators may administer the Plan with respect to different groups of Service Providers. The Board may retain the authority to concurrently administer the Plan with a Committee and may revoke the delegation of some or all authority previously delegated. (ii) To the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, the Board or a Committee may delegate to one or more subcommittees of the Board or a Committee or officers the authority to grant Awards to Employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that the delegation must comply with any limitations on the authority required by Applicable Laws, including the total number of Shares that may be subject to the Awards granted by such officer(s). This delegation may be revoked at any time by the Board or Committee. (b) Powers of the Administrator. Subject to the terms of the Plan, any limitations on delegations specified by the Board, and any requirements imposed by Applicable Laws, the Administrator will have the authority, in its sole discretion, to make any determinations and perform any actions deemed necessary or advisable to administer the Plan including: (i) to determine the Fair Market Value; (ii) to approve forms of Award Agreements for use under the Plan; (iii) to select the Service Providers to whom Awards may be granted and grant Awards to such Service Providers; (iv) to determine the number of Shares to be covered by each Award granted; 8 (v) to determine the terms and conditions, consistent with the Plan, of any Award granted. Such terms and conditions may include, but are not limited to, the Exercise Price, the time(s) when Awards may be exercised (which may be based on performance criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, and any restriction or limitation regarding any Award or the Shares relating to an Award; (vi) to institute and determine the terms and conditions of an Exchange Program; (vii) to construe and interpret the Plan and make any decisions necessary to administer the Plan, including but not limited to determining whether and when a Change in Control has occurred; (viii) to establish, amend, and rescind rules and regulations and adopt sub-plans relating to the Plan, including rules, regulations and sub-plans for the purposes of facilitating compliance with aplicable non-U.S. laws, easing the administration of the Plan and/or obtaining tax-favorable treatment for Awards granted to Service Providers located outside the U.S., in each case as the Administrator may deem necessary or advisable; (ix) to interpret, modify, or amend each Award (subject to Section 19), including extending the Expiration Date and the post-termination exercisability period of such modified or amended Awards; (x) to allow Participants to satisfy tax withholding obligations in any manner permitted by Section 16; (xi) to delegate ministerial duties to any of the Companys employees; (xii) to authorize any person to take any steps and execute, on behalf of the Company, any documents required for an Award previously granted by the Administrator to be effective; (xiii) to temporarily suspend the exercisability of an Award if the Administrator deems such suspension to be necessary or appropriate for administrative purposes, provided that, unless prohibited by Applicable Laws, such suspension shall be lifted in all cases not less than 10 Trading Days before the last date that the Award may be exercised; (xiv) to allow Participants to defer the receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares otherwise due to any such Participants under an Award; and (xv) to make any determinations necessary or appropriate under Section 13. (c) Grant Date. The grant date of an Award (Grant Date) will be the date that the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award or may be a later date if such later date is designated by the Administrator on the date of the determination or under an automatic grant policy. Notice of the determination will be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the Grant Date. 9 (d) Waiver. The Administrator may waive any terms, conditions, or restrictions. (e) Fractional Shares. Except as otherwise provided by the Administrator, any fractional Shares that result from the adjustment of Awards will be canceled. Any fractional Shares that result from vesting percentages will be accumulated and vested on the date that an accumulated full Share is vested. (f) Electronic Delivery. The Company may deliver by e-mail or other electronic means (including posting on a website maintained by the Company or by a third party under contract with the Company or another member of the Company Group) all documents relating to the Plan or any Award and all other documents that the Company is required to deliver to its security holders (including prospectuses, annual reports, and proxy statements). (g) Choice of Law; Choice of Forum. The Plan, all Awards and all determinations made and actions taken under the Plan, to the extent not otherwise governed by the laws of the United States, will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises under this Plan, a Participants acceptance of an Award is his or her consent to the jurisdiction of the State of Delaware, and agreement that any such litigation will be conducted in Delaware Court of Chancery, or the federal courts for the United States for the District of Delaware, and no other courts, regardless of where a Participants services are performed. (h) Effect of Administrators Decision. The Administrators decisions, determinations and interpretations will be final and binding on all Participants and any other holders of Awards. 5. Eligibility. Nonstatutory Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Awards may be granted to Service Providers; provided that Awards granted to Platform Workers will be subject to any requirements provided by the Final Rules. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees. 6. Stock Options. (a) Stock Option Award Agreement. Each Option will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the number of Shares subject to the Option, per share Exercise Price, its Expiration Date, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator determines. Each Option will be designated in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. An Option not designated as an Incentive Stock Option is a Nonstatutory Stock Option. (b) Exercise Price. The Exercise Price for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option will be determined by the Administrator and stated in the Award Agreement, subject to the following: (i) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option: (1) granted to an ISO Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company (a Ten Percent Owner), the Exercise Price for the Shares to be issued will be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant; and 10 (2) granted to any ISO Employee other than a Ten Percent Owner, the Exercise Price for the Shares to be issued will be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. (ii) In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the Exercise Price for the Shares to be issued will be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with an Exercise Price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant (i) pursuant to a transaction described in, and in a manner consistent with, Section 424(a) of the Code or (ii) to a Service Provider that is not a U.S. taxpayer. (c) Form of Consideration. The Administrator will determine the acceptable form(s) of consideration for exercising an Option. Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, the consideration may consist of any one or more or combination of the following, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws: (i) cash; (ii) check or wire transfer; (iii) promissory note, if and to the extent approved by the Company; (iv) other Shares that have a fair market value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate Exercise Price of the Shares as to which such Option will be exercised. To the extent not prohibited by the Administrator, this shall include the ability to tender Shares to exercise the Option and then use the Shares received on exercise to exercise the Option with respect to additional Shares; (v) consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise arrangement (whether through a broker or otherwise) implemented by the Company for the exercise of Options that has been approved by the Administrator, if and to the extent permitted by the Company with respect to a particular Award; (vi) consideration received by the Company under a net exercise program under which Shares are withheld from otherwise deliverable Shares that has been approved by the Administrator, if and to the extent permitted by the Company with respect to a particular Award; and (vii) any other consideration or method of payment to issue Shares (provided that other forms of considerations may only be approved by the Administrator). 11 The Administrator has the power to remove or limit any of the above forms of consideration for exercising an Option except for the payment of cash at any time in its sole discretion. (d) Term of Option. The term of each Option will be determined by the Administrator and stated in the Award Agreement, provided that, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option: (a) granted to a Ten Percent Owner, the Option may not be exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years from the date such Option is granted, or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement; and (b) granted to an ISO Employee other than a Ten Percent Owner, the Option may not be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date such Option is granted, or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement. (e) Incentive Stock Option Limitations. (i) To the extent that the aggregate fair market value of the shares with respect to which incentive stock options under Code Section 422(b) are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year (under all plans and agreements of the Company Group) exceeds $100,000, the incentive stock options whose value exceeds $100,000 will be treated as nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock options will be considered in the order in which they were granted. For this purpose, the fair market value of the shares subject to an option will be determined as of the grant date of each option. (ii) If an Option is designated in the Administrator action that granted it as an Incentive Stock Option but the terms of the Option do not comply with Sections 6(b) and 6(d), then the Option will not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option. (f) Exercise of Option. An Option is exercised when the Company receives: (i) a notice of exercise (in such form as the Administrator may specify from time to time) from the person entitled to exercise the Option and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised (together with applicable tax withholdings). Shares issued upon exercise of an Option will be issued in the name of the Participant. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder will exist with respect to the Shares subject to an Option, despite the exercise of the Option. The Company will issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share. Exercising an Option in any manner will decrease the number of Shares thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan (except as provided in Section 3(c)) and for purchase under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised. (i) Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider. If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon such cessation as the result of the Participants death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within thirty (30) days of such cessation, or such longer period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement or Section 6(d), as applicable) to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of cessation. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator or set forth in the Award Agreement or other written agreement authorized by the Administrator between the Participant and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parents, as applicable, if on the 12 date of such cessation the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan immediately. If after such cessation the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option will terminate and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan. (ii) Disability of Participant. If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participants Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within twelve (12) months of cessation, or such longer period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement or Section 6(d), as applicable) to the extent the Option is vested on the date of cessation. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator or set forth in the Award Agreement or other written agreement authorized by the Administrator between the Participant and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parents, as applicable, if on the date of cessation the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan immediately. If after such cessation the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan. (iii) Death of Participant. If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised within twelve (12) months following the Participants death, or within such longer period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement or Section 6(d), as applicable) to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of death, by the personal representative of the Participants estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participants will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. If the Option is exercised pursuant to this Section 6(f)(iii), Participants personal representative shall be subject to the terms of this Plan and the Award Agreement, including but not limited to the restrictions on transferability and forfeitability applicable to the Service Provider. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator or set forth in the Award Agreement or other written agreement authorized by the Administrator between the Participant and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parents, as applicable, if at the time of death Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan immediately. If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan. (g) Expiration of Options. Subject to Section 6(d), an Options Expiration Date will be set forth in the Award Agreement. An Option may expire before its expiration date under the Plan (including pursuant to Sections 6(f), 13, 14, or 17(d)) or under the Award Agreement. (h) Tolling of Expiration. If exercising an Option prior to its expiration is not permitted because of Applicable Laws, other than the rules of any stock exchange or quotation system on which the Common Stock is listed or quoted, the Option will remain exercisable until 30 days after the first date on which exercise no longer would be prevented by such provisions; provided, however, that this tolling of expiration shall not apply if and to the extent the holder of 13 such Option is a United States taxpayer and the tolling would result in a violation of Section 409A such that the Option would be subject to additional taxation or interest under Section 409A. If this would result in the Option remaining exercisable past its Expiration Date, then unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 14, the Option will remain exercisable only until the end of the later of (x) the first day on which its exercise would not be prevented by Section 20(a) and (y) its Expiration Date. 7. Stock Appreciation Rights. (a) Stock Appreciation Right Award Agreement. Each Stock Appreciation Right grant will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the number of Shares subject to the Stock Appreciation Right, its per share Exercise Price, its Expiration Date, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator determines. (b) Exercise Price. The Exercise Price of a Stock Appreciation Right will be determined by the Administrator, provided that in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right granted to a U.S. taxpayer, the Exercise Price will be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant. (c) Payment of Stock Appreciation Right Amount. Payment upon Stock Appreciation Right exercise may be made in cash, in Shares (which, on the date of exercise, have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the amount of payment to be made under the Award), or any combination of cash and Shares, with the determination of form of payment made by the Administrator. When a Participant exercises a Stock Appreciation Right, he or she will be entitled to receive a payment from the Company equal to (i) the excess, if any, between the fair market value on the date of exercise over the Exercise Price, multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised. (d) Exercise of Stock Appreciation Right. A Stock Appreciation Right is exercised when the Company receives a notice of exercise (in such form as the Administrator may specify from time to time) from the person entitled to exercise the Stock Appreciation Right. Shares issued upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right will be issued in the name of the Participant. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder will exist with respect to the Shares subject to a Stock Appreciation Right, despite the exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right. The Company will issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised. A Stock Appreciation Right may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share. Exercising a Stock Appreciation Right in any manner will decrease (x) the number of Shares thereafter available under the Stock Appreciation Right by the number of Shares as to which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised and (y) the number of Shares thereafter available under the Plan by the number of Shares issued upon such exercise. (e) Expiration of Stock Appreciation Rights. A Stock Appreciation Rights Expiration Date will be set forth in the Award Agreement. A Stock Appreciation Right may expire before its expiration date under the Plan (including pursuant to Sections 13, 14, or 17(c)) or under the Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rules of Section 6(d) relating to the maximum term and Section 6(f) relating to exercise also will apply to Stock Appreciation Rights. 14 (f) Tolling of Expiration. If exercising a Stock Appreciation Right prior to its expiration is not permitted because of Applicable Laws, other than the rules of any stock exchange or quotation system on which the Common Stock is listed or quoted, the Stock Appreciation Right will remain exercisable until 30 days after the first date on which exercise no longer would be prevented by such provisions; provided, however, that this tolling of expiration shall not apply if and to the extent the holder of such Stock Appreciation Right is a United States taxpayer and the tolling would result in a violation of Section 409A such that the Stock Appreciation Right would be subject to additional taxation or interest under Section 409A. If this would result in the Stock Appreciation Right remaining exercisable past its Expiration Date, then unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 14, the Stock Appreciation Right will remain exercisable only until the end of the later of (x) the first day on which its exercise would not be prevented by Section 20(a) and (y) its Expiration Date. 8. Restricted Stock. (a) Restricted Stock Award Agreement. Each Award of Restricted Stock will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the number of Shares subject to the Award of Restricted Stock and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator determines. For the avoidance of doubt, Restricted Stock may be granted without any Period of Restriction (e.g., vested stock bonuses). Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, Shares of Restricted Stock will be held in escrow while unvested. (b) Restrictions. (i) Except as provided in this Section 8(b) or the Award Agreement, while unvested, Shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated. (ii) While unvested, Service Providers holding Shares of Restricted Stock may exercise full voting rights with respect to those Shares, unless the Administrator determines otherwise. (iii) Service Providers holding a Share covered by an Award of Restricted Stock will not be entitled to receive dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such Shares while such Shares are unvested, unless the Administrator provides otherwise. If the Administrator provides that dividends and distributions will be received and any such dividends or distributions are paid in cash they will be subject to the same provisions regarding forfeitability as the Shares with respect to which they were paid and if such dividend or distributions are paid in Shares, the Shares will be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the Shares with respect to which they were paid and, unless the Administrator determines otherwise, the Company will hold such dividends until the restrictions on the Shares with respect to which they were paid have lapsed. (iv) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8(b) or an Award Agreement, a Share covered by each Award of Restricted Stock made under the Plan will be released from escrow when practicable after the last day of the applicable Period of Restriction. 15 (v) The Administrator may impose, prior to grant, or remove any restrictions on Shares covered by an Award of Restricted Stock. 9. Restricted Stock Units. (a) Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement. Each Award of Restricted Stock Units will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the number of Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award of Restricted Stock Units and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator determines. (b) Vesting Criteria and Other Terms. The Administrator will set vesting criteria, if any, that, depending on the extent to which the criteria are met, will determine the number of Restricted Stock Units paid out to the Participant. The Administrator may set vesting criteria based upon the achievement of Company-wide, divisional, business unit, or individual goals (that may include continued employment or service) or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion. (c) Earning Restricted Stock Units. Upon meeting any applicable vesting criteria, the Participant will have earned the Restricted Stock Units and will be paid as determined in Section 9(d). The Administrator may reduce or waive any criteria that must be met to earn the Restricted Stock Units. (d) Form and Timing of Payment. Payment of earned Restricted Stock Units will be made at the time(s) set forth in the Award Agreement and determined by the Administrator. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, the Administrator may settle earned Restricted Stock Units in cash, Shares, or a combination of both. 10. Performance Awards. (a) Award Agreement. Each Performance Award will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the period during which any performance objectives or other vesting provisions, if any, will be measured (Performance Period), and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator determines. (b) Objectives or Vesting Provisions and Other Terms. The Administrator will set objectives or vesting provisions that, depending on the extent to which the objectives or vesting provisions are met, will determine the value of the payout for the Performance Awards. The Administrator may set vesting criteria based upon the achievement of Company-wide, divisional, business unit, or individual goals (that may include continued employment or service) or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion. (c) Form and Timing of Payment. Payment of earned Performance Awards will be made at the time(s) specified in the Award Agreement. Payment with respect to earned Performance Awards will be made in cash, in Shares of equivalent value, or any combination of cash and Shares, with the determination of form of payment made by the Administrator at the time of payment or, in the discretion of the Administrator, at the time of grant. 16 (d) Value of Performance Awards. Each Performance Awards threshold, target, and maximum payout values will be established by the Administrator on or before the Grant Date. (e) Earning Performance Awards. After an applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of a Performance Award will be entitled to receive a payout for the Performance Award earned by the Participant over the Performance Period. The Administrator may reduce or waive any performance objectives or other vesting provisions for such Performance Award. 11. Leaves of Absence, Reduced or Part-Time Work Schedule, Transfer between Locations, and Change of Status. (a) Leaves of Absence, Reduced or Part-Time Work Schedule, and Transfer between Locations. Unless the Administrator provides otherwise or as otherwise required by Applicable Laws, vesting of Awards granted hereunder will be adjusted or suspended during any unpaid leave of absence in accordance with the Companys leave of absence policy in effect at the time of such leave. In addition, unless the Administrator provides otherwise or as otherwise required by Applicable Laws, if, after the date of grant of a Participants Award, the Participant commences working on a part-time or reduced work schedule basis, the vesting of such Award will be adjusted in accordance with the Companys reduced work schedule or part-time policy then in effect. Adjustments or suspensions of vesting pursuant to this Section shall be accomplished in a manner that is exempt from or complies with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the regulations and guidance thereunder. (b) Employment Status. A Participant will not cease to be a Service Provider in the case of (i) any leave of absence approved by the Company or (ii) transfers between locations of the Company (or member of the Company Group) or between the Company or any member of the Company Group. (c) Incentive Stock Options. With respect to Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed three (3) months, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract. If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Company is not so guaranteed, then six (6) months following the first day of such leave any Incentive Stock Option held by a Participant will cease to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option and will be treated for tax purposes as a Nonstatutory Stock Option. 12. Transferability of Awards. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, or otherwise required by Applicable Laws, an Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant. If the Administrator makes an Award transferable, the Award will be limited by any additional terms and conditions imposed by the Administrator. Any unauthorized transfer of an Award will be void. 13. Adjustments; Dissolution or Liquidation. (a) Adjustments. If any extraordinary dividend or other extraordinary distribution (whether in cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, reclassification, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, other change in the corporate 17 structure of the Company affecting the Shares, or any similar equity restructuring transaction, as that term is used in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (or any of its successors) affecting the Shares occurs (including a Change in Control), the Administrator, to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be provided under the Plan, will adjust the number and class of shares that may be delivered under the Plan and/or the number, class, and price of shares covered by each outstanding Award, and the numerical Share limits in Section 3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conversion of any convertible securities of the Company and ordinary course repurchases of Shares or other securities of the Company will not be treated as an event that will require adjustment. (b) Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator will notify each Participant, at such time prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction as the Administrator determines. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action. 14. Change in Control or Merger. (a) Administrator Discretion. If a Change in Control or a merger of the Company with or into another corporation or other entity occurs (each, a Transaction), each outstanding Award will be treated as the Administrator determines (subject to the provisions of this Section), without a Participants consent, including that such Award be continued by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation (or an affiliate thereof) or that the vesting of any such Awards may accelerate automatically upon consummation of a Transaction. (b) Identical Treatment Not Required. The Administrator need not take the same action or actions with respect to all Awards or portions thereof or with respect to all Participants. The Administrator may take different actions with respect to the vested and unvested portions of an Award. The Administrator will not be required to treat all Awards similarly in the Transaction. (c) Continuation. An Award will be considered continued if, following the Change in Control or merger: (i) the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the Transaction, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the Transaction by holders of Shares for each Share held on the effective date of the Transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration received by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares) and the Award otherwise is continued in accordance with its terms (including vesting criteria, subject to Section 14(c)(iii) below and Section 13(a); provided that if the consideration received in the Transaction is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon exercising an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or upon the payout of a Restricted Stock Unit, or Performance Award, for each Share subject to such Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Transaction; or 18 (ii) the Award is terminated in exchange for an amount of cash and/or property, if any, equal to the amount that would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participants rights as of the date of the occurrence of the Transaction. Any such cash or property may be subjected to any escrow applicable to holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control. If as of the date of the occurrence of the Transaction the Administrator determines that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participants rights, then such Award may be terminated by the Company without payment. The amount of cash or property can be subjected to vesting and paid to the Participant over the original vesting schedule of the Award. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 14(c) to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned, or is paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participants consent, in all cases, unless specifically provided otherwise under the applicable Award Agreement or other written agreement authorized by the Administrator between the Participant and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parents, as applicable; provided, however, that a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporations post-Transaction corporate structure will not invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption. (d) Modification. The Administrator will have authority to modify Awards in connection with a Change in Control or merger: (i) in a manner that causes the Awards to lose their tax-preferred status; (ii) to terminate any right a Participant has to exercise an Option prior to vesting in the Shares subject to the Option (i.e., early exercise), so that following the closing of the Transaction the Option may be exercised only to the extent it is vested; (iii) to reduce the Exercise Price subject to the Award in a manner that is disproportionate to the increase in the number of Shares subject to the Award, as long as the amount that would be received upon exercise of the Award immediately before and immediately following the closing of the Transaction is equivalent and the adjustment complies with U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(v)(D); and (iv) to suspend a Participants right to exercise an Option during a limited period of time preceding and or following the closing of the Transaction without Participant consent if such suspension is administratively necessary or advisable to permit the closing of the Transaction. (e) Non-Continuation. If the successor corporation does not continue an Award (or some portion such Award), the Participant will fully vest in (and have the right to exercise) 100% of the then-unvested Shares subject to his or her outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, all restrictions on 100% of the Participants outstanding Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units will lapse, and, regarding 100% of Participants outstanding Awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be treated as achieved at 100% of target levels and all other terms and conditions met, in all cases, unless specifically provided otherwise 19 under the applicable Award Agreement or other written agreement authorized by the Administrator between the Participant and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parents, as applicable. In no event will vesting of an Award accelerate as to more than 100% of the Award. Unless specifically provided otherwise under the applicable Award Agreement or other written agreement authorized by the Administrator between the Participant and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parents, as applicable, if Options or Stock Appreciation Rights are not continued when a Change in Control or a merger of the Company with or into another corporation or other entity occurs, the Administrator will notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Participants vested Options or Stock Appreciation Rights (after considering the foregoing vesting acceleration, if any) will be exercisable for a period of time determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion and all of the Participants Options or Stock Appreciation Rights will terminate upon the expiration of such period (whether vested or unvested). 15. Outside Director Grants. (a) Outside Director Acceleration. With respect to Awards granted to an Outside Director, in the event of a Change in Control, the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise outstanding Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights as to all of the Shares underlying such Award, including those Shares which otherwise would not be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on other outstanding Awards will lapse, and, with respect to Awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels and all other terms and conditions met, unless specifically provided otherwise under the applicable Award Agreement, a Company policy related to Director compensation, or other written agreement authorized by the Administrator between the Participant and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parents, as applicable, that specifically references this default rule. (b) Outside Director Limits. No Outside Director may be paid, issued, or granted, in any Fiscal Year, cash retainer fees and equity awards (including any Awards issued under this Plan) with an aggregate value greater than $750,000, increased to $1,500,000 in connection with his or her initial service (with the value of each equity award based on its grant date fair value (determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles)). Any cash compensation paid or Awards granted to an individual for his or her services as an Employee, or for his or her services as a Consultant (other than as an Outside Director) or as a Platform Worker, will not count for purposes of the limitation under this Section 15(b). 16. Tax Matters. (a) Withholding Requirements. Prior to the delivery of any Shares or cash under an Award (or exercise thereof) or such earlier time as any Tax Withholding is due, the Company may deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy any Tax Withholding with respect to such Award or Shares subject to an Award (including upon exercise of an Award). (b) Withholding Arrangements. The Administrator, in its sole discretion and under such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may elect to satisfy such Tax Withholding, in whole or in part (including in combination) by (without limitation) (i) requiring the Participant to pay cash, check, or other cash equivalents, (ii) withholding otherwise deliverable cash 20 (including cash from the sale of Shares issued to the Participant) or Shares having a fair market value equal to the amount required to be withheld or such greater amount (including up to a maximum statutory amount) as the Administrator may determine or permit if such amount does not result in unfavorable financial accounting treatment, as the Administrator determines in its sole discretion, (iii) forcing the sale of Shares issued pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof) having a fair market value equal to the minimum statutory amount applicable in a Participants jurisdiction or a greater amount as the Administrator may determine or permit if such greater amount would not result in unfavorable financial accounting treatment, as the Administrator determines in its sole discretion, (iv) requiring the Participant to deliver to the Company already-owned Shares having a fair market value equal to the minimum statutory amount required to be withheld or a greater amount as the Administrator may determine or permit if such greater amount would not result in unfavorable financial accounting treatment, as the Administrator determines in its sole discretion, (v) requiring the Participant to engage in a cashless exercise transaction (whether through a broker or otherwise) implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan, (vi) having the Company or a Parent or Subsidiary of the Company withhold from wages or any other cash amount due or to become due to the Participant and payable by the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company, or (vii) such other consideration and method of payment for the meeting of Tax Withholding as the Administrator may determine to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, provided that, in all instances, the satisfaction of the Tax Withholding will not result in any adverse accounting consequence to the Company, as the Administrator may determine in its sole discretion. The fair market value of the Shares to be withheld or delivered will be determined as of the date the amount of tax to be withheld is calculated or such other date as Administrator determines is applicable or appropriate with respect to the Tax Withholding calculation. (c) Compliance With Code Section 409A. Unless the Administrator determines that compliance with Code Section 409A is not necessary, it is intended that Awards will be designed and operated so that they are either exempt or excepted from the application of Code Section 409A or comply with any requirements necessary to avoid the imposition of additional tax under Code Section 409A(a)(1)(B) so that the grant, payment, settlement, or deferral will not be subject to the additional tax or interest applicable under Code Section 409A and the Plan and each Award Agreement will be interpreted consistent with this intent. This Section 16(c) is not a guarantee to any Participant of the consequences of his or her Awards. In no event will the Company have any responsibility, liability or obligation to reimburse, indemnify, or hold harmless Participant for any taxes that may be imposed or other costs that may be incurred, as a result of Section 409A. 17. Other Terms. (a) No Effect on Employment or Service. Neither the Plan nor any Award will confer upon a Participant any right regarding continuing the Participants relationship as a Service Provider with the Company or member of the Company Group, nor will they interfere with the Participants right, or the Participants employers right, to terminate such relationship at any time free from any liability or claim under the Plan. (b) Interpretation and Rules of Construction. The words include, includes, and including when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words without limitation. 21 (c) Plan Governs. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and the terms and conditions of any Grant Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan will prevail. (d) Forfeiture Events. (i) All Awards granted under the Plan will be subject to recoupment under any clawback policy that the Company is required to adopt pursuant to the listing standards of any national securities exchange or association on which the Companys securities are listed or as is otherwise required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or other Applicable Laws. In addition, the Administrator may impose such other clawback, recovery, or recoupment provisions in an Award Agreement as the Administrator determines necessary or appropriate, including without limitation to any reacquisition right regarding previously acquired Shares or other cash or property. Unless this Section 17(d)(i) is specifically mentioned and waived in an Award Agreement or other document, no recovery of compensation under a clawback policy or otherwise will be an event that triggers or contributes to any right of a Participant to resign for good reason or constructive termination (or similar term) under any agreement with the Company or a member of the Company Group. (ii) The Administrator may specify in an Award Agreement that the Participants rights, payments, and benefits with respect to an Award will be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment upon the occurrence of specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of an Award. Such events may include, but will not be limited to, termination of such Participants status as Service Provider for cause or any specified action or inaction by a Participant that would constitute cause for termination of such Participants status as a Service Provider. 18. Term of Plan. Subject to Section 21, the Plan will become effective upon the business day immediately prior to the Registration Date. It will continue in effect until terminated under Section 19, but no Incentive Stock Options may be granted after ten (10) years from the date the Plan is adopted by the Board and Section 3(a)(iii) will operate only until the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date the Plan is adopted by the Board. 19. Amendment and Termination of the Plan. (a) Amendment and Termination. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may amend, alter, suspend, or terminate the Plan or any part thereof, at any time and for any reason. (b) Stockholder Approval. The Company will obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary or desirable to comply with Applicable Laws. (c) Consent of Participants Generally Required. Subject to Section 19(d) below, no amendment, alteration, suspension, or termination of the Plan or an Award under it will materially impair the rights of any Participant without a signed, written agreement authorized by the Administrator between the Participant and the Company. Termination of the Plan will not affect the Administrators ability to exercise the powers granted to it regarding Awards granted under the Plan prior to such termination. 22 (d) Exceptions to Consent Requirement. A Participants rights will not be deemed to have been impaired by any amendment, alteration, suspension, or termination if the Administrator, in its sole discretion, determines that the amendment, alteration, suspension, or termination taken as a whole does not materially impair the Participants rights. Subject to any limitations of Applicable Laws, the Administrator may amend the terms of any one or more Awards without the affected Participants consent even if it does materially impair the Participants rights if such amendment is done (i) in a manner specified by the Plan, (ii) to maintain the qualified status of the Award as an Incentive Stock Option under Code Section 422, (iii) to change the terms of an Incentive Stock Option, if such change results in impairment of the Award only because it impairs the qualified status of the Award as an Incentive Stock Option under Code Section 422, (iv) to clarify the manner of exemption from Code Section 409A or compliance with any requirements necessary to avoid the imposition of additional tax or interest under Code Section 409A(a)(1)(B), or (v) to comply with other Applicable Laws. 20. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares. (a) Legal Compliance. The Company will make good faith efforts to comply with all Applicable Laws related to the issuance of Shares. Shares will not be issued pursuant to an Award, including without limitation upon exercise or vesting thereof, as applicable, unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares and exercise or vesting of the Award, as applicable, will comply with Applicable Laws. If required by the Administrator, issuance will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance. If the Company determines it to be impossible or impractical to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction or to complete or comply with the requirements of any Applicable Laws, registration or other qualification of the Shares under any state, federal or foreign law or under the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the stock exchange on which Shares of the same class are then listed, or any other governmental or regulatory body, which authority, registration, qualification or rule compliance is deemed by the Companys counsel to be necessary or advisable for the issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, the Company will be relieved of any liability regarding the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such authority, registration, qualification or rule compliance was not obtained and the Administrator reserves the authority, without the consent of a Participant, to terminate or cancel Awards with or without consideration in such a situation. (b) Investment Representations. As a condition to the exercise or vesting of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising such Award to represent and warrant during any such exercise or vesting that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and with no present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required. (c) Failure to Accept Award. If a Participant has not accepted an Award to the extent such acceptance has been requested or required by the Company or has not taken all administrative and other steps (e.g., setting up an account with a broker designated by the Company) necessary for the Company to issue Shares upon the vesting, exercise, or settlement of the Award prior to the first date the Shares subject to such Award are scheduled to vest, then the portion of the Award scheduled to vest on such date will be cancelled on such date and such Shares subject to the Award immediately will revert to the Plan for no additional consideration unless otherwise provided by the Administrator. 23 21. Stockholder Approval. The Plan will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted by the Board. Such stockholder approval will be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws. 24 UDEMY, INC. 2021 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN NOTICE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Award and Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (the Notice of Grant), the Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award attached hereto as Exhibit A, the Country Addendum attached hereto as Exhibit B, and all other exhibits to these documents (all together, this Agreement) have the meanings given to them in the Udemy, Inc. 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan).

PARTICIPANT _________________________________________ Signature Address: __________________________________ _________________________________ A-1 EXHIBIT A TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD 1. Grant. The Company grants the Participant an award of RSUs as described in the Notice of Grant. If there is a conflict between the Plan, this Agreement, or any other agreement with the Participant governing these RSUs, those documents will take precedence and prevail in the following order: (a) the Plan, (b) the Agreement, and (c) any other agreement between the Company and the Participant governing these RSUs. 2. Companys Obligation to Pay. Each RSU is a right to receive a Share or, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, an amount in cash equal to the Fair Market Value of one Share, on the date it vests. Until an RSU vests, the Participant has no right to payment of the Share. Before a vested RSU is paid, the RSU is an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the Companys general assets. A vested RSU will be paid to the Participant (or in the event of the Participants death, to the Participants estate or such other person as specified in Section 6 below) in whole Shares or cash. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b) and notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, each vested RSU that has met all requirements for settlement under this Agreement (including with respect to RSUs that the Administrator determines will be settled in cash) will be settled no later than the applicable Settlement Deadline. Settlement Deadline with respect to a particular vested RSU means as soon as practicable after vesting (but no later than sixty (60) days following the vesting date (or, if earlier, no later than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which occurs the first date on which the applicable RSU is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture for purposes of Section 409A)). If any RSU has not met all the requirements for settlement under this Agreement in a manner that would allow it to be settled by the applicable Settlement Deadline, such RSU will be forfeited as of immediately following the applicable Settlement Deadline. In no event will Participant be permitted, directly or indirectly, to specify the taxable year or date of settlement of any RSUs under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, there may be multiple Settlement Deadlines, with each such Settlement Deadline corresponding to a particular RSU. 3. Vesting. These RSUs will vest only under the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Grant, Section 4 of this Agreement, or Section 13 of the Plan. RSUs scheduled to vest on a certain date or upon the occurrence of a certain condition will not vest unless the Participant continues to be a Service Provider until the time such vesting is scheduled to occur. 4. Acceleration; Amendment. (a) Discretionary Acceleration or Amendment. The Administrator may, pursuant to its authority under, and in accordance with, Section 4(b)(v), Section 4(b)(ix), Section 4(b)(xiv), and Section 9(c) of the Plan, in its discretion, unilaterally (x) accelerate, in whole or in part, the vesting of these RSUs, (y) waive or decrease some or all of the requirements for vesting of unvested RSUs at any time, or (z) waive or decrease some or all of the requirements for settlement of RSUs at any time, in each case, subject to the terms of the Plan but without the need for Participant consent in any instance, and subject to Section 13(j) of this Agreement; provided, however, that no such acceleration, waiver, or decrease shall occur or be effective A-1 unless such modification would result in this RSU award remaining exempt or excepted from the requirements of Code Section 409A pursuant to the short-term deferral exception or another exception or exemption under Code Section 409A, or otherwise complying with Code Section 409A, in each case such that none of this Agreement, the RSUs provided under this Agreement, or Shares issuable hereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Code Section 409A. If so modified, the vesting date with respect to the applicable RSUs will be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to be the date specified by the Administrator (provided, that, for purposes of determining the applicable settlement deadline under Section 1 of this Agreement with respect to such RSUs, the vesting date will be deemed to be no later than the first date on which the RSUs are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture for purposes of Code Section 409A). The settlement of RSUs through Shares pursuant to this Section 4(a) shall in all cases be no later than the applicable settlement deadline as set forth in Section 1 of this Agreement and at a time or in a manner that is exempt from, or complies with, Code Section 409A. The prior sentence may be superseded in a future agreement or amendment to this Agreement only by direct and specific reference to such sentence. (b) The Companys intent is that this RSU award be exempt or excepted from the requirements of Code Section 409A. However, in an abundance of caution, the Company is including in this subsection certain Code Section 409A rules that only apply if these RSUs are not exempt or excepted, and then only in certain circumstances. Specifically, Code Section 409A contains rules that must apply to these RSUs if (i) they are not exempt or excepted from Code Section 409A, (ii) the Company has any stock that is publicly traded on an established securities market or otherwise at the time Participants service terminates, (iii) Participant receives acceleration of vesting of these RSUs in connection with a termination of service, and (iv) at the time of such termination, Participant is considered a specified employee under the Code Section 409A rules. Should these rules ever become applicable to Participants RSUs, then notwithstanding anything in the Plan, this Agreement or any other agreement (whether entered into before, on, or after the Grant Date) to the contrary, if the vesting of these RSUs is accelerated in connection with Participants termination as a Service Provider (provided that such termination is a separation from service within the meaning of Code Section 409A, as determined by the Company), other than due to Participants death, and if (x) Participant is a U.S. taxpayer and a specified employee within the meaning of Code Section 409A at the time of such termination as a Service Provider and (y) the settlement of such accelerated RSUs will result in the imposition of additional tax under Code Section 409A if such settlement is on or within the six (6) month period following Participants termination as a Service Provider, then the settlement of such accelerated RSUs will not occur until the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of Participants termination as a Service Provider, unless the Participant dies following the Participants termination as a Service Provider, in which case, the Shares subject to these RSUs will be settled and issued to the Participants administrator or executor of the Participants estate as soon as practicable following the Participants death (subject to Section 6). 5. Forfeiture upon Cessation of Status as a Service Provider. Upon the Participants termination as a Service Provider for any reason other than death, these RSUs will immediately stop vesting and any of these RSUs that have not yet vested will be forfeited by the Participant for no consideration upon the date that Participant ceases to be a Service Provider for any reason, in all cases, subject to Applicable Laws. Upon the Participants termination as a A-2 Service Provider due to the Participants death, these RSUs will immediately stop vesting and, on the thirtieth (30th) day following the date of the Participants death, any of these RSUs that have not yet vested will be forfeited by the Participant for no consideration, in all cases, subject to Applicable Laws. For the avoidance of doubt, service during any portion of the vesting period shall not entitle the Participant to vest in a pro rata portion of unvested RSUs. For purposes of the RSUs, the Participants status as a Service Provider will be considered to be terminated as of the date the Participant is no longer providing services to the Company, or if different, the Participants employer (the Employer) or the Subsidiary or Parent to which the Participant is providing services (the Employer, Subsidiary, or Parent, as applicable, the Service Recipient) or other member of the Company Group (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Participant is a Service Provider or the terms of the Participants employment or service agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or determined by the Administrator, the Participants right to vest in the RSUs under the Plan, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., the Participants period of service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of garden leave or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Participant is a Service Provider or the terms of the Participants employment or service agreement, if any). The Administrator shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the Participant is no longer providing services for purposes of the RSUs (including whether the Participant may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence). 6. Death of Participant. Any distribution or delivery to be made to the Participant under this Agreement will, if the Participant is then deceased, be made to the administrator or executor of the Participants estate or, if the Administrator permits, the Participants designated beneficiary, unless otherwise required to comply with Applicable Laws. Any such transferee must furnish the Company with (a) written notice of the Participants status as transferee, and (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer and compliance with any laws or regulations that apply to the transfer. 7. Tax Obligations. (a) Tax Withholding. (i) No Shares will be issued to the Participant until the Participant makes satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Administrator) for the payment of Tax Withholdings. If the Participant is a non-U.S. employee, the method of payment of Tax Withholdings may be restricted by any Country Addendum (as defined below). If the Participant fails to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment of any Tax Withholdings under this Agreement when any of these RSUs otherwise are supposed to vest or Tax Withholdings related to RSUs otherwise are due, the Participant will permanently forfeit the applicable RSUs and any right to receive Shares under such RSUs, and such RSUs will be returned to the Company at no cost to the Company, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws. (ii) The Company has the right (but not the obligation) to satisfy any Tax Withholdings by withholding from proceeds of a sale of Shares acquired upon payment of these RSUs arranged by the Company (on the Participants behalf pursuant to this authorization without further consent), and this will be the method by which such tax withholding obligations are satisfied until the Company determines otherwise, subject to Applicable Laws. A-3 (iii) The Company also has the right (but not the obligation) to satisfy any Tax Withholdings: (A) by reducing the number of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant; (B) by requiring payment by cash or check made payable to the Company and/or any Service Recipient with respect to which the withholding obligation arises; (C) by deduction of such amount from salary, wages or other compensation payable to the Participant; or (D) in any combination of the foregoing, or any other method determined by the Administrator to be compliance with Applicable Laws. (iv) The Company may withhold or account for Tax Withholdings by considering statutory or other withholding rates, including minimum or maximum rates applicable in the Participants jurisdiction(s). In the event of over-withholding, the Participant may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash (with no entitlement to the equivalent in Common Stock), or if not refunded, the Participant may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay any additional Tax Withholdings directly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company and/or the Employer(s). If the obligation for Tax Withholdings is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, the Participant will be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax Withholdings. (v) Further, if the Participant is subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, the Company or the Employer(s) or former Employer(s) may withhold or account for tax in more than one jurisdiction. (vi) Regardless of any action of the Company or the Employer(s), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax Withholdings and any and all additional taxes related to the Award, the Shares, or other amounts or property delivered under the Award and the Participants participation in the Plan is and remains the Participants responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer(s). The Participant further acknowledges that the Company and the Employer(s) (A) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax Withholdings in connection with any aspect of these RSUs and (B) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of these RSUs to reduce or eliminate the Participants liability for Tax Withholdings or achieve any particular tax result. (b) Code Section 409A. It is the intent of this Agreement that it and all issuances and benefits to U.S. taxpayers hereunder be exempt or excepted from the requirements of Code Section 409A pursuant to the short-term deferral exception under Code Section 409A, or otherwise be exempted or excepted from, or comply with, Code Section 409A, so that none of this Agreement, the RSUs provided under this Agreement, or Shares issuable thereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Code Section 409A, and any ambiguities or ambiguous terms herein will be interpreted to be so exempt or excepted, or to so comply. Each issuance upon settlement of the RSUs under this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). In no event will any member of the Company Group have any liability or obligation to reimburse, indemnify, or hold harmless Participant for any taxes that may be imposed, or other costs incurred, on Participant as a result of Code Section 409A. A-4 8. Rights as Stockholder. The Participants or any other persons rights as a stockholder of the Company (including the right to vote and to receive dividends and distributions) will not begin until Shares have been issued and recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars. 9. Acknowledgements and Agreements. The Participants signature on the Notice of Grant accepting these RSUs indicates that: (a) THE PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE VESTING OF THESE RSUS IS EARNED ONLY BY CONTINUING AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AND THAT BEING HIRED OR BEING GRANTED THESE RSUS WILL NOT RESULT IN VESTING. (b) THE PARTICIPANT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THESE RSUS AND THIS AGREEMENT DO NOT CREATE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AS A SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL AND WILL NOT INTERFERE IN ANY WAY WITH THE PARTICIPANTS RIGHT OR THE RIGHT OF THE EMPLOYER(S) TO TERMINATE THE PARTICIPANTS RELATIONSHIP AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAWS. (c) The Participant agrees that this Agreement and its incorporated documents reflect all agreements on its subject matters and that the Participant is not accepting this Agreement based on any promises, representations, or inducements other than those reflected in the Agreement. (d) The Participant agrees that the Companys delivery of any documents related to the Plan or these RSUs (including the Plan, the Agreement, the Plans prospectus, and any reports of the Company provided generally to the Companys stockholders) to the Participant may be made by electronic delivery, which may include but does not necessarily include the delivery of a link to a Company intranet or to the Internet site of a third party involved in administering the Plan, the delivery of the document via email, or any other means of electronic delivery specified by the Company. If the attempted electronic delivery of such documents fails, the Participant will be provided with a paper copy of the documents. The Participant acknowledges that the Participant may receive from the Company a paper copy of any documents that were delivered electronically at no cost to the Participant by contacting the Company by telephone or in writing. The Participant may revoke the Participants consent to the electronic delivery of documents or may change the email address to which such documents are to be delivered (if the Participant has provided an email address) at any time by notifying the Company of such revoked consent or revised email address by telephone, postal service, or email. Finally, the Participant understands that the Participant is not required to consent to electronic delivery of documents. A-5 (e) The Participant may deliver any documents related to the Plan or these RSUs to the Company by email or any other means of electronic delivery approved by the Administrator, but the Participant must provide the Company or any designated third party administrator with a paper copy of any documents if the Participants attempted electronic delivery of such documents fails. (f) The Participant accepts that all good faith decisions or interpretations of the Administrator regarding the Plan and Awards under the Plan are binding, conclusive, and final. No member of the Administrator will be personally liable for any such decisions or interpretations. (g) The Participant agrees that the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, is discretionary in nature, and may be amended, suspended, or terminated by the Company at any time, to the extent permitted by the Plan. (h) The Participant agrees that the grant of these RSUs is exceptional, voluntary, and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of restricted stock units or benefits in lieu of restricted stock units, even if restricted stock units have been granted in the past. (i) The Participant agrees that any decisions regarding future Awards will be in the Companys sole discretion. (j) The Participant agrees that the Participant is voluntarily participating in the Plan. (k) The Participant agrees that these RSUs and any Shares acquired under these RSUs, and the income from and value of same, are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation. (l) The Participant agrees that these RSUs, any Shares acquired under these RSUs, and the income from and value of same, are not part of normal or expected compensation for any purpose, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, holiday pay, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits, or similar payments. (m) The Participant agrees that the future value of the Shares underlying these RSUs is unknown, indeterminable, and cannot be predicted with certainty. (n) The Participant agrees that no member of the Company Group is liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the Participants local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of these RSUs or of any amounts due to the Participant from the payment of these RSUs or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon such payment. (o) Unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by the Administrator in its discretion, the RSUs and the benefits evidenced in this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the RSUs or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company, nor to be exchanged, cashed out, or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Shares. A-6 (p) The Participant agrees that the Participant has no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages from any forfeiture of these RSUs resulting from the termination of the Participants status as a Service Provider (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Participant is a Service Provider or the terms of the Participants service agreement, if any). 10. Data Privacy. (a) The Participant voluntarily, explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of the Participants personal data as described in this Agreement and any other Award materials (Data) by and among, as applicable, the Employer(s), the Company, and any member of the Company Group for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering, and managing the Participants participation in the Plan. (b) The Participant understands that the Company and the Service Recipient(s) may hold certain personal information about the Participant, including, but not limited to, the Participants name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all equity awards, or any other entitlement to stock awarded, canceled, vested, unvested, or outstanding in the Participants favor, for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering, and managing the Plan. (c) The Participant understands that Data will be transferred to one or more stock plan service provider(s) selected by the Company, which may assist the Company with the implementation, administration, and management of the Plan. The Participant understands that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipients country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than the Participants country. The Participant understands that if the Participant resides outside the United States, the Participant may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting the Participants local human resources representative. The Participant authorizes the Company and any other possible recipients that may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering, and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain, and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purposes of implementing, administering, and managing the Participants participation in the Plan. (d) The Participant understands that Data may be transferred to a stock plan service provider, as may be selected by the Company in the future, assisting the Company with the implementation, administration, and management of the Plan. The Participant understands that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipients country of operation (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than the Participants country. The Participant authorizes the Company, any stock plan service provider selected by the Company, and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future), including but not limited to E*TRADE Financial Corporate Services, Inc., Equity Plan Solutions, LLC, and eShares, Inc. DBA Carta, Inc., with implementing, administering, and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain, and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, A-7 administering, and managing the Participants participation in the Plan. The Participant understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer, and manage the Participants participation in the Plan. The Participant understands that if the Participant resides in certain jurisdictions outside the United States, to the extent required by Applicable Laws, the Participant may, at any time, request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting the Company and/or access to Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data, or refuse or withdraw the consents given by accepting these RSUs, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing the Participants local human resources representative. Further, the Participant understands that the Participant is providing these consents on a purely voluntary basis. If the Participant does not consent or if the Participant later seeks to revoke the Participants consent, the Participants engagement as a Service Provider with the Service Recipient(s) will not be adversely affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing the Participants consent is that the Company will not be able to grant the Participant awards under the Plan or administer or maintain awards. Therefore, the Participant understands that refusing or withdrawing the Participants consent may affect the Participants ability to participate in the Plan (including the right to retain these RSUs). The Participant understands that the Participant may contact the Participants local human resources representative for more information on the consequences of the Participants refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent. 11. Insider Trading Restrictions/Market Abuse Laws. The Participant acknowledges that the Participant may be subject to insider trading restrictions and market abuse laws in applicable jurisdictions including, but not limited to, the United States and the Participants country of residence, which may affect the Participants ability to acquire or sell Shares or rights to Shares (e.g., RSUs) under the Plan during such time as the Participant is considered to have inside information regarding the Company (as defined by the laws in the applicable jurisdictions). Local insider trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders the Participant placed before the Participant possessed inside information. Furthermore, the Participant could be prohibited from (i) disclosing the inside information to any third party and (ii) tipping third parties or causing them otherwise to buy or sell securities. The Participant should keep in mind that the term third parties includes fellow employees. Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable insider trading policy of the Company. The Participant is responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable restrictions and should consult with the Participants personal legal advisor on this matter. 12. Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Requirements. Depending on the Participants country, the Participant may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control, and/or tax reporting requirements as a result of the vesting of the RSUs, the acquisition, holding, and/or transfer of Shares or cash resulting from participation in the Plan and/or the opening and maintaining of a brokerage or bank account in connection with the Plan. The Participant may be required to report such assets, accounts, account balances and values, and/or related transactions to the applicable authorities in the Participants country. The Participant may also be required to repatriate sale proceeds or other funds received as a result of the Participants participation in the Plan to the Participants country through a designated bank or broker and/or within a certain time after receipt. The Participant acknowledges that the Participant is responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable foreign asset/account, exchange control, and tax reporting and other requirements. The Participant further understands that the Participant should consult the Participants personal tax and legal advisors, as applicable on these matters. A-8 13. Miscellaneous.

Any notice to be given to the Company under the terms of this Agreement must be addressed to the Company at Udemy, Inc., 600 Harrison Street, 3rd Floor, San Francisco, California 94107, USA, Attn.: General Counsel, until the Company designates another address in writing.

(d) Additional Conditions to Issuance of Stock. If at any time the Company determines, in its discretion, that the listing, registration, qualification, or rule compliance of the Shares upon any securities exchange or under any U.S. or non-U.S. federal, state, or local law, the tax Code and related regulations, or under the rulings or regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or any other governmental regulatory body or the clearance, consent, or approval of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or any other governmental regulatory authority is necessary or desirable as a condition to the issuance of Shares to Participant hereunder, such issuance will not occur unless and until such listing, registration, qualification, rule compliance, clearance, consent, or approval will have been completed, effected, or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company. If any such listing, registration, qualification, rule compliance, clearance, consent, or approval has not been completed by the applicable Settlement Deadline with respect to a Restricted Stock Unit in a manner that would allow it to be settled by the applicable Settlement Deadline, such Restricted Stock Unit will be forfeited as of immediately following the Settlement Deadline for no consideration and at no cost to the Company. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Plan, the Company shall not be required to issue any certificate or certificates for Shares hereunder prior to the lapse of such reasonable period of time following the date of vesting of a Restricted Stock Unit as the Administrator may establish from time to time for reasons of administrative convenience and any such certificate may be in book entry form. (e) Captions. Captions provided in this Agreement are for convenience only and are not to serve as a basis for interpretation or construction of this Agreement. (f) Agreement Severable. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be severed from the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the invalidity or unenforceability will have no effect on the remainder of the Agreement. A-9 (g) Country Addendum. These RSUs are subject to any special terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit B to this Agreement for any country whose laws are applicable to the Participant and this RSU Award (as determined by the Company in its sole discretion) (the Country Addendum). If the Participant relocates to a country included in the Country Addendum, the special terms and conditions for that country will apply to the Participant to the extent the Company determines that applying such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons. (h) Imposition of Other Requirements. The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Participants participation in the Plan, on the RSUs and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require the Participant to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing; provided, however, that no such imposition of other requirements shall occur or be effective unless such imposition would result in these RSUs remaining exempt or excepted from the requirements of Code Section 409A pursuant to the short-term deferral exception or another exception or exemption under Code Section 409A, or otherwise complying with Code Section 409A, in each case such that none of this Agreement, the RSUs provided under this Agreement, or Shares, cash or other property issuable hereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Code Section 409A. (i) Choice of Law; Choice of Forum. The Plan, this Agreement, these RSUs, and all determinations made and actions taken under the Plan, to the extent not otherwise governed by the laws of the United States, will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises under the Plan, the Participants acceptance of these RSUs is the Participants consent to the jurisdiction of the State of Delaware and the Participants agreement that any such litigation will be conducted in the Delaware Court of Chancery or the federal courts for the United States for the District of Delaware and no other courts, regardless of where the Participant is performing services. (j) Modifications to the Agreement. The Plan and this Agreement constitute the entire understanding of the parties on the subjects covered. The Participant expressly warrants that the Participant is not accepting this Agreement in reliance on any promises, representations, or inducements other than those contained herein. Modifications to this Agreement or the Plan can be made only in an express written contract executed by a duly authorized officer of the Company. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to Section 13(h), the Administrator may, without the consent of the Participant, modify this Agreement in any of the following manners: (i) take any action permitted by Section 4 of this Agreement, including to waive or decrease, in whole or in part, some or all of the requirements required for vesting of all or a portion of the unvested RSUs; or (ii) waive or decrease some or all of the requirements for settlement of RSUs. The Company reserves the right to revise this Agreement as it deems necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Participant, to comply with Code Section 409A, to otherwise avoid imposition of any additional tax or income recognition under Code Section 409A in connection with these RSUs, or to comply with other Applicable Laws. (k) Waiver. The Participant acknowledges that a waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of this Agreement will not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement or of any subsequent breach of this Agreement by the Participant. A-10 (l) Language. The Participant acknowledges that the Participant is sufficiently proficient in English, or has consulted with an advisor who is sufficiently proficient in English, so as to allow the Participant to understand the terms of this Agreement. If Participant has received this Agreement, or any other document related to these RSUs and/or the Plan translated into a language other than English and if the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version, the English version will control. A-11 EXHIBIT B COUNTRY ADDENDUM TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT Terms and Conditions This Country Addendum to Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (the Country Addendum) includes additional terms and conditions that govern these RSUs granted to the Participant under the Plan if the Participant resides and/or works in one of the countries listed below on the Grant Date or the Participant moves to one of the listed countries. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Plan and the Agreement. If the Participant is a citizen or resident of a country (or if the Participant is considered as such for local law purposes) other than the one in which the Participant is currently residing and/or working, or if the Participant transfers to another country after being granted the RSUs, the Company will, in its discretion, determine the extent to which the terms and conditions contained herein will be applicable to the Participant. Notifications This Country Addendum may also include information regarding securities laws, exchange controls, and certain other issues of which the Participant should be aware with respect to participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control, and other Applicable Laws in effect in the respective countries as of August 2021. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that the Participant not rely on the information in this Country Addendum as the only source of information relating to the consequences of participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time the Participant vests in or sells the Shares acquired under the Plan. In addition, the information contained in this Country Addendum is general in nature and may not apply to the Participants particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure the Participant of a particular result. The Participant is advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in the Participants country may apply to the Participants situation. Finally, if the Participant is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which the Participant is currently residing and/or working, transfers employment after these RSUs are granted, or is considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the information in this Country Addendum may not apply to the Participant in the same manner, and the Administrator will determine to what extent the terms and conditions in this Country Addendum apply. The Participant acknowledges that the Participant has been advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant exchange control and tax laws in the Participants country may apply to the Participants individual situation. B-1 |I.|| | GLOBAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO PARTICIPANTS IN ALL COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES 1. Foreign Exchange Considerations. The Participant understands and agrees that neither the Company nor any Parent, Subsidiary or employer shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the Participants local currency and the U.S. dollar that may affect the value of the RSUs, or of any amounts due to the Participant under the Plan or as a result of vesting in the RSUs and/or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired under the Plan. The Participant agrees and acknowledges that the Participant will bear any and all risk associated with the exchange or fluctuation of currency associated with the Participants participation in the Plan. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Participant may be responsible for reporting inbound transactions or fund transfers that exceed a certain amount. The Participant is advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the exchange control regulations apply to the RSUs and the Participants specific situation and understands that the relevant laws and regulations can change frequently and occasionally on a retroactive basis. 2. Tax Withholding Considerations. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that Tax Withholdings includes any or all income tax, social security, social insurances, national insurance contributions, social insurance contributions, payroll tax, fringe benefit, or other tax-related items related to the Participants participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Participant including, without limitation, in connection with the grant of the RSUs, the acquisition or sale of Shares acquired under the Plan and/or the receipt of any dividends on such Shares. Prior to any tax withholding event, the Participant agrees to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or any Parent, Subsidiary, affiliate, employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax Withholdings by one or a combination of the methods set forth in Section 7of the Agreement. 3.

The Company grants the Participant an Option to purchase Shares of Common Stock as described in the Notice of Grant. If there is a conflict between the Plan, this Agreement, or any other agreement with the Participant governing this Option, those documents will take precedence and prevail in the following order: (a) the Plan, (b) the Agreement, and (c) any other agreement between the Company and the Participant governing this Option. If the Notice of Grant designates this Option as an Incentive Stock Option (ISO), this Option is intended to qualify as an ISO under Code Section 422. Even if this Option is designated an ISO, to the extent it first becomes exercisable as to more than $100,000 in any calendar year, the portion in excess of $100,000 is not an ISO under Code Section 422(d) and that portion will be a Nonstatutory Stock Option (NSO). In addition, if the Participant exercises this Option after three (3) months have passed since the Participant ceased to be an employee of the Company or a Parent or Subsidiary of the Company, it generally will no longer be an ISO (however, different rules apply to cessation of employee status due to death or Disability). If there is any other reason this Option (or a portion of it) will not qualify as an ISO, to the extent of such nonqualification, this Option will be an NSO. The Participant understands that the Participant will have no recourse against the Administrator, any member of the Company Group, or any officer or director of a member of the Company Group if any portion of this Option is not an ISO. 2. Vesting. This Option will only be exercisable (also referred to as vested) under the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Grant, Section 3 of this Agreement, or Section 14 of the Plan. Shares scheduled to vest on a certain date or upon the occurrence of a certain condition will not vest unless the Participant continues to be a Service Provider until the time such vesting is scheduled to occur. 3. Administrator Discretion. The Administrator has the discretion to accelerate the vesting of any portion of this Option. In that case, this Option will be vested as of the date and to the extent specified by the Administrator. 4. Forfeiture upon Cessation of Status as a Service Provider. Upon the Participants termination as a Service Provider for any reason other than death, this Option will immediately stop vesting and any portion of this Option that has not yet vested will be immediately forfeited for no consideration upon the date that Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, in all cases, subject to Applicable Laws. Upon the Participants termination as a Service Provider due to the Participants death, this Option will immediately stop vesting and, on the thirtieth (30th) day following the date of the Participants death, any portion of this Option that has not yet vested will be immediately forfeited for no consideration, in all cases, subject to Applicable Laws. For purposes of this Option, the Participants status as a Service Provider will be considered to be terminated as of the date the Participant is no longer actively providing services to the Company, or if different, the Participants employer (the Employer) or the Subsidiary or Parent to which the Participant is providing services (the Employer, Subsidiary, or Parent, as applicable, the Service Recipient) or other member of the Company Group (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Participant is a Service Provider or the A-1 terms of the Participants employment or service agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or determined by the Administrator, the Participants right to vest in this Option under the Plan, if any, will terminate as of such date and the Participants right to exercise the Option after termination, if any, will be measured from such date, and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., the Participants period of service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of garden leave or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Participant is a Service Provider or the terms of the Participants employment or service agreement, if any). The Administrator shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the Participant is no longer actively providing services for purposes of this Option (including whether the Participant may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence). 5. Death of Participant. Any distribution or delivery to be made to the Participant under this Agreement will, if the Participant is then deceased, be made to the administrator or executor of the Participants estate or, if the Administrator permits, the Participants designated beneficiary, unless otherwise required to comply with Applicable Laws. Any such transferee must furnish the Company with (a) written notice of the Participants status as transferee, and (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer and compliance with any laws or regulations that apply to the transfer. 6. Exercise of Option. This Option may be exercised only before its Expiration Date and only under the Plan and this Agreement. To exercise this Option, the Participant must deliver and the Administrator must receive an exercise notice according to procedures determined by the Administrator. The exercise notice must (i) state the number of Shares as to which this Option is being exercised (Exercised Shares), (ii) make any representations or agreements required by the Company, (iii) be accompanied by a payment of the total exercise price for all Exercised Shares, and (iv) be accompanied by a payment of all required Tax Withholdings for all Exercised Shares. This Option is exercised when both the exercise notice and payments due have been received by the Company for all Exercised Shares. The Administrator may designate a particular exercise notice to be used, but until a designation is made, the exercise notice attached to this Agreement as Exhibit C may be used. 7. Method of Payment. The Participant may pay the total exercise price for Exercised Shares by any of the following methods or a combination of methods: (i) cash, (ii) check, (iii) wire transfer, (iv) consideration received by the Company under a formal cashless exercise program adopted by the Company, or (v) surrender of other Shares, as long as the Company determines that accepting such Shares does not result in any adverse accounting consequences to the Company. If Shares are surrendered, the value of those Shares will be the fair market value for those Shares on the date they are surrendered. A non-U.S. residents methods of exercise may be restricted by the terms and condition of the Country Addendum attached hereto as Exhibit B. A-2 8. Tax Obligations. (a) Tax Withholding. (i) No Shares will be issued to the Participant until the Participant makes satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Administrator) for the payment of Tax Withholdings. If the Participant is a non-U.S. employee, the method of payment of Tax Withholdings may be restricted by the Country Addendum. If the Participant fails to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment of any Tax Withholdings under this Agreement at the time of an attempted Option exercise, the Company may refuse to honor the exercise and refuse to deliver the Shares, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws. (ii) The Company also has the right (but not the obligation) to satisfy any Tax Withholdings (A) by reducing the number of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant, (B) by requiring payment by cash or check made payable to the Company and/or any Service Recipient with respect to which the withholding obligation arises, (C) by deduction of such amount from salary, wages, or other compensation payable to the Participant, or (D) in any combination of the foregoing, or any other method determined by the Administrator to be compliance with Applicable Laws. (iii) The Company may withhold or account for Tax Withholdings by considering statutory or other withholding rates, including minimum or maximum rates applicable in the Participants jurisdiction(s). In the event of over-withholding, the Participant may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash (with no entitlement to the equivalent in Common Stock), or if not refunded, the Participant may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay any additional Tax Withholdings directly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company and/or the Employer(s). If the obligation for Tax Withholdings is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, the Participant will be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares exercised, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax Withholdings. (iv) Further, if the Participant is subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, the Company or the Employer(s) or former Employer(s) may withhold or account for tax in more than one jurisdiction. (v) Regardless of any action of the Company or the Employer(s), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax Withholdings and any and all additional taxes related to the Option, the Shares or other amounts or property delivered under the Option and the Participants participation in the Plan is and remains the Participants responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer(s). The Participant further acknowledges that the Company and the Employer(s) (A) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax Withholdings in connection with any aspect of this Option and (B) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of this Option to reduce or eliminate the Participants liability for Tax Withholdings or achieve any particular tax result. (vi) For U.S. taxpayers, under Code Section 409A, a stock right (such as this Option) that was granted with a per share exercise price that is determined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) to be less than the fair market value of an underlying share on the date of grant (a discount option) may be considered deferred compensation. A stock right that is a discount option may result in (A) income A-3 recognition by the recipient of the stock right prior to the exercise of the stock right, (B) an additional 20% U.S. federal income tax, and (C) potential penalty and interest charges. The discount option may also result in additional U.S. state income, penalty, and interest tax to the recipient of the stock right. Participant is hereby notified that the Company cannot and has not guaranteed that the IRS will agree that the per Share exercise price of this Option equals or exceeds the fair market value of a Share on the Grant Date in a later examination. Participant is hereby notified that if the IRS determines that this Option was granted with a per Share exercise price that was less than the fair market value of a Share on the Grant Date, Participant shall be solely responsible for Participants costs related to such a determination. (b) Tax Reporting. This Section 8(b) applies if the Participant is a U.S. income taxpayer. If this Option is partially or wholly an ISO, and if the Participant sells or otherwise disposes of any the Shares acquired by exercising the ISO portion on or before the later of (i) two (2) years after the Grant Date or (ii) one (1) year after the date of exercise, the Participant may be subject to withholding of Tax Withholdings by the Company on the compensation income recognized by the Participant and must immediately notify the Company in writing of the disposition. 9.

If the attempted electronic delivery of such documents fails, the Participant will be provided with a paper copy of the documents. The Participant acknowledges that the Participant may receive from the Company a paper copy of any documents that were delivered electronically at no cost to the Participant by contacting the Company by telephone or in writing. The Participant may revoke the Participants consent to the electronic delivery of documents or may change the electronic mail address to which such documents are to be delivered (if the Participant has provided an electronic mail address) at any time by notifying the Company of such revoked consent or revised e-mail address by telephone, postal service, or electronic mail.

(k) The Participant agrees that the Participant is voluntarily participating in the Plan.

A-5 (n) The Participant agrees that the future value of the Shares underlying this Option is unknown, indeterminable, and cannot be predicted with certainty. (o) The Participant understands that if the underlying Shares do not increase in value, this Option will have no intrinsic monetary value. (p) The Participant understands that if this Option is exercised, the value of each Share received on exercise may increase or decrease in value, even below the Exercise Price. (q) The Participant agrees that no member of the Company Group is liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the Participants local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of this Option or of any amounts due to the Participant from the exercise of this Option or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon exercise. (r) Unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by the Administrator in its discretion, this Option and the benefits evidenced in this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have this Option or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company, nor to be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Shares. (s) The Participant agrees that the Participant has no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages from any forfeiture of this Option resulting from the termination of the Participants status as a Service Provider (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Participant is a Service Provider or the terms of the Participants service agreement, if any). 11. Data Privacy. (a) The Participant voluntarily consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of the Participants personal data as described in this Agreement and any other Award materials (Data) by and among, as applicable, the Employer(s), the Company and any member of the Company Group for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering, and managing the Participants participation in the Plan. (b) The Participant understands that the Company and the Employer(s) may hold certain personal information about the Participant, including, but not limited to, the Participants name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all equity awards or any other entitlement to stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested, or outstanding in the Participants favor, for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering, and managing the Plan. (c) The Participant understands that Data will be transferred to one or more a stock plan service provider(s) selected by the Company, which may assist the Company with the implementation, administration, and management of the Plan. The Participant understands that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the A-6 recipients country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than the Participants country. The Participant understands that if the Participant resides outside the United States, the Participant may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting the Participants local human resources representative. The Participant authorizes the Company and any other possible recipients that may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering, and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain, and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purposes of implementing, administering, and managing the Participants participation in the Plan. (d) The Participant understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer, and manage the Participants participation in the Plan. The Participant understands that if the Participant resides in certain jurisdictions outside the United States, to the extent required by Applicable Laws, the Participant may, at any time, request access to Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data, or refuse or withdraw the consents given by accepting this Option, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing the Participants local human resources representative. Further, the Participant understands that the Participant is providing these consents on a purely voluntary basis. If the Participant does not consent or if the Participant later seeks to revoke the Participants consent, the Participants engagement as a Service Provider with the Employer(s) will not be adversely affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing the Participants consent is that the Company will not be able to grant the Participant awards under the Plan or administer or maintain awards. Therefore, the Participant understands that refusing or withdrawing the Participants consent may affect the Participants ability to participate in the Plan (including the right to retain this Option). The Participant understands that the Participant may contact the Participants local human resources representative for more information on the consequences of the Participants refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent. 12.

The Participant acknowledges that the Participant may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws in applicable jurisdictions including, but not limited to, the United States and the Participants country of residence, which may affect the Participants ability to acquire or sell Shares or rights to Shares (e.g., this Option) under the Plan during such time as the Participant is considered to have inside information regarding the Company (as defined by the laws in the applicable jurisdictions). Local insider trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders the Participant placed before the Participant possessed inside information. Furthermore, the Participant could be prohibited from (i) disclosing the inside information to any third party and (ii) tipping third parties or causing them otherwise to buy or sell securities. The Participant should keep in mind third parties includes fellow employees. Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable insider trading policy of the Company.

The information is based on the securities, exchange control, and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of February 2021. Such laws often are complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that Participant not rely on the information in this Country Addendum or any tax summary provided by the Company as the only source of information relating to the consequences of Participants participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time Participant exercises the Options or sells the Shares acquired under the Plan. In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to Participants particular situation and the Company is not in a position to assure Participant of any particular result. Accordingly, Participant is advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws of Participants country may apply to his or her situation. Finally, if Participant is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which Participant currently is a Service Provider or transfers to another country after the grant of the Option, or is considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the information contained herein may not be applicable to Participant in the same manner. In addition, the Company, in its discretion, will determine the extent to which the terms and conditions contained herein will apply to Participant under these circumstances.

Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering maximum applicable withholding rates, in which case Participant will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. Finally, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any applicable Parent, Subsidiary, affiliate, or employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or any Parent, Subsidiary, affiliate, or employer may be required to withhold as a result of Participants participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.

An option to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Non-423 Component will be granted pursuant to rules, procedures, or sub-plans adopted by the Administrator designed to achieve tax, securities laws, or other objectives for Eligible Employees and the Company.

Further, if the stockholders of the Company immediately before such change in ownership continue to retain immediately after the change in ownership, in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of shares of the Companys voting stock immediately prior to the change in ownership, direct or indirect beneficial ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the total voting power of the stock of the Company or of the ultimate parent entity of the Company, such event shall not be considered a Change in Control under this subsection (i).

An Eligible Employee may participate in the Plan pursuant to Section 3(b) by (i) submitting to the Companys stock administration office (or its designee) a properly completed subscription agreement authorizing Contributions in the form provided by the Administrator for such purpose or (ii) following an electronic or other enrollment procedure determined by the Administrator, in either case on or before a date determined by the Administrator prior to an applicable Enrollment Date. 6. Contributions. (a) At the time a Participant enrolls in the Plan pursuant to Section 5, he or she will elect to have Contributions (in the form of payroll deductions or otherwise, to the extent permitted by the Administrator) made on each pay day during the Offering Period in an amount not exceeding fifteen percent (15%) of the Compensation that he or she receives on the pay day (provided that, should a pay day occur on an Exercise Date, a Participant will have any Contributions made on such day applied to his or her account under the immediately following Purchase Period or Offering Period, as applicable). The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may permit all Participants in a specified Offering to contribute amounts to the Plan through payment by cash, check, or other means set forth in the subscription agreement prior to each Exercise Date of each Purchase Period. A Participants subscription agreement will remain in effect for successive Offering Periods unless terminated as provided in Section 10 hereof. (b) In the event Contributions are made in the form of payroll deductions, such payroll deductions for a Participant will commence on the first pay day following the Enrollment Date and will end on the last pay day on or prior to the last Exercise Date of such Offering Period to which such authorization is applicable, unless sooner terminated by the Participant as provided in Section 10 hereof; provided, however, that for the first Offering Period, payroll deductions will commence on the first pay day on or following the end of the Enrollment Window. (c) All Contributions made for a Participant will be credited to his or her account under the Plan and Contributions will be made in whole percentages of his or her Compensation only. A Participant may not make any additional payments into such account. - 9 - (d) A Participant may discontinue his or her participation in the Plan as provided under Section 10. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, during an Offering Period, a Participant may not increase the rate of his or her Contributions, and during a Purchase Period, may only decrease the rate of his or her Contributions one (1) time to a Contribution rate that is less than the Participants original Contribution Rate in effect at the commencement of the applicable Offering Period. Any such decrease during a Purchase Period requires the Participant (i) properly completing and submitting to the Companys stock administration office (or its designee) a new subscription agreement authorizing the change in Contribution rate in the form provided by the Administrator for such purpose or (ii) following an electronic or other procedure prescribed by the Administrator, in either case on or before a date determined by the Administrator prior to an applicable Exercise Date. If a Participant has not followed such procedures to change the rate of Contributions, the rate of his or her Contributions will continue at the originally elected rate throughout the Purchase Period and future Offering Periods and Purchase Periods (unless the Participants participation is terminated as provided in Sections 10 or 11). The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, amend the nature and/or number of Contribution rate changes that may be made by Participants during any Offering Period or Purchase Period and may establish other conditions or limitations as it deems appropriate for Plan administration. Any change in the rate of Contributions made pursuant to this Section 6(d) will be effective as of the first (1st) full payroll period following five (5) business days after the date on which the change is made by the Participant (unless the Administrator, in its sole discretion, elects to process a given change in payroll deduction rate more quickly). (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3(d), a Participants Contributions may be decreased to zero percent (0%) at any time during a Purchase Period. Subject to Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3(d) hereof, Contributions will recommence at the rate originally elected by the Participant effective as of the beginning of the first Purchase Period scheduled to end in the following calendar year, unless terminated by the Participant as provided in Section 10. (f) Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in the Plan, the Administrator may allow Participants to participate in the Plan via cash contributions instead of payroll deductions if (i) payroll deductions are not permitted under applicable local law, (ii) the Administrator determines that cash contributions are permissible under Section 423 of the Code, or (iii) the Participants are participating in the Non-423 Component. (g) At the time the option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at the time some or all of the Common Stock issued under the Plan is disposed of (or any other time that a taxable event related to the Plan occurs), the Participant must make adequate provision for the Companys or Employers federal, state, local, or any other tax liability payable to any authority including taxes imposed by jurisdictions outside of the U.S., national insurance, social security, or other tax withholding - 10 - obligations, if any, which arise upon the exercise of the option or the disposition of the Common Stock (or any other time that a taxable event related to the Plan occurs). At any time, the Company or the Employer may, but will not be obligated to, withhold from the Participants compensation the amount necessary for the Company or the Employer to meet applicable withholding obligations, including any withholding required to make available to the Company or the Employer any tax deductions or benefits attributable to sale or early disposition of Common Stock by the Eligible Employee. In addition, the Company or the Employer may, but will not be obligated to, withhold from the proceeds of the sale of Common Stock or any other method of withholding the Company or the Employer deems appropriate to the extent permitted by U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.423-2(f). 7. Grant of Option. On the Enrollment Date of each Offering Period, each Eligible Employee participating in such Offering Period will be granted an option to purchase on each Exercise Date during such Offering Period (at the applicable Purchase Price) up to a number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing such Eligible Employees Contributions accumulated prior to such Exercise Date and retained in the Eligible Employees account as of the Exercise Date by the applicable Purchase Price; provided that in no event will an Eligible Employee be permitted to purchase during each Purchase Period more than 5,000 shares of Common Stock (subject to any adjustment pursuant to Section 19) and provided further that such purchase will be subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 3(d) and 13. The Eligible Employee may accept the grant of such option (i) with respect to the first Offering Period by submitting a properly completed subscription agreement in accordance with the requirements of Section 5 on or before the last day of the Enrollment Window, and (ii) with respect to any subsequent Offering Period under the Plan, by electing to participate in the Plan in accordance with the requirements of Section 5. The Administrator may, for future Offering Periods, increase or decrease, in its absolute discretion, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that an Eligible Employee may purchase during each Purchase Period. Exercise of the option will occur as provided in Section 8, unless the Participant has withdrawn pursuant to Section 10. The option will expire on the last day of the Offering Period. 8. Exercise of Option. (a) Unless a Participant withdraws from the Plan as provided in Section 10, his or her option for the purchase of shares of Common Stock will be exercised automatically on each Exercise Date, and the maximum number of full shares subject to the option will be purchased for such Participant at the applicable Purchase Price with the accumulated Contributions from his or her account. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be purchased; any Contributions accumulated in a Participants account which are not sufficient to purchase a full share will be retained in the Participants account for the subsequent Purchase Period or Offering Period, subject to earlier withdrawal by the Participant as provided in Section 10. Any other funds left over in a Participants account after the Exercise Date will be returned to the Participant. During a Participants lifetime, a Participants option to purchase shares hereunder is exercisable only by him or her. - 11 - (b) If the Administrator determines that, on a given Exercise Date, the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which options are to be exercised may exceed (i) the number of shares of Common Stock that were available for sale under the Plan on the Enrollment Date of the applicable Offering Period, or (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock available for sale under the Plan on such Exercise Date, the Administrator may in its sole discretion (x) provide that the Company will make a pro rata allocation of the shares of Common Stock available for purchase on such Enrollment Date or Exercise Date, as applicable, in as uniform a manner as will be practicable and as it will determine in its sole discretion to be equitable among all Participants exercising options to purchase Common Stock on such Exercise Date, and continue all Offering Periods then in effect or (y) provide that the Company will make a pro rata allocation of the shares of Common Stock available for purchase on such Enrollment Date or Exercise Date, as applicable, in as uniform a manner as will be practicable and as it will determine in its sole discretion to be equitable among all participants exercising options to purchase Common Stock on such Exercise Date, and terminate any or all Offering Periods then in effect pursuant to Section 20. The Company may make a pro rata allocation of the shares available on the Enrollment Date of any applicable Offering Period pursuant to the preceding sentence, notwithstanding any authorization of additional shares for issuance under the Plan by the Companys stockholders subsequent to such Enrollment Date. 9. Delivery. As soon as reasonably practicable after each Exercise Date on which a purchase of shares of Common Stock occurs, the Company will arrange the delivery to each Participant of the shares purchased upon exercise of his or her option in a form determined by the Administrator (in its sole discretion) and pursuant to rules established by the Administrator. The Company may permit or require that shares be deposited directly with a broker designated by the Company or to a designated agent of the Company, and the Company may utilize electronic or automated methods of share transfer. The Company may require that shares be retained with such broker or agent for a designated period of time and/or may establish other procedures to permit tracking of disqualifying dispositions of such shares. No Participant will have any voting, dividend, or other stockholder rights with respect to shares of Common Stock subject to any option granted under the Plan until such shares have been purchased and delivered to the Participant as provided in this Section 9. - 12 - 10. Withdrawal. (a) A Participant may withdraw all but not less than all the Contributions credited to his or her account and not yet used to exercise his or her option under the Plan at any time by (i) submitting to the Companys stock administration office (or its designee) a written notice of withdrawal in the form determined by the Administrator for such purpose (which may be similar to the form attached hereto as Exhibit B), or (ii) following an electronic or other withdrawal procedure determined by the Administrator. The Administrator may set forth a deadline of when a withdrawal must occur to be effective prior to a given Exercise Date in accordance with policies it may approve from time to time. All of the Participants Contributions credited to his or her account will be paid to such Participant promptly after receipt of notice of withdrawal and such Participants option for the Offering Period will be automatically terminated, and no further Contributions for the purchase of shares will be made for such Offering Period. If a Participant withdraws from an Offering Period, Contributions will not resume at the beginning of the succeeding Offering Period unless the Participant re-enrolls in the Plan in accordance with the provisions of Section 5. (b) A Participants withdrawal from an Offering Period will not have any effect on his or her eligibility to participate in any similar plan that may hereafter be adopted by the Company or in succeeding Offering Periods that commence after the termination of the Offering Period from which the Participant withdraws. 11. Termination of Employment. Upon a Participants ceasing to be an Eligible Employee for any reason, he or she will be deemed to have elected to withdraw from the Plan and the Contributions credited to such Participants account during the Offering Period but not yet used to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Plan will be returned to such Participant or, in the case of his or her death, to the person or persons entitled thereto under Section 15, and such Participants option will be automatically terminated. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, a Participant whose employment transfers between entities through a termination with an immediate rehire (with no break in service) by the Company or a Designated Company will not be treated as terminated under the Plan; however, if a Participant transfers from an Offering under the 423 Component to the Non-423 Component, the exercise of the option will be qualified under the 423 Component only to the extent it complies with Section 423 of the Code, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator. 12. Interest. No interest will accrue on the Contributions of a participant in the Plan, except as may be required by Applicable Law, as determined by the Company, and if so required by the laws of a particular jurisdiction, will apply to all Participants in the relevant Offering under the 423 Component, except to the extent otherwise permitted by U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.423-2(f). - 13 - 13. Stock. Subject to adjustment upon changes in capitalization of the Company as provided in Section 19 hereof, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that will be made available for sale under the Plan will be 2,800,000 shares of Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan will be increased on the first day of each Fiscal Year beginning with the 2023 Fiscal Year equal to the least of (i) one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of Common Stock on the last day of the immediately preceding Fiscal Year, (ii) three (3) times the initial number of shares reserved under the Plan as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, or (iii) a lesser amount determined by the Administrator. Until the shares of Common Stock are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), a Participant will have only the rights of an unsecured creditor with respect to such shares, and no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder will exist with respect to such shares. Shares of Common Stock to be delivered to a Participant under the Plan will be registered in the name of the Participant or in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse. 14. Administration. The Plan will be administered by the Board or a Committee appointed by the Board, which Committee will be constituted to comply with Applicable Laws. The Administrator will have full and exclusive discretionary authority to construe, interpret and apply the terms of the Plan, to delegate ministerial duties to any of the Companys employees, to designate separate Offerings under the Plan, to designate Subsidiaries and Affiliates of the Company as participating in the 423 Component or Non-423 Component, to determine eligibility, to adjudicate all disputed claims filed under the Plan and to establish such procedures that it deems necessary for the administration of the Plan (including, without limitation, to adopt such procedures and sub-plans as are necessary or appropriate to permit the participation in the Plan by employees who are foreign nationals or employed outside the U.S., the terms of which sub-plans may take precedence over other provisions of this Plan, with the exception of Section 13 hereof, but unless otherwise superseded by the terms of such sub-plan, the provisions of this Plan will govern the operation of such sub-plan). Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, the Eligible Employees eligible to participate in each sub-plan will participate in a separate Offering or in the Non-423 Component. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrator is specifically authorized to adopt rules and procedures regarding eligibility to participate, the definition of Compensation, handling of Contributions, making of Contributions to the Plan (including, without limitation, in forms other than payroll deductions), establishment of bank or trust accounts to hold Contributions, payment of interest, conversion of local currency, obligations to pay payroll tax, determination of beneficiary designation requirements, withholding procedures and handling of stock certificates that vary with applicable local requirements. The Administrator also is authorized to determine that, to the extent permitted by U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.423-2(f), the terms of an option granted under the Plan or an Offering to citizens or residents of a non-U.S. jurisdiction will be less favorable than the terms of options granted under the Plan or the same Offering to employees resident solely in the U.S. Every finding, decision, and determination made by the Administrator will, to the full extent permitted by law, be final and binding upon all parties. - 14 - 15. Designation of Beneficiary. (a) If permitted by the Administrator, a Participant may file a designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any shares of Common Stock and cash, if any, from the Participants account under the Plan in the event of such Participants death subsequent to an Exercise Date on which the option is exercised but prior to delivery to such Participant of such shares and cash. In addition, if permitted by the Administrator, a Participant may file a designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any cash from the Participants account under the Plan in the event of such Participants death prior to exercise of the option. If a Participant is married and the designated beneficiary is not the spouse, spousal consent will be required for such designation to be effective. (b) Such designation of beneficiary may be changed by the Participant at any time by notice in a form determined by the Administrator. In the event of the death of a Participant and in the absence of a beneficiary validly designated under the Plan who is living at the time of such Participants death, the Company will deliver such shares and/or cash to the executor or administrator of the estate of the Participant, or if no such executor or administrator has been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its discretion, may deliver such shares and/or cash to the spouse or to any one or more dependents or relatives of the Participant, or if no spouse, dependent or relative is known to the Company, then to such other person as the Company may designate. (c) All beneficiary designations will be in such form and manner as the Administrator may designate from time to time. Notwithstanding Sections 15(a) and (b) above, the Company and/or the Administrator may decide not to permit such designations by Participants in non-U.S. jurisdictions to the extent permitted by U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.423-2(f). 16. Transferability. Neither Contributions credited to a Participants account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an option or to receive shares of Common Stock under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged, or otherwise disposed of in any way (other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or as provided in Section 15 hereof) by the Participant. Any such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge, or other disposition will be without effect, except that the Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw funds from an Offering Period in accordance with Section 10 hereof. - 15 - 17. Use of Funds. The Company may use all Contributions received or held by it under the Plan for any corporate purpose, and the Company will not be obligated to segregate such Contributions except under Offerings or for Participants in the Non-423 Component for which Applicable Laws require that Contributions to the Plan by Participants be segregated from the Companys general corporate funds and/or deposited with an independent third party. Until shares of Common Stock are issued, Participants will have only the rights of an unsecured creditor with respect to such shares. 18. Reports. Individual accounts will be maintained for each Participant in the Plan. Statements of account will be given to participating Eligible Employees at least annually, which statements will set forth the amounts of Contributions, the Purchase Price, the number of shares of Common Stock purchased, and the remaining cash balance, if any. 19. Adjustments, Dissolution, Liquidation, Merger, or Change in Control. (a) Adjustments. In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Common Stock, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Common Stock occurs, the Administrator, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, will, in such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust the number and class of Common Stock that may be delivered under the Plan, the Purchase Price per share and the number of shares of Common Stock covered by each option under the Plan that has not yet been exercised, and the numerical limits of Sections 7 and 13. (b) Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, any Offering Period then in progress will be shortened by setting a New Exercise Date and will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed dissolution or liquidation, unless provided otherwise by the Administrator. The New Exercise Date will be before the date of the Companys proposed dissolution or liquidation. The Administrator will notify each Participant in writing or electronically, prior to the New Exercise Date, that the Exercise Date for the Participants option has been changed to the New Exercise Date and that the Participants option will be exercised automatically on the New Exercise Date, unless prior to such date the Participant has withdrawn from the Offering Period as provided in Section 10 hereof. - 16 - (c) Merger or Change in Control. In the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding option will be assumed or an equivalent option substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the option, the Offering Period with respect to which such option relates will be shortened by setting a New Exercise Date on which such Offering Period will end. The New Exercise Date will occur before the date of the Companys proposed merger or Change in Control. The Administrator will notify each Participant in writing or electronically prior to the New Exercise Date that the Exercise Date for the Participants option has been changed to the New Exercise Date and that the Participants option will be exercised automatically on the New Exercise Date, unless prior to such date the Participant has withdrawn from the Offering Period as provided in Section 10 hereof. 20. Amendment or Termination. (a) The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan, or any part thereof, at any time and for any reason. If the Plan is terminated, the Administrator, in its discretion, may elect to terminate all outstanding Offering Periods either immediately or upon completion of the purchase of shares of Common Stock on the next Exercise Date (which may be sooner than originally scheduled, if determined by the Administrator in its discretion), or may elect to permit Offering Periods to expire in accordance with their terms (and subject to any adjustment pursuant to Section 19). If the Offering Periods are terminated prior to expiration, all amounts then credited to Participants accounts that have not been used to purchase shares of Common Stock will be returned to the Participants (without interest thereon, except as otherwise required under Applicable Laws, as further set forth in Section 12 hereof) as soon as administratively practicable. (b) Without stockholder consent and without limiting Section 20(a), the Administrator will be entitled to change the Offering Periods or Purchase Periods, designate separate Offerings, limit the frequency and/or number of changes in the amount withheld during an Offering Period, establish the exchange ratio applicable to amounts withheld in a currency other than U.S. dollars, permit Contributions in excess of the amount designated by a Participant in order to adjust for delays or mistakes in the Companys processing of properly completed Contribution elections, establish reasonable waiting and adjustment periods and/or accounting and crediting procedures to ensure that amounts applied toward the purchase of Common Stock for each Participant properly correspond with Contribution amounts, and establish such other limitations or procedures as the Administrator determines in its sole discretion advisable that are consistent with the Plan. (c) In the event the Administrator determines that the ongoing operation of the Plan may result in unfavorable financial accounting consequences, the Administrator may, in its discretion and, to the extent necessary or desirable, modify, amend, or terminate the Plan to reduce or eliminate such accounting consequence including, but not limited to: - 17 - (i) amending the Plan to conform with the safe harbor definition under the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (or any successor thereto), including with respect to an Offering Period underway at the time; (ii) altering the Purchase Price for any Offering Period or Purchase Period including an Offering Period or Purchase Period underway at the time of the change in Purchase Price; (iii) shortening any Offering Period or Purchase Period by setting a New Exercise Date, including an Offering Period or Purchase Period underway at the time of the Administrator action; (iv) reducing the maximum percentage of Compensation a Participant may elect to set aside as Contributions; and (v) reducing the maximum number of shares of Common Stock a Participant may purchase during any Offering Period or Purchase Period. Such modifications or amendments will not require stockholder approval or the consent of any Participant. 21. Notices. All notices or other communications by a Participant to the Company under or in connection with the Plan will be deemed to have been duly given when received in the form and manner specified by the Company at the location, or by the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof. 22. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares. Shares of Common Stock will not be issued with respect to an option unless the exercise of such option and the issuance and delivery of such shares pursuant thereto will comply with all applicable provisions of law, domestic or foreign, including, without limitation, the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the shares may then be listed, and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance. - 18 - As a condition to the exercise of an option, the Company may require the person exercising such option to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any of the aforementioned applicable provisions of law. 23. Code Section 409A. The 423 Component of the Plan is exempt from the application of Code Section 409A and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to so be exempt from Code Section 409A. In furtherance of the foregoing and notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, if the Administrator determines that an option granted under the Plan may be subject to Code Section 409A or that any provision in the Plan would cause an option under the Plan to be subject to Code Section 409A, the Administrator may amend the terms of the Plan and/or of an outstanding option granted under the Plan, or take such other action the Administrator determines is necessary or appropriate, in each case, without the Participants consent, to exempt any outstanding option or future option that may be granted under the Plan from or to allow any such options to comply with Code Section 409A, but only to the extent any such amendments or action by the Administrator would not violate Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate will have no liability to a Participant or any other party if the option to purchase Common Stock under the Plan that is intended to be exempt from or compliant with Code Section 409A is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Administrator with respect thereto. The Company makes no representation that the option to purchase Common Stock under the Plan is compliant with Code Section 409A. 24. Term of Plan. The Plan will become effective upon the later to occur of (i) its adoption by the Board or (ii) the business day immediately prior to the Registration Date. It will continue in effect for a term of twenty (20) years, unless sooner terminated under Section 20. 25. Stockholder Approval. The Plan will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted by the Board. Such stockholder approval will be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws. 26. Governing Law. The Plan will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware (except its choice-of-law provisions). 27. No Right to Employment. Participation in the Plan by a Participant will not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained as an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company, as applicable. Further, the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company may dismiss a Participant from employment at any time, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan. - 19 - 28. Severability. If any provision of the Plan is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason in any jurisdiction or as to any Participant, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan will be construed and enforced as to such jurisdiction or Participant as if the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had not been included. 29. Compliance with Applicable Laws. The terms of this Plan are intended to comply with all Applicable Laws and will be construed accordingly. 30. Automatic Transfer to Low Price Offering Period. To the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, if the Fair Market Value on any Exercise Date in an Offering Period is lower than the Fair Market Value on the Enrollment Date of such Offering Period, then all Participants in such Offering Period automatically will be withdrawn from such Offering Period immediately after the exercise of their option on such Exercise Date and automatically re-enrolled in the immediately following Offering Period as of the first day thereof. - 20 - EXHIBIT A UDEMY, INC. 2021 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT |_____ Original Application||Offering Date:| _____ Change in Payroll Deduction Rate 1. ____________________ (Employee) hereby elects to participate in the Udemy, Inc. 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Plan) and subscribes to purchase shares of the Companys Common Stock in accordance with this Subscription Agreement and the Plan.

The performance goals may be based on any factors the Administrator determines relevant, including without limitation on an individual, divisional, portfolio, project, business unit, segment, or Company-wide basis.

The Administrator also may determine that a Target Award (or portion thereof) will not have a performance goal associated with it but instead will be granted (if at all) as determined by the Administrator.

(d) Payment in the Event of Death or Disability. If a Termination of Employment occurs due to a Participants death or Disability prior to payment of an Actual Award that the Administrator has determined will be paid for a prior Performance Period, then the Actual Award will be paid to the Participant or the Participants estate, as the case may be, subject to the Administrators discretion pursuant to Section 4(d). |6.|| | General Provisions. (a) Tax Matters. It is the intent that this Plan be exempt from or comply with the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the payments to be provided hereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities or ambiguous terms will be interpreted to be so exempt or so comply. Each payment under this Plan is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). In no event will the Company Group have any liability, obligation, or responsibility to reimburse, indemnify, or hold harmless any Participant or other Employee for any taxes, penalties, or interest imposed, or other costs incurred, as a result of Section 409A. The Company Group will have the right and authority to deduct from any Actual Award all applicable Tax Withholdings. Prior to the payment of an Actual Award or such earlier time as any Tax Withholdings are due, the Company Group is permitted to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company Group, an amount sufficient to satisfy any Tax Withholdings with respect to such Actual Award. (b) No Effect on Employment or Service. Neither the Plan nor any award under the Plan will confer upon a Participant any right regarding continuing the Participants relationship as an Employee or other service provider to the Company Group, nor will they interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company Group or the Participant to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause, to the extent permitted by applicable laws. (c) Forfeiture Events. (i) Clawback Policy; Applicable Laws. All awards under the Plan will be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment in accordance with any clawback policy that the Company Group is required to adopt pursuant to the listing standards of any national securities exchange or association on which the Companys securities are listed or as is otherwise required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform -6- and Consumer Protection Act or other applicable laws. In addition, the Administrator may impose such other clawback, recovery, or recoupment provisions with respect to an award under the Plan as the Administrator determines necessary or appropriate, including without limitation a reacquisition right in respect of previously acquired cash, stock, or other property provided with respect to an award. Unless this Section 6(c)(i) is specifically mentioned and waived in a written agreement between a Participant and a member of the Company Group or other document, no recovery of compensation under a clawback policy will give the Participant the right to resign for good reason or constructive termination (or similar term) under any agreement with a member of the Company Group. (ii) Additional Forfeiture Terms. The Administrator may specify when providing for an award under the Plan that the Participants rights, payments, and benefits with respect to the award will be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment upon the occurrence of specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of the award. Such events may include, without limitation, termination of the Participants status as an Employee for cause or any act by a Participant, whether before or after the Participants status as an Employee terminates, that would constitute cause. (iii) Accounting Restatements. If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, then any Participant who knowingly or through gross negligence engaged in the misconduct, or who knowingly or through gross negligence failed to prevent the misconduct, and any Participant who is one of the individuals subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, will reimburse the Company Group the amount of any payment with respect to an award earned or accrued during the twelve (12) month period following the first public issuance or filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (whichever first occurred) of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement. (d) Successors. All obligations of the Company under the Plan, with respect to awards under the Plan, will be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company. (e) Nontransferability of Awards. No award under the Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and except as provided in Section 5(c). All rights with respect to an award granted to a Participant will be available during such Participants lifetime only to such Participant. 7. Amendment, Termination, and Duration. The Administrator may amend or terminate the Plan, or any part thereof, at any time and for any reason. The amendment, suspension, or termination of the Plan will not, without the consent of the Participant, alter or impair any rights or obligations under any Actual Award earned by such Participant. No award -7- may be granted during any period of suspension or after termination of the Plan. Any payments under this Plan, including the method of calculating such payments, do not create any contractual or other acquired right to participate in a similar Plan, receive any similar payments (or benefits in lieu) or have the Participants payments calculated in a certain way in the future. The actual or anticipated value of any awards under the Plan will not be taken into account in assessing any other employment benefits or termination payments, including any payments in lieu of notice or severance, except as required by applicable law. The Plan will commence on the date first adopted by the Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board, and subject to the Administrators right to amend or terminate the Plan, will remain in effect thereafter until terminated. 8. Legal Construction. (a) Gender and Number. Unless otherwise indicated by the context, any feminine term used herein also will include the masculine and any masculine term used herein also will include the feminine; the plural will include the singular and the singular will include the plural. (b) Severability. If any provision of the Plan is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason in any jurisdiction or as to any Participant, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan will be construed and enforced as if the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision had not been included. (c) Governing Law. Unless otherwise provided in an Applicable Appendix, (i) the Plan and all awards and all determinations made and actions taken under the Plan will be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions, and (ii) for purposes of litigating any dispute that arises under this Plan, a Participants acceptance of an award is his or her consent to the jurisdiction of the State of California, and agreement that any such litigation will be conducted in the state courts in San Francisco County, California, or the US federal courts for the Northern District of California, and no other courts, regardless of where a Participants services are performed. (d) Bonus Plan. The Plan is intended to be a bonus program as defined under U.S. Department of Labor regulations section 2510.3-2(c) and will be construed and administered in accordance with such intention. (e) Headings. Headings are provided herein for convenience only, and will not serve as a basis for interpretation or construction of the Plan. (f) Severability. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in the Plan shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of the Plan, but the Plan shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provisions had never been contained herein. 9. Compliance with Applicable Laws. Awards under the Plan (including without limitation the granting of such awards) will be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required. * * * -8- PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM You have been designated as a Participant who may be eligible to participate in the Employee Incentive Compensation Plan (the Plan), subject to meeting the terms of the Plan and this Acknowledgment Form.

By signing below, you acknowledge and agree that you received a copy of the Plan and have read and understand its terms.

OUTSIDE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION POLICY Adopted and approved [_____], and effective as of the Effective Date Udemy, Inc. (the Company) believes that providing cash and equity compensation to members of its Board of Directors (the Board, and members of the Board, the Directors) represents an effective tool to attract, retain, and reward Directors who are not employees of the Company (the Outside Directors). This Outside Director Compensation Policy (the Policy) is intended to formalize the Companys policy regarding cash compensation and grants of equity awards to its Outside Directors. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used in this Policy will have the meaning given such term in the Companys 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (or if such plan no longer is in use at the time of the grant of an equity award, the meaning given such term or any similar term in the equity plan then in place under which such equity award is granted) (such applicable plan, the Plan). Each Outside Director will be solely responsible for any tax obligations incurred by such Outside Director as a result of the equity awards and cash and other compensation such Outside Director receives under this Policy. Subject to Section 9 of this Policy, this Policy will be effective as of the date of the first sale of Shares (or other common equity securities of the Company) to the general public upon the closing of an underwritten public offering (1) pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to Section 12(b) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and (2) immediately after which such securities (i.e., the Shares or other common equity securities of the Company) are registered on a national securities exchange (as defined under then-applicable United States federal securities laws and regulations) (such date, the Effective Date). 1. Cash Compensation. a. Annual Cash Retainers for Service as Outside Director. Each Outside Director will be paid a cash retainer of $35,000 per year. There are no per-meeting attendance fees for attending Board meetings or meetings of any committee of the Board. b. Additional Annual Cash Retainers for Service as Lead Independent Director, Committee Chair, and Committee Member. As of the Effective Date, each Outside Director who serves as the Lead Independent Director, or chair or a member of a committee of the Board will be eligible to earn additional annual fees as follows: | | Lead Independent Director: |$||15,000| | | Audit Committee Chair: |$||20,000| | | Member of Audit Committee: |$||10,000| | | Compensation Committee Chair: |$||14,000| | | Member of Compensation Committee: |$||7,000| | | Nominating and Governance Committee Chair: |$||8,000| | | Member of Nominating and Governance Committee: |$||4,000| For clarity, each Outside Director who serves as the chair of a committee will receive only the additional annual fee as the chair of the committee and not the additional annual fee as a member of such committee while serving as such chair, provided that the Outside Director who serves as the Lead Independent Director will receive the annual fee as an Outside Director and the additional annual fee as the Lead Independent Director. c. Payments. Each annual cash retainer under this Policy will be paid quarterly in arrears on a prorated basis to each Outside Director who has served in the relevant capacity at any point during the immediately preceding fiscal quarter of the Company (Fiscal Quarter), and such payment will be made no later than 30 days following the end of such immediately preceding Fiscal Quarter. For purposes of clarity, an Outside Director who has served as an Outside Director, as a member of an applicable committee (or chair thereof) during only a portion of the relevant Fiscal Quarter will receive a prorated payment of the quarterly payment of the applicable annual cash retainer(s), calculated based on the number of days during such Fiscal Quarter such Outside Director has served in the relevant capacities. For purposes of clarity, an Outside Director who has served as an Outside Director, as a member of an applicable committee (or chair thereof), as applicable, from the Effective Date through the end of the Fiscal Quarter containing the Effective Date (the Initial Period) will receive a prorated payment of the quarterly payment of the applicable annual cash retainer(s), calculated based on the number of days during the Initial Period that such Outside Director has served in the relevant capacities. 2. Equity Compensation. Outside Directors will be eligible to receive all types of Awards (except Incentive Stock Options) under the Plan, including discretionary Awards not covered under this Policy. All grants of Awards to Outside Directors pursuant to Section 2 of this Policy will be automatic and nondiscretionary, except as otherwise provided herein, and will be made in accordance with the following provisions: a. No Discretion. No person will have any discretion to select which Outside Directors will be granted any Awards under this Policy or to determine the number of Shares to be covered by such Awards, except as provided in Sections 2(d) and 9 below. b. Initial Awards. Each individual who first becomes an Outside Director following the Effective Date will be granted an award of Restricted Stock Units (an Initial Award) covering a number of Shares having a Value (as defined below) of $360,000, with any resulting fraction rounded down to the nearest whole Share. The Initial Award will be granted automatically on the first Trading Day on or after the date on which such individual first becomes an Outside Director (the first date as an Outside Director, the Initial Start Date), whether through election by the Companys stockholders or appointment by the Board to fill a vacancy. If an individual was a member of the Board and also an employee, becoming an Outside Director due to termination of employment will not entitle the Outside Director to an Initial Award. Each Initial Award will be scheduled to vest as follows: One third (1/3rd) of the Shares subject to the Initial Award will be scheduled to vest each year following the grant date on the same day of the month as the grant date (or, if there is no corresponding day in a particular month, then the last day of that month), in each case subject to the Outside Director continuing to be an Outside Director through the applicable vesting date. 2 c. Annual Award. On the first Trading Day immediately following each Annual Meeting of the Companys stockholders (an Annual Meeting) that occurs after the Effective Date, each Outside Director automatically will be granted an award of Restricted Stock Units (an Annual Award) covering a number of Shares having a Value of $180,000; provided that the first Annual Award granted to an individual who first becomes an Outside Director following the Effective Date will have a Value equal to the product of (A) $180,000 multiplied by (B) a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the number of fully completed days between the applicable Initial Start Date and the date of the first Annual Meeting to occur after such individual first becomes an Outside Director, and (ii) the denominator of which is 365; and provided further that any resulting fraction shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Share. Each Annual Award will be scheduled to vest in full on the earlier of (i) the one-year anniversary of the grant date or (ii) the date of the next Annual Meeting following the grant date, in each case subject to the Outside Director continuing to be an Outside Director through the applicable vesting date. d. Additional Terms of Initial Awards and Annual Awards. Each Initial Award and Annual Award will be granted under and subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and the applicable form of Award Agreement previously approved by the Board or its Compensation Committee, as applicable, for use thereunder. For purposes of this Policy, Value means the grant date fair value as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or such other methodology the Board or any committee of the Board designed by the Board with appropriate authority (the Designated Committee), as applicable, may determine prior to the grant of the applicable Award becoming effective. The Board or the Designated Committee, as applicable and in its discretion, may change and otherwise revise the terms of Initial Awards and Annual Awards granted under this Policy, including, without limitation, the number of Shares subject thereto and type of Award. 3. Other Compensation and Benefits. Outside Directors also may be eligible to receive other compensation and benefits, as may be determined by the Board or its Designated Committee, as applicable, from time to time. 4. Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, each Outside Director will fully vest in his or her outstanding Company equity awards as of immediately prior to a Change in Control, including any Initial Awards and Annual Awards, provided that the Outside Director continues to be an Outside Director through the date of the Change in Control. 5. Annual Compensation Limit. No Outside Director may be granted Awards with Values, and be provided cash retainers or fees, with amounts that, in any Fiscal Year, in the aggregate, exceed $750,000, provided that, in the Fiscal Year containing an Outside Directors Initial Start Date, such limit will be increased to $1,500,000. Any Awards or other compensation provided to an individual (a) for his or her services as an Employee, or for his or her services as a Consultant other than as an Outside Director, or (b) prior to the Effective Date, will be excluded for purposes of the foregoing limit. 6. Travel Expenses. Each Outside Directors reasonable, customary, and properly documented out-of-pocket travel expenses to meetings of the Board and any of its committees, as applicable, will be reimbursed by the Company. 3 7. Code Section 409A. In no event will cash compensation or expense reimbursement payments under this Policy be paid after the later of (a) the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) month following the end of the Companys taxable year in which the compensation is earned or expenses are incurred, as applicable, or (b) the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) month following the end of the calendar year in which the compensation is earned or expenses are incurred, as applicable, in compliance with the short-term deferral exception under Code Section 409A. It is the intent of this Policy that this Policy and all payments hereunder be exempt or excepted from or otherwise comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A so that none of the compensation to be provided hereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Code Section 409A, and any ambiguities or ambiguous terms herein will be interpreted to be so exempt or comply. In no event will the Company Group have any responsibility, liability, or obligation to reimburse, indemnify, or hold harmless an Outside Director or any other person for any taxes imposed, or other costs incurred, as a result of Code Section 409A. 8. Stockholder Approval. The initial adoption of this Policy will be subject to approval by the Companys stockholders prior to the Effective Date. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, following such approval, the Policy will not be subject to approval by the Companys stockholders, including, for the avoidance of doubt, as a result of or in connection with an action taken with respect to this Policy as contemplated in Section 9. 9. Revisions. The Board may amend, alter, suspend, or terminate this Policy at any time and for any reason. No amendment, alteration, suspension, or termination of this Policy will materially impair the rights of an Outside Director with respect to compensation that already has been paid or awarded, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the Outside Director and the Company. Termination of this Policy will not affect the Boards or the Designated Committees ability to exercise the powers granted to it with respect to Awards granted pursuant to this Policy prior to the date of such termination, including without limitation such applicable powers set forth in the Plan. * * * 4 Exhibit 10.7 UDEMY, INC.

I have read and accept this /s/ Exhibit 10.14 UDEMY, INC. CHANGE IN CONTROL AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENT This Change in Control and Severance Agreement (this Agreement) is made between Udemy, Inc. (the Company) and Gregg Coccari (the Executive), effective as of September 1, 2021 (the Effective Date). This Agreement provides certain protections to the Executive in connection with a change in control of the Company or in connection with the involuntary termination of the Executives employment under the circumstances described in this Agreement. The Company and the Executive agree as follows: 1. Term of Agreement. This Agreement will have an initial term of three (3) years commencing on the Effective Date (the Initial Term). On the third (3rd) anniversary of the Effective Date and each third (3rd) anniversary thereafter, this Agreement will renew automatically for additional, three (3) year terms (each, an Additional Term) unless either party provides the other party with written notice of nonrenewal at least sixty (60) days prior to the date of automatic renewal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change in Control occurs when there are fewer than twelve (12) months remaining during the Initial Term or Additional Term, as applicable, the term of this Agreement will extend automatically through the date that is twelve (12) months following the date of the Change in Control. If the Executive becomes entitled to the benefits under Section 3 of this Agreement, then the Agreement will not terminate until all of the obligations of the parties hereto with respect to this Agreement have been satisfied. 2. At-Will Employment. The Company and the Executive acknowledge that the Executives employment is and will continue to be at-will, as defined under applicable law. 3. Severance Benefits. (a) Qualifying Non-CIC Termination. On a Qualifying Non-CIC Termination (as defined below), the Executive will be eligible to receive the following payments and benefits from the Company: (i) Severance. A single, lump sum payment equal to twelve (12) months of the Executives Salary (as defined below), less applicable withholdings. (ii) COBRA Coverage. Subject to Section 3(d), the Company will pay the premiums for coverage under COBRA (as defined below) for the Executive and the Executives eligible dependents, if any, at the rates then in effect, subject to any subsequent changes in rates that are generally applicable to the Companys active employees (the COBRA Coverage), until the earliest of (A) a period of: twelve (12) months from the date of the Executives termination of employment, (B) the date upon which the Executive (and the Executives eligible dependents, as applicable) becomes covered under similar plans, or (C) the date upon which the Executive ceases to be eligible for coverage under COBRA. (b) Qualifying CIC Termination. On a Qualifying CIC Termination, the Executive will be eligible to receive the following payments and benefits from the Company: (i) Severance. A single, lump sum payment equal to twelve (12) months of the Executives Salary plus 100% of the Executives Target Bonus, less applicable withholdings. (ii) COBRA Coverage. Subject to Section 3(d), the Company will provide COBRA Coverage until the earliest of (A) a period of twelve (12) months from the date of the Executives termination of employment, (B) the date upon which the Executive (and the Executives eligible dependents, as applicable) becomes covered under similar plans, or (C) the date upon which the Executive ceases to be eligible for coverage under COBRA. (iii) Equity Vesting Acceleration. Vesting acceleration (and exercisability, as applicable) as to 100% of the then-unvested shares subject to each of the Executives then-outstanding compensatory equity awards issued by the Company. In the case of an equity award with performance-based vesting, unless otherwise specified in the applicable equity award agreement governing such award, all performance goals and other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at target. (c) Termination Other Than a Qualifying Termination. If the termination of the Executives employment with the Company Group is not a Qualifying Termination, then the Executive will not be entitled to receive severance or other benefits. (d) Conditions to Receipt of COBRA Coverage. The Executives receipt of COBRA Coverage is subject to the Executive electing COBRA continuation coverage within the time period prescribed pursuant to COBRA for the Executive and the Executives eligible dependents, if any. If the Company determines in its sole discretion that it cannot provide the COBRA Coverage without potentially violating, or being subject to an excise tax under, applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 2716 of the Public Health Service Act), then in lieu of any COBRA Coverage, the Company will provide to the Executive a taxable monthly payment payable on the last day of a given month (except as provided by the immediately following sentence), in an amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium that the Executive would be required to pay to continue his or her group health coverage in effect on the date of his or her Qualifying Termination (which amount will be based on the premium rates applicable for the first month of COBRA Coverage for the Executive and any of eligible dependents of the Executive) (each, a COBRA Replacement Payment), which COBRA Replacement Payments will be made regardless of whether the Executive elects COBRA continuation coverage and will end on the earlier of (x) the date upon which the Executive obtains other employment or (y) the date the Company has paid an amount totaling the number of COBRA Replacement Payments equal to the number of months in the applicable COBRA Coverage period. For the avoidance of doubt, the COBRA Replacement Payments may be used for any purpose, including, but not limited to continuation coverage under COBRA, and will be subject to any applicable withholdings. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under this Agreement, if the Company determines in its sole discretion at any time that it cannot provide the COBRA Replacement Payments without violating applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 2716 of the Public Health Service Act), the Executive will not receive the COBRA Replacement Payments or any further COBRA Coverage. - 2 - (e) Non-Duplication of Payment or Benefits. For purposes of clarity, in the event of a Qualifying Pre-CIC Termination, any severance payments and benefits to be provided to the Executive under Section 3(b) will be reduced by any amounts that already were provided to the Executive under Section 3(a). Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if the Executive is entitled to any cash severance, continued health coverage benefits, or vesting acceleration of any equity awards (other than under this Agreement) by operation of applicable law or under a plan, policy, contract, or arrangement sponsored by or to which any member of the Company Group is a party (Other Benefits), then the corresponding severance payments and benefits under this Agreement will be reduced by the amount of Other Benefits paid or provided to the Executive. (f) Death of the Executive. In the event of the Executives death before all payments or benefits the Executive is entitled to receive under this Agreement have been provided, the unpaid amounts will be provided to the Executives designated beneficiary, if living, or otherwise to the Executives personal representative in a single lump sum as soon as possible following the Executives death. (g) Transfer Between Members of the Company Group. For purposes of this Agreement, if the Executive is involuntarily transferred from one member of the Company Group to another, the transfer will not be a termination without Cause but may give the Executive the ability to resign for Good Reason. (h) Exclusive Remedy. In the event of a termination of the Executives employment with the Company Group, the provisions of this Agreement are intended to be and are exclusive and in lieu of any other rights or remedies to which the Executive may otherwise be entitled, whether at law, tort or contract, or in equity. The Executive will be entitled to no benefits, compensation or other payments or rights upon termination of employment other than those benefits expressly set forth in this Agreement. 4. Accrued Compensation. On any termination of the Executives employment with the Company Group, the Executive will be entitled to receive all accrued but unpaid vacation, expense reimbursements, wages, and other benefits due to the Executive under any Company-provided plans, policies, and arrangements. 5. Conditions to Receipt of Severance. (a) Separation Agreement and Release of Claims. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive signing and not revoking the Companys then-standard separation agreement and release of claims (which may include an agreement not to disparage any member of the Company Group, non-solicit provisions, an agreement to assist in any litigation matters, and other standard terms and conditions) (the Release and that requirement, the Release Requirement), which must become effective and irrevocable no later than the sixtieth (60th) day following the Executives Qualifying Termination (the Release Deadline). If the Release does not become effective and irrevocable by the Release Deadline, the Executive will forfeit any right to severance payments or benefits under Section 3. - 3 - (b) Payment Timing. Any lump sum severance payment under Section 3(a)(i) or 3(b)(i) will be provided on the first regularly scheduled payroll date of the Company following the date the Release becomes effective and irrevocable (the Severance Start Date), subject to any delay required by Section 5(d) below. Any taxable installments of any COBRA-related severance benefits that otherwise would have been made to the Executive on or before the Severance Start Date will be paid on the Severance Start Date, and any remaining installments thereafter will be provided as specified in the Agreement. Any restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, and/or similar full value awards that accelerate vesting under Section 3 will be settled (x) on a date no later than ten (10) days following the date the Release becomes effective and irrevocable, or (y) if later, in the event of a Qualifying Pre-CIC Termination, on a date no later than the Change in Control. (c) Return of Company Property. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive returning all documents and other property provided to the Executive by any member of the Company Group (with the exception of a copy of the Company employee handbook and personnel documents specifically relating to the Executive), developed or obtained by the Executive in connection with his or her employment with the Company Group, or otherwise belonging to the Company Group. (d) Section 409A. The Company intends that all payments and benefits provided under this Agreement or otherwise are exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and any guidance promulgated under Section 409A of the Code (collectively, Section 409A) so that none of the payments or benefits will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities in this Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with this intent. No payment or benefits to be paid to the Executive, if any, under this Agreement or otherwise, when considered together with any other severance payments or separation benefits that are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A (together, the Deferred Payments) will be paid or otherwise provided until the Executive has a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A. If, at the time of the Executives termination of employment, the Executive is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A, then the payment of the Deferred Payments will be delayed to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, which generally means that the Executive will receive payment on the first payroll date that occurs on or after the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day following the Executives termination of employment. The Company reserves the right to amend this Agreement as it considers necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Executive or any other individual, to comply with any provision required to avoid the imposition of the additional tax imposed under Section 409A or to otherwise avoid income recognition under Section 409A prior to the actual payment of any benefits or imposition of any additional tax. Each payment, installment, and benefit payable under this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). In no event will any member of the Company Group reimburse, indemnify, or hold harmless the Executive for any taxes, penalties and interest that may be imposed, or other costs that may be incurred, as a result of Section 409A. - 4 - (e) Resignation of Officer and Director Positions. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive resigning from all officer and director positions with all members of the Company Group and the Executive executing any documents the Company may require in connection with the same. 6. Limitation on Payments. (a) Reduction of Severance Benefits. If any payment or benefit that the Executive would receive from any Company Group member or any other party whether in connection with the provisions in this Agreement or otherwise (the Payment) would (i) constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax), then the Payment will be equal to the Best Results Amount. The Best Results Amount will be either (x) the full amount of the Payment or (y) a lesser amount that would result in no portion of the Payment being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of those amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state, and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax, results in the Executives receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater amount. If a reduction in payments or benefits constituting parachute payments is necessary so that the Payment equals the Best Results Amount, reduction will occur in the following order: (A) reduction of cash payments in reverse chronological order (that is, the cash payment owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering the Excise Tax will be the first cash payment to be reduced); (B) cancellation of equity awards that were granted contingent on a change in ownership or control within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code in the reverse order of date of grant of the awards (that is, the most recently granted equity awards will be cancelled first); (C) reduction of the accelerated vesting of equity awards in the reverse order of date of grant of the awards (that is, the vesting of the most recently granted equity awards will be cancelled first); and (D) reduction of employee benefits in reverse chronological order (that is, the benefit owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering the Excise Tax will be the first benefit to be reduced). In no event will the Executive have any discretion with respect to the ordering of Payment reductions. The Executive will be solely responsible for the payment of all personal tax liability that is incurred as a result of the payments and benefits received under this Agreement, and the Executive will not be reimbursed, indemnified, or held harmless by any member of the Company Group for any of those payments of personal tax liability. (b) Determination of Excise Tax Liability. Unless the Company and the Executive otherwise agree in writing, the Company will select a professional services firm (the Firm) to make all determinations required under this Section 6, which determinations will be conclusive and binding upon the Executive and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 6, the Firm may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Executive will furnish to the Firm such information and documents as the Firm reasonably may request in order to make determinations under this Section 6. The Company will bear the costs and make all payments for the Firms services in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 6. The Company will have no liability to the Executive for the determinations of the Firm. - 5 - 7. Definitions.

(b) Cause means the occurrence of any of the following: (i) the Executives willful and continued failure to perform the Executives assigned duties or responsibilities as an employee of the Company (other than a failure resulting from the Executives disability) after written notice from the Company describing the basis for the Companys belief that the Executive has failed to perform such duties or responsibilities, and not remedying such failure within thirty (30) days of the Executives receipt of such notice; (ii) the Executive engaging in any act of dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation in connection with the Executives responsibilities as a Company employee that results in substantial harm to the Companys reputation or business; (iii) the Executives violation of any federal or state law or regulation applicable to the business of the Company or its affiliates that results in substantial harm to the Companys reputation or business; (iv) the Executives unauthorized use or disclosure of any proprietary information or trade secrets of the Company; or (v) the Executive being convicted of, or entering a plea of nolo contendere to, a felony.

(n) Target Bonus means the Executives annual (or annualized, as applicable) target bonus in effect immediately prior to the Executives Qualifying Termination or, if the Executives Qualifying Termination occurs during the Change in Control Period and the amount is greater, the Executives annual (or annualized, if applicable) target bonus in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control. 8.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change in Control occurs when there are fewer than twelve (12) months remaining during the Initial Term or Additional Term, as applicable, the term of this Agreement will extend automatically through the date that is twelve (12) months following the date of the Change in Control. If the Executive becomes entitled to the benefits under Section 3 of this Agreement, then the Agreement will not terminate until all of the obligations of the parties hereto with respect to this Agreement have been satisfied. 2. At-Will Employment. The Company and the Executive acknowledge that the Executives employment is and will continue to be at-will, as defined under applicable law. 3. Severance Benefits. (a) Qualifying Non-CIC Termination. On a Qualifying Non-CIC Termination (as defined below), the Executive will be eligible to receive the following payments and benefits from the Company: (i) Severance. A single, lump sum payment equal to twelve (12) months of the Executives Salary (as defined below), less applicable withholdings. (ii) COBRA Coverage. Subject to Section 3(d), the Company will pay the premiums for coverage under COBRA (as defined below) for the Executive and the Executives eligible dependents, if any, at the rates then in effect, subject to any subsequent changes in rates that are generally applicable to the Companys active employees (the COBRA Coverage), until the earliest of (A) a period of twelve (12) months from the date of the Executives termination of employment, (B) the date upon which the Executive (and the Executives eligible dependents, as applicable) becomes covered under similar plans, or (C) the date upon which the Executive ceases to be eligible for coverage under COBRA. (iii) Extension of Post-Termination Exercise Period. The post-termination exercise period for the Executives vested and outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock of the Company will extend to one (1) year from the date of the Executives termination of employment, not to exceed the expiration date of any such option. (b) Qualifying CIC Termination. On a Qualifying CIC Termination, the Executive will be eligible to receive the following payments and benefits from the Company: (i) Severance. A single, lump sum payment equal to twelve (12) months of the Executives Salary plus 100% of the Executives Target Bonus, less applicable withholdings. (ii) COBRA Coverage.

(iv) Extension of Post-Termination Exercise Period. The post-termination exercise period for the Executives vested and outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock of the Company will extend to one (1) year from the date of the Executives termination of employment, not to exceed the expiration date of any such option. (c) Termination Other Than a Qualifying Termination. If the termination of the Executives employment with the Company Group is not a Qualifying Termination, then the Executive will not be entitled to receive severance or other benefits. (d) Conditions to Receipt of COBRA Coverage. The Executives receipt of COBRA Coverage is subject to the Executive electing COBRA continuation coverage within the time period prescribed pursuant to COBRA for the Executive and the Executives eligible dependents, if any. If the Company determines in its sole discretion that it cannot provide the COBRA Coverage without potentially violating, or being subject to an excise tax under, applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 2716 of the Public Health Service Act), then in lieu of any COBRA Coverage, the Company will provide to the Executive a taxable monthly payment payable on the last day of a given month (except as provided by the immediately following sentence), in an amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium that the Executive would be required to pay to continue his or her group health coverage in effect on the date of his or her Qualifying Termination (which amount will be based on the premium rates applicable for the first month of COBRA Coverage for the Executive and any of eligible dependents of the Executive) (each, a COBRA Replacement Payment), which COBRA - 2 - Replacement Payments will be made regardless of whether the Executive elects COBRA continuation coverage and will end on the earlier of (x) the date upon which the Executive obtains other employment or (y) the date the Company has paid an amount totaling the number of COBRA Replacement Payments equal to the number of months in the applicable COBRA Coverage period. For the avoidance of doubt, the COBRA Replacement Payments may be used for any purpose, including, but not limited to continuation coverage under COBRA, and will be subject to any applicable withholdings. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under this Agreement, if the Company determines in its sole discretion at any time that it cannot provide the COBRA Replacement Payments without violating applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 2716 of the Public Health Service Act), the Executive will not receive the COBRA Replacement Payments or any further COBRA Coverage. (e) Non-Duplication of Payment or Benefits. For purposes of clarity, in the event of a Qualifying Pre-CIC Termination, any severance payments and benefits to be provided to the Executive under Section 3(b) will be reduced by any amounts that already were provided to the Executive under Section 3(a). Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if the Executive is entitled to any cash severance, continued health coverage benefits, or vesting acceleration of any equity awards (other than under this Agreement) by operation of applicable law or under a plan, policy, contract, or arrangement sponsored by or to which any member of the Company Group is a party (Other Benefits), then the corresponding severance payments and benefits under this Agreement will be reduced by the amount of Other Benefits paid or provided to the Executive. (f) Death of the Executive. In the event of the Executives death before all payments or benefits the Executive is entitled to receive under this Agreement have been provided, the unpaid amounts will be provided to the Executives designated beneficiary, if living, or otherwise to the Executives personal representative in a single lump sum as soon as possible following the Executives death. (g) Transfer Between Members of the Company Group. For purposes of this Agreement, if the Executive is involuntarily transferred from one member of the Company Group to another, the transfer will not be a termination without Cause but may give the Executive the ability to resign for Good Reason. (h) Exclusive Remedy. In the event of a termination of the Executives employment with the Company Group, the provisions of this Agreement are intended to be and are exclusive and in lieu of any other rights or remedies to which the Executive may otherwise be entitled, whether at law, tort or contract, or in equity. The Executive will be entitled to no benefits, compensation or other payments or rights upon termination of employment other than those benefits expressly set forth in this Agreement. 4. Accrued Compensation. On any termination of the Executives employment with the Company Group, the Executive will be entitled to receive all accrued but unpaid vacation, expense reimbursements, wages, and other benefits due to the Executive under any Company-provided plans, policies, and arrangements. - 3 - 5. Conditions to Receipt of Severance. (a) Separation Agreement and Release of Claims. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive signing and not revoking the Companys then-standard separation agreement and release of claims (which may include an agreement not to disparage any member of the Company Group, non-solicit provisions, an agreement to assist in any litigation matters, and other standard terms and conditions) (the Release and that requirement, the Release Requirement), which must become effective and irrevocable no later than the sixtieth (60th) day following the Executives Qualifying Termination (the Release Deadline). If the Release does not become effective and irrevocable by the Release Deadline, the Executive will forfeit any right to severance payments or benefits under Section 3. (b) Payment Timing. Any lump sum severance payment under Section 3(a)(i) or 3(b)(i) will be provided on the first regularly scheduled payroll date of the Company following the date the Release becomes effective and irrevocable (the Severance Start Date), subject to any delay required by Section 5(d) below. Any taxable installments of any COBRA-related severance benefits that otherwise would have been made to the Executive on or before the Severance Start Date will be paid on the Severance Start Date, and any remaining installments thereafter will be provided as specified in the Agreement. Any restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, and/or similar full value awards that accelerate vesting under Section 3 will be settled (x) on a date no later than ten (10) days following the date the Release becomes effective and irrevocable, or (y) if later, in the event of a Qualifying Pre-CIC Termination, on a date no later than the Change in Control. (c) Return of Company Property. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive returning all documents and other property provided to the Executive by any member of the Company Group (with the exception of a copy of the Company employee handbook and personnel documents specifically relating to the Executive), developed or obtained by the Executive in connection with his or her employment with the Company Group, or otherwise belonging to the Company Group. (d) Section 409A. The Company intends that all payments and benefits provided under this Agreement or otherwise are exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and any guidance promulgated under Section 409A of the Code (collectively, Section 409A) so that none of the payments or benefits will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities in this Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with this intent. No payment or benefits to be paid to the Executive, if any, under this Agreement or otherwise, when considered together with any other severance payments or separation benefits that are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A (together, the Deferred Payments) will be paid or otherwise provided until the Executive has a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A. If, at the time of the Executives termination of employment, the Executive is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A, then the payment of the Deferred Payments will be delayed to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, which generally means that the Executive will receive payment on the first payroll date that - 4 - occurs on or after the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day following the Executives termination of employment. The Company reserves the right to amend this Agreement as it considers necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Executive or any other individual, to comply with any provision required to avoid the imposition of the additional tax imposed under Section 409A or to otherwise avoid income recognition under Section 409A prior to the actual payment of any benefits or imposition of any additional tax. Each payment, installment, and benefit payable under this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). In no event will any member of the Company Group reimburse, indemnify, or hold harmless the Executive for any taxes, penalties and interest that may be imposed, or other costs that may be incurred, as a result of Section 409A. (e) Resignation of Officer and Director Positions. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive resigning from all officer and director positions with all members of the Company Group and the Executive executing any documents the Company may require in connection with the same. 6. Limitation on Payments. (a) Reduction of Severance Benefits. If any payment or benefit that the Executive would receive from any Company Group member or any other party whether in connection with the provisions in this Agreement or otherwise (the Payment) would (i) constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax), then the Payment will be equal to the Best Results Amount. The Best Results Amount will be either (x) the full amount of the Payment or (y) a lesser amount that would result in no portion of the Payment being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of those amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state, and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax, results in the Executives receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater amount. If a reduction in payments or benefits constituting parachute payments is necessary so that the Payment equals the Best Results Amount, reduction will occur in the following order: (A) reduction of cash payments in reverse chronological order (that is, the cash payment owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering the Excise Tax will be the first cash payment to be reduced); (B) cancellation of equity awards that were granted contingent on a change in ownership or control within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code in the reverse order of date of grant of the awards (that is, the most recently granted equity awards will be cancelled first); (C) reduction of the accelerated vesting of equity awards in the reverse order of date of grant of the awards (that is, the vesting of the most recently granted equity awards will be cancelled first); and (D) reduction of employee benefits in reverse chronological order (that is, the benefit owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering the Excise Tax will be the first benefit to be reduced). In no event will the Executive have any discretion with respect to the ordering of Payment reductions. The Executive will be solely responsible for the payment of all personal tax liability that is incurred as a result of the payments and benefits received under this Agreement, and the Executive will not be reimbursed, indemnified, or held harmless by any member of the Company Group for any of those payments of personal tax liability. - 5 - (b) Determination of Excise Tax Liability. Unless the Company and the Executive otherwise agree in writing, the Company will select a professional services firm (the Firm) to make all determinations required under this Section 6, which determinations will be conclusive and binding upon the Executive and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 6, the Firm may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Executive will furnish to the Firm such information and documents as the Firm reasonably may request in order to make determinations under this Section 6. The Company will bear the costs and make all payments for the Firms services in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 6. The Company will have no liability to the Executive for the determinations of the Firm. 7. Definitions.

This Agreement provides certain protections to the Executive in connection with a change in control of the Company or in connection with the involuntary termination of the Executives employment under the circumstances described in this Agreement. The Company and the Executive agree as follows: 1. Term of Agreement. This Agreement will have an initial term of three (3) years commencing on the Effective Date (the Initial Term). On the third (3rd) anniversary of the Effective Date and each third (3rd) anniversary thereafter, this Agreement will renew automatically for additional, three (3) year terms (each, an Additional Term) unless either party provides the other party with written notice of nonrenewal at least sixty (60) days prior to the date of automatic renewal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change in Control occurs when there are fewer than twelve (12) months remaining during the Initial Term or Additional Term, as applicable, the term of this Agreement will extend automatically through the date that is twelve (12) months following the date of the Change in Control. If the Executive becomes entitled to the benefits under Section 3 of this Agreement, then the Agreement will not terminate until all of the obligations of the parties hereto with respect to this Agreement have been satisfied. 2. At-Will Employment. The Company and the Executive acknowledge that the Executives employment is and will continue to be at-will, as defined under applicable law. 3. Severance Benefits. (a) Qualifying Non-CIC Termination. On a Qualifying Non-CIC Termination (as defined below), the Executive will be eligible to receive the following payments and benefits from the Company: (i) Severance. A single, lump sum payment equal to twelve (12) months of the Executives Salary (as defined below), less applicable withholdings. (ii) COBRA Coverage. Subject to Section 3(d), the Company will pay the premiums for coverage under COBRA (as defined below) for the Executive and the Executives eligible dependents, if any, at the rates then in effect, subject to any subsequent changes in rates that are generally applicable to the Companys active employees (the COBRA Coverage), until the earliest of (A) a period of twelve (12) months from the date of the Executives termination of employment, (B) the date upon which the Executive (and the Executives eligible dependents, as applicable) becomes covered under similar plans, or (C) the date upon which the Executive ceases to be eligible for coverage under COBRA. (iii) Special Protection. If such Qualifying Non-CIC Termination occurs within twelve (12) months following the termination of employment of Gregg Coccari, then 50% of the shares subject to Executives then unvested and outstanding Company equity awards will accelerate and fully vest. (b) Qualifying CIC Termination. On a Qualifying CIC Termination, the Executive will be eligible to receive the following payments and benefits from the Company: (i) Severance. A single, lump sum payment equal to twelve (12) months of the Executives Salary plus 100% of the Executives Target Bonus, less applicable withholdings. (ii) COBRA Coverage. Subject to Section 3(d), the Company will provide COBRA Coverage until the earliest of (A) a period of twelve (12) months from the date of the Executives termination of employment, (B) the date upon which the Executive (and the Executives eligible dependents, as applicable) becomes covered under similar plans, or (C) the date upon which the Executive ceases to be eligible for coverage under COBRA. (iii) Equity Vesting Acceleration. Vesting acceleration (and exercisability, as applicable) as to 100% of the then-unvested shares subject to each of the Executives then-outstanding compensatory equity awards issued by the Company. In the case of an equity award with performance-based vesting, unless otherwise specified in the applicable equity award agreement governing such award, all performance goals and other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at target. (c) Termination Other Than a Qualifying Termination. If the termination of the Executives employment with the Company Group is not a Qualifying Termination, then the Executive will not be entitled to receive severance or other benefits. (d) Conditions to Receipt of COBRA Coverage. The Executives receipt of COBRA Coverage is subject to the Executive electing COBRA continuation coverage within the time period prescribed pursuant to COBRA for the Executive and the Executives eligible dependents, if any. If the Company determines in its sole discretion that it cannot provide the COBRA Coverage without potentially violating, or being subject to an excise tax under, applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 2716 of the Public Health Service Act), then in lieu of any COBRA Coverage, the Company will provide to the Executive a taxable monthly payment payable on the last day of a given month (except as provided by the immediately following sentence), in an amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium that the Executive would be required to pay to continue his or her group health coverage in effect on the date of his or her Qualifying Termination (which amount will be based on the premium rates applicable for the first month of COBRA Coverage for the Executive and any of eligible dependents of the Executive) (each, a COBRA Replacement Payment), which COBRA Replacement Payments will be made regardless of whether the Executive elects COBRA continuation coverage and will end on the earlier of (x) the date upon which the Executive obtains other employment or (y) the date the Company has paid an amount totaling the number of COBRA Replacement Payments equal to the number of months in the applicable COBRA Coverage period. For - 2 - the avoidance of doubt, the COBRA Replacement Payments may be used for any purpose, including, but not limited to continuation coverage under COBRA, and will be subject to any applicable withholdings. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under this Agreement, if the Company determines in its sole discretion at any time that it cannot provide the COBRA Replacement Payments without violating applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 2716 of the Public Health Service Act), the Executive will not receive the COBRA Replacement Payments or any further COBRA Coverage. (e) Non-Duplication of Payment or Benefits. For purposes of clarity, in the event of a Qualifying Pre-CIC Termination, any severance payments and benefits to be provided to the Executive under Section 3(b) will be reduced by any amounts that already were provided to the Executive under Section 3(a). Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if the Executive is entitled to any cash severance, continued health coverage benefits, or vesting acceleration of any equity awards (other than under this Agreement) by operation of applicable law or under a plan, policy, contract, or arrangement sponsored by or to which any member of the Company Group is a party (Other Benefits), then the corresponding severance payments and benefits under this Agreement will be reduced by the amount of Other Benefits paid or provided to the Executive. (f) Death of the Executive. In the event of the Executives death before all payments or benefits the Executive is entitled to receive under this Agreement have been provided, the unpaid amounts will be provided to the Executives designated beneficiary, if living, or otherwise to the Executives personal representative in a single lump sum as soon as possible following the Executives death. (g) Transfer Between Members of the Company Group. For purposes of this Agreement, if the Executive is involuntarily transferred from one member of the Company Group to another, the transfer will not be a termination without Cause but may give the Executive the ability to resign for Good Reason. (h) Exclusive Remedy. In the event of a termination of the Executives employment with the Company Group, the provisions of this Agreement are intended to be and are exclusive and in lieu of any other rights or remedies to which the Executive may otherwise be entitled, whether at law, tort or contract, or in equity. The Executive will be entitled to no benefits, compensation or other payments or rights upon termination of employment other than those benefits expressly set forth in this Agreement. 4. Accrued Compensation. On any termination of the Executives employment with the Company Group, the Executive will be entitled to receive all accrued but unpaid vacation, expense reimbursements, wages, and other benefits due to the Executive under any Company-provided plans, policies, and arrangements. 5. Conditions to Receipt of Severance. (a) Separation Agreement and Release of Claims. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive signing and not revoking the Companys then-standard separation agreement - 3 - and release of claims (which may include an agreement not to disparage any member of the Company Group, non-solicit provisions, an agreement to assist in any litigation matters, and other standard terms and conditions) (the Release and that requirement, the Release Requirement), which must become effective and irrevocable no later than the sixtieth (60th) day following the Executives Qualifying Termination (the Release Deadline). If the Release does not become effective and irrevocable by the Release Deadline, the Executive will forfeit any right to severance payments or benefits under Section 3. (b) Payment Timing. Any lump sum severance payment under Section 3(a)(i) or 3(b)(i) will be provided on the first regularly scheduled payroll date of the Company following the date the Release becomes effective and irrevocable (the Severance Start Date), subject to any delay required by Section 5(d) below. Any taxable installments of any COBRA-related severance benefits that otherwise would have been made to the Executive on or before the Severance Start Date will be paid on the Severance Start Date, and any remaining installments thereafter will be provided as specified in the Agreement. Any restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, and/or similar full value awards that accelerate vesting under Section 3 will be settled (x) on a date no later than ten (10) days following the date the Release becomes effective and irrevocable, or (y) if later, in the event of a Qualifying Pre-CIC Termination, on a date no later than the Change in Control. (c) Return of Company Property. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive returning all documents and other property provided to the Executive by any member of the Company Group (with the exception of a copy of the Company employee handbook and personnel documents specifically relating to the Executive), developed or obtained by the Executive in connection with his or her employment with the Company Group, or otherwise belonging to the Company Group. (d) Section 409A. The Company intends that all payments and benefits provided under this Agreement or otherwise are exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and any guidance promulgated under Section 409A of the Code (collectively, Section 409A) so that none of the payments or benefits will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities in this Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with this intent. No payment or benefits to be paid to the Executive, if any, under this Agreement or otherwise, when considered together with any other severance payments or separation benefits that are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A (together, the Deferred Payments) will be paid or otherwise provided until the Executive has a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A. If, at the time of the Executives termination of employment, the Executive is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A, then the payment of the Deferred Payments will be delayed to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, which generally means that the Executive will receive payment on the first payroll date that occurs on or after the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day following the Executives termination of employment. The Company reserves the right to amend this Agreement as it considers necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Executive or any other individual, to comply with any provision required to avoid the imposition of the additional tax imposed under Section 409A or to otherwise avoid income recognition under Section 409A prior to the actual - 4 - payment of any benefits or imposition of any additional tax. Each payment, installment, and benefit payable under this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). In no event will any member of the Company Group reimburse, indemnify, or hold harmless the Executive for any taxes, penalties and interest that may be imposed, or other costs that may be incurred, as a result of Section 409A. (e) Resignation of Officer and Director Positions. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive resigning from all officer and director positions with all members of the Company Group and the Executive executing any documents the Company may require in connection with the same. 6. Limitation on Payments. (a) Reduction of Severance Benefits. If any payment or benefit that the Executive would receive from any Company Group member or any other party whether in connection with the provisions in this Agreement or otherwise (the Payment) would (i) constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax), then the Payment will be equal to the Best Results Amount. The Best Results Amount will be either (x) the full amount of the Payment or (y) a lesser amount that would result in no portion of the Payment being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of those amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state, and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax, results in the Executives receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater amount. If a reduction in payments or benefits constituting parachute payments is necessary so that the Payment equals the Best Results Amount, reduction will occur in the following order: (A) reduction of cash payments in reverse chronological order (that is, the cash payment owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering the Excise Tax will be the first cash payment to be reduced); (B) cancellation of equity awards that were granted contingent on a change in ownership or control within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code in the reverse order of date of grant of the awards (that is, the most recently granted equity awards will be cancelled first); (C) reduction of the accelerated vesting of equity awards in the reverse order of date of grant of the awards (that is, the vesting of the most recently granted equity awards will be cancelled first); and (D) reduction of employee benefits in reverse chronological order (that is, the benefit owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering the Excise Tax will be the first benefit to be reduced). In no event will the Executive have any discretion with respect to the ordering of Payment reductions. The Executive will be solely responsible for the payment of all personal tax liability that is incurred as a result of the payments and benefits received under this Agreement, and the Executive will not be reimbursed, indemnified, or held harmless by any member of the Company Group for any of those payments of personal tax liability. (b) Determination of Excise Tax Liability. Unless the Company and the Executive otherwise agree in writing, the Company will select a professional services firm (the Firm) to make all determinations required under this Section 6, which determinations will be conclusive and binding upon the Executive and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 6, the Firm may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning - 5 - applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Executive will furnish to the Firm such information and documents as the Firm reasonably may request in order to make determinations under this Section 6. The Company will bear the costs and make all payments for the Firms services in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 6. The Company will have no liability to the Executive for the determinations of the Firm. 7. Definitions.

(n) Target Bonus means the Executives annual (or annualized, as applicable) target bonus in effect immediately prior to the Executives Qualifying Termination or, if the Executives Qualifying Termination occurs during the Change in Control Period and the amount is greater, the Executives annual (or annualized, if applicable) target bonus in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control. 8.

A single, lump sum payment equal to the sum of (A) twelve (12) months of the Executives Salary (as defined below) plus (B) an amount equal to the Executives prorated Target Bonus (as defined below), with such prorated Target Bonus to be calculated by multiplying the Executives Target Bonus by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which is the number of days during which the Executive was employed with the Company in the calendar year in which such termination occurs, and (y) the denominator of which is three hundred sixty-five (365), not to exceed 50% of the Executives Target Bonus, less applicable withholdings. (ii) COBRA Coverage. Subject to Section 3(d), the Company will pay the premiums for coverage under COBRA (as defined below) for the Executive and the Executives eligible dependents, if any, at the rates then in effect, subject to any subsequent changes in rates that are generally applicable to the Companys active employees (the COBRA Coverage), until the earliest of (A) a period of twelve (12) months from the date of the Executives termination of employment, (B) the date upon which the Executive (and the Executives eligible dependents, as applicable) becomes covered under similar plans, or (C) the date upon which the Executive ceases to be eligible for coverage under COBRA. (iii) Extension of Post-Termination Exercise Period. The post-termination exercise period for the Executives vested and outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock of the Company will extend to one (1) year from the date of the Executives termination of employment, not to exceed the expiration date of any such option. (iv) Special Protection. If such Qualifying Non-CIC Termination occurs prior to the first anniversary of the commencement of the Executives employment with the Company, then a number of then unvested and outstanding shares subject to the Executives original option to purchase shares of common stock of the Company that is subject to time-based vesting will accelerate and fully vest, with such number equal to the product of (A) 25% of the shares originally subject to such option and (B) the quotient of the number of days between the date of the commencement of the Executives employment with the Company and the date of the Executives termination of employment divided by three hundred sixty-five (365), rounded up to the nearest whole share. (b) Qualifying CIC Termination. On a Qualifying CIC Termination, the Executive will be eligible to receive the following payments and benefits from the Company: (i) Severance. A single, lump sum payment equal to twelve (12) months of the Executives Salary plus 100% of the Executives Target Bonus, less applicable withholdings. (ii) COBRA Coverage.

(iv) Extension of Post-Termination Exercise Period. The post-termination exercise period for the Executives vested and outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock of the Company will extend to one (1) year from the date of the Executives termination of employment, not to exceed the expiration date of any such option. - 2 - (c) Termination Other Than a Qualifying Termination. If the termination of the Executives employment with the Company Group is not a Qualifying Termination, then the Executive will not be entitled to receive severance or other benefits. (d) Conditions to Receipt of COBRA Coverage. The Executives receipt of COBRA Coverage is subject to the Executive electing COBRA continuation coverage within the time period prescribed pursuant to COBRA for the Executive and the Executives eligible dependents, if any. If the Company determines in its sole discretion that it cannot provide the COBRA Coverage without potentially violating, or being subject to an excise tax under, applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 2716 of the Public Health Service Act), then in lieu of any COBRA Coverage, the Company will provide to the Executive a taxable monthly payment payable on the last day of a given month (except as provided by the immediately following sentence), in an amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium that the Executive would be required to pay to continue his or her group health coverage in effect on the date of his or her Qualifying Termination (which amount will be based on the premium rates applicable for the first month of COBRA Coverage for the Executive and any of eligible dependents of the Executive) (each, a COBRA Replacement Payment), which COBRA Replacement Payments will be made regardless of whether the Executive elects COBRA continuation coverage and will end on the earlier of (x) the date upon which the Executive obtains other employment or (y) the date the Company has paid an amount totaling the number of COBRA Replacement Payments equal to the number of months in the applicable COBRA Coverage period. For the avoidance of doubt, the COBRA Replacement Payments may be used for any purpose, including, but not limited to continuation coverage under COBRA, and will be subject to any applicable withholdings. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under this Agreement, if the Company determines in its sole discretion at any time that it cannot provide the COBRA Replacement Payments without violating applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 2716 of the Public Health Service Act), the Executive will not receive the COBRA Replacement Payments or any further COBRA Coverage. (e) Non-Duplication of Payment or Benefits. For purposes of clarity, in the event of a Qualifying Pre-CIC Termination, any severance payments and benefits to be provided to the Executive under Section 3(b) will be reduced by any amounts that already were provided to the Executive under Section 3(a). Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if the Executive is entitled to any cash severance, continued health coverage benefits, or vesting acceleration of any equity awards (other than under this Agreement) by operation of applicable law or under a plan, policy, contract, or arrangement sponsored by or to which any member of the Company Group is a party (Other Benefits), then the corresponding severance payments and benefits under this Agreement will be reduced by the amount of Other Benefits paid or provided to the Executive. (f) Death of the Executive. In the event of the Executives death before all payments or benefits the Executive is entitled to receive under this Agreement have been provided, the unpaid amounts will be provided to the Executives designated beneficiary, if living, or otherwise to the Executives personal representative in a single lump sum as soon as possible following the Executives death. - 3 - (g) Transfer Between Members of the Company Group. For purposes of this Agreement, if the Executive is involuntarily transferred from one member of the Company Group to another, the transfer will not be a termination without Cause but may give the Executive the ability to resign for Good Reason. (h) Exclusive Remedy. In the event of a termination of the Executives employment with the Company Group, the provisions of this Agreement are intended to be and are exclusive and in lieu of any other rights or remedies to which the Executive may otherwise be entitled, whether at law, tort or contract, or in equity. The Executive will be entitled to no benefits, compensation or other payments or rights upon termination of employment other than those benefits expressly set forth in this Agreement. 4. Accrued Compensation. On any termination of the Executives employment with the Company Group, the Executive will be entitled to receive all accrued but unpaid vacation, expense reimbursements, wages, and other benefits due to the Executive under any Company-provided plans, policies, and arrangements. 5. Conditions to Receipt of Severance. (a) Separation Agreement and Release of Claims. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive signing and not revoking the Companys then-standard separation agreement and release of claims (which may include an agreement not to disparage any member of the Company Group, non-solicit provisions, an agreement to assist in any litigation matters, and other standard terms and conditions) (the Release and that requirement, the Release Requirement), which must become effective and irrevocable no later than the sixtieth (60th) day following the Executives Qualifying Termination (the Release Deadline). If the Release does not become effective and irrevocable by the Release Deadline, the Executive will forfeit any right to severance payments or benefits under Section 3. (b) Payment Timing. Any lump sum severance payment under Section 3(a)(i) or 3(b)(i) will be provided on the first regularly scheduled payroll date of the Company following the date the Release becomes effective and irrevocable (the Severance Start Date), subject to any delay required by Section 5(d) below. Any taxable installments of any COBRA-related severance benefits that otherwise would have been made to the Executive on or before the Severance Start Date will be paid on the Severance Start Date, and any remaining installments thereafter will be provided as specified in the Agreement. Any restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, and/or similar full value awards that accelerate vesting under Section 3 will be settled (x) on a date no later than ten (10) days following the date the Release becomes effective and irrevocable, or (y) if later, in the event of a Qualifying Pre-CIC Termination, on a date no later than the Change in Control. (c) Return of Company Property. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive returning all documents and other property provided to the Executive by any member of the Company Group (with the exception of a copy of the Company employee handbook and personnel - 4 - documents specifically relating to the Executive), developed or obtained by the Executive in connection with his or her employment with the Company Group, or otherwise belonging to the Company Group. (d) Section 409A. The Company intends that all payments and benefits provided under this Agreement or otherwise are exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and any guidance promulgated under Section 409A of the Code (collectively, Section 409A) so that none of the payments or benefits will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities in this Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with this intent. No payment or benefits to be paid to the Executive, if any, under this Agreement or otherwise, when considered together with any other severance payments or separation benefits that are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A (together, the Deferred Payments) will be paid or otherwise provided until the Executive has a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A. If, at the time of the Executives termination of employment, the Executive is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A, then the payment of the Deferred Payments will be delayed to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, which generally means that the Executive will receive payment on the first payroll date that occurs on or after the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day following the Executives termination of employment. The Company reserves the right to amend this Agreement as it considers necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Executive or any other individual, to comply with any provision required to avoid the imposition of the additional tax imposed under Section 409A or to otherwise avoid income recognition under Section 409A prior to the actual payment of any benefits or imposition of any additional tax. Each payment, installment, and benefit payable under this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). In no event will any member of the Company Group reimburse, indemnify, or hold harmless the Executive for any taxes, penalties and interest that may be imposed, or other costs that may be incurred, as a result of Section 409A. (e) Resignation of Officer and Director Positions. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive resigning from all officer and director positions with all members of the Company Group and the Executive executing any documents the Company may require in connection with the same. 6. Limitation on Payments. (a) Reduction of Severance Benefits. If any payment or benefit that the Executive would receive from any Company Group member or any other party whether in connection with the provisions in this Agreement or otherwise (the Payment) would (i) constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax), then the Payment will be equal to the Best Results Amount. The Best Results Amount will be either (x) the full amount of the Payment or (y) a lesser amount that would result in no portion of the Payment being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of those amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state, and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax, results in the Executives receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the - 5 - greater amount. If a reduction in payments or benefits constituting parachute payments is necessary so that the Payment equals the Best Results Amount, reduction will occur in the following order: (A) reduction of cash payments in reverse chronological order (that is, the cash payment owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering the Excise Tax will be the first cash payment to be reduced); (B) cancellation of equity awards that were granted contingent on a change in ownership or control within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code in the reverse order of date of grant of the awards (that is, the most recently granted equity awards will be cancelled first); (C) reduction of the accelerated vesting of equity awards in the reverse order of date of grant of the awards (that is, the vesting of the most recently granted equity awards will be cancelled first); and (D) reduction of employee benefits in reverse chronological order (that is, the benefit owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering the Excise Tax will be the first benefit to be reduced). In no event will the Executive have any discretion with respect to the ordering of Payment reductions. The Executive will be solely responsible for the payment of all personal tax liability that is incurred as a result of the payments and benefits received under this Agreement, and the Executive will not be reimbursed, indemnified, or held harmless by any member of the Company Group for any of those payments of personal tax liability. (b) Determination of Excise Tax Liability. Unless the Company and the Executive otherwise agree in writing, the Company will select a professional services firm (the Firm) to make all determinations required under this Section 6, which determinations will be conclusive and binding upon the Executive and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 6, the Firm may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Executive will furnish to the Firm such information and documents as the Firm reasonably may request in order to make determinations under this Section 6. The Company will bear the costs and make all payments for the Firms services in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 6. The Company will have no liability to the Executive for the determinations of the Firm. 7. Definitions.

For purposes of this subsection (iii), gross fair market value means the value of the assets of the Company, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed a Change in Control unless the transaction qualifies as a change in control event within the meaning of Section 409A.

(n) Target Bonus means the Executives annual (or annualized, as applicable) target bonus in effect immediately prior to the Executives Qualifying Termination or, if the Executives Qualifying Termination occurs during the Change in Control Period and the amount is greater, the Executives annual (or annualized, if applicable) target bonus in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control. 8.

(the Company) and Cara Brennan Allamano (the Executive), effective as of September 1, 2021 (the Effective Date). This Agreement provides certain protections to the Executive in connection with a change in control of the Company or in connection with the involuntary termination of the Executives employment under the circumstances described in this Agreement. The Company and the Executive agree as follows: 1. Term of Agreement. This Agreement will have an initial term of three (3) years commencing on the Effective Date (the Initial Term). On the third (3rd) anniversary of the Effective Date and each third (3rd) anniversary thereafter, this Agreement will renew automatically for additional, three (3) year terms (each, an Additional Term) unless either party provides the other party with written notice of nonrenewal at least sixty (60) days prior to the date of automatic renewal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change in Control occurs when there are fewer than twelve (12) months remaining during the Initial Term or Additional Term, as applicable, the term of this Agreement will extend automatically through the date that is twelve (12) months following the date of the Change in Control. If the Executive becomes entitled to the benefits under Section 3 of this Agreement, then the Agreement will not terminate until all of the obligations of the parties hereto with respect to this Agreement have been satisfied. 2. At-Will Employment. The Company and the Executive acknowledge that the Executives employment is and will continue to be at-will, as defined under applicable law. 3. Severance Benefits. (a) Qualifying Non-CIC Termination. On a Qualifying Non-CIC Termination (as defined below), the Executive will be eligible to receive the following payments and benefits from the Company: (i) Severance. A single, lump sum payment equal to six (6) months of the Executives Salary (as defined below), less applicable withholdings. (ii) COBRA Coverage. Subject to Section 3(d), the Company will pay the premiums for coverage under COBRA (as defined below) for the Executive and the Executives eligible dependents, if any, at the rates then in effect, subject to any subsequent changes in rates that are generally applicable to the Companys active employees (the COBRA Coverage), until the earliest of (A) a period of six (6) months from the date of the Executives termination of employment, (B) the date upon which the Executive (and the Executives eligible dependents, as applicable) becomes covered under similar plans, or (C) the date upon which the Executive ceases to be eligible for coverage under COBRA. (b) Qualifying CIC Termination. On a Qualifying CIC Termination, the Executive will be eligible to receive the following payments and benefits from the Company: (i) Severance. A single, lump sum payment equal to twelve (12) months of the Executives Salary plus 100% of the Executives Target Bonus, less applicable withholdings. (ii) COBRA Coverage.

(iii) Equity Vesting Acceleration. Vesting acceleration (and exercisability, as applicable) as to 100% of the then-unvested shares subject to each of the Executives then-outstanding compensatory equity awards issued by the Company. In the case of an equity award with performance-based vesting, unless otherwise specified in the applicable equity award agreement governing such award, all performance goals and other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at target. (c) Termination Other Than a Qualifying Termination. If the termination of the Executives employment with the Company Group is not a Qualifying Termination, then the Executive will not be entitled to receive severance or other benefits. (d) Conditions to Receipt of COBRA Coverage. The Executives receipt of COBRA Coverage is subject to the Executive electing COBRA continuation coverage within the time period prescribed pursuant to COBRA for the Executive and the Executives eligible dependents, if any. If the Company determines in its sole discretion that it cannot provide the COBRA Coverage without potentially violating, or being subject to an excise tax under, applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 2716 of the Public Health Service Act), then in lieu of any COBRA Coverage, the Company will provide to the Executive a taxable monthly payment payable on the last day of a given month (except as provided by the immediately following sentence), in an amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium that the Executive would be required to pay to continue his or her group health coverage in effect on the date of his or her Qualifying Termination (which amount will be based on the premium rates applicable for the first month of COBRA Coverage for the Executive and any of eligible dependents of the Executive) (each, a COBRA Replacement Payment), which COBRA Replacement Payments will be made regardless of whether the Executive elects COBRA continuation coverage and will end on the earlier of (x) the date upon which the Executive obtains other employment or (y) the date the Company has paid an amount totaling the number of COBRA Replacement Payments equal to the number of months in the applicable COBRA Coverage period. For the avoidance of doubt, the COBRA Replacement Payments may be used for any purpose, including, but not limited to continuation coverage under COBRA, and will be subject to any applicable withholdings. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under this Agreement, if the Company determines in its sole discretion at any time that it cannot provide the COBRA Replacement Payments without violating applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 2716 of the Public Health Service Act), the Executive will not receive the COBRA Replacement Payments or any further COBRA Coverage. - 2 - (e) Non-Duplication of Payment or Benefits. For purposes of clarity, in the event of a Qualifying Pre-CIC Termination, any severance payments and benefits to be provided to the Executive under Section 3(b) will be reduced by any amounts that already were provided to the Executive under Section 3(a). Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if the Executive is entitled to any cash severance, continued health coverage benefits, or vesting acceleration of any equity awards (other than under this Agreement) by operation of applicable law or under a plan, policy, contract, or arrangement sponsored by or to which any member of the Company Group is a party (Other Benefits), then the corresponding severance payments and benefits under this Agreement will be reduced by the amount of Other Benefits paid or provided to the Executive. (f) Death of the Executive. In the event of the Executives death before all payments or benefits the Executive is entitled to receive under this Agreement have been provided, the unpaid amounts will be provided to the Executives designated beneficiary, if living, or otherwise to the Executives personal representative in a single lump sum as soon as possible following the Executives death. (g) Transfer Between Members of the Company Group. For purposes of this Agreement, if the Executive is involuntarily transferred from one member of the Company Group to another, the transfer will not be a termination without Cause but may give the Executive the ability to resign for Good Reason. (h) Exclusive Remedy. In the event of a termination of the Executives employment with the Company Group, the provisions of this Agreement are intended to be and are exclusive and in lieu of any other rights or remedies to which the Executive may otherwise be entitled, whether at law, tort or contract, or in equity. The Executive will be entitled to no benefits, compensation or other payments or rights upon termination of employment other than those benefits expressly set forth in this Agreement. 4. Accrued Compensation. On any termination of the Executives employment with the Company Group, the Executive will be entitled to receive all accrued but unpaid vacation, expense reimbursements, wages, and other benefits due to the Executive under any Company-provided plans, policies, and arrangements. 5. Conditions to Receipt of Severance. (a) Separation Agreement and Release of Claims. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive signing and not revoking the Companys then-standard separation agreement and release of claims (which may include an agreement not to disparage any member of the Company Group, non-solicit provisions, an agreement to assist in any litigation matters, and other standard terms and conditions) (the Release and that requirement, the Release Requirement), which must become effective and irrevocable no later than the sixtieth (60th) day following the Executives Qualifying Termination (the Release Deadline). If the Release does not become effective and irrevocable by the Release Deadline, the Executive will forfeit any right to severance payments or benefits under Section 3. - 3 - (b) Payment Timing. Any lump sum severance payment under Section 3(a)(i) or 3(b)(i) will be provided on the first regularly scheduled payroll date of the Company following the date the Release becomes effective and irrevocable (the Severance Start Date), subject to any delay required by Section 5(d) below. Any taxable installments of any COBRA-related severance benefits that otherwise would have been made to the Executive on or before the Severance Start Date will be paid on the Severance Start Date, and any remaining installments thereafter will be provided as specified in the Agreement. Any restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, and/or similar full value awards that accelerate vesting under Section 3 will be settled (x) on a date no later than ten (10) days following the date the Release becomes effective and irrevocable, or (y) if later, in the event of a Qualifying Pre-CIC Termination, on a date no later than the Change in Control. (c) Return of Company Property. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive returning all documents and other property provided to the Executive by any member of the Company Group (with the exception of a copy of the Company employee handbook and personnel documents specifically relating to the Executive), developed or obtained by the Executive in connection with his or her employment with the Company Group, or otherwise belonging to the Company Group. (d) Section 409A. The Company intends that all payments and benefits provided under this Agreement or otherwise are exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and any guidance promulgated under Section 409A of the Code (collectively, Section 409A) so that none of the payments or benefits will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities in this Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with this intent. No payment or benefits to be paid to the Executive, if any, under this Agreement or otherwise, when considered together with any other severance payments or separation benefits that are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A (together, the Deferred Payments) will be paid or otherwise provided until the Executive has a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A. If, at the time of the Executives termination of employment, the Executive is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A, then the payment of the Deferred Payments will be delayed to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, which generally means that the Executive will receive payment on the first payroll date that occurs on or after the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day following the Executives termination of employment. The Company reserves the right to amend this Agreement as it considers necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Executive or any other individual, to comply with any provision required to avoid the imposition of the additional tax imposed under Section 409A or to otherwise avoid income recognition under Section 409A prior to the actual payment of any benefits or imposition of any additional tax. Each payment, installment, and benefit payable under this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). In no event will any member of the Company Group reimburse, indemnify, or hold harmless the Executive for any taxes, penalties and interest that may be imposed, or other costs that may be incurred, as a result of Section 409A. - 4 - (e) Resignation of Officer and Director Positions. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive resigning from all officer and director positions with all members of the Company Group and the Executive executing any documents the Company may require in connection with the same. 6. Limitation on Payments. (a) Reduction of Severance Benefits. If any payment or benefit that the Executive would receive from any Company Group member or any other party whether in connection with the provisions in this Agreement or otherwise (the Payment) would (i) constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax), then the Payment will be equal to the Best Results Amount. The Best Results Amount will be either (x) the full amount of the Payment or (y) a lesser amount that would result in no portion of the Payment being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of those amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state, and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax, results in the Executives receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater amount. If a reduction in payments or benefits constituting parachute payments is necessary so that the Payment equals the Best Results Amount, reduction will occur in the following order: (A) reduction of cash payments in reverse chronological order (that is, the cash payment owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering the Excise Tax will be the first cash payment to be reduced); (B) cancellation of equity awards that were granted contingent on a change in ownership or control within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code in the reverse order of date of grant of the awards (that is, the most recently granted equity awards will be cancelled first); (C) reduction of the accelerated vesting of equity awards in the reverse order of date of grant of the awards (that is, the vesting of the most recently granted equity awards will be cancelled first); and (D) reduction of employee benefits in reverse chronological order (that is, the benefit owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering the Excise Tax will be the first benefit to be reduced). In no event will the Executive have any discretion with respect to the ordering of Payment reductions. The Executive will be solely responsible for the payment of all personal tax liability that is incurred as a result of the payments and benefits received under this Agreement, and the Executive will not be reimbursed, indemnified, or held harmless by any member of the Company Group for any of those payments of personal tax liability. (b) Determination of Excise Tax Liability. Unless the Company and the Executive otherwise agree in writing, the Company will select a professional services firm (the Firm) to make all determinations required under this Section 6, which determinations will be conclusive and binding upon the Executive and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 6, the Firm may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Executive will furnish to the Firm such information and documents as the Firm reasonably may request in order to make determinations under this Section 6. The Company will bear the costs and make all payments for the Firms services in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 6. The Company will have no liability to the Executive for the determinations of the Firm. - 5 - 7. Definitions.

(n) Target Bonus means the Executives annual (or annualized, as applicable) target bonus in effect immediately prior to the Executives Qualifying Termination or, if the Executives Qualifying Termination occurs during the Change in Control Period and the amount is greater, the Executives annual (or annualized, if applicable) target bonus in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control. 8.

The Executives receipt of COBRA Coverage is subject to the Executive electing COBRA continuation coverage within the time period prescribed pursuant to COBRA for the Executive and the Executives eligible dependents, if any. If the Company determines in its sole discretion that it cannot provide the COBRA Coverage without potentially violating, or being subject to an excise tax under, applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 2716 of the Public Health Service Act), then in lieu of any COBRA Coverage, the Company will provide to the Executive a taxable monthly payment payable on the last day of a given month (except as provided by the immediately following sentence), in an amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium that the Executive would be required to pay to continue his or her group health coverage in effect on the date of his or her Qualifying Termination (which amount will be based on the premium rates applicable for the first month of COBRA Coverage for the Executive and any of eligible dependents of the Executive) (each, a COBRA Replacement Payment), which COBRA Replacement Payments will be made regardless of whether the Executive elects COBRA continuation coverage and will end on the earlier of (x) the date upon which the Executive obtains other employment or (y) the date the Company has paid an amount totaling the number of COBRA Replacement Payments equal to the number of months in the applicable COBRA Coverage period. For the avoidance of doubt, the COBRA Replacement Payments may be used for any purpose, including, but not limited to continuation coverage under COBRA, and will be subject to any applicable withholdings. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under this Agreement, if the Company determines in its sole discretion at any time that it cannot provide the COBRA Replacement Payments without violating applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 2716 of the Public Health Service Act), the Executive will not receive the COBRA Replacement Payments or any further COBRA Coverage. - 2 - (e) Non-Duplication of Payment or Benefits. For purposes of clarity, in the event of a Qualifying Pre-CIC Termination, any severance payments and benefits to be provided to the Executive under Section 3(b) will be reduced by any amounts that already were provided to the Executive under Section 3(a). Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if the Executive is entitled to any cash severance, continued health coverage benefits, or vesting acceleration of any equity awards (other than under this Agreement) by operation of applicable law or under a plan, policy, contract, or arrangement sponsored by or to which any member of the Company Group is a party (Other Benefits), then the corresponding severance payments and benefits under this Agreement will be reduced by the amount of Other Benefits paid or provided to the Executive. (f) Death of the Executive. In the event of the Executives death before all payments or benefits the Executive is entitled to receive under this Agreement have been provided, the unpaid amounts will be provided to the Executives designated beneficiary, if living, or otherwise to the Executives personal representative in a single lump sum as soon as possible following the Executives death. (g) Transfer Between Members of the Company Group. For purposes of this Agreement, if the Executive is involuntarily transferred from one member of the Company Group to another, the transfer will not be a termination without Cause but may give the Executive the ability to resign for Good Reason. (h) Exclusive Remedy. In the event of a termination of the Executives employment with the Company Group, the provisions of this Agreement are intended to be and are exclusive and in lieu of any other rights or remedies to which the Executive may otherwise be entitled, whether at law, tort or contract, or in equity. The Executive will be entitled to no benefits, compensation or other payments or rights upon termination of employment other than those benefits expressly set forth in this Agreement. 4. Accrued Compensation. On any termination of the Executives employment with the Company Group, the Executive will be entitled to receive all accrued but unpaid vacation, expense reimbursements, wages, and other benefits due to the Executive under any Company-provided plans, policies, and arrangements. 5. Conditions to Receipt of Severance. (a) Separation Agreement and Release of Claims. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive signing and not revoking the Companys then-standard separation agreement and release of claims (which may include an agreement not to disparage any member of the Company Group, non-solicit provisions, an agreement to assist in any litigation matters, and other standard terms and conditions) (the Release and that requirement, the Release Requirement), which must become effective and irrevocable no later than the sixtieth (60th) day following the Executives Qualifying Termination (the Release Deadline). If the Release does not become effective and irrevocable by the Release Deadline, the Executive will forfeit any right to severance payments or benefits under Section 3. - 3 - (b) Payment Timing. Any lump sum severance payment under Section 3(a)(i) or 3(b)(i) will be provided on the first regularly scheduled payroll date of the Company following the date the Release becomes effective and irrevocable (the Severance Start Date), subject to any delay required by Section 5(d) below. Any taxable installments of any COBRA-related severance benefits that otherwise would have been made to the Executive on or before the Severance Start Date will be paid on the Severance Start Date, and any remaining installments thereafter will be provided as specified in the Agreement. Any restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, and/or similar full value awards that accelerate vesting under Section 3 will be settled (x) on a date no later than ten (10) days following the date the Release becomes effective and irrevocable, or (y) if later, in the event of a Qualifying Pre-CIC Termination, on a date no later than the Change in Control. (c) Return of Company Property. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive returning all documents and other property provided to the Executive by any member of the Company Group (with the exception of a copy of the Company employee handbook and personnel documents specifically relating to the Executive), developed or obtained by the Executive in connection with his or her employment with the Company Group, or otherwise belonging to the Company Group. (d) Section 409A. The Company intends that all payments and benefits provided under this Agreement or otherwise are exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and any guidance promulgated under Section 409A of the Code (collectively, Section 409A) so that none of the payments or benefits will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities in this Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with this intent. No payment or benefits to be paid to the Executive, if any, under this Agreement or otherwise, when considered together with any other severance payments or separation benefits that are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A (together, the Deferred Payments) will be paid or otherwise provided until the Executive has a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A. If, at the time of the Executives termination of employment, the Executive is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A, then the payment of the Deferred Payments will be delayed to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, which generally means that the Executive will receive payment on the first payroll date that occurs on or after the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day following the Executives termination of employment. The Company reserves the right to amend this Agreement as it considers necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Executive or any other individual, to comply with any provision required to avoid the imposition of the additional tax imposed under Section 409A or to otherwise avoid income recognition under Section 409A prior to the actual payment of any benefits or imposition of any additional tax. Each payment, installment, and benefit payable under this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). In no event will any member of the Company Group reimburse, indemnify, or hold harmless the Executive for any taxes, penalties and interest that may be imposed, or other costs that may be incurred, as a result of Section 409A. - 4 - (e) Resignation of Officer and Director Positions. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive resigning from all officer and director positions with all members of the Company Group and the Executive executing any documents the Company may require in connection with the same. 6. Limitation on Payments. (a) Reduction of Severance Benefits. If any payment or benefit that the Executive would receive from any Company Group member or any other party whether in connection with the provisions in this Agreement or otherwise (the Payment) would (i) constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax), then the Payment will be equal to the Best Results Amount. The Best Results Amount will be either (x) the full amount of the Payment or (y) a lesser amount that would result in no portion of the Payment being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of those amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state, and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax, results in the Executives receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater amount. If a reduction in payments or benefits constituting parachute payments is necessary so that the Payment equals the Best Results Amount, reduction will occur in the following order: (A) reduction of cash payments in reverse chronological order (that is, the cash payment owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering the Excise Tax will be the first cash payment to be reduced); (B) cancellation of equity awards that were granted contingent on a change in ownership or control within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code in the reverse order of date of grant of the awards (that is, the most recently granted equity awards will be cancelled first); (C) reduction of the accelerated vesting of equity awards in the reverse order of date of grant of the awards (that is, the vesting of the most recently granted equity awards will be cancelled first); and (D) reduction of employee benefits in reverse chronological order (that is, the benefit owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering the Excise Tax will be the first benefit to be reduced). In no event will the Executive have any discretion with respect to the ordering of Payment reductions. The Executive will be solely responsible for the payment of all personal tax liability that is incurred as a result of the payments and benefits received under this Agreement, and the Executive will not be reimbursed, indemnified, or held harmless by any member of the Company Group for any of those payments of personal tax liability. (b) Determination of Excise Tax Liability. Unless the Company and the Executive otherwise agree in writing, the Company will select a professional services firm (the Firm) to make all determinations required under this Section 6, which determinations will be conclusive and binding upon the Executive and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 6, the Firm may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Executive will furnish to the Firm such information and documents as the Firm reasonably may request in order to make determinations under this Section 6. The Company will bear the costs and make all payments for the Firms services in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 6. The Company will have no liability to the Executive for the determinations of the Firm. - 5 - 7. Definitions.

The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive returning all documents and other property provided to the Executive by any member of the Company Group (with the exception of a copy of the Company employee handbook and personnel documents specifically relating to the Executive), developed or obtained by the Executive in connection with his or her employment with the Company Group, or otherwise belonging to the Company Group. (d) Section 409A. The Company intends that all payments and benefits provided under this Agreement or otherwise are exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and any guidance promulgated under Section 409A of the Code (collectively, Section 409A) so that none of the payments or benefits will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities in this Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with this intent. No payment or benefits to be paid to the Executive, if any, under this Agreement or otherwise, when considered together with any other severance payments or separation benefits that are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A (together, the Deferred Payments) will be paid or otherwise provided until the Executive has a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A. If, at the time of the Executives termination of employment, the Executive is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A, then the payment of the Deferred Payments will be delayed to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, which generally means that the Executive will receive payment on the first payroll date that occurs on or after the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day following the Executives termination of employment. The Company reserves the right to amend this Agreement as it considers necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Executive or any other individual, to comply with any provision required to avoid the imposition of the additional tax imposed under Section 409A or to otherwise avoid income recognition under Section 409A prior to the actual payment of any benefits or imposition of any additional tax. Each payment, installment, and benefit payable under this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). In no event will any member of the Company Group reimburse, indemnify, or hold harmless the Executive for any taxes, penalties and interest that may be imposed, or other costs that may be incurred, as a result of Section 409A. - 4 - (e) Resignation of Officer and Director Positions. The Executives receipt of any severance payments or benefits upon the Executives Qualifying Termination under Section 3 is subject to the Executive resigning from all officer and director positions with all members of the Company Group and the Executive executing any documents the Company may require in connection with the same. 6. Limitation on Payments. (a) Reduction of Severance Benefits. If any payment or benefit that the Executive would receive from any Company Group member or any other party whether in connection with the provisions in this Agreement or otherwise (the Payment) would (i) constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax), then the Payment will be equal to the Best Results Amount. The Best Results Amount will be either (x) the full amount of the Payment or (y) a lesser amount that would result in no portion of the Payment being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of those amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state, and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax, results in the Executives receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater amount. If a reduction in payments or benefits constituting parachute payments is necessary so that the Payment equals the Best Results Amount, reduction will occur in the following order: (A) reduction of cash payments in reverse chronological order (that is, the cash payment owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering the Excise Tax will be the first cash payment to be reduced); (B) cancellation of equity awards that were granted contingent on a change in ownership or control within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code in the reverse order of date of grant of the awards (that is, the most recently granted equity awards will be cancelled first); (C) reduction of the accelerated vesting of equity awards in the reverse order of date of grant of the awards (that is, the vesting of the most recently granted equity awards will be cancelled first); and (D) reduction of employee benefits in reverse chronological order (that is, the benefit owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering the Excise Tax will be the first benefit to be reduced). In no event will the Executive have any discretion with respect to the ordering of Payment reductions. The Executive will be solely responsible for the payment of all personal tax liability that is incurred as a result of the payments and benefits received under this Agreement, and the Executive will not be reimbursed, indemnified, or held harmless by any member of the Company Group for any of those payments of personal tax liability. (b) Determination of Excise Tax Liability. Unless the Company and the Executive otherwise agree in writing, the Company will select a professional services firm (the Firm) to make all determinations required under this Section 6, which determinations will be conclusive and binding upon the Executive and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 6, the Firm may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Executive will furnish to the Firm such information and documents as the Firm reasonably may request in order to make determinations under this Section 6. The Company will bear the costs and make all payments for the Firms services in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 6. The Company will have no liability to the Executive for the determinations of the Firm. - 5 - 7. Definitions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed a Change in Control unless the transaction qualifies as a change in control event within the meaning of Section 409A. Further and for the avoidance of doubt, a transaction will not constitute a Change in Control if its sole purpose is to either (i) change the state of the Companys incorporation or (ii) create a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same proportions by the persons who held the Companys securities immediately before such transaction.

(n) Target Bonus means the Executives annual (or annualized, as applicable) target bonus in effect immediately prior to the Executives Qualifying Termination or, if the Executives Qualifying Termination occurs during the Change in Control Period and the amount is greater, the Executives annual (or annualized, if applicable) target bonus in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control. 8.
