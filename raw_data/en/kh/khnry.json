RAS affects approximately 20% of the general population [1]. It is the most common ulcerative disease of the oral mucosa [2]. It is more common in children with a prev - alence of 39% [3]. Prevalence decreases with advanc-ing age and increases with higher socioeconomic sta-tus and female gender [4]. A prodromal period of 2-48 RESEARCh ARtiClE Abstract Objective: Conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of natural products in the treatment of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) and their effect on the size and pain levels compared with placebos. Study design: Randomized placebo-controlled trials were identified up to January 2019 in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library. Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Results: The search yielded 248 unduplicated referenc- es. After evaluation, 11 studies with 694 subjects with RAS were included. One was considered low risk of bias, two were considered high risk and eight were considered un- clear risk. In a meta-analysis, natural products provided a statistically significant reduction in ulcer size of about -1.74 mm compared to placebo (95% CI = -3.151 to -0.327; p = 0.016); also pain intensity improved moderately with an ef- fect size (standardized difference in means) of -0.79 (95% CI = -1.447 to -0.141; p = 0.017). Quality of evidence was moderate due to unclear/high risk of bias for ulcer size and pain intensity. The group using natural products were 2.556 times as likely to improve than placebo subjects at 3-4 days. Similar results after 5-7 days with low quality of evidence. Conclusions: The selected group of 11 natural products included in this systematic review seem to reduce pain in- tensity and lesion size in RAS patients with low to moderate quality of evidence. However, due to high heterogeneity and unclear/high risk of bias, the results are inconclusive.Keywords Natural products, Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), Plant-based interventions, Honey, Herbal supplement, Systemat-ic CI: Confidence Items for and Meta-analyses; Patient Intervention Comparison Outcome; Index; RR: Grades of SDM: Standardized Difference in Means*Corresponding author: Reyes Enciso, PhD, Associate Professor, Instructional, Division of Dental Public Health and Pediatric Dentistry, Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC, 925 West 34th St, Room 4268, Los Angeles, California, USA, Fax: (213)-740-8815Check for updatesISSN: 2469-5734DOI: 10.23937/2469-5734/1510103 Phillips et al. Int J Oral Dent Health 2019, 5:103 Page 2 of 17 hours precedes the ulceration [4]. During the prodromal period, patients may experience tingling or burning in the area where the ulceration develops. The ulcers are round and shallow with an erythematous border and white, yellow or gray pseudo membrane. The lesions occur most commonly in non-keratinized oral mucosa, such as the buccal mucosa, but may also occur on ke - ratinized tissue like the hard palate [2-5]. The course of the lesion healing is variable, and the lesions may last days or weeks before healing is complete. The lesions can be quite painful and affect nutrition, speech and oral hygiene [3]. Other diseases such as herpes stomatitis, Beh\u00e7et's disease, Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis may be considered in the differential diagnosis of intraoral ul - cerations, but are different etiological entities than RAS. The precise etiology of RAS is unknown. There may be a combination of contributory factors that lead to devel-opment of RAS in each individual patient. Regardless, the etiology of RAS is multi-factorial and may be relat-ed to trauma, nutritional deficiency, allergy, altered immune response and stress [2, 3]. There is also a he- reditary component; children whose parents both ex- perience RAS exhibit a 90% prevalence of the conditi on [3,6]. A number of treatments for RAS have been evaluat- ed, including use of topical analgesic anti-inflammatory drugs, local anesthetics, topical antibiotics, antiseptics and topical steroids [1]. Although topical medications can be helpful, not every patient will experience satis-factory response to topical interventions. Several sys-temic medications have been considered for manage - ment of RAS including corticosteroids, dapsone, thalid - omide and colchicine, among others [1, 2,4]. Because of the possible adverse effects from systemic medications, herbal supplements and natural products have been ad- vocated as an alternate form of treatment. There is a growing interest among patients, clinicians and researchers as to the viability of 'natural products' as appropriate treatment options due to the perceived lack of side effects and the variability of response to topical medications. In this systematic review, 'natural products' are defined as compounds that are derived from natu- ral sources such as plants, animals or micro-organisms [7]. A total of eleven plant-based interventions and hon- ey (herbal supplements or natural products) have been studied in randomized controlled trials against a placebo (Table 1). The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of natural products in the treatment of RAS and their effect on the size of RAS lesions and the pain levels compared with placebos. Methods and Materials This systematic review adhered to the Preferred re - porting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement [ 8]. Inclusion and exclusion criteria The PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Out- come) question was, in adult patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis, do natural products (plant-based or animal-based) reduce ulcer size and pain in-tensity compared to placebo. Studies were limited to Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy of natural products to treat recurrent aphthous stoma-titis in adults compared to placebo [9 -19]. Synthetic supplements such as vitamins (including LongoVital- a mix of vitamins and a variety of herbs) were exclud- Table 1: Mechanism of action, interactions and adverse reactions of the interventions included in this systematic review.

The external use of aloe has not been associated with severe adverse reactions; the majorities are relatively mild and reversible upon cessation. Reports of burning sensations following topical application of aloe gel to dermabraded skin have been described. Contact dermatitis from the related Aloe arborescens has been reported. Erythema, edema, urticaria, and eczematous rash have also been reported following A. vera application. Honey [13] Honey has anti- infection and rapid wound healing properties.None well documented for honey or bee pollen. Case reports of hematuria due to potentiation of warfarin have been documented with royal jelly. Allergic reactions may occur to pollen in honey when ingested. Attempts to hyposensitize patients by administering bee pollen may produce severe anaphylaxis and other acute or chronic responses. Although rare, bee pollen can cause serious, sometimes fatal, adverse reactions. Some case reports of acute hepatitis and photosensitivity following ingestion of bee pollen have been reported. In many allergic patients, skin tests are positive for royal jelly. Case reports exist of allergy, acute exacerbation of asthma, anaphylaxis, and death.

A fourth reviewer (R.E.) resolved any disagree - ments during discussions about inclusion or rejections of studies that had lack of consensus. Each abstract had reasons for exclusion clearly outlined. Inclusion and ex-clusion criteria, number of participants, demographics and other data on study participants' characteristics were gathered during the qualitative synthesis phase. A standardized table was used to extract this data along with the interventions and outcomes that were as-sessed in each study. Assessment of risk of bias was undertaken indepen - dently by three reviewers (K.S.P., W.C.C.-M., J.M.P.) ded by the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool [25]. Arisk of bias table was completed for each included study. Meta-analyses Studies reporting similar outcomes comparing natu - ral products' group to placebo group in RCTs of patients with RAS were included in meta-analyses. Random-ef - fects model was chosen due to the heterogeneity of the interventions (i.e. different natural products). Differ-ence in means and 95% Confidence intervals (CI) were reported for outcomes ulcer size in mm and level of erythema and exudation at different time points. Stan - dardized difference in means (SDM) and 95% CI were reported for pain intensity due to the use of three dif - ferent pain scales by the studies. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI were reported for the binary outcome significant improvement in ulcer size (yes/no) defined as an effica - cy index of > 70%. All analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis software v2 (Bio stat, En - glewood, NJ, USA). Levels of evidence and summary of the review findings Quality of evidence assessment and summary of the review findings were conducted with the software GRADE profiler\u00a9 (Grader\u00a9), following the Cochrane Collaboration and GRADE Working Group recommen - dations [25]. In this systematic review we downgraded the quality of the evidence due to unclear/high risk of bias or due to imprecision (only two studies reporting the outcomes with less than 400 participants in total in - cluded in the meta-analysis [ 26]).ed. Editorials, literature reviews, systematic reviews, case reports, animal studies, pilot studies, not ran- domized controlled trials and clinical guidelines were excluded. Reviews, systematic reviews and guidelines were scanned for relevant trials. Articles not available in English were also excluded (Table 1). Outcomes: The primary outcomes of this systematic review were ulcer size in millimeters measured with a ruler or caliper, and pain intensity measured with vari- ous validated scales. Secondary outcomes included lev- el of erythema and exudation , measured based on the methods of Greer 1993 [20] with modifications by Liu, et al. [ 21]. The degree of hyperemia was also reported on analyzed was the Efficacy index (EI) for ulcer size or pain, as defined by Meng, et al. [22] and Liu, et al. [16]. The EI was Review authors defined a significant improvement as patients with an EI > 70%. Finally, time to complete healing in days was evaluated as well in addition to the Oral health impact profile (OHIP) [23]. The OHIP-14 is a 14 question questionnaire that measures people's per-ception of the social impact of oral disorders on their well-being [ 23].

Comparison groups: Patients in the comparison groups were labeled as controls and were provided placebos that contained inert ingredients. In two studies efforts were made to ensure that the placebo resembled the intervention in color and consistency [9,15,19]. The remaining eight studies did not desig- nate if that was also done [10- 14,16-18]. Outcomes: The primary outcome reported by the in - cluded studies was ulcer size in mm, measured using a sterile calibrated dental probe with millimeter marking [9,12,14-18] or a metal caliper [13]. Another primary out - come was pain intensity measured with various scales: Visual analog scale (VAS) on a 100 mm line labeled at one end \"no soreness\" and the other end \"worst pos - sible [9, 12] or a 10 mm scale [13, 17,19]; pain intensity on a 0-3 scale with 0-no pain, 1-discomfort, 2-moderate pain and 3-severe pain [11-15]. Secondary outcomes included level of erythema and exudation were reported in three studies [9, 12]. One study report- ed only average degree of erythema without any other information (i.e. standard deviation, percentiles) and could not be included in the meta-analysis [14]. One study [19] reported the degree of hyperemia on a scale 0-3 and could not be included in the meta-analysis as it is a different outcome than erythema and exudation combined. Another secondary outcome measured was the Efficacy index (EI) for ulcer size or pain, as defined by Meng, et al. [22] and Liu, et al. [16]. The EI was eval-uated for ulcers' size in two studies [15, 16] and for pain in one study [16]. Three outcomes were only evaluated text and analyzed for inclusion independently by three review authors. 11 manuscripts were relevant for inclu - sion. Table 2 shows a list of our included studies. Main reasons for exclusion for 29 references are reported in PRISMA flowchart (Figure 1). Included studies Ten double-blinded RCTS [9-13, 15-19], and one sin - gle blinded study [14] were eligible for qualitative anal - ysis to answer the question of efficacy of nutraceuticals on the treatment of Recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAS) (Table 2 ). Population: A total of 694 patients were included in this review. All studies enrolled patients at only one center, and enrolled both male and female with more females overall [9-19]. The number of patients enrolled in each study ranged from 20 [11] to 217 [16]. The ages of the patients ranged from 10 [10] to 64 [10]. The in - clusion criteria among the studies as well as the average age and gender distribution are presented in Table 2. Patients from the studies had a diagnosis of recurrent aphthous ulcers with present clinical signs and symp-toms of ulcerations on the oral mucosa and history of RAS. Inclusion criteria in some studies specified lesions' minimum size, duration of lesion, time of onset and oth - er characteristics as listed in Table 2 .

The randomly assigned number was recorded in the protocol, and information regarding the contents in one study, time to complete healing [10,18], dates of pain elimination [10], and Oral health impact profile (OHIP) [12] and no meta-analysis could be undertaken.

Random sequence generation: Method was identi - fied as low risk of bias in six studies total [9, 14-17, 19] because they used a computer based random number generator. Five studies [10-13, 18] were unclear risk for random sequence generation because they didn't spec-ify the method they used. No studies were high risk.

Four studies [9, 10,12,18] were considered to have an unclear risk of bias for incomplete outcome data, intent to treat analysis not clearly stated or because the num - ber of dropouts were stated, but the reason was not clear. Selective reporting: All of the pre-specified out - comes were reported in the pre-specified way in all became available after the completion of the study and statistical analysis. One study was considered to be high risk for blinding because they did not state that that they used randomized controlled trials in their blinding methods [14]. Eight studies [9-11, 13,16-19] had unclear risk of bias for blinding as they did not go into detail about how the blinding was done, but stated that dou - ble blinding did occur. Incomplete outcome data: Five studies [13, 15-17,19] included had no missing outcome data and were as- sessed as being at low risk of bias for this domain.

Due to different pain scales reported by the authors, the effect size reported for pain intensity is the 'Standardized Difference in Means' (SDM). Cohen suggested that SDM > 0.8 be considered a 'large' effect size. ISSN: 2469-5734DOI: 10.23937/2469-5734/1510103 Phillips et al. Int J Oral Dent Health 2019, 5:103 Page 11 of 17 Meta-analyses results The primary outcome measures reported by the authors were the differences in post-treatment ulcer size (mm) and pain intensity. Secondary outcomes included significant improvement in ulcer size at 3-4 days and 5-7 days and level of erythema and exuda-tion (scale 0-3). All results reported used the ran-dom-effects model. Ulcer size (mm): Six studies reported mean and stan - dard deviation of ulcer size at 3-4 days [11, 13,15,17- 19].Natural products provided a statistically signifi-cantly better reduction in ulcer size (mm) compared to placebo (Difference in means = -1.739; 95% CI = -3.151 to -0.327; p = 0.016) (Figure 3a). Similar results were found at 5-7 days (Figure 3b). Pain intensity: Six studies reported mean and standard deviation of pain intensity at 3-4 days [11-14,16,19]. Due to different pain scales reported by eleven included studies [9-19] therefore the selective reporting risk of bias was assessed as low for all of them. Other potential sources of bias: In four studies [10,15,17,18] there was a low risk of bias of other po- tential sources because they mentioned acceptable funding sources such as university based grants, no co-interventions were used and the groups were bal- anced at baseline. In seven studies [9 ,11-14,16,19] there was an unclear risk of bias of other potential sources because no funding sources were mentioned or there were no statements on co-interventions mentioned or not, and no statements on whether there were balanced groups at baseline or not. Overall risk of bias : In conclusion, one study [15] was considered low risk. (Supplement Table 2; Figure 2), two studies [11, 14] were considered at high risk of bias and eight studies were considered unclear risk [9,10,12,13,16-19].

Int J Oral Dent Health 2019, 5:103 Page 12 of 17 Level of erythema and exudation : Two studies [9,12] reported level of erythema and exudation on a 0-3 scale. We found no significant improvement in level of erythema and exudation at day 2 nor day 6 (Supple - ment Figure 1). Summary of the evidence and quality of the find- ings (GRADE): Quality of evidence was moderate due to unclear/high risk of bias for ulcer size and pain in-tensity at 3-4 days and 5-7 days. Quality of evidence was low due to unclear/high risk of bias and impreci-sion for outcomes 'significant improvement in ulcer size' and 'level of erythema and exudation' with only two studies reporting the outcomes with less than 400 participants in total included in the meta-anal- ysis [26]. Moderate evidence grading indicates that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low evidence grading indicates that further research is very likely to have an import- ant impact on our confidence in the estimate of ef-fect and it is likely to change the estimate (Table 3).the authors, the effect size reported for pain intensi-ty was the 'Standardized difference in means' (SDM). Cohen suggested that an absolute value of SDM be- tween 0.2 and 0.8 be considered a 'moderate' effect size, and a SDM > 0.8 to be a 'large' effect. Natural products showed significantly better reduction in pain intensity compared to placebo at 3-4 days (SDM = -0.794; 95% CI = -1.447 to -0.141; p = 0.017) 4a) and at day 6 (SDM = -1.094; 95% CI = -1.709 to -0.479; 0.001) 4b). Significant improvement in ulcer size: Two studies [15,19] reported significant improvement in ulcer size. They paired EI = 100% and EI = 70-100% categories as considered significant improvement of ulcer and EI = 0-30% and EI = 30-70% as non-significant improvement [15,19]. The patients using natural products were 2.556 times as likely to improve than subjects using placebo at 3-4 days (Risk ratio (RR) = 2.556; 95% CI = 1.084 to 6.030; p = 0.032) (Figure 5a) and 1.532 times as likely to improve than subjects using placebo at 5-7 days (RR = 1.532; 95% CI = 1.091 to 2.152; p = 0.014) (Figure 5b).

These results do not nec-essarily imply a clinical significance to the patient, and further studies are necessary to corroborate the results of this systematic review. Agreements and disagreements with other stud - ies or reviews The results of this systematic review agree with a systematic review published in 2018 by Heydarpour, et al. evaluating plant derived topical interventions for the treatment of RAS [28]. The primary differ- ence between our review and Heydarpour, et al. [28] review is that ours included a meta-analysis of the interventions. Heydarpour, et al. [28] evaluated non-pharmaceutical interventions in the treatment of RAS and reached the following conclusion: Due to the complex etiology of RAS, the unpredictability of out-comes resolution with current treatment modalities and the potential for adverse effects associated with systemic medicaments, local treatments with fewer side effects are desired and greater numbers of stud- ies evaluating these treatments are needed. Another review by Hamedi, et al. conducted in 2016 also eval-uated plant based interventions for the treatment of RAS [29]. The focus of Hamedi, et al. [29] review was the mechanisms by which the plants may exert their benefits pharmacologically. The effects of the plants evaluated included antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, immune modulatory and anti-viral benefits. In our systematic review, when evaluating primary outcome measures, the natural products under study yielded improvements in pain level and lesion size. The Heydarpour, et al. review yielded similar results. No significant side effects were revealed, only slight side Discussion Summary of main results Ten double-blinded RCTS [9 -13,15-19], and one single blinded study [14] were eligible for qualitative analysis to answer the question of efficacy of natural products on the treatment of RAS. A total of eleven interventions (plant-based and honey) were under study in the included RCTs [9 -19]. One study [15] was considered low risk, two studies [11, 14] were consid- ered at high risk of bias and eight studies were con-sidered unclear risk [9 ,10,12,13,16-19] (Supplement Table 2 and Figure 2). Natural products provided significantly better re- duction in ulcer size (mm) at 3-4 days (p = 0.016) and 5-7 days (p = 0.016) compared to placebo. The group using natural products showed significant improve - ment in ulcer size compared to placebo at 3-4 days (p = 0.032). At 5-7 days, people using natural products were 1.532 times as likely to improve than subjects using placebo (p = 0.014). Compared to dexametha-sone, a clinical study reported that dexamethasone shows significant ulcer size reduction at day 6 (p < 0.001) compared to placebo, but no data was report-ed before day 6 [27]. These results seem to make nat- ural products an alternative to the more commonly used corticosteroid. However, the clinical relevance of the ulcer size might not be as important to patients as it is pain reduction. Drugs like triamcinolone ointment and dexameth- asone, have been reported to be more effective than placebo in reducing pain (p < 0.01 for triamcinolone, p = 0.001 for dexamethasone) [27]. In our systematic review, natural products showed significantly better re - duction in pain intensity (various pain scales reported) Level of erythema and exudation at day 2 (scale 0-3)162(2 studies)2 days LOW 1,2 due to imprecision and risk of biasNA NA The mean level of erythema and exudation in the intervention groups was -0.779 lower (scale 0-3) at day 2 (-1.738 lower to + 0.180 higher) Level of erythema and exudation at day 6 (scale 0-3)162 (2 studies) 6 daysLOW 1,2 due to imprecision and risk of biasNA NA The mean level of erythema and exudation in the intervention groups was -0.865 lower (scale 0-3) at day 6 (-1.938 lower to + 0.208 higher) GRADE Working Group grades of evidence.

In addition, parameters were not similar in all studies in what constitutes RAS and by whom it was diagnosed by. Implications for research Natural products may be effective in the treat- ment of RAS, but greater research focus needs to be placed on specific protocols, the nature of the inter-vention, patient access to the intervention and clin-ical relevance. Although the medicaments evaluated in this analysis yielded positive results, it was unclear whether these results would be applicable clinical-ly. Meta-analyses indicated that those interventions that showed greater efficacy over placebo reduced lesion pain and lesion longevity by such a small de - gree and short timeframe, that investment in these medicaments may not be worthwhile from a clinical standpoint. Future studies may produce a specific regimen of non-pharmaceutical interventions that can be combined with pharmaceutical medicaments, may develop a protocol that leads to prevention of lesions, may result in a method of adjunctive use of non-pharmaceutical topical interventions, or may lead to the development of a new drug that is en-tirely plant-based that has both high efficacy and low risk of adverse events. Further research should also include possible drug-drug interactions. Conclusions The utilization of natural products for the treatment of ailments is not new. Despite still being a popular option, the data supporting their use is limited. In this systematic review, we analyzed the available data for a selected group of natural products, plant-based and honey. In general, these natural products provided a significantly better reduction in ulcer size and pain com-pared to placebo when used for the treatment of RAS. However, these results should be taken cautiously since most of the studies were assessed at unclear risk of bias and the studies were heterogeneous. These results do not necessarily imply a clinical significance to the pa-tient, and further studies with good quality methodolo - gy are needed for each particular natural product.

Statement of Equal Authors' Contribution All authors contributed to the design and imple -effects such as mild burning sensation (S. khuzistanica ) and slight-to-moderate irritation (A. vulgaris ), which spontaneously relieved. Combining the results of these two reviews indicates that there is both a subjective and objective benefit derived from utilization of plant-based, non-pharmaceutical interventions. Heterogeneity of the review Review authors tried to minimize heterogeneity by including only studies with patients with RAS receiving a natural product or placebo, excluding vitamins and products with herbs and vitamins (such as LongoVital). However, some heterogeneity was present; in partic-ular, there were different interventions in all studies and no consistent use of standard in diagnosis of RAS. Furthermore, measurements were not taken at the same intervals for RAS ulcer size and pain intensity in all studies. In addition, parameters were not similar in all studies in what constitutes RAS and by whom it was diagnosed by. There was some heterogeneity in the fact that pain intensity was measured with various scales and also the days at which the lesions' size and pain were measured. Overall completeness and applicability of evi- dence Four electronic databases were searched, MEDLINE via PubMed, the Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE up through January 2019. All included studies, reviews and systematic reviews were cross-ref-erenced for relevant trials. Three reviewers (W.C.C., K.S.P., J.M.P.) individually assessed abstracts and titles to determine eligibility. Articles not available in English were excluded. The results of this systematic review are applicable to males and females, 10 to 64-years-old, di - agnosed with RAS. Quality of the evidence Only randomized controlled trials (ten dou- ble-blinded RCTS [9 -13,15-19], and one single blind- ed study [14]) were eligible for qualitative analysis to answer the question of efficacy of natural products on the treatment of RAS by choice of the authors, as high-quality RCTs can provide the best evidence in comparing the effects of natural products to place-bo on pain and ulcer size in RAS. However, of the 11 RCTs included in the qualitative analysis, one study [15] was considered low risk, two studies [11, 14] were considered at high risk of bias and eight stud- ies were considered unclear risk [9 ,10,12,13,16-19]. The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate due to risk of bias, small total sample size of only 694 participants, small number of eligible studies in each meta-analysis due to heterogeneity of the outcomes reported and in some cases, wide variance of point estimates and statistical heterogeneity.
