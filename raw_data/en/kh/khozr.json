This study evaluated the self-reported post-vaccination side effects vector-based (AZD1222, Gam-COVID-Vac and A d26.COV2.S) vaccines among Algerian healthcare workers using a validated questi onnaire. The nal analysis included 721 healthcare workers, with a predominance of fem ales (59.1%) and younger individuals 20-30 years old (39.4%). Less than half (49.1%) of the respondents reported at least one local side effect, while 53.8% reported at least one systemic side effect. These side effects were more prevalent among viral vector va ccinees than inactivated virus vaccinees. The most common local side effects were inj ection site pain (39%) and arm pain (25.4%), fever (28.4%), hea dache (24.8%) and myalgia (22.7%) were the most prevalent systemic side effects. The s ide effects appeared earlier among inactivated virus vaccines recipients and generally lasted for 2 to 3 days for the two vaccinated groups. The risk factors associated with a hi gher prevalence of side effects included female gender, allergic individuals, ind ividuals with regular medication, those who contracted the COVID-19 disease and those who rece ived two doses for both inactivated and viral-based vaccines groups. Desp ite the higher prevalence of post-vaccination side effects among adenoviral vector v accines recipients, both vaccines groups were equally effective in preventing sympt omatic infections, and no life-threatening side effects were reported in either vacc ine group.

Inactivated Virus vs. Viral Vector Vaccines Safety INTRODUCTION As of March 2022, four hundred and forty-one million cases and nearly six million fatalities were recorded globally du e to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic ( 1). After the second anniversary of its emergence, the disease continues its rapid spread despite the drastic preventive measures applied in all countries worldwide. In the absence of vaccines or ecie nt medications against this disease during the rst wave, coun tries had no alternatives other than non-pharmacological preventi ve measures like lockdowns, travel restrictions, physical dis tancing, quarantine,andusingfacemaskstolimitthediseasepropagat ion according to their capacities ( 2). These measures have helped to limit the propagation of the disease; however, they seem to be insucient to control the disease entirely, and the COVID - 19 resurged in multiple waves when countries started their deconnement( 3,4). Hence, researchers were racing against the clock to nd the best strategy to ght this disease and return to normal life. In this way, herd immunity or population immunity through vaccination or immunity developed after a previous infection was one of the proposed strategies ( 5). Given the impossibility to achieve herd immunity through natural infection, the bes t approachtoachieveherdimmunityrecommendedbytheWorld Health Organization (WHO) is to protect people by vaccination (6,7). These exceptional circumstances have pushed researchers and laboratories to develop and produce dierent types of vaccines in a short period of about 1 year ( 8). In December 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had approved six vaccines types, and the mass vaccination campaign started sin ce then(9). Currently, 35 COVID-19 vaccines are approved by at least one country, and ten vaccines are approved by the WHO ( 9). However, myths, speculations, misinformation and conspirac y theories surrounding COVID-19 vaccines and their side eect s havehighlyinfluencedvaccineuptake.Thesefactorshavecau sed delays due to unwillingness in people to get vaccinated, leadi ng to vaccine hesitancy ( 10-14). Multiples studies have reported that this hesitancy is mainly related to vaccines' safety an d eectiveness; however, all approved vaccines had high ecacy levels (10-17). Nevertheless, like any other pharmacological agents, these vaccines could induce some side eects that cou ld include flu-like symptoms (e.g. headache, fatigue and myalgi a) and injection site reactions and are mostly non-serious and of shortduration( 18-28). Algeria started its mass vaccination campaign on December 31, 2020. The vaccines had been administered rst to healthc are workers and individuals with comorbidities ( 29-31). Currently, the approved vaccines in the country include inactivated viru s vaccines, i.e., BBIBP-CorV and February 20, 2022, more than 7.46 million persons received at least one dose of COVID-19, representingabout16.7%ofthetotalpopulation( 33). The current work was conducted to determine the most common side eects reported by healthcare workers in Algeria afterCOVID-19vaccinationandtoevaluateeventualriskfa ctorsassociated with post-vaccination side eects. To the best of o ur knowledge,nosuchstudiesaboutCOVID-19vaccinesideeect s wereconductedinAlgeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS Design The present study had been designed as an analytical cross- sectional survey-based study that utilized a self-adminis tered questionnaire (SAQ) to collect data from the target populatio n abouttheirpost-vaccinationsideeects.Thestudywasdesig ned and reported according to the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservationalstudiesinEpidemiology(STROBE)guidelinesf or cross-sectionalstudies( 34). Setting This study was carried out between October 25 and November 25, 2021 after 6,328,806 (14.4%) of the Algerian population received at least one dose and 4,751,933 (10.8%) were fully vaccinatedinordertoensurethatasubstantialproportionof the Algerian healthcare workers were already vaccinated. The s tudy utilizedaSAQthatwasdesignedandadministereddigitally using Google Forms (Google LLC, Menlo Park, CA, USA, 2021)( 35). A uniform resource locator (URL) and a quick response (QR) codewereusedtodisseminatetheSAQandcollectdatafromth e targetpopulation. Participants The target population of this study were Algerian healthcare workers who received either one or two doses of COVID-19 vaccinesthatwereapprovedformassinoculationinAlgeria.T he participantswhoreceivedinactivatedvirusandadenoviralv ector vaccines were included, while the participants who received protein sub-unit mRNA-based vaccines were excluded from the subsequentanalyses. Anon-randomtechniquethroughconveniencesamplingwas used as the potential participants were recruited using social media platforms (Facebook and WhatsApp groups) targeting especiallythoseofmedicalinterests. Epi-InfoTMversion 7.2.4 (CDC. Atlanta, GA, USA, 2020) had been used to calculate the sample size using the following assumptions of an expected outcome frequency of 50%, an acceptable margin error of 4%, a condence level (CI) of 95%, and a postulated proportion of responses resulted from careless/insucient eort (C/IE) of 10%( 36). The required samplesizeforthisstudywas660responses. Participation in this study was on voluntary basis and it was not incentivised by nancial rewards or any other means of compensation.Theparticipants'identitywaskeptanonymousin ordertocontrolHawthorne'seectandinformationbias. Instrument The SAQ used in this study was adopted from previous studies and its items had been reviewed by a panel of experts to assess contentvalidity.Consequently,testre-testreliability oftheitems was estimated to be acceptable with a mean Cohen's kappa Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 896343Lounis et al. Inactivated Virus vs. Viral Vector Vaccines Safety coecient of 0.89 \u00b10.13 and reported in detail previously ( 23- 28,37). The SAQ comprised 25 multiple choice items that were stratied into three categories; (i) demographic character istics including sex, age group, and profession, (ii) anamnestic characteristicsincludingchronicillnesses,medication s,allergies, previous COVID-19 infection, and COVID-19 vaccine type and number of doses, and (iii) post-vaccination side eects, their onset and duration, and post-vaccination medical care andmedications. Ethics The study protocol had been reviewed and approved by the Scientic Committee of the Faculty of Natural and Life Sciences/University of Djelfa on 20/10/2021 with the refere nce number 117/10/2021. The Declaration of Helsinki for resear ch involving human subjects had guided the conception and execution of the entire study ( 38). All participants provided their informed consent digitally before lling the questio nnaire. The responses of the participants who did not complete the questionnaire were not saved; and the participants were able t o leave the study any time without justication. Given the fac t that no identifying personal data was collected, retrospecti ve identicationoftheparticipantswasnotpossible. Analyses The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) vers ion 28.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA, 2021) was used to analyse the collected data ( 39). Initially, descriptive statistics used frequencies ( n) and percentages ( %) to summarize nominal and ordinal data. Then, inferential statistics through chi - squared test ( 2) and Fisher's-exact test had been used to evaluate the association between independent and dependent variables. Eventually, multivariable logistic regressio n was used to evaluate the suggested risk factors of post-vaccination s ide eectsfollowinginactivatedvirusvaccinesandadenoviral vector vaccines. All analytical tests were performed with a conden ce level(CI)of95%andasignicancelevel( Sig.)of0.05. RESULTS Demographic Characteristics A total of 724 responses were received during the study period (October 25-November 25, 2021), of which three responses were excluded because the respondents received mRNA-based vaccines (two received BNT162b2 and one received mRNA- 1273). Out of the 721 included participants, 450 received BBIBP- CorV or CoronaVac (inactivated virus group, n=450), while Gam-COVID-Vac, 98 received AZD1222, and 17 receivedAd26.COV2.S(adenoviralvectorgroup, n=271). The most commonly represented age group was the 20-30 years-old (39.4%), followed by the Table1. More than half (54.4%) of the sample were married, while 45.1% were single and 0.4% were either divorced or widow. Physicians (35.5%) were the most participating profession, followed by dentists (20.4%), nurses (9.3%), paramedicsTABLE 1 | Demographic and anamnestic characteristics of Algerian he althcare workers receiving COVID-19 vaccines ( n=721).

Also, their professional background guaranteed a better and more detailed description of the post- vaccination side eects. For these reasons, multiple studies were conducted to determine vaccines side eects among this population subset in dierent countries, e.g., Czech Republic, Germany, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Turkey, and United ArabEmirates( 19-28). Overall, 49.1, and 53.8% of the surveyed healthcare workers in our study reported at least one local or systemic side eect,respectively.Thelocalandsystemicsideeectsweresignica ntly morefrequentamongtheadenoviralvectorvaccinesgroup(6 1.3, and68.3%)thantheinactivatedvirusvaccinatedgroup(41.8 ,and 45.1%).

The local and systemic side eects were more prevalent after the second dose than the rst dose for both inactivated and adenoviral vector vaccin es, thus, conrming what was previously reported in dierent studies (45,46). Contrarily, Omeish et al. 2021 in Jordan and Jeon et al. 2021 in Korea found that side eects were more frequentandmoresevereaftertherstdose( 18,47). Themostcommonlocalsideeectsinthisstudywasinjection site pain (39%), followed by arm pain (25.4%), and injection site swelling (2.5%) and itching (2.5%). However, these side eects emergedgenerallywithlowfrequenciesthanpreviouslyreport ed, especially with the adenoviral vector vaccines, i.e., AZD12 22where injection site pain was reported with a prevalence higher than 58% ( 24,27,47-49). Similarly, a large-scale multinational studycoveringmorethan10,000vaccineesintheArabcountr ies reported that more than 58% of the participants suered from injectionsitepainandswelling( 50). In our study, the local side eects generally appeared earlier among the inactivated virus group than the adenoviral vecto r group, and they generally resolved within the rst day (38.7%) or between the rst and third day (46.7%) post-vaccination in the two groups. This nding is in consistence with what Solomon et al. 2021 reported, where most of the AZD1222 recipients developed injection site pain within the rst 12h Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 8 May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 896343Lounis et al.

Predictor B (SE) Wald AOR CI fever (28.4%), headache (24.8%) and myalgia (22.7%). These symptoms with chills and dizziness are the most common reported side eects for all available vaccines and are generally reported with higher frequency than in our study, especially for adenoviral vector vaccines . (19,21,24). For instance, fatigue, fever and headache were reported by 90%, 66% and 62% of vaccinated individuals in Saudi Arabia following AZD1222 ( 21). In the same Saudi study, it was also reported that 75% of the systemic adverse eects lasted for 1 day ( 21). In our study, the systemic side eects generally emerged in the rst day and lasted mostly for 2days. Additionally,38.1%of ourparticipantstookpost-vaccinatio n medications, mainly Paracetamol, to manage these side eect s and 1.1% reported being hospitalized, thus, conrming the mildness of these side eects. In Iraq, 57.2% of the vaccinate d healthcare workers took Paracetamol, especially among thos e vaccinated with BNT162b2 and AZD1222, and 8.7% of them soughtmedicalcare( 42). The second objective of this study was to determine the risk factors related to the emergence of post-vaccination si de eects. Our results showed that sex, age, tobacco, allergy, chronic diseases, regular medications and previous infecti on with COVID-19 were associated with the frequency of these sideeects. Being a female increased signicantly the risk of developing side eects for both inactivated virus vaccines (OR =2.641; CI 95%=1.780-3.919)andadenoviralvectorvaccines(OR =2.002; CI95%=1.113-3.601).Thesameobservationwasalsoreported not only for COVID-19 vaccines but also for other bacterial and viral vaccines in which females were more likely to devel op side eects signs than males ( 19,28,51-53). These results are unsurprising because of the hormonal and genetic dierences between males and females, leading to dierent immunologica l reactions( 54).DiRestaetal.2021reportedthattheantibodytiterinBNT162b2recipientswashigherinfemalehealthcareworke rs, whichwasassociatedwithhighsideeectsfrequency( 55). Regarding age, our results showed that the young healthcare workers (20-30 years-old) had developed less frequent local a nd systemic side eects than the older ones for the two vaccine groups. Moreover, the most exposed to these side eects was the category of 30-50 years old. Our results are generally in line with multiple previous studies despite some dierences in age categorization. Menni et al. 2021 reported a high frequenc y of post-vaccination side eects following mRNA-based and adenoviral vector-based vaccines the people under 55 years old (56). Similarly, other studies found the same observation for a younger individual of <49 years (Czech Republic), ( 23) <45 years (Jordan), ( 20)<39 years (Germany), ( 57)<38 years (Iran), (51) and <32 years (Turkey) ( 28) for both inactivated virus and adenoviral vector vaccines. In addition, Klugar e t al. 2021 reported that the post-vaccination side eects were more reported in younger healthcare workers who received mRNA- basedvaccines,i.e.,BNT162b2andadenoviralvectorvacci ne,i.e. AZD1222( 24). Our participants with chronic diseases did not develop more side eects than those without chronic diseases for the two vaccinated groups. Contrarily, allergic individual s and those taking medications regularly developed signicantly more side eects than their counterparts. This result supports the observation reported by Alhazmi et al. 2021 in Saudi Arabia, while other studies found that persons with chronic conditio ns andregularmedicationaremorelikelytodevelopsideeects( 21, 23,24,27,28). For the association between regular medications and side eects, it is imperative to deal with this nding cautiouslysincethereportedmedicationsarevariousandin clude antihistaminic agents, anti-diabetics, antihypertensive drugs, contraceptives, and thyroid hormones and little is known abo ut their interaction with the dierent COVID-19 vaccines. In th e previous studies that found a lower prevalence of side eects among people with chronic diseases, this nding was attributed to their weak immune system, which leads to a weaker immune response( 46). Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 9 May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 896343Lounis et al. Inactivated Virus vs. Viral Vector Vaccines Safety The history of infection with COVID-19 increased signicantly the risk of developing side eects even in both vaccine groups. The same results were found in multiple previous studies for dierent COVID-19 vaccines, including the mRNA-based ones ( 23,24,27,28,50,57). Moreover, the antibody titer after COVD-19 vaccination was higher among individuals with a past history of SARS-CoV-2 infection than those who had not been in contact with this pathogen ( 44). On the contrary, two Saudi Arabia studies failed to nd any association between the history of COVID- 19 infection and post-vaccination side eects prevalence and severity ( 21,46). Nevertheless, Zare et al. 2021 found a signicant association between previous infection and post-vaccination side eects prevalence in the group of Gam- COVID-VacbutnotinthegroupofAZD1222( 58).Thisnding should be however interpreted cautiously since the period between the COVID-19 recovery and the date of vaccination isunknown. Limitations At last, this study has several limitations related to the sample selection and the survey method. The survey was conducted using convenient and snowball sampling based on an online questionnaire that could marginalize individuals without access to the internet and overrepresent younger individuals who tend to spend more time with social media. Given the increase in familywise error rate across the report ed statistical analyses, lack of control can be considered one of the limitations of this study ndings. Another limitatio n is the lower number of healthcare workers who received vector-based vaccines; this could be explained by the fact that the inactivated vaccines are the most used and the most preferred vaccines by the Algerian population, as described in previousstudies. Strengths To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study provides the rst evidence about self-reported COVID-19 vaccines sid e eects among the Algerian population. It also provides a cross- vaccine comparison for the inactivated virus versus adenovi ral vectorvaccines. CONCLUSION In conclusion, this is the rst study that concerns COVID- 19 vaccines among healthcare workers in Algeria. Results showed that local and systemic are generally more prevalent with adenoviral vector vaccines than inactivated virus vac cines. Injection site pain (39%) and arm pain (25.4%) were the most common local side eects, while fatigue (34.4%), fever (28.4%) ,headache (24.8%) and myalgia (22.7%) were the most reported systemicsideeects.Females,allergicindividuals,andth osewith a history of COVID-19 infection had a signicantly higher ri sk of developing post-vaccination side eects for inactiv ated virusoradenoviralvectorvaccines.
