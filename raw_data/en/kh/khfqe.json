There are many tasty and satiating foods that can actively boost our immune system to help prevent sickness. Bastyr University's Dr. Neal Malik takes the mystery out of food choices with this selection of 8 healthy foods that have immune boosting properties. You can reap the potential benefits of these foods by incorporating them into your daily eating plan. Berries Berries are naturally high in vitamin C and other powerful antioxidants that can be enjoyed fresh or frozen. Elderberries may help to recover from illnesses faster, but further research is needed to know for sure. Cinnamon A fall and winter favorite, cinnamon contains essential oils that may help reduce the amount of time we spend getting over a cold or the flu. Fresh Garlic Researchers are discovering that this common ingredient may help kill bacteria and viruses. When possible, consume fresh garlic as opposed to relying on garlic capsules/supplements-the jury is still out as to whether these have the same effect. Ginger May help our immune cells win the battle against colds and the flu. Add fresh ginger to your stir-fry recipes or as part of a salad dressing. Honey This sweetener has been used as an antibiotic for centuries. It was believed that ancient Romans would apply it to their eyes when they had a bout of conjunctivitis (\"pink eye\"). Turns out, they were on to something: honey has been found to prevent the growth of bacteria. Add it to your tea or as a topping on your whole grain pancakes or waffles. Mushrooms A good source of vitamin D and an underutilized immune-boosting food. In fact, clinical researchers discovered improved immune responses in cancer patients who are receiving chemotherapy and radiation after consuming mushrooms. Sweet Potato A fall and winter favorite that's high in vitamins A and C, a one-two punch when it comes to knocking out bacteria and viruses. Turmeric Typically found as a bright yellow powder, this immune system booster is often used in Asian curry dishes. You may also find turmeric supplements, but be careful with these - many have failed quality testing but are still available on store "}
