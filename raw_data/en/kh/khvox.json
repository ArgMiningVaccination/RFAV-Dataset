After the first case of illness reported in Mexico and the and the United States in March and April 2009, this infection spread rapidly and infected hu - mans in over 70 countries within 3 months. The World Health Organization declared the pandemic alert level as phases 5-6 for pH1N1 [1]. The infection rates of pH1N1 dif - fered among age groups, with most of infected patients younger than 25 years old. This may be because of the cross-protection of pre-existing antibodies in the elderly, par - ticularly in those who had experienced other pandemic viruses [1,2]. A diagnostic kit to test for pH1N1 was developed at the beginning of the outbreak. A rapid diagnostic tests using respiratory specimens for pH1N1 are commercially avail - able. However, negative results in rapid diagnostic tests do not completely rule out in -\u00a9 Korean Vaccine Society.

This research was supported by a grant from the Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) funded by the Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea (HI10C2146).Purpose: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been used in the diverse field to evaluate influenza virus infection; for the surveillance, diagnosis, efficacy evaluation, and development of the vaccine. The aim of this study was to establish an ELISA for detecting HA strain-specific antibodies using recombinant pandemic A H1N1 (pH1N1) HA1 (rHA1) protein. Materials and Methods: rHA1 was produced in baculovirus system. The clinical performance of the developed ELISA was validated using human serum samples, by comparison with stan - dard methods for detecting a neutralizing antibody; hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay and microneutralization test (MNT). The ability of the ELISA system to evaluate the efficacy test of an influenza vaccine was explored by measuring antibody levels in the serum of vaccinated mice. Results: Our ELISA could detect anti-rHA1 antibody in influenza-infected patients and vac - cinated subjects. Compared to HI assay and MNT as reference methods, our method showed good performance in detection of anti-rHA1 antibody. Detection of the anti-rHA1 antibody in vaccinated mice and its correlation with titers in HI assay was also proved in a mice model. Conclusion: An ELISA system using rHA1 of pH1N1 influenza virus was developed, and showed good clinical performance in diagnosis of influenza virus infection and evaluation of the vac - cination efficacy in both human and animal models. Keywords: Influenza A virus, H1N1 https://crossmar k-cdn.crossref.org/widget/v2.0/logos /CROSSMARK_Color_square.sv g Doo Hee Shim et al Influenza virus antibody detecting ELISA system 71 http://www.ecevr.org/ https://doi.org/10.7774/cevr.2019.8.1.70fection with pH1N1. Typical serological tests can be used to detect r pH1N1 infection, such as hemagglutination inhibi - tion (HI) assay or microneutralization test (MNT) [3,4]. Al - though these traditional methods are sensitive, they are com - plex and labor-intensive, thus a new active serological sur - veillance method is required to detect influenza viruses as well as to evaluate antigenic match between circulating vi - ruses and vaccine strains [4]. In the present study, we developed and validated a hemag - glutinin 1 (HA1)-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent as - say (ELISA) kit for serological detection of neutralizing anti - bodies against pH1N1 using both human and mouse serum samples. This ELISA kit can be easily and quickly applied in any basic laboratory. The sensitivity and specificity for de - tecting HA1 of influenza virus were also demonstrated, as compared to the traditional HI assays and MNT. This HA1- specific ELISA kit could be a useful tool for detecting influen - za virus outbreaks and determining vaccine efficacy. Materials and Methods Production of recombinant H1N1 HA1 protein (rHA1) Construction of recombinant plasmid The HA gene of influenza virus A/New York/3571/2009 (H1N1) was synthesizes based on the sequence in the NCBI Influenza Database, and the synthetic HA (residues 18-344) gene frag - ment was amplified with adaptor primers having restriction enzyme sequences for BalII (forward) and Xba I (reverse) at the 5\u00b4 end of each primer and then cloned into the 6x-His-tagg - ed baculovirus transfer vector pAcGP67A (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Production of rHA1 The recombinant transfer vector pAcGP67A and the Baculo - Gold were co-transfected into Spodoptera instruction (BD Bioscience). A high-titer of recombinant virus was obtained from the cell-culture supernatant after two consecutive sub - cultures. To obtain recombinant HA1 protein, High-Five cells (2\u00d7106 cells/mL) were infected with high-titer of recombinant virus at 27\u00b0C, 115 rpm for 3 days then cells were harvested and the recombinant proteins in the supernatant were ob - tained by ammonium sulfate precipitation and Ni-NTA col - umn purification (#1018, ADAR Biotech, Rehovot, Israel). The protein concentration was measured by bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).Western blotting rHA1 was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryl - amide gel electrophoresis and the separated protein bands were visualized by Coomassie blue staining and silver stain - ing. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose mem - branes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and blocked with 5% skim milk in phosphate buffered saline , 1\u00d7 PBS and Tween-20) for 1 hour at room tem - perature (RT). The membrane was incubated with an anti- HA1 mouse monoclonal (BSA) in PBST after 3 washes PBST membranes incubated a antibody in 5% skim milk-PBST was added after PBST wash - ing and incubated for 1 hour at RT. After washing with PBST 3 times, the membranes were developed using a chemilumini - escent substrate (Amersham ECL, GE Healthcare, Bucking - hamshire, UK) and exposing the protein side of the membrane to X-ray film. Human serum samples A total of 147 subjects was enrolled in this study. Forty-seven patients with influenza infection were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction using nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with presenting fever. Blood samples from the pa - tients were obtained at the time of H1N1 diagnosis. The con - trol group of 30 subjects showed no flu-like symptoms or con - firmed H1N1 infection. Samples from 70 subjects were col - lected before vaccination (pre-vaccination) and resampled at 4 weeks after vaccination with H1N1-inactivated influenza vaccine (post-vaccination). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board Committee of Gangnam Sever - ance Hospital (Seoul, Korea; IRB No. 3-2009-0170). Informed consents were obtained from all participants and all proce - dures were carried out in accordance with the relevant guide - lines and regulations. HI assay The HI assay was performed as described previously [5]. Brief - ly, sera were treated with receptor destroying enzyme at 30\u00b0C for 20 hours and inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 1 hour. The samples were serially diluted with PBS in the V-bottom 96-well plates then mixed with a standard amount of virus (4 HAU). The plates were incubated for 30 minutes at RT, and 0.5% of chick - en red blood cells were loaded into each well and further in -Doo Hee Shim et al Influenza virus antibody detecting ELISA system 72 http://www.ecevr.org/ https://doi.org/10.7774/cevr.2019.8.1.70cubated for 30 minutes at 25\u00b0C. The HI endpoint was the high - est serum dilution at which agglutination was not observed. Microneutralization test Serum neutralizing antibody titers were determined by con - ducting a multi-well plate cell culture assay. Briefly, MDCK cells were seeded at 1.5\u00d710 cells/well in a 96-well culture plate and cultured at 37\u00b0C, and 5% CO 2 in an incubator to form a monolayer. Serially diluted samples pretreated with receptor destroying enzyme were mixed separately with 100 TCID 50 of A/New York/3571/2009 (H1N1) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. The serum and virus mixture was added to the monolayer of MDCK cells. The plates were further incu - bated for 18 hours at 37\u00b0C and washed with PBS 3 times, and fixed with 80% acetone for 10 minutes. The presence of viral proteins was confirmed by the monoclonal antibody against influenza nucleoprotein (NP), and the end point of the neu - tralizing titer was determined as the highest serum dilution at which NP was reduced by 50%. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Optimal dilutions of purified H1N1-rHA1 antigen were deter - mined by various conditions and repeated experiments. For antigen coating, the indicated concentration of rHA1 anti - gens (7.5 ng/mL) was diluted in cold carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) in 96-well microplate and incubated at 4\u00b0C, overnight. Antigen-free carbonate the buffer was coated for endpoint assay and the background was subtracted. 3% of BSA in PBST was used for blocking (37\u00b0C for 1 hour). After washing the plate 5 times, serum samples were diluted and pre-incubated with blocking buffer containing supernatant of the High-Five cell culture medium (10 g/mL of protein concentration) at RT for 10 minutes. Next, 100 L of diluted serum samples (1:100) was applied in duplicate to each antigen-coated and non-coated well and incubated for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0C. After the plates were washed 5 times with PBST, HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG (1:10,000, and anti-mouse IgG Ab (1:5,000, Santa Cruz Bio - technology, Dallas, TX, USA) were added to each well match - ing the sample origin. Next, the plates were incubated for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0C and washed 7 times with PBST. For color de - velopment, 100 L of 3,3\u00b4,5,5\u00b4-tetra-methylbezidine in acidic buffer (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was added to each well and incubated for 15 minutes at RT. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2.5 N H 2SO 4. The optical densi - ty (OD) was determined at a wavelength of 450 nm using a microplate reader within 30 minutes. Endpoint titers of hu - man H1N1-HA1-specific Abs were expressed as the OD 450 val- rHA1 uncoated well subtraction wells. and protective efficacy in a murine model Animals Six-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Ori - ent Bio (Seoul, Korea). The animals were maintained in the animal care facilities of the Korea Research Institute of Bio - science and Biotechnology (KRIBB) under specific pathogen- free conditions. The experiments were approved by the Insti - tutional Animal Care and Use Committee of KRIBB (KRIBB- AEC-14058). Vaccination, sample collection, and viral challenge Each group of mice was immunized with 0.2, 0.5, or 0.8 g of influenza virus A/California/04/2009 (CA04) vaccine candi - date, suspended in a volume of 0.2 mL by intramuscular in - jection twice at a 2-week interval. For the control experiment, 0.2 mL of PBS was injected into the mice intramuscularly. Af - ter 2 weeks after the last vaccination, the mice were anesthe - tized with a Zoletil 50 mix (0.015 mL/20 Virbac Laboratory, Carros, France) and Rompun injection (0.5 mg/20 g, Bayer Korea, Seoul, Korea). Sera were collected by orbital bleeding. Next, the mice were challenged with 10\u00d7 the LD 50 of live in - fluenza A virus in 30 L of PBS into intranasal route. The body weight change and survival rate of the animals were also eval - uated. Statistical analysis All data were expressed as the mean\u00b1standard deviation. Statistical comparisons between experimental groups were performed using the Student's t test. The sensitivity and spec - ificity of ELISA for detecting the anti-HA1 specific antibody were reported by calculating the area under the receiving op - erator characteristic curve. The correlation between the anti- HA1 antibody and HI titer was determined by Pearson corre - lation test. GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) was used for all analyses. p<0.05 was consid - ered statistically significant.

Proteins were pro - duced by High-Five cells after vector transformation. Purified rHA1 protein was confirmed by Coomassie blue and silver staining (Fig. 1C). H1N1 proteins of the expected size of 46 kDa were isolated. The ELISA system using recombinant HA1 protein was established to detect anti-rHA1 antibody in patients with influenza virus infection The ELISA system using rHA1 protein was developed and validated to detect anti-rHA1 antibodies in the serum sam - ples from influenza-infected patients and controls. According to this ELISA, OD values of patients were increased than con - trols (0.942\u00b10.371 vs. 0.212\u00b10.086, p<0.001) (Fig. 2A). And in vaccinated individuals, anti-rHA1 antibody levels were sig - nificantly increased after vaccination compared with levels from pre-vaccination status (Fig. 2B). From these data, this ELISA system using rHA1 could be useful in diagnosis of in - fluenza infection and in discrimination of vaccination status in human. The ELISA system was compared to standard detection methods for influenza virus infection, such as the HI assay and MNT. As shown in Fig. 2C, this ELISA system could be a sensitive and specific method for detecting the anti-rHA1 an - Fig. 3. Measurements of anti-rHA1 antibodies in mice.

The detection perfor - mance of this ELISA system was comparable to that of the HI assay and MNT. Anti-rHA1 antibodies were detected by the ELISA system in the animal model of influenza virus infection The ELISA system using rHA1 protein was also validated in an animal model. The control (PBS) and vaccinated groups were compared. The vaccinated groups were immunized with influenza virus A/California/04/2009 (CA04) vaccine. The vaccines contained 3 different amounts of antigens, such as 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 \u00b5g in each single dose of vaccine, respec - tively. All mice were immunized with PBS or vaccines twice in 2 weeks apart and challenged at 2 weeks after the last vac - cination (Fig. 3A). Body weight changes and the survival rate of vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups were monitored af - ter influenza virus challenge (Fig. 3B, C). Compared to the control PBS group, the vaccinated groups showed lower body weight changes (Fig. 3B) and death rates (Fig. 3C). The serum levels of anti-rHA1 antibodies were measured in both non- immunized and immunized mice by ELISA. The increased levels of antibodies were detected in all vaccinated mice but not in PBS group. The amount of antigens in vaccines did not affect the production of anti-rHA1 antibodies in this study (Fig. 3D). And the levels of anti-rHA1 antibodies were signifi - cantly correlated with the results of HI assay using the same samples (r=0.508, p<0.001) (Fig. 3E). Taken together, anti-rHA1 antibodies were detected by the ELISA system in vaccinated mice. The positive correlation between anti-rHA1 antibody measured by ELISA and titers in HI assay was also observed in the animal model. Discussion A striking influenza pandemic occurred in 2009-2010. This highly pathogenic virus came from swine and the next pan - demic virus has been thought to have arisen from avian sourc - es in Asia [4]. Because of unpredictable and diverse sources, techniques for global surveillance in influenza virus infection that could be used both in humans and animals has been re - quired. Humans have been exposed to influenza viruses that underwent antigenic and genetic changes; thus, assays that are strain-specific have been also required to characterize the viruses and detect immune responses to recent infection or vaccination [4]. The standard HI assay or MNT for measuring antibody responses to influenza virus surface antigens were developed previously [6,7]. Therefore, we focused on being strain-specific, convenient and readily available test for both humans and animals. In this study, we produced recombinant HA1 influenza protein (2009 H1N1 pandemic strain) using a baculovirus-in - sect cell system. We established the ELISA system using rHA1 for detecting an anti-rHA1-specific antibody in humans, as well as in mice. Its clinical performance was also demonstrat - ed by the comparison with those of HI assay and MNT. This ELISA system could be used for evaluating influenza virus vaccine efficacy, not even for diagnosing current infections. Diagnostic techniques for early and accurate detection of newly emerging viruses are important for the rapid initiation of therapy and prophylaxis to control infection during disease outbreaks [6]. Traditional methods for detecting the neutral - izing antibodies induced by influenza virus infection are time- consuming and the results could be affected by several exter - nal factors [4,8]. Rapid diagnostic kits for influenza viruses are commonly used to detect influenza infection. The results of rapid diagnostic kits could be completed within 30 min - utes and are easily interpreted. However, rapid diagnostic kits showed lower sensitivity (62.3% reported in a meta-analysis) compared reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction based approaches in the 2009 pandemic season. Accurate di - agnosis of new emerging pathogen was limited at that time [6]. In contrast, the ELISA system developed in this study, could be used to detect specific antibodies against certain strain of influenza virus in a short time. This method is relatively easy and convenient compared to the HI assay or MNT, with simi - lar high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of influenza virus infection compared to the HI assay or MNT. Our meth - od does not require a live virus to perform or complex proce - dures. Moreover, this ELISA system could discriminate the vaccination status of the subjects, and thus the efficacy of vac - cines could be also evaluated. In summary, we established a recombinant HA1-based ELISA system for detecting anti-rHA1 antibody against influ - enza virus infection in humans. We developed a diagnostic approach for influenza virus infection which showed good clinical performance. This method is also applicable for eval - uating the vaccination status of the patients and efficacy of influenza virus vaccines. The ELISA system developed in this study is a useful approach for diagnosis of influenza virus in - fection and assessment in vaccine efficacy.
