Located in Town Square off Las Vegas Boulevard, I Love Crystals opened up in August of 2020 by business partners Lacey Hawk and Kurtis Imel. Wanting to open a crystal shop ever since she was a little girl, Hawk shared what inspired her business. \"I went into a crystal cave when I was very young, and I just didn't want to leave. I fell in love with them way back then, and it has just been a life-long dream of mine to open a crystal shop,\" she said. \"We believe that crystals really help people - they're not just beautiful, they have many healing properties.\" Hawk believes in the healing energies these crystals possess and wants to share that with the world. Products Offered I Love Crystals offers a variety of high-quality healing crystals. Imported from all over the world, Hawk reports that all their crystals undergo a cleansing process before putting them on the shelf to sell. The shop sells crystals such as amethyst, citrine, tiger's eye, celestite, tourmaline moldavite, and so many more. In addition to selling crystals, but they also have stone jewelry and crystal singing bowls. People use singing bowls to promote relaxation; each bowl carries a certain note that vibrates through it when played. The vibrations help align energies within the human body. Sound baths - a meditative experience using sound therapy by \"bathing\" someone with different sound waves - often utilize these instruments. What is Crystal Healing? Crystal healing is a holistic therapy that involves using and placing crystals on or around a person to help unblock and/or direct energies. In an energy-based system, like our bodies, our energies can become dormant, unbalanced, and/or blocked; therefore, the practice of crystal healing involves using a crystal to extract and redirect the energies. Each crystal contains its own type of energies and properties. For example, amethyst, a crystal known as a protective stone, also contains healing properties known to relieve stress and anger. Examples of crystals used in crystal healing include cut crystals, tumble stones, and raw crystals. Crystal healing can be done by crystal healers or by oneself, preferably in a quiet space. This natural therapy is known to bring deep relaxation, ease tense muscles, enhance self-esteem, and bring forth clarity. I Love Crystals' Goals and Outlook For Hawk and Imel, I Love Crystals has never been a business just about making money. \"We have such a love for the crystals, and I feel like people feel it when they come into the store because we give our crystals a bath, and we welcome them into the store,\" she said. \"We feel like they're kind of our little pets, and they're going to find their forever homes. The endgame for us is to help others find the perfect crystal(s) that will help them with their healing needs.\" #GetinMotion with I Love Crystals Lacey Hawk and Imel Kurtis' passion for their crystal business is crystal clear; they want to help others on their crystal journey!
