On Wednesday, March 22, the DukeCenter for Integrative Medicine (DCIM) will sponsor an Integrative Health Fair. This fair is being offered in conjunction with the fourth-year medical student capstone course, but it is open from noon to 1 p.m. in the SearleCenter to the entire Duke community. \"There are many steps on a path to more patient-centered doctoring,\" said Dr. Sam Moon, DCIM director of education. \"One piece of patient-centeredness is understanding peoples' health-seeking impulses and behaviors, such as seeking care from complementary health practitioners. This fair is not advocating any specific therapy, but promoting a process of inquiry and dialogue in hopes that these soon-to-be doctors can better help their future patients.\" Practitioners will represent alternate medical systems such as traditional Chinese medicine and ayurveda, and mind-body interventions such as meditation and hypnosis. Practitioners of manipulative and body-based methods including yoga, massage, chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation, feldenkreis and the Alexander Technique will be present to explain and in some cases demonstrate their modality. Biologically based therapies (nutrition, botanicals and supplements) and energy therapies (Reiki, Tai Chi/QiGong and Therapeutic Touch) will also be represented. "}
