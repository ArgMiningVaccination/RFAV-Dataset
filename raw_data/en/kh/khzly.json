Are there side effects during or after an energy healing session? When I first began using energy healing many years ago, I was not aware that there could be energy healing side effects (aka: healing crisis, herx reaction, herxeimer reaction, die off, cleansing crisis, etc). They are not normally severe enough to be incapacitating or anything. But, some experience minor side effects during and after energy healing sessions. In some cases where deep healing is taking place, there may be some minor side effects that are noticed, especially if you are sensitive to noticing things that are different in your body & surroundings. Some energy healing sessions might leave you feeling a little lethargic, ready for a nap. As energy correction takes place and the negative energy frequencies are being release, the body's energy system is disrupted and the and the body is realigning into a new energy frequency that is different. With the method I use, an energetic filter/shield can be placed on the energy correction (healing) code in order to offset some or all of the energy healing crisis, healing reaction or clearing reaction. At the end of a session, I test if it is needed and to what extent (example: 57% filter/shield and by intention add this information to the energy correction code. As an personal example, during a self session or running a session for someone else (since I act as a surrogate when working with others), I normally experience a shiver, a swirl of energy run up my body out of the top of my head, a yawn, fatigue (especially with an emotionally severe issue), a dizzy feeling for a moment or two, itching on my face or hands that is short lived when releasing something usually of non-physical or emotional nature, usually while releasing a trauma or specific event. In some more extensive deep sessions, I have actually began crying uncontrollably, however, it lasts a few moments as if I am releasing something emotionally painful and then it stops as suddenly as it began. Usually this is only for maybe 10-15 seconds and has only lasted maybe 30 seconds a few times over the years. In a few cases, I have actually felt an emotion such as deep loss/grief during this type of release and then it dissipates just as quickly as well. And, then all of a sudden I feel a tremendous relief and even feel like smiling or laughing. I usually know when the release is complete because I take a deep breath without realizing it intentionally and feel \"done\". It's pretty cool to be able to release stuff in such a quick & beneficial manner. Side effects are usually minimal and can be viewed as your body's way of expressing the release of something negative as it begins to heal. The most common side effects reported to me during and after their energy healing sessions include (not limited to): vivid dreams, dreams of healing or resolution of emotional or physical issue, dreams of healing a specific relationship or past love trauma, the sensation of heat, nausea, dizziness, sleepy, numb, tingling, emotional release and brief anger, laughter and so forth. Keep in mind, this is just your body's way of releasing old energy frequencies and patterns in order to find true sustainable healing. Any time you make significant changes in your self healing, there will be side effects no matter what method you choose, even if you only change your diet - it is not harmful - it is possible to experience these symptoms in phases for a few days to a week, or not at all. Some of the side effects that might be considered \"negative\" that could show up with energy healing that I am aware of are: - Yawning - Flatulence - Burping - Itching - Feeling a need to stretch your body - Irritable - Fatigue - Dizzy - Nausea - Coughing - Sneezing - Mood swings - Crying/laughing - Dreams - Chills/warmth - Tingling - Sleepy - Diarrhea - Memories - Energetic release Some of the side effects that could be considered positive associated with energy healing that I am aware of are: - Less anxiety, more calm - Healing trauma of sexual assault/rape - Better sleep - Deeper meditation - Being more present - More energy - Rapid release of trauma - Lifting depression - Raise spiritual consciousness/awareness - More self esteem/confidence - More Joy & laughter - More money/prosperity & success - Generational issues - Releasing intentions that block healing - Better relationship/relationship healing - More ease/less resistance - Dosage change in RX, supplements, etc. - Better sex/more intimacy/orgasm - Weight loss/weight gain - Clear head/less brain fog (usually toxin related) - Better memory - Better eye sight - Feeling balance/harmony/calm - Being able to speak up for self/others - Reversal of dis-ease symptoms - Change in physical medical testing results & HRV - Better intuition - Inner peace - Healthier body - Less pain - Forgiveness - Long standing emotional turmoil & heartache healing - Inner peace/preparing to die - Grief release - Less rage/anger - Relationship loss/breakup healing - Overcoming addictions - Healing fear of public (agoraphobia) - Symptoms of PTSD healing - And, much more In some cases, you might notice a shift or effect during your energy healing session. In some cases you might notice side effects or shifts in days & weeks following your energy healing session. Normally, the most intense effects are noticed within a day or two at most. What should I do after an Energy Healing session? I normally recommend drinking plenty of water to keep the body hydrated & flush out any toxins being released. I also recommend some rest if you are able to after your session. A short nap if time permits is great. Even a short meditation can be beneficial. If you are in a very toxic state (physically and emotionally) especially at the beginning, your body may feel a little lethargic for a few days after your initial session. You may notice a little emotional upheaval for a day or two as non-physical portion of your healing is being released such as emotions and old patterns. It can last moments or off and on throughout your day. Try to relax, and take a moment to reflect if you can and let it release without judgement. In most cases, you will quickly notice the \"clouds being lifted\" so to speak. I have found that this normally lessens as work progresses and healing takes place. I always recommend that you honor yourself & intuition and listen to what your body is telling you. Energy healing/energy medicine (aka: energy correction) can be a tremendous addition to other forms of healing and can enhance the effects of other healing work, holistic or traditional. Some forms of energy medicine, can significantly reduce or completely remove the negative side effects of necessary medications and treatments such as chemo therapy if that is the route you choose for healing.
