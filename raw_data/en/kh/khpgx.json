About Essential Oils Essential oils have been used for therapeutic purposes for over 6,000 years. Many cultures used them in cosmetics, perfumes, and drugs. Essential oils were also commonly used for spiritual, therapeutic, hygienic, and ritualistic purposes. More recently, Ren\u00e9-Maurice Gattefoss\u00e9, a French chemist, discovered the healing properties of lavender oil when he applied it to a burn on his hand caused by an explosion in his laboratory. He then started to analyze the chemical properties of essential oils and how they were used to treat burns, skin infections, gangrene, and wounds in soldiers during World War I. In 1928, Gattefoss\u00e9 founded the science of aromatherapy. By the 1950s, massage therapists, nurses, physiotherapists, doctors, and other health care providers began using aromatherapy to heal people. Over the last 40 years, Aromatherapy has started to gain popularity in the US. Today, many lotions, candles, and beauty products are sold as \"aromatherapy\" products. However, many of these products contain synthetic fragrances. These types of products do not have the same properties as essential oils.
