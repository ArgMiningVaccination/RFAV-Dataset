It changes brain chemistry and can have a wide range of benefits, including enhanced cognitive abilities. Adderall is also addictive and can lead to many adverse effects when used beyond the supervision of a medical professional and is therefore a controlled substance. Also known as cognitive enhancers or smart drugs, nootropics are products that can provide you a broad array of brain health benefits, such as more mental energy, sharper focus and better memory. There are three core types of nootropics: prescription drugs, synthetic compounds and dietary supplements. Adderall and Ritalin are examples of nootropics that are prescription drugs. Racetams are an example of synthetic compounds that are nootropics and currently legal in the U.S. although illegal in many other countries. [Natural Adderall alternatives](https://supplementsjar.com/noocube-adderall) are examples of nootropics that are dietary supplements. Adderall over the counter is our focus here as it provides many of the brain health benefits associated with the stimulant medication, but it is non-addictive. It also does not have the same side effects, can be used without medical supervision and can be combined with many other types of supplements.

[Performance Lab Mind](https://supplementsjar.com/performancelabmind)\u2014 Best Choice for Overcoming and Avoiding Brain Fog #1. NooCube \u2014 Best Overall OTC Adderall Alternative (Editors' Choice) [NooCube](https://supplementsjar.com/noocube-adderall) is the number one brain productivity supplement on the market both in our opinion based on the research we have performed but also in terms of total sales and customer satisfaction rates. It is developed by Wolfson Brands, which is among the most trusted supplement companies in the industry. This is a potent Adderall substitute because it is a well-rounded supplement that is designed to provide you cognitive enhancement throughout the day but also improved brain health over the long term. Ingredients: - Alpha GPC - Bacopa Monnieri L-Theanine L-Tyrosine - 2020 - Oat Straw - Pterostilbene - Resveratrol 99% - Vitamin B1, B7 and B12 The most notable ingredient that makes NooCube the best Adderall alternative is Lutemax 2020. This is an award-winning product that provides you high levels of macular carotenoids, which were difficult to get in this quantity prior to this proprietary extraction method. These compounds help to combat the oxidative stress from blue light and improve attention, focus, sleep patterns and more. Bacopa monnieri is packed with bacosides, which improve the function of receptors that are integral in processing difficult information. Huperzia serrata slows cognitive decline and improves memory and other brain functions. L-tyrosine is an amino acid that supports dopamine thereby lowering stress levels, and all of the other ingredients play ancillary roles, such as boosting energy levels. Note that this product does use a meat-based capsule and is thus not appropriate for vegans and vegetarians. Pros: - No caffeine - Money-back guarantee - High customer satisfaction rates Cons: - Gelatin capsule Expected Results The near-immediate effects that you should experience include razor-sharp focus and enhanced problem-solving skills. Over time, you will experience lowered stress levels and better sleep and notice increased motivation along with enhanced short-term memory and improved long-term memory. Usage NooCube is a natural Adderall replacement that is designed to be used on a daily basis and in an ongoing manner. The directions advise taken two capsules daily with breakfast. You can increase dosage to three or four capsules daily for increased short-term effects. Do not exceed four capsules daily. You do not need an increased dosage for the long-term effects. Those should begin to manifest in four to six weeks, and most people will experience the full effects within three months of regular use. Pricing, Shipping and Refunds The standard price is $60 per bottle with fast and free shipping. You can lower the per-bottle price to $40 with a three-month supply and to $30 with a six-month supply. Bulk purchases also include a couple of e-books as a free gift. Wolfson Brands offers a 60-day 100% money-back guarantee. You have to return the used and unused portion of the order but will receive a full refund. Conclusion NooCube is the most popular nootropic supplement on the market. It is the finest Adderall replacement available and a top choice among people who choose to manage their ADHD without medicine. It is also helpful for those users in that you can take up to four capsules and even split up the dosage throughout the day. It does get pricey if you need two bottles a month, so we highly recommend bulk purchases.

Mind Lab Pro \u2014 Universal Nootropic for Clarity, Focus and Energy [Mind Lab Pro ](https://supplementsjar.com/mindlabpro) has not been on the market as long as NooCube but has quickly established itself as a top nootropic in general and one of the best Adderall alternatives. What it does particularly well is boost your energy levels and heighten clarity and focus within a short period of taking it. Most users are able to maintain those increased levels of performance throughout their work/school days. This product also receives points for using a plant-based capsule and thus being suitable for vegans and vegetarians, but it remains unclear if Mind Lab Pro is able to deliver the long-term benefits that NooCube does. Ingredients - Bacopa Monnieri - Citicoline - L-Theanine - L-Tyrosine - Lion's - Maritime Pine Bark - Phosphatidylserine - Rhodiola rosea - Vitamin B6, B9 and B12 You may notice some similarities between this product and NooCube, which has a lot to do with these ingredients being common among generic natural OTC Adderall alternatives. A key ingredient here is lion's mane, which is a mushroom that has long been used in traditional medicine. It is essential to how fast this product works and to balancing your mood and providing other benefits. It may also be integral to the long-term benefits, but this product will need to be on the market longer before that is evident. Pros: - Fast acting - Plant-based capsule - Money-back guarantee Cons: - Pricier than NooCube Expected Results This natural Adderall substitute really stands out in how fast it works. That has quickly made it one of the most popular natural Adderall alternatives for students. It has now sold more than 1 million bottles at the time of this writing. By about the fourth week, you should notice that those fast results are intensified. It is less clear what you should expect at the third-month mark and beyond. Usage The directions advise taking two capsules daily. When you take them is really up to you. Take them before class or a workout, but we do recommend a routine to make it less likely you miss a dose. As with NooCube, you can increase your dose to three capsules and then three, and depending on how your schedule is, it may make sense to take two capsules at different points in the day. Pricing, Shipping and Refunds Mind Lab Pro costs $69 a bottle, and shipping is an added charge. You can reduce your per-bottle price to about $52 and get shipping included by purchasing a four-month supply, but any way you cut it, NooCube is the better deal from a purely financial perspective. Mind Lab Pro also gives you a 100% money-back guarantee, but it only gives you 30 days to make that decision. Conclusion There is a lot we like about Mind Lab Pro, including the short-term benefits and how you get the full effects in just 20-30 minutes. But there are some downsides as we have mentioned, and the brand will need to make adjustments on that front before this product really threatens NooCube for the top spot. [Achieve fast and enhanced clarity and focus at a special price by clicking here!](https://supplementsjar.com/mindlabpro) #3. Brain Pill \u2014 Top Adderall Alternative for Memory and Learning When it comes to natural OTC Adderall alternatives for seniors and students, [Brain Pill is among our favorite](https://supplementsjar.com/brainpill) products. It is also notable because it has undergone more clinical studies than any related products we have reviewed. Most products are based on clinically reviewed ingredients as is the case with NooCube and Lutemax 2020. But Brain Pill has been clinically trialed as a complete product, which is not usual. It has also received a great deal of attention because it is endorsed by Dr. Dave David, and he has promoted the product in a number of high-profile spots on channels like CNN, FOX and ABC. Ingredients - Bacopa Monnieri - Citicoline - DHA Complex - Gingko A - L-Theanine Vitamin B5, B6, B9, B12 Again, with these ingredients, you may notice some similarities with the other top natural OTC Adderall substitutes that we have reviewed thus far. One of the ingredients that distinguishes Brain Pill is PS or phosphatidylserine, which is a fatty substance that not only helps to protect brain cells but is integral in the communication that takes place between them. [Studies have shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4258547/) , including the Brain Pill trials, that high levels of PS allow people to make difficult decisions much faster than otherwise. Pros: - No caffeine - Clinically trialed - Money-back guarantee - Recommended by doctors Cons: - Gelatin-based capsule Expected Results Brain pill may be the most ambitious natural OTC Adderall replacement to make our list as it contains more than a dozen distinct nootropics that have all been chosen for different brain health effects. The official website is a great place to start if you would like a more complete understanding of all that this product seeks to achieve, but the six most notable are dialed-in focus, stronger concentration, higher levels of mental alertness, improved mental performance, increased brain stamina and enhanced overall cognitive function. Usage The directions advise taken one capsule in the morning with water and a second capsule in the afternoon with water as well. Take each capsule at least 15 minutes prior to a meal. You can over time increase the dosage to three or even four capsules, but never exceed four in a 24-hour period. According to the manufacturer, Brain Pill is a bit different than other nootropics in that it may not provide immediate benefits when used short term and recommends using it for no less than 30 days. Pricing, Shipping and Refunds Brain Pill is pricey at $70 a bottle and does not include free shipping. It is sold with a 60-day 100% money-back guarantee. You can reduce the per-bottle price by purchasing two or more bottles at a time. But shipping is not included unless you opt for a six-month supply. That still only reduces the per-bottle price to about $59. Conclusion We are often asked why clinical trials are not more common for dietary supplements, and the reason is reflected in the price tag. All of the marketing that the company does factors in as well. This is an excellent product, but the sticker price may push it outside the budget of the average consumer. [Try the brain booster that Dr. Dave David endorses at a special online price!](https://supplementsjar.com/brainpill) #4. Performance Lab Mind \u2014 Best Choice for Overcoming and Avoiding Brain Fog Performance Lab refers to the product line. Mind refers to the specific product. For those unfamiliar with it, Performance Lab is a brand that offers customers a wide range of dietary supplements that can be combined without a great deal of effort on the part of the user. For the purposes of this review, we assessed [Performance Lab Mind](https://supplementsjar.com/performancelabmind) as a standalone product, and we found it to be an excellent option for dealing with brain fog. That includes the brain fog common among those on a keto diet. Ingredients - Citicoline - L-Tyrosine - Maritime Pine Bark - Phosphatidylserine If you have been reading through the reviews for these Adderall replacements thus far, then you will find these ingredients familiar. You will also notice that this ingredient list is rather minimalistic. That is due to the stacking concept behind the brand, and it is an approach that both works for and against the product depending on your perspective. Through the other products Performance Lab offers, you can easily add a vitamin complex, an energy boosting mix and so forth. Pros: - Plant-based capsule - Money-back guarantee - Convenient stacking options Cons: - None Expected Results Performance Lab Mind is the best alternative to Adderall for brain fog. It is also an excellent option if you want a nootropic that you can take on occasion. Many nootropics are at their best when they are taken over an extended period. Mind works well like that too, but if you are a person who does not want to take a nootropic daily, this product is worth your consideration. You can take it in advance of a day you know is going to be tough or take it after a rough day before you head out for an evening of fun. Usage This product is simple as you only need to take one capsule a day and you can take it whenever it best suits your lifestyle. You can take up to two capsules daily but should not exceed two in 24 hours. Pricing, Shipping and Refunds The single bottle price is $69 and shipping is not free. Shipping is included with a two-month supply but that does not lower the per-bottle price. For a discount, you need to opt for a four-month supply, which reduces the per-bottle price to about $52. The product is sold with a 30-day 100% money-back guarantee. Conclusion Performance Labs Mind is a strong product that may be undermined with some customers due to the emphasis on stacking. The monthly cost can rise quickly if you take that route. Still, this remains our favorite product for a nootropic that you take on occasion, but if you want a daily supplement, NooCube, Mind Lab Pro and Brain Pill are likely all better options for most. [Cut through the brain fog and ensure it never returns with Performance Lab Mind!](https://supplementsjar.com/performancelabmind) Additional Thoughts About the Best Adderall Alternatives The four products reviewed above are the top Adderall alternatives on the market according to our research. Verifiable customer satisfaction ratings are very high with each supplement. It is worth noting that it is rare for a nootropic not to work as can be the case with some supplements. The caffeine in coffee, for instance, affects everyone, but it affects everyone differently, and this is something to keep in mind when you try an Adderall alternative. Your experience may be different than the next person. In the sections to follow, we will dive deeper into Adderall, nootropics in general, synthetic compounds and so forth. We'll provide some advice that should prove helpful if you want to experiment with over-the-counter Adderall alternatives that are not on our list but which may work well for you. - Nootropics Nootropics are substances that can either be natural or synthetic that have a positive affect on mental skills to some degree. NooCube is a nootropic supplement that contains multiple natural nootropics, including L-theanine and L-tyrosine. Adderall is a nootropic medicine that contains a pair of synthetic nootropics. Science is still in the relative early stages of research into nootropics. Consider that drugs like Adderall were created in the [mid-1990s](https://recoverycentersofamerica.com/substance-guide/adderall/) and most research only dates back that far. Still, there is enough scientific evidence to know that nootropics work even if we do not completely understand the ins and outs. While Adderall was designed with ADHD patients in mind, it soon found a place among professionals and college students who were under a great deal of mental stress and benefitted from the usage. Of course, the beneficial aspects did not preclude the negatives, and [nootropic supplements](https://www.outlookindia.com/outlook-spotlight/best-nootropics-in-2023-top-3-strongest-smart-drugs-cognitive-enhancers-that-actually-work-news-281528) have really evolved in response to a demand for something much safer. - Adderall Adderall is a trade name for a combination drug made up of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Among people with ADHD, Adderall provides focus they may normally lack. It also reduces the hyperactivity and impulsive behaviors that otherwise undermine concentration. Adderall typically has similar effects on people who do not have ADHD. But since they are not overcoming challenges that an ADHD sufferer is and reaching a human baseline, they are enhanced. Enhanced brain power seems like something most of us could use, but there is a real dark side to Adderall usage. The drug is addictive and creates a dependency in many people. Your body can also develop a tolerance to the drug so that you need more of it, and these two problems exacerbate each other. Those who are addicted and have a tolerance are more likely to abuse it. High doses can result in an abnormal dopamine system and can result in nerve damage that cannot be undone. - Synthetic Compounds Synthetic compounds are manmade substances. Adderall is an example of a synthetic substance that is classified as a drug. Most synthetic nootropics are a drug. The issue is that the chemistry is evolving faster than the lawmakers can keep up. That means that there are synthetic compounds such as Piracetam that are legal in the U.S. even though some make the case that it should not be. Piracetam is a synthetic derivative of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid, which is often shortened to GABA. GABA is often found in natural OTC Adderall alternative vitamins in a natural form. Taking Piracetam can produce a more intense effect than taking natural [GABA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3970207/#:~:text=GABAergic%20inhibition%20is%20implicated%20in,excitatory%20in%20the%20developing%20brain.) . The problem is that scientists are not yet sure how Piracetam functions. It is also not known if it has serious long-term side effects. Therefore, people who take Piracetam instead of GABA may be seriously risking their health. - OTC Adderall Alternatives There are many nootropics found naturally in the foods you eat. The most famous of those is caffeine, and for centuries, people have drunk coffee for the mental benefits it provides, such as alertness. Natural OTC Adderall alternatives are dietary supplements that contain such nootropics in highly concentrated forms. These ingredients are perfectly safe to take in those amounts, but those are amounts that you would not easily be able to acquire if you had to eat plants to get them. Some people need Adderall to lead a happy and productive life. Most of us do not and are therefore far better off finding our ideal alternative to Adderall, which is natural and totally safe for us to take on a continued basis. The effects may never reach the extremes Adderall can deliver, but the results they do deliver are significant and beneficial, and many athletes and successful entrepreneurs swear by them. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is marked by a behavioral pattern that involves inattention, hyperactivity and/or impulsivity. We all experience such behaviors at times, but for someone with ADHD, those behaviors are so prevalent and consistent as to interfere with development and productivity. In cases involving inattention, the person often has difficulty remaining focused, staying organized and keeping to a particular task. Prior to ADHD being recognized, such behaviors could often be misconstrued as a lack of comprehension or even defiance. People who deal with hyperactivity are often restless and move constantly even in situations where it is socially unacceptable. Impulsivity often involves a lack of self-control or the desire for instant gratification. ADHD sufferers with such impulses may interrupt others or even make important decisions without considering the consequences. Managing ADHD Without Medicine Not everyone who has ADHD needs medication to manage it, and many people who choose this path do use a natural OTC Adderall replacement for [ADHD](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/facts.html) . Be mindful that we are not providing medical advice. Before you choose to stop using a medication or begin using Adderall over the counter, you should consult with your doctors. That said, there are many reports of people with ADHD greatly benefitting from these natural remedies while being able to leave behind the side effects that come with Adderall. It is also important to note that you generally cannot manage ADHD without medicine simply by taking a natural OTC Adderall alternative pill. Such pills help, but they are not magic pills. ADHD specialists advise that managing ADHD with or without medicine often begins with a nutrient-based diet. It is also recommended that you identify any food sensitivities and eliminate those foods from your diet. Vitamins should be taken regularly to cover any potential gaps in your diet. You should increase your intake of antioxidants, and perform a cleanse or detox two to four times a year. Consistent sleep in addition to more time outdoors is important, and behavioral therapy may be necessary. Benefits of Taking a Natural Adderall Alternative - Limiting cognitive decline - Better and more stable mood - Enhanced problem-solving skills - Improved focus and concentration - More motivation and higher energy levels - Improved short- and long-term memory recall There are many different benefits that you can derive from taking a nootropic. If you want to take a nootropic as a daily supplement in order to enjoy better mental health in general and stave off cognitive decline, then you will be hard pressed to find a better solution than [NooCube](https://supplementsjar.com/noocube-adderall) . It is not just the most effective Adderall alternative but the top nootropic product on the market. You may also have specific goals in mind. Some users want that boost in the morning that is better than caffeine without having to drink coffee. Others like to take it after work in order to recover mentally. Others still take it to avoid the brain fog that can arises from diet, sleepiness or stress. If you fit it into this category, you should write your goals down and prioritize them. With that information, you can then seek a product or specific ingredients that provide the particular benefits you want. Ideal Candidates for Nootropics Ideal candidates are typically adults who want to improve brain health in some way. This includes adults who take it for maintenance, university students and professionals who may be under significant mental stress and seniors who may be experiencing cognitive decline. The general rule for adults is that if you are relatively healthy, then you are a fine candidate for the [best natural OTC Adderall alternative pills.](https://www.outlookindia.com/outlook-spotlight/best-adderall-over-the-counter-alternatives-in-2023-top-natural-and-legal-otc-adderall-stimulants-for-focus-news-279578) If you have a medical condition or are taking medication on an extended basis, then you should consult with a medical professional before you proceed. If you are talking medication on a temporary basis, then you should at least wait for that period to end before you start. Dietary supplements are generally not recommended for children under the age of 18 because there is so little clinical research. This is not the case with nootropics. There is significant research, and they are widely considered to be safe. Nevertheless, it is best to consult with a doctor before giving a nootropic to a child. Usage and Side Effects When taking Adderall over the counter, always adhere to the label directions. Never exceed the maximum recommended dosage. If an upper dosage is suggested, never begin taking it right away but rather acclimate to it. If you up your dose from two to four capsules, for instance, that should happen over a period of no less than two weeks. In lieu of specific advice, always take your capsules with water and at least 15 minutes in advance of your meal if applicable. There are no known side effects with natural nootropics the way there are with drugs like Adderall. People who experience side effects do so due to a specific allergy. For instance, Huperzine A is commonly used in nootropics, and it is from plants to which some people are allergic. If you experience headaches, diarrhea, upset stomach, dizziness, racing heart or anything like that, stop taking the nootropic right away and do not resume taking it until you have consulted with your doctor. How to Choose an OTC Adderall Alternative The easiest way to begin taking Adderall over the counter is to choose one of the products that we have carefully screened. These products work and have many satisfied customers to show for it. If you want to experiment, vet the ingredients. Avoid any hidden ingredients or ingredients for which you cannot determine the benefit. We also suggest avoiding brands and products that are new. Give them some time and see how are they are widely received. Look for a money-back guarantee as well. It is usually an indication that the company stands behind its product, and it helps to limit your risk. OTC Adderall Alterative Pricing The average rate for a one-month supply for high-quality over-the-counter Adderall is $50, and that will increase to either $75 or $100 if you want to take a higher dose, which many Adderall alternatives support. Generally, at $50 or more, you should expect free shipping and certainly within the U.S. Our team strongly encourages anyone who wants to take a nootropic on a regular basis to take advantage of bulk discounts as it will significantly reduce your coasts. Consider our top choice NooCube. If you purchase a six-month supply, you are paying $1 to $2 a day as opposed to $2 to $4, which is a significant difference. We understand that you may be wary to do this on your first purchase, but the big and popular companies like NooCube include protection for that in their money-back guarantee. Let's say you buy the six-month supply and decide six weeks in that you do not like it, NooCube will refund the entire $180. Frequently Asked Questions 1. Does Adderall Require a Prescription? Yes. Adderall and all other similar products whether branded or generic are controlled substances in the U.S. and thus require a prescription from a licensed medical professional in order for you to purchase and possess them legally. 2. Can You Purchase Adderall Online? Yes. There is no federal law that bans the sale of Adderall and other prescription medications via the internet. Note that each state may have their own laws regarding online pharmacies so whether Adderall is available to you online will depend on your location. Be mindful that you still require a prescription for an online purchase of Adderall and that gray markets and other online vendors that may sell you Adderall and other medications without a prescription are very much illegal in the U.S. 3. Is There an Adderall Shortage? During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were reports of people who had an Adderall prescription that they could not get filled. While such incidents did occur, they were related to supply chain issues in general. As of this writing, there is no current or foreseeable shortage of Adderall or its generic alternatives. 4. How Does Adderall Differ From Ritalin? Adderall and Ritalin are the two most common stimulant medications prescribed to people with ADHD. Ritalin is the brand name for methylphenidate while Adderall is the brand name for the combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Both drugs work by stimulating the central nervous system and thus speeding upon brain activity. Ritalin takes effect quicker and reaches peak performance sooner. Adderall, on the other hand, remains active for four to six hours as opposed to two to three hours. Neither Adderall or Ritalin is better than the other. Some users respond better to the extended and more consistent experience that Adderall provides while others prefer Ritalin as it gives them more control over the symptoms of their condition and any side effects caused by the medication. 5. Do OTC Adderall Alternatives Require a Prescription? No. Over-the-counter Adderall alternatives are natural dietary supplements. Natural Adderall substitutes are made with ingredients that are not controlled substances and which are approved by the FDA for human consumption. 6. Can Anyone Take an Adderall Alternative? Adderall alternatives are suitable for most people, but there are some exceptions. As is the case with most dietary supplements, these products are not recommended for children under the age of 18 without consulting with a physician. Likewise, these products are not advised for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding without consulting with a physician. 7. Can You Take an Adderall Alternative With Other Supplements? Yes. Natural alternatives to Adderall are dietary supplements and may therefore be stacked with other dietary supplements. However, you should take precautions to ensure that you are not exceeding the safe limits for any particular ingredients. Do this by identifying the recommended daily values for you and by maintaining a combined ingredient list with total amounts based on all of the products that you are currently using. 8. Can You Take an Adderall Alternative With Medication? Dietary supplements are generally safe to take with medications and in some cases are even recommended by doctors. There are no known complications between Adderall substitutes and medications. That said, you should consult with your doctor and pharmacist prior to use. In most scenarios where there is a conflict, the medication usually neutralizes the supplement or interferes with absorption so your pharmacist may need to adjust your usage schedule in order to avoid that issue. 9. How Long Should It Take to Experience Results? There are both short-term and long-term benefits associated with taking natural alternatives to Adderall and other nootropics, so you should adjust your expectations based on that. With nootropics that boost short-term cognitive ability, you should experience the results anywhere from 20 to 90 minutes. As for benefits from nerve cells growing and the like, you should expect that to take four to six weeks. 10. Can You Enhance the Effects of a Nootropic? Nootropics generally do not require any support in order to be effective in the short term and over the long term. However, you can certainly support your brain health through a healthier lifestyle. Regular exercise, for instance, is proven to improve cognitive abilities. You should also balance your diet and work in ingredients that are natural nootropics, such turmeric, spinach, blueberries and so forth. Final Thoughts \u2014 Which Brand Should You Choose?
