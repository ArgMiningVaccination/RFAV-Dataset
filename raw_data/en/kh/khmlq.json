I'm not an expert on any of these is- sues so naturally I will tell you how things are. The process of legalizing doctors to aid in the deaths of their patients has brought forth strong emotions on both sides of the issue. Words such as \"killing,\" \"murder,\" \"torture,\" \"inhu- manity,\" and more have been used to bolster one position or the other. I believe most patients, if offered good palliation, would choose not to end their life. But, on the other hand, how do you effectively palliate conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis? To observe your body dying around you is not a death I would wish on anyone. The College's recent standards and guidelines on prescribing nar - cotics for chronic nonmalignant pain have raised the ire of a number of physician groups. Walking the line between reducing prescription drug abuse/deaths and alleviation of suf- fering is difficult indeed. However, in my over 20 years of clinical practice, I can count on one hand the number of patients for whom daily narcotic use for chronic nonmalignant pain improved quality of life.The ever-increasing use of medic - inal marijuana is also quite polar - izing. I have had a number of dying patients report that marijuana eased suffering and made their last days more comfortable. However, I now have patients using medicinal mari- juana for fatigue, insomnia, depres- sion, fibromyalgia, musculoskeletal discomfort, and more. These prescrip- tions didn't come from my hand, but none of my patients had any trouble obtaining them. I am troubled by the large number of people taking a cen- tral nervous system active substance with little scientific evidence to sup- port its use. Why bring up these controver - sies? The British Columbia Medical Journal is the perfect place for BC physicians to share their points of view on all topics.

Ministers of health, deputy ministers, and health bureaucrats across Canada embraced and imple- mented many of the BC proposals, in- cluding the following: \"The commis- sion recommends that the Ministry of Health and the BCMA give priority to the joint development of a program to limit the number of physicians.\" Their rationale was that doctors and patients were to blame for ris - ing costs and if we stopped treat- ing patients costs would fall. This assumption was based on now-dis- credited theories that failed to recog- nize that rationing leads to delayed care and that waiting costs more. The legacy of their actions was a short- age of doctors, as Canada dropped in the rankings of doctor supply to 26th in the world (when I started practice we were fourth). Commissioner and UBC economist Robert Evans had earlier written, \"A central cause of the problem was the oversupply of physi- cians, which tended to generate great - er utilization of services; there are too many doctors; and a supply-induced demand; a bed built was a (hospital) bed filled.\" His philosophies domi- nated the report. When reflecting on the frenzy and turmoil that consumed commu- nist China in the 1950s during Mao Tse-tung's Great Leap Forward, vol- unteers commented that what seemed completely normal at the time seemed like madness after the fact. I believe we will look back on our current health system with similar sentiments. More recent commissions have also been failures. The Romanow Commission endorsed the status quo. Senator Kirby's Commission made creative suggestions, such as patient- focused funding and a care guaran- tee. These would empower patients and limit the monopoly control of governments. The report of the BC Select Standing Committee on Health concluded, \"Your Committee recom- mends improved wait-list manage- ment not a health care guarantee.\" (Translation: let's study and manage wait lists, rather than fix them.) Other tax-funded experts en - dorsed this approach. They have dominated health policy in Canada. Jonathan Lomas, former executive director of the Canadian Health Ser - vices Research Foundation, made his views clear when stating, \"I think we have to be very careful about empow- ering the consumer because they will make choices that are not in their own health interest.\" Dr Charles Wright, former VP at Vancouver General Hospital, wait- list consultant to the BC Ministry of Health, Health Council of Canada member, and recipient of an $850 000 grant to study wait lists, stated, \"Ad- ministrators maintain waiting lists the way airlines overbook. As for urgent patients in pain, the public system will decide when their pain requires care. These are societal decisions. The individual is not able to decide rationally.\" Yet another expert, Dr Gordon Guyatt, a former NDP candidate, co- founder and leading spokesperson of Medical Reform Group (which later evolved into Canadian Doctors for Medicare), wrote: \". . . adverse health consequences among those waiting for care are few and far between. . . . It is likely that there are areas of Canada in which certain patients\u2014possibly those with cancer, heart disease\u2014wait too long. But the complexities of the wait-list issue suggest careful study and planning before we try to solve a problem that may be much smaller than we imagine.\" These examples reflect the arrogance of government- funded advisors and explain why input from patients and practising physicians has been discounted. Reform may come soon as patients gain their freedom after an objective and impartial evaluation of the facts and evidence by the courts. After an almost 8-year delay, our constitution- al trial begins this September. I fore- see that within 5 years following the judgment all patients in Canada will have rapid access as wait lists are dra- matically shortened. Medicare will be expanded to cover prescription drugs, physiotherapy, dentistry, prosthetics, etc. (areas now inexplicably excluded by arbitrarily designating them medi- cally unnecessary). Funding will come from the economic savings of short- ened waits and added revenues as wealthier Canadians are encouraged to contribute more than the less wealthy. In Canada, lower socioeconomic groups have the least coverage, poor - est access, and worst outcomes. Both Statistics Canada and independent study groups around the world have verified this. In 2010, Italian health law expert Giandeomenico Barcello- na, wrote, \"I am very fond of Canada, one of the best countries in the world, but this (Canada's health) system is tailor made just for very rich people, who can get medical care abroad.\" Change is on the way. In the hybrid system that evolves, the poor and eco- nomically deprived will benefit as wait lists disappear. The only advantage the rich will experience is their ability to access timely care in Canada. Govern- ments and citizens will enjoy the mas- sive economic benefits that result from reduced disability and work loss. Sadly, for some health policy ex- perts and economists, they will find that the end of wait lists will mean that their tax-funded grants to study them will likewise disappear. \u2014BD354 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgpersonal view Medicinal cannabis: Concern with College standard Medicinal cannabis presents a unique dilemma for physicians and regula- tory authorities because it represents an unapproved treatment with lim- ited good-quality research to inform guidelines that clarify specific age- related indications, dosage, or risks. In addition, many myths portray neg- ative effects, which results in a cul- ture of ill-informed lack of medical support. Despite these barriers phy- sicians have been designated as the gatekeepers of access to cannabis for medical purposes. On 5 May 2015 the College of Physicians and Sur - geons of British Columbia (CPSBC) published a standard entitled Mari - juana for Medical Purposes, to set out the professional requirements of physicians in BC who plan to support patients in the use of cannabis for medical purposes. Practitioners for Medicinal Can- nabis (PMC) is a nationwide network of specialists and general practition- ers among whom there is extensive clinical experience in the medicinal use of cannabis. PMC is committed to best possible patient care, includ- ing the informed use of cannabis and cannabis-derived products. As par - ticipants in PMC, we write as a group of physicians to share with readers of the BCMJ our concerns about some of the statements included in the CPSBC standard. We also offer access to an information resource and networking with PMC. PMC concerns First, we consider that the CPSBC standard fails to acknowledge or accommodate the unique and com - plex nature of cannabis, or how it is used for medical purposes. Cannabis is not a single therapeutic entity. The plant contains many different physi- ologically active compounds with a wide variety of potential therapeutic uses. Different strains possess a dif- ferent balance of components, spe- cifically in the balance of THC to CBD. In spite of the commonly held perception that cannabis is smoked, there are other safer, less stigmatized ways to prepare cannabis for thera- peutic applications. Effects of a par - ticular product on one clinical situ- ation cannot be assumed to apply to Continued on page 356Letters of less than 300 words are welcomed provided they do not contain material that has been submitted or published elsewhere; they may be edited for clarity and length.

Jack Chang, M.D. For 355 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgpresident's comment Better together. You will often hear me repeat these are two words when I'm communicat - ing with our members. Quite simply it means that when we are united as a profession and working together, we really can make a meaningful differ - ence. You have probably also seen the two words associated with our Doc- tors of BC logo (Better. Together.). That's because they form the foun- dation of the work we do with and for our members. Though to do this work, we need to know your thoughts on how we're meeting and addressing your needs\u2014where we are doing well and, even more importantly, how we can improve in the areas that are a pri- ority for you. To garner this information we conducted a comprehensive member survey earlier this year to measure engagement\u2014how we are engaging and interacting with you and how you are engaging and interacting with your health authorities. We also asked some overarching questions on your impressions of how we are doing as an association. We received a response rate of 20%, which is an excellent response for this kind of sur - vey and what now provides the basis for a statistically sound analysis. The almost 2500 responses were also demographically and geographically representative of the broader mem- bership. In general, most of our physician members feel we are doing a good job, but we can do better. We want to do a great job in serving and address- ing your needs. The majority of respondents said they are pleased with the work we do in representing you, consulting with you, and advocating for your issues with government. You identified three logue between facilities-based physi- cians and health authorities. This will help provide the opportunity for our physicians to not only have a stron- ger and legitimate voice, but to have a voice that is also authoritative. We now have 77 sites involved at various stages of development, with a target of having 50 of those sites approved for full operational funding by Janu- ary 2017. Whereas the MSAs will strengthen the physician voice and professional leadership in our prov- ince's facilities, the divisions of fam- ily practice are already providing a strong voice for family doctors work- ing in the community. The information we gathered through the Member Engagement Survey will help develop our 2017 3-year strategic plan. The data and re- sponses will be used by staff as they adapt and enhance our member pro- grams and services. I want to thank the many mem- bers who participated in the survey, and I encourage all members to speak up and provide your input, not just through our surveys, but continually. Doctors of BC is committed to providing the best professional value to you, and your input enables us to do just that. Your voice is important to me and to our association, so please don't hesitate to connect with me at president@doctorsofbc.ca and fol- low me, like many of your peers do, on social media via Twitter @awruddi man. \u2014Alan Ruddiman, MBBCh, BC Presidentkey of priority: negotiations, policy development to support mem- bers on ministry and health authority initiatives that impact you, and mem- ber consultation. Respondents further identified two additional key areas where you think we can do a better job. You told us that you want us to be more time - ly and proactive, and you want us to provide more ways to share and com- municate your views on issues that are important to you. The association commits to giving these areas high priority and attention as we move for - ward. We also asked members about how well they are engaging with their health authorities. Many of you feel your professional voice is not being heard at that level, nor do you have the opportunity for credible input into health authority decisions. You will find detailed information about this in the survey results available in the Members Area of the Doctors of BC website. Doctors of BC is com - municating these results to the health authorities and to government to help foster stronger and more positive pro- fessional relationships that benefit our patients, the health care system, and the profession. I can assure you that work is al- ready underway to address your areas of concern, especially with regard to health authority relation- ships. We have been and continue to support physicians to better engage with their health authorities through the creation of the medical staff as- sociations (MSAs), created by our most recent Physician Master Agree- ment. In many respects the MSAs will play a key role in helping to achieve these objectives by fostering two- way communication and open dia-How is Doctors of BC doing in meeting your needs? You told us and we are listening356 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgother products or clinical contexts, and each individual patient's response is unique. Second, we believe that the CPS- BC standard fails to recognize the sig- nificance and importance of existing scientific literature. In particular, this includes the enormous and grow- ing literature regarding the body's endocannabinoid system with which cannabis interacts. As many readers are aware, large-scale double-blind controlled trials are not the only resource that informs clinical know- ledge. There is a considerable body of sound evidence to support the use of cannabis for medical purposes that also confirms its relative safety, espe- cially compared with other agents. The CPSBC standard also fails to acknowledge appropriately the con- text of more questionable studies that underpin some of the well-established but misinformed myths around canna- bis. Given the complex nature of can- nabis, it is relevant to note that stud- ies that report on or make correlations between cannabis use and specific outcomes, but which don't also take into account or adequately address pertinent variables (THC/CBD con- tent, THC/CBD ratios, confounding factors such as cigarette smoking or personal view Continued from page 354 been attempted to assist the patient in the management of his/her medical condition and have not successfully helped the patient.\" We are concerned that this requirement does not duly respect a patient's personal autonomy and right to make decisions pertaining to his/her own health care. We recom- mend that the word \"attempted\" be replaced by \"considered.\" Fifth, we are concerned that the CPSBC standard, through its several requirements and restrictions on phy- sician behavior, creates a barrier to care for patients. In addition, the stan- dard does not put the physician's role or the College's responsibility into an appropriate societal context. Fed- eral courts have deemed use of can- nabis for approved medical purposes to be a Charter right, protected by the Constitution. The College's mandate of public protection through effective regulation of the medical profession includes protection of those disabled and seriously ill patients who benefit from the medical use of cannabis. The College standard presents consider - able challenges for a physician who wishes to provide the professional support that a patient needs in order to exercise his or her constitutional right. other drug use, pre-existing mental health issues, age, genetic factors, and recreational versus medicinal canna - bis use), cannot be replicated or con- firmed in a meaningful way. It is also questionable whether conclusions drawn about cannabis from studies of recreational users can be extrapolated to its use in a medical context. Third, we question the appropri- ateness of the College warnings to physicians who consider authorizing legal access to cannabis. The Col- lege's position presents an alarming perspective of a physician's risk in authorizing the use of cannabis; for example, \"may be the subject of accu- sations or suggestions of negligence, including liability if the use of mari- juana produces unforeseen or uniden- tified negative effects.\" This risk is not substantially different from that of prescribing any other substance or undertaking any medical procedure. Fourth, we take issue with the College's prerequisite that conven- tional therapies be attempted before cannabis. The College standard lists eight requirements for physicians. The first of these says the physician shall: \"Document that conventional therapies for the condition for which the authorization of marijuana for medical purposes was provided have pacific centre for reproductive medicine pacific fertility.ca IVF and Infertility Reproductive Genetics Fertility Preservation Prenatal Screening Oocyte Freezing Doctors: Caitlin Dunne Jon Havelock Jeffrey Roberts Ken Seethram Tim Rowe Victor Chow referrals@pacificfertility.ca 604.422.7276 357 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgBC Medical Journal Material: Aug 15, 2016 Insertion: FILENAME 2016-08-2331-MB-Aug-E-Class-Print_Ad-BCMJ .indd INTERNAL REVISION 3 TRAP AT FINAL OUTPUTCLIENT -- TRIM 6.625\" x 4.2\" CLIENT REVISION 2 CREATION DATE 05/06/16 BLEED -- OPERATOR RP REVISION DATE August 15, 2016 10:26 AM FOLD -.--\" x -.-- \" T: horsman@123w.ca SAFE -.-- \" APPROVALS SEEN APPROVED RESOLUTION 300dpi CREATIVE/DESIGNER -- FONTS -- COPYWRITER -- NOTES CREATIVE DIRECTOR -- ACCOUNT MM IT'S EVERYONE'S JOB TO PROOF.

Several members of our group have co-authored a summary of the relevant literature informing the use of cannabis in the care of such patients. Our intention is to provide a clinical perspective and a nuanced discussion to help physicians bal - ance potential risks against potential benefits when considering a trial of a cannabis-derived product for an indi- vidual patient.

The following physicians, in al- phabetical order, endorse the content of this letter. They are all participants in PMC. \u2014Donna Dryer, MD, MD \u2014Christine Singh, MD, CCFPCollege replies The College appreciates the op- portunity to respond to a letter re- garding its professional standard, Marijuana for Medical Purposes. According to the Health Professions Act (HPA), the role of the College is to establish, monitor, and enforce standards of practice to reduce in- competent, impaired, or unethical practice. The regulation of medical marijuana is an obligation that med- ical regulatory authorities across Canada have been reluctant to take on. The revisions to the Medical Marijuana Access Regulations es - sentially removed Health Canada from any oversight of the use of this substance. When the College's Ethics Com- mittee drafted the standard regarding medical use of marijuana, it reviewed the considerable experience of the state medical boards that have been regulating this aspect of practice for a while. Published and personal reports Continued on page 358358 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgemphasized the importance of docu- menting a professional interaction with the patient, which includes tak- ing a history, conducting an exami - nation, considering a differential or provisional diagnosis, formulating a treatment plan, and following the patient. It may seem unnecessary to remind physicians to act professional- ly in this regard, but multiple instanc- es of documents being signed with no or minimal patient interactions had been identified. The College did not want to have the entire profession dis- graced because of a few individuals exchanging their signature for a fee\u2014 and not much else. Turning to the specifics in the let - ter, the College standard is not a clini - cal practice guideline so it does not address how marijuana is used for medical purposes. The paucity of sci- entific evidence is acknowledged by the authors of the letter, and is noted on the Health Canada website as well as the College standard. The College doesn't evaluate studies, scientific or otherwise, in the context of ethical and professional standards. This is the purview and responsibility of subject matter experts who draft clinical prac- tice guidelines. With respect to the cautions in the standard, the College is reminding physicians that as a natural substance, marijuana use is not without potential harmful effects. Given the high rate of recreational use and the lack of legal access to marijuana, the lines between true medical use and convenience for recreational use are blurry. Even in jurisdictions that authorize medical use and lawful recreational use, recre- ational users may still seek out medi- cal authorization because it is cheaper. The College is encouraged that the federal government is moving to legalize recreational use of marijua - na. This will no doubt alleviate pres- sure on the existing medical access pathways. The foundation of the Col- lege's standard\u2014that medical mari -juana is a treatment decision based on a professional interaction with the patient, weighing the unique risks and benefits for each patient, and in the context of a longitudinal rela - tionship\u2014is to ensure good medical practice. Readers may wish to review the Federation of State Medical Boards' Model Guidelines for the Recommen- dation of Marijuana in Patient Care, adopted as policy in April 2016. Like the College standard, the guideline addresses similar important topics: the physician-patient relationship, pa- tient evaluation, informed and shared decision making, treatment agree- ments, qualifying conditions, ongoing monitoring and adapting treatment plans, consultation and referral, medi- cal records, and physician conflict of interest. The College hopes that continued research and the development of phar - maceutical cannabis-derived prod- ucts provided through traditional pre- scription/pharmacist dispensing will soon be reality. When recreational use of marijuana is legalized, taxed appropriately to increase revenues for the publically funded health care system, and sold responsibly through provincial agencies that have a solid track record of not selling alcohol to children, physicians will be able to perform their customary role where substance use is concerned: counsel - ing patients to moderate their con- sumption. \u2014Gerrard A.

For example, the author claims that \"patients who were cared for by their own GP had shorter hospital stays\" than those cared for by hos- pitalists.

There are clearly advantages to the traditional model of inpatient care provided by a patient's own GP. Good continuity of care is the most obvious example. I have great respect for the dedication of my GP colleagues who maintain busy community practices as well as hospital privileges.

Spiritual/religious issues are impor - tant for many of our patients, not just those facing end-of-life issues. A study of 2000 physicians published in 20071 indicated that most psychia- trists and nonpsychiatric physicians believe that religion/spirituality helps patients cope with and endure illness and suffering by offering a positive, hopeful state of mind and/or a com- munity that offers emotional or prac- tical support. Over the years I have recommended that medical students, psychiatry residents, and residents in other disciplines routinely ask patients about their spiritual beliefs and how they would like them to be addressed. Dr Bates included a copy of the FICA spiritual history tool in his article. I would highly recommend that the FICA be used routinely with patients, especially those who have chronic ill - ness and suffering. It could be used as a brief screening tool, similar to the CAGE questionnaire, which is com- monly used to screen for alcohol/ substance abuse. Over the years I have seen no negative effects from asking patients about spiritual issues. Instead, it usually improves rapport and contributes to a positive doctor- patient relationship. Patients can be referred to appropriate spiritual care resources as needed, but physicians should not neglect identifying impor - tant spiritual/religious issues that may be affecting a patient's well-being. \u2014Stephen D.

Re: Thoughts on professionalism In response to our president's \"Thoughts on professionalism\" in the June issue (BCMJ 2016;58:247), I would like to add comments per - taining to his third tenet of our pro- fession's longstanding tradition\u2014the value and merit of the social contract. This longstanding tradition of a historically great and independent profession predates this country's tiny historical anomaly of forced and unconstitutional social contracts\u2014a contract that is with the state rather than with the patient, contrary to our Hippocratic Oath. Forced because we have a single payer that has legislat- ed a monopoly, and because doctors must travel abroad to change their employers. Unconstitutional because it is a rationing monopoly, at least hurting patients in need. The issue has become far more concerning recently for patients and physicians alike because the topic of physician-assisted death now also raises the uncomfortable question of whether physicians have finally become de facto agents of the state in this country. Since professionalism is rather defined by skills, good judgment, and polite behavior that is expected from a person who is trained to do a job well, we should ask ourselves: where has our collective independence of thought and actions necessary to sup- port good judgment gone lately? And personal view Continued on page 3601/3 horizontal 6.625 2.75 Specializing in: Infertility IVF and r elated technologies and Ash St., Vancouv er FERTILITYWITHGRA CE.COM 360 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgwill our patients be better off for its apparent absence? Advocacy for our patients should be the real cornerstone of our profes- sion, and it requires independence. Fighting internal and external factors that degrade our ability to advocate and care for patients and reverting the erosion of our profession is the ulti- mate healing goal for the profession itself. This social contract that imposed itself slowly across several genera- tions, by misrepresenting the original aim of Tommy Douglas, can only be seen as a clumsy ideological vestige of the past. It interferes with our pri- mary commitment: our patients. Dr Ruddiman, what we are fortu- nate to have is not that social contract but a direct contract with our patients, and having had an opportunity to ac- quire an amazing education (rapidly paid back with income tax), lifesav- ing skills in a very rewarding profes- sion\u2014an old one indeed\u2014all these transcending ideology, generations, postal codes, and bureaucrats. That should be the foundation of our inde- pendence. Our problem is then that we, as a profession, no longer believe that we belong to a great independent profes- sion; rather, we subject ourselves to whatever master of the day is willing to pay us. Mercenaries, agents of the state, whatever you may want to call us, we are no longer the healers of the Hippocratic Oath. The legacy will not be excellent 21st-century medi- cal care and we will be remembered as enablers who replaced the Hippo - cratic Oath with an oath (little \"o\") to the state. And isn't that what we do not want to become! \u2014J.N. Mahy, MD, FRCSC, FACS Burnaby President replies Thank you, Dr Mahy, for sharing your thoughts on the milieu of medical pro- fessionalism. This is to be considered as each of us sets out every day to deliver the highest quality of care to all patients across British Columbia. While I agree that physicians would gladly embrace greater independence within our health care system, it is not necessarily the cornerstone with which to effectively advocate on behalf of our patients. Every day, indi- vidually and collectively, we as a pro- fession effectively advocate on behalf of our patients, both for their needs and those of our health care system. Doctors of BC is now enhancing this advocacy on behalf of the profession with the development of medical staff associations all across our province to support and grow physician lead- ership, our influence, indeed our very independence. \u2014Alan Ruddiman, MBBCh, Dip PEMP, FRRMS President, Doctors of BC Safe prescribing (1) I and every doctor in British Colum- bia received the new College of Phy- sicians and Surgeons of BC profes- sional standards on safe prescribing last week to address the public health emergency related to opioid overdos- es. This is a new professional standard to assist physicians with the challeng- ing task of prescribing opioids, ben- zodiazepines, and other medications. This was adopted to \"direct appropri- ate prescribing of potentially harmful drugs,\" and \"these professional stan- dards are not discretionary and must be adhered to.\" We are all directed to document discussions with our patients about the benefit of pharma- cologic and non-opioid therapies for the treatment of chronic pain. The College accepts aggressive pharmacotherapy in the context of active cancer, palliative, and end-of- life care. But it frowns on continuing to prescribe opioids to patients with chronic noncancer pain who, usu- ally, after everything else has been tried and failed, need narcotics as an add-on or replacement (usually due to adverse events) for other modes of treatment. We are to advise our patients that long-term opioid therapy is not indi- cated for certain medical conditions, including headaches, headache disor - ders, and axial low back pain, but if we are at the point of prescribing opi- oids to a patient in chronic pain then usually everything else has failed. I have patients with chronic head- aches where neurologists have pre- scribed narcotics because nothing else works. I have patients who have had benzodiazepines added to their narcotic regimen by neurologists and pain clinics so that they can get some sleep. Patients who are nonsurgical candidates for chronic back pain often suffer until opioids are prescribed. When did it become gospel that patients with a history of addictions or those with psychiatric illness or young people, whoever that applies to, can't suffer severe pain? I attended a medical conference years ago when a well-respected clinical pharmacolo- gist asked, \"Would you rather have a patient in chronic pain suffer, be bedridden, and/or housebound, and not be on narcotics, or be adequately treated and be a productive member of society working, enjoying his/her quality of life, and paying taxes, albeit needing narcotics to do so?\" I thought about what he said and changed my whole attitude on treating chronic noncancer pain and have never regret- ted it. Yes, patients become dependent on narcotics, but there is a difference between dependence and addiction. We have patients who are dependent on antihypertensive medications, on thyroid medications, on diabetic med- ications, and the list goes on. We also have patients dependent on narcotics and if that's what it takes for them to have some quality of life and function normally, or as close to normally as possible, then I am all in favor of pre- scribing narcotics. I have no problems with the Col-personal view Continued from page 359361 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orglege's new standards, but what do they recommend I treat my chronic pain patients with? Many cannot tol- erate nonsteroidal antiinflammato- ry drugs (NSAIDs). (It is said more people die from NSAIDS in Canada than all of the traffic accidents com - bined.) NSAIDS are contraindicated in so many situations\u2014chronic kid - ney disease, heart problems, gastro- intestinal bleeds, etc. Tylenol is min- imally effective, if at all, in patients with anything more than mild pain, especially in the geriatric population. We send our difficult patients to pain clinics, and after a prolonged wait for usually minimal benefit, rare- ly, if ever, do they suggest to taper or stop opioids. Studies have shown it to be safe to drive, etc., in those with steady-state narcotic administration. I will gladly stop prescribing opioids for chronic pain, but tell me what should I pre- scribe? My prescribing habits can easily be monitored through PharmaNet and the duplicate prescription program. Those who are prescribing out of range can be audited and disciplined if they can't justify their prescribing, but leave the rest of us alone to care as best we can for our patients in pain. Not all patients are con artists or junkies. Not all doctors are inappro- priate prescribers. We care about our patients and hate to see them suffer but our options are limited. I have yet to have a specialist in pain, surgery, physiatry, internal med- icine, etc., suggest I stop narcotic pre- scribing for appropriate indications, and I have been practising for a long time. Give me readily accessible, work- able alternatives to narcotics when all else fails or leave me alone! \u2014Stephen M. Shore, MD, CCFP Langley College replies (1) The College fully appreciates the dif- ficulty in treating patients with medi-cal conditions or symptomatology for which an effective treatment cannot be found, or for which the patient is unable to pay. Safe Prescribing of Drugs with Potential for Misuse/Diversion was developed over the past year because the previous document, entitled Pre- scribing Principles, failed to prevent an increasing toll of prescription drug misuse and overdose deaths in this province. Additionally, clinical guidelines developed by NOUGG in 2010, an initiative sponsored by this and other Canadian medical regula- tory authorities, have also apparently not been effective in preventing the increasing reliance of prescribers on long-term opioid treatment for chron- ic noncancer pain. There is an excellent summary of the current medical evidence and expert opinion in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Guidelines for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. The conclusion of the experts is that opioid treatment for chronic pain provides small to mod- erate short-term benefits, uncertain long-term benefits, and potential for serious harm. While there is limited evidence of the long-term benefits of non-opioid therapies, the risk of harm is clearly far less and thus they should be con- sidered preferred treatments. Non- pharmacologic therapies can include exercise and physical therapies as well as psychological therapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Not all of these approaches have to be in the context of multidisciplinary programs, which many patients are unable to afford. The College's statutory mandate is public protection, and the purpose of this professional standard is to reduce inappropriate prescribing of certain classes of medications. The College cannot address all of the societal problems that make the treatment of patients with chronic noncancer pain so challenging; however, it can try to reduce the additional harm that is caused by unsafe pharmacotherapy. \u2014Gerrard A. Vaughan, MD President, College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia \u2014Heidi M. Oetter, MD Registrar and CEO, College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia Safe prescribing (2) In an unprecedented move, the Col- lege of Physicians and Surgeons of BC (CPSBC) introduced the profes- sional standards and guidelines Safe Prescribing of Drugs with Potential for Misuse/Diversion as a legally enforceable policy on 1 June 2016. The standard extends the US Cent ers for Disease Control and Pre- vention's (CDC) Guideline for Pre- scribing Opioids for Chronic Pain to include stimulants and sedatives. The CPSBC gave no reasons for rejecting the evidence-based Cana- dian Guideline for Safe and Effec - tive Use of Opioids for Chronic Non- Cancer Pain or adopting the CDC guideline as a standard. The CPSBC did not consult the Pain Medicine Physicians of BC Society (PMPoBC) or Pain BC, the key organizations representing physi- cians with focused pain practices and the one in five British Columbians liv- ing with persistent pain. The PMPoBC wants to minimize harm from drugs we prescribe. How- ever, we are very concerned that en - forcing the standard will diminish quality of life in the majority of pa- tients who do not misuse, divert, or become addicted to opioids, sedative, or stimulants. The CPSBC appears to accept this consequence. The PMPoBC is very concerned that, given the lack of access to interdisciplinary pain clinics and community-based physical and psy- chological therapies, some patients will seek illicit drugs to relieve their conditions which will further escalate personal view Continued on page 362362 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgthe current public health emergency. We also hope that physicians do not withdraw from managing persistent pain because of mandated restrictions to their practices. The PMPoBC has written to the CPSBC seeking clarification of many statements in the standard, including those mandating maximum daily doses of opioid and prohibiting trials of opi- oids in certain conditions, including many psychiatric disorders. We have offered to help the CPSBC revise their standard. We await their response. \u2014Owen D Williamson, MBBC, FRSCS, FFPMANZCA President, Pain Medicine Physicians of BC Society College replies (2) The development of this or any other professional standard is not \"unprec- edented.\" The College has a statutory obligation to set standards for medical practice, and most elements contained in the standard on safe prescribing have appeared in successive versions developed by the College's Prescrip- tion Review Program entitled Pre - scribing Principles. The College has been using the prescribing principles in its work with registrants for more than 3 years. Hundreds of BC physi- cians have successfully operational- ized them in their practices\u2014by that measure, they are extensively field tested in real-life clinical settings. With respect to strong opioids for chronic noncancer pain, succes- sive, authoritative systematic reviews by Furlan,1 Ballantyne,2 Chou,3 and colleagues suggest that, on average, there is weak evidence of modest relief of pain for a period of weeks or a few months, with minimal func- tional improvement, not superior to naproxen or nortriptyline. Dr Chou's recent paper in the Annals of Internal Medicine documents accumulating epidemiological evidence of harms, including addiction and death. This is not to say that some patients do not benefit from long-term opioid thera- py, only that the benefit is very mod- est, the risks significant, and the evi- dence tentative, despite over 20 years of escalating prescribing. While the College participates in a consultative process during the development of professional stan- dards, it cannot and must not abrogate its legal obligation to regulate medi- cal practice, including prescribing. Regulation is foundational, and the advice in the standard is deliberately formulated in general terms, allowing flexibility for bedside clinical judg- ment. Nothing in the standard prohib- its or even materially interferes with the ability of pain specialists or other physicians to safely and effectively care for their patients. The College shares concerns that services for patients who suffer from chronic pain are often difficult to access or navigate. Solutions to that are beyond the mandate of the regula- tor. What is within the College's man- date is the ability to investigate any report of physicians misapplying the standard to the detriment of patients. \u2014Gerrard A.

We believe that the release of this document reflects a striking failure of due diligence, and a major misstep in the College's fidu- ciary duty to guard public safety. By codifying so many complex clinical decisions as standards instead of guidelines, the College has intrud - ed into the doctor-patient relationship in an unprecedented fashion. Limit- ing opioid dosing to an absolute, no- exceptions maximum of 90 mg of mor - phine equivalent per day is one such example. In clinical practice, patients' requirements, physiologies, condi - tions, and options/alternatives are often highly divergent. Protection for patients on stable, responsible, endur - ing, and successful opioid treatment regimens that happen to be in excess of this arbitrary figure\u2014and there are many\u2014is lacking in this document. That the College does not explic - itly make an exception for active can- cer, palliative, and end-of-life patients is an unconscionable oversight that requires formal revision immediately. Our biggest concern is the Col- lege's failure to account for the welfare of the many British Columbians suf- fering from chronic mental illness. The idea that someone who needs a benzo- diazepine for treatment of a complex sleep disorder, or a psychostimulant for severe ADHD, now does not have the option of receiving basic ongo- ing opioid pain control medication if needed\u2014unlike every other patient in the province\u2014is frankly discrimina- tory. By failing to clearly define \"seda- tives,\" \"stimulants,\" and \"psychoac- tive medications,\" and by painting such treatments with the same brush used for Schedule I drugs, the College further stigmatizes the mentally ill. personal view Continued from page 361363 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgThe Section of Psychiatry is ex- tremely supportive of well-consid- ered and effective strategies and ini- tiatives that aim to reduce the risk of harm to the public. This document, clearly produced without meaningful input from psychiatrists, will leave physicians in certain cases facing the dilemma of either disregarding stan- dards published by their regulatory body, or compromising patient care. We object. \u2014Steve Wiseman, MD Chair, Economics Committee, BC Psychiatric Association \u2014Carol-Ann Saari, MD President, BC Psychiatric Association College replies (3) Safe Prescribing of Drugs with Poten- tial for Misuse/Diversion was devel- oped over the past year as an evolu- tion to a previous document entitled Prescribing Principles, which failed to prevent an increasing toll of pre- scription drug misuse and overdose deaths in this province. The deci- sion to reframe what is essentially the same advice as a standard rather than a guideline was based on what the College saw as a need to provide more authoritative direction to the profession in the context of Dr Perry Kendall's recent description of BC's health care emergency of opioid mis- use and overdose. The authors write that the profes- sional standard does not explicitly make an exception for active cancer, palliative, and end-of-life patients. In fact it does, but perhaps greater clar - ity or emphasis on this point would be helpful when the standard is next reviewed. The College does not accept that the professional standard in any way fails to account for the welfare of patients with mental illness or con - tributes to the stigmatization of these patients. A large part of the impetus to provide more authoritative direc- tion for safe prescribing was evidence before the College\u2014that it is often patients with concurrent diagnoses of mental illness or addiction who are the victims of the adverse and some- times fatal side effects of inappropri- ate long-term opioid treatment. \u2014Gerrard A. Vaughan, MD President, College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia \u2014Heidi M. Oetter, MD Registrar and CEO, College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia EHRs and burnout (a.k.a. early retirement) A recent article in the Globe and Mail, included in a Doctors of BC news- flash, led me to write about electron- ic health records (www.theglobeand mail.com/life/health-and-fitness/ health/doctors-using-electronic -records-at-higher-risk-for-burnout -study/article30652673/). EHR adoption has not included provisions for transcription of pre-existing records/history. EHRs have been a boon for the regional health authorities in British Columbia\u2014 gathering of big data to allow further simplification of complex realities and ultimately leading to more hom- ogenization and standardization of our (ideally) complex relationships with real people (patients) on the ground. Bonus incentives for man- agement that are modelled on the cor - porate sphere make the mining of big data without a thorough understand- ing of the front-line complexities dangerous. With an agenda to make it easier to have the appearance of accountability and standardization of care, the data are often used to justify reduced real services on the ground and increased micromanagement. I would hypothesize that in family medicine, burnout leads to a decreased ability to be our patients' advocates in navigating the idiosyncrasies of non- transparently rationed care, less face personal view Continued on page 364 364 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgtime with patients, and more errors, thus justifying a need for more qual- ity assurance and more idiot-proofing built into the EHRs, followed by a need for constant improvements (i.e., not intuitive patches that are usually inconsistent with the original operat - ing platform), and resulting in EHRs that are even more rigid and frustrat- ing. It's a positive feedback loop and more business for the IT industry. The apparent smartness of drop-down menus and rigid algorithms have reduced flexibility and fit, as well as satisfaction and connection, which are essential in family medicine. Many of us may retire earlier than we otherwise would have, not because we don't get it and are too rigid to learn, but rather because we do. \u2014Andre C. Piver, MD Nelson Re: The impact of excessive endurance exercise First, thank you for a very impor - tant and well-written article [BCMJ 2016;58:203-209]. I took a look at the four recent studies that were discussed in the \"How much exercise is enough?\" sec- tion and wonder if you can shed light on something. The clearest U-curve is found in the study on Copenhagen joggers.1,2 The study on runners in Texas3 also showed a U curve though it was less striking. The study on all forms of exercise in Taiwan,4 how- ever, showed a continued benefit with longer and more vigorous exercise. The main differences in these studies that I found were: 1. Difference in race: East Asian ver - sus two white populations. 2. Difference in exercise modality: running versus all forms. 3. Difference in follow-up period: The study in Taiwan was only 8 years of follow-up, which is less than in Copenhagen or Texas, though the subgroup analysis in Copenhagen2 was also around personal view this length and showed a marked U-curve. I didn't see any obvious differ - ences in other subject characteristics, though I may have missed something. Are there any other studies sug- gesting differences in exercise bene- fits among different races or exercise modalities?

Authors reply We would like to thank Dr Fox for his comments. The studies mentioned are population cohort studies looking at a wide range of individuals with vary- ing activity and fitness levels. The Taiwan study1 attempted to define the minimal amount of exercise required and looked at all comers in a standard medical screening program. They did demonstrate that higher levels of moderate or vigorous activity con- ferred no additional health benefits and, thus, more of a reverse J-shaped curve than a U-shaped curve. Giv- en the scope of this review, which focused on excessive endurance exer - cise, we have focused on those at the extreme end of these mortality curves. The other related articles in the April and May issues of the BCMJ may provide more insight into the specific benefits of exercise, since it is clear that moderate exercise is beneficial. The specific studies mentioned are all observational studies with inher - ent limitations. There are other simi- lar studies not included in the scope of the review that demonstrate similar U-shaped curves or reverse J-shaped curves, but there appears to be a con- sistent signal that further benefit and potential harm may lie at the extreme end of exercise. To our knowledge, there are no randomized studies that directly compare differences in exercise modality on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. Overall, our take-home message is that we know moderate and even high levels of exercise appear to show benefit, but the upper limit at which adverse car - diac effects occur is not known. \u2014Andrea K.Y.

The remainder of blood from the right atrium flows through the pulmonary artery and is shunted away from the lungs to the aorta through the ductus arteriosus. Blood from the aorta then enters the umbilical arteries and flows into the placenta and is oxygenated. The oxy- genated blood flows back through the umbilical cord to the liver, is bypassed through the ductus venosus into the inferior vena cava, and arrives in the right atrium of the heart. At birth the umbilical cord is clamped and the baby no longer receives oxygen from the mother. With the first breaths the lungs begin to expand and the ductus arteriosus and the foramen ovale both close. The heart is completely formed by 8 weeks of gestation, but if problems occur during the crucial steps of cardi- ac development congenital heart dis- ease (CHD) can result. The incidence of CHD Canada-wide is estimated to be 12 to 14 cases per 1000 live births1 and includes a spectrum of abnormali- ties, from minor narrowing of a blood vessel to malformation of one or more cardiac valves and chambers. Since the introduction of cardiac surgery and the first successful liga - tion of a patent ductus arteriosus in the 1930s, the care of patients with CHD has been characterized by dra- matic progress and widespread opti - mism. Historically, most patients with CHD died in infancy or childhood. In the past 4 decades, however, advanc- es in medical care, surgery, and inter - ventional cardiology have changed this poor prognosis, and today over 90% of patients with CHD reach adulthood. Analysis of administrative data from Quebec indicates that in the year 2000 there was a prevalence rate of 4.09 cases per 1000 adults for all CHD and 0.38 cases per 1000 adults for severe lesions,2 and that an equal number of adults and children were affected by CHD. Since 2000 the number of adults with CHD has grown to exceed the number of chil- dren with CHD. The prevalence of se- vere CHD in adults increased by 85% from 1985 to 2000 and by 55% from 2000 to 2010, consistent with the con- cept that the greatest survival benefit has occurred in those with more se- vere forms of CHD.2 In 2010, adults represented 66% of the entire CHD population. One result of the successful treat - ment of children with CHD is an increasing number of medically com- plex adult CHD patients who live with uncertainty regarding complications and prognosis. Few of these patients This article has been peer reviewed. Dr Jasmine Grewal Dr Marla Kiess367 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgGuest editorial have been cured and most have been left with residual defects or abnormal - ities that will lead to problems later in life (e.g., valvular dysfunction, steno- sis in previously implanted conduits, ventricular heart failure, pulmonary hyperten- sion, thromboembolism, complica- tions associated with pregnancy). Issues unique to adults with CHD include long-term and multisystemic effects of single-ventricle physiolo- baffles, and complex arrhyth- mias. Acquired heart diseases such as hypertension and coronary artery disease may have a significant nega - tive impact on patients with delicate - ly balanced circulation. Even simple procedures may pose additional risk in some patients (e.g., insertion of a jugular line in a patient with intracar - diac baffles can result in puncture of the baffle and death). The majority of these patients will require lifelong cardiac-focused medical care and repeat cardiac surgery or interven- tional procedures. As well, a number of these patients will be developmen- tally delayed, have learning difficul - ties, and/or psychological, social, and financial difficulties that present bar - riers to proactive health management. Many of these patients will require genetic counseling, reproductive counseling, advice about insurability, and guidance regarding appropriate leisure activities, employment restric- tions, and career choices. The majority of adult CHD pa - tients should be seen at least once by an adult CHD specialist to determine the most appropriate care, and cer - tainly patients with moderate to se- vere disease merit ongoing follow-up by an expert multidisciplinary team dedicated to the care of adults with CHD. There is strong evidence to show that referral to and management by such a team decreases morbidity and mortality in this complex patient population.3 At some time in their medical careers, most physicians in BC will encounter patients who have CHD. Physicians are often at a loss when dealing with these medically complex patients and can benefit from know- ing more about common issues and available resources. In this theme issue we attempt to bridge some knowledge gaps with four articles by adult congenital heart disease experts from the Pacific Adult Congenital Heart Disease program based at St. Paul's Hospital in Van- couver. The first article, by Dr Marla Kiess, provides some historical con- text and reviews the current state of care for adults with CHD in BC. The second article, by Drs Andrew Camp- bell and Ronald Carere, describes cur - rent surgical and noninvasive inter - ventions for managing adult patients with CHD. In the third article, Dr Jasmine Grewal and colleagues consider spe- cific medical issues in adult CHD patients related to pregnancy, pul- monary hypertension, and arrhyth- mias. Finally, in the fourth article, Ms Karen LeComte and colleagues dis- cuss the need to ensure a successful transition and transfer when a patient moves from pediatric to adult care. The goal of these articles is not to outline specific management prin- ciples, but rather to highlight some complexities and considerations faced by these patients so that physi- cians can make appropriate referrals and provide better care for adults with congenital heart disease. \u2014Jasmine Grewal, MD, FRCPC Director, Cardiac Obstetrics Program, Cardiologist, Pacific Adult Congenital Heart (PACH) clinic, Division of Cardiology, St. Paul's Hospital \u2014Marla Kiess, MD, FRCPC Director, Pacific Adult Congenital Heart Clinic, Division of Cardiology, St. Paul's Hospital References 1.

ABSTRACT: Cardiology experts around the world, including many Canadians, have contributed to dramatic surgical, interventional, and diagnostic advances since the 1930s. These developments began when Dr Helen Taussig established the pediatric cardiology clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Balti\u00ad more in 1930 and Dr Maude Abbott of Montreal published the Atlas of Congenital Heart Disease in 1936. The first surgical procedure was ligation of a patent ductus arterio\u00ad sus performed by Dr Robert Gross at the Children's Hospital in Boston in 1938. Intracardiac repair first be\u00ad came possible with the development of cardiopulmonary bypass technol\u00ad ogy in the 1950s, followed in the 1970s by the development of deep hypothermia with circulatory arrest, which made lengthier surgeries possible. Interventional techniques went hand in hand with surgical ad\u00ad vances. Balloon dilatation of the pul\u00ad monary valve was first described in the 1950s and became widely used after static balloon dilatation was in\u00ad troduced in 1982. Balloon atrial sep\u00adtostomy was developed in 1966 to promote mixing at the atrial level and dramatically improved the outcome for newborns with complete trans\u00ad position of the great arteries. Be\u00ad ginning with innovative use of X\u00adray imaging, diagnostic techniques sup\u00ad ported both surgical and nonsurgical interventions. Right heart catheter \u00ad ization became available in the late 1940s and left heart catheterization was developed in the 1950s. The advent of two\u00addimensional echocar \u00ad diography in the 1970s permitted a major step forward in the treatment of congenital heart disease (CHD), as did the establishment of standard\u00ad ized nomenclature. Canadian doctor Wilfred Bigelow determined how to use total body hypothermia for open heart surgery in 1953, and the first open heart procedure in Canada was performed by Dr John Callaghan in Edmonton in 1954. In British Colum\u00ad bia, Dr Ross Robertson performed a Blalock\u00adTaussig shunt, closed a pat\u00ad ent ductus arteriosus, and repaired a coarctation of the aorta at Vancouver General Hospital in 1947. In the late 1950s Dr Harold Rice built the first cardiopulmonary bypass machine used at St. Paul's Hospital. Because of the many advances made since the 1930s, children born with CHD today are much more likely to grow to adulthood, but they are also like\u00ad ly to require multiple operations for scarring and narrowing of arteries or veins and insertion or replacement of conduits and valves. Patients with moderate to severe disease are rarely cured and face a lifetime of re\u00ad peat surgical and interventional pro\u00ad cedures. Each year, BC Children's Hospital registers approximately 500 newly diagnosed CHD patients and moves 300 previously diagnosed patients from pediatric to adult care. Approximately 150 patients per year will require follow\u00adup in an adult CHD clinic. A review of advances in the treatment of CHD reveals dramatic progress beginning in the 1930s and continuing to the present. Cardiology experts around the world, including many Canadians, have contributed to a variety of surgical, intervention\u00ad al, and diagnostic developments.

She convinced Dr Alfred Blalock of the merit of this idea and eventually Blalock collaborated with his technician, Vivien Thomas, to construct a shunt from the right sub- clavian artery to the right pulmonary artery in a cyanotic child. A report on the procedure was published in 1945.4 Also in 1945, Drs Crafoord and Nylin of Stockholm performed surgery on a patient with coarctation of the aorta.5 In 1948, Sir Russell Brock, working in Guy's Hospital in London, England, published a report describing three cases of pulmonary stenosis that were repaired with pulmonary valvotomy.6 In 1950, Drs Blalock and Hanlon per - formed atrial septectomy using a sur - gical clamp devised by Vivien Thom- as.7 With the development of cardio- pulmonary bypass technology, intra - cardiac repair became possible. The first procedure done with the use of a heart-lung machine was for closure of an atrial septal defect and was per - formed by Dr Gibbon in Philadelphia in 1953.8 Later that year, Dr Lillehei, working in Minneapolis, performed open heart surgery using cross- circulation between the child and a parent. This procedure was found to have a high mortality rate, which led Lillehei and his colleagues to develop a pump oxygenator.9 However, even with this innovation the preservation of blood flow to the brain was not always optimal and surgeons had to work quickly until the development of deep hypothermia with circulatory arrest in the early 1970s made length- ier surgeries possible. Interventional and diagnostic techniques Interventional techniques went hand in hand with surgical advances. Although balloon dilatation of the pulmonary valve was described in 1953 by Rubio-Alvarez and col- leagues,10 the procedure did not become widely used until Kan and colleagues11 introduced static bal- loon dilatation in 1982. Balloon atrial septostomy, developed in 1966 by Drs Rashkind and Miller,12 promoted mixing at the atrial level and dramati - cally improved the outcome for new- borns with complete transposition of the great arteries. There was an explosion of catheter-based therapies in the 1980s, including balloon dila - tation for repair of coarctation of the aorta and stenotic valves, shunts, and conduits. The development of stents vastly improved long-term results. Various devices became available to address fistulae, patent ductus arte-riosus, and atrial septal defects. A major advance was the development of prosthetic pulmonary valves by Dr Bonhoeffer13 and prosthetic aortic valves by Drs Cribier14 and Webb15 in the 2000s. Diagnostic techniques, begin - ning with Dr Taussig's innovative use of X-ray imaging, supported both surgical and nonsurgical interven- tions. Right heart catheterization became available in the late 1940s and left heart catheterization was devel- oped in the 1950s. M-mode echocar - diograms, first available in the 1960s, were helpful, but it was the advent of two-dimensional echocardiography in the 1970s that permitted a major step forward. Important advances in pathology included the establishment of standardized nomenclature by Richard and Stella Van Praagh work- ing in Toronto, Chicago, and then Boston, and by Robert Anderson, working in London, England. Canadian contributions Canadians have been at the forefront of improvements for patients with congenital heart disease, beginning with Dr Maude Abbott of Montreal, who wrote the Atlas of Congenital Heart Disease already mentioned. Dr Wilfred Bigelow16 of the Toronto Canadians have been at the forefront of improvements for patients with congenital heart disease.370 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgHistory and evolution of the treatment of adult congenital heart disease General Hospital determined how to use total body hypothermia for open heart surgery in 1953. The first open heart procedures in Canada were for closure of an atrial septal defect and a ventricular septal defect and were performed by Dr John Callaghan in Edmonton in 1954. Dr William Mus- tard at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto significantly advanced the care of patients with complete trans- position of the great arteries with his atrial switch operation (Mustard pro- cedure) in 1963.17 In British Columbia, Dr Ross Robertson performed a Blalock- Taussig shunt, closed a patent ductus arteriosus, and repaired a coarctation of the aorta at Vancouver General Hospital in 1947. Dr Jack Stenstrom started performing PDA ligations and Blalock-Taussig shunts in Victoria in 1949. In 1957, Dr Peter Allen, with the assistance of Drs Phil Ashmore, Bill Trapp, and Ross Robertson, per - formed the first open heart procedure at Vancouver General Hospital, clos- ing an atrial septal defect in a 9-year- old boy.18 In the late 1950s, Dr Harold Rice built the first cardiopulmonary bypass machine used at St. Paul's Hospital.19 He had a very person- al reason for wanting to do this: his wife, Dorothy, was born with an atri- al septal defect, and in 1953 she was the fourth patient in the world and the first patient at the Mayo Clinic to have open heart surgery under hypo- thermic cardiac arrest. An anomalous pulmonary vein discovered at surgery could not be repaired until the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass, and she had a second procedure in 1958 at the Mayo Clinic when she was in her late forties. Drs Bob Gourlay, Ted Mus- grove, and Gerry Coursley closed an atrial septal defect in a 12-year- old girl using Dr Rice's machine at St. Paul's Hospital in 1960. Cardiac catheterization was first performed at Vancouver General Hospital by Drs Morris Young and Dennis Vince, starting in the mid-1950s. Dr Doris Kavanagh performed the first cardiac catheterization at St. Paul's Hospital in 1959. The need for this procedure was great. After her first successful study, Dr Kavanagh was asked by Dr Young if she could catheterize some of his patients and he sent her a list of 400 patients who had been waiting for as long as 4 years. Further developments In the early days of cardiac surgery, intracardiac repairs could only be per -formed on older children. Congenital heart lesions frequently resulted in too much or too little blood flow to the lungs. Infants and young children with reduced blood flow to the lungs were palliated with arterial shunts, either Blalock-Taussig (subclavian artery to pulmonary artery), Potts (descend- ing aorta to pulmonary artery), or Waterston (ascending aorta to pulmo- nary artery), and those with excess blood flow to the lungs were palli- ated with pulmonary artery banding. The flow through these arterial shunts was difficult to control and pulmo- nary hypertension was a significant risk. Dr Glenn felt that venous shunts would be superior, anastomosing the superior vena cava to the pulmonary artery in 1959.20 Many patients had repeat operations with ligation of arterial shunts and replacement with right and/or left Glenn shunts. When the child patient reached an adequate size, usually around age 4, intracar - diac repair was performed, the shunts were ligated, or the pulmonary band was removed. Dr Fontan developed total right heart bypass for patients with single-ventricle physiology in 197121 and subsequent modifica- tions to improve hemodynamics were developed by him and Dr de Leval.22 In the early 1980s, Dr Aldo Castenada perfected neonatal repairs at the Bos- ton Children's Hospital.23 Adult congenital heart disease care in BC As in the past, many children born with congenital heart disease today will require multiple operations as they grow to adulthood for various reasons, including scarring and nar - rowing of arteries or veins and inser - tion or replacement of conduits and valves. Patients with moderate to severe disease are rarely cured and face a lifetime of repeat surgical and interventional procedures.In the early days of cardiac surgery, intracardiac repairs could only be performed on older children.371 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgHistory and evolution of the treatment of adult congenital heart disease Based on a Canada-wide incidence rate of 12 to 14 cases per 1000 live births,24 500 to 600 infants with CHD are born per year in British Colum - bia. Data suggest that as of 2010 over 24 000 individuals with CHD born in BC had survived to adulthood. Some of these adults have simple defects and have little need for medical care. However, over 12 000 adults have moderate to severe defects and will require lifelong care by an array of health professionals with expertise in the field of CHD. BC Children's Hospital currently registers approximately 500 newly diagnosed patients with CHD every year and moves 300 patients from pediatric to adult care each year. Ap- proximately 50% of these patients, or 150 per year, will have moderate to severe CHD and require follow-up in an adult CHD clinic. These patients need ongoing evaluation to determine whether they require further interven- tion or medical management. About 110 of these patients (60%) can be expected to require specialized con- tinuing care for optimal quality of life. A smaller but significant number of individuals present later in child- hood or early adulthood with congen- ital defects that have gone undetected due to the sometimes insidious nature of CHD progression, and like patients with known CHD, these newly diag- nosed patients may need advice re- garding pregnancy risks and cardiac surgery options. The range of abnormalities, the complexities of postoperative anato- my, and the challenges of multisys- tem involvement mean a full under - standing of CHD is now well beyond the education and experience of the typical cardiologist caring for adult patients. To care for these patients, practitioners require knowledge and training in congenital heart disease, adult cardiology, and general medi -cine, and the support and expertise of a multidisciplinary team (nurses, psy- chologists, social workers) who have knowledge of CHD. A recent study from Quebec has shown that these complex patients have higher rates of hospitalization, more visits to emergency rooms, greater use of outpatient cardiolo - gist care, and more days in critical care.25 The Canadian Cardiovascular Society,26 American College of Car - diology,27 and European Society of Cardiology28 have all recognized the urgent need for trained medical staff, allied health personnel, and special- ized clinics to deliver appropriate care to this rapidly growing population of adults with CHD. Summary Many advances have followed the first successful ligation of a patent ductus arteriosus in 1938. Intracar - diac repair became possible with the development of cardiopulmonary bypass technology in the 1950s, while lengthier surgeries became possible after the development of deep hypo- thermia with circulatory arrest in the 1970s. Interventional techniques have accompanied surgical advances, and a variety of imaging innovations have supported the development of both surgical and nonsurgical inter - ventions. The many advances made since the 1930s mean that children born with CHD today are much more likely to grow to adulthood. However, they are also likely to require multiple operations for scarring and narrowing of arteries or veins and insertion or replacement of conduits and valves, and to require the support and exper - tise of a multidisciplinary team with knowledge of CHD.

Carere, MD, FRCPC Surgical and interventional management of adult congenital heart disease A growing population of patients with adult CHD is being helped today by rapidly developing surgical techniques and catheter- based technologies. ABSTRACT: Survival of pediatric pa\u00ad tients after surgery for congenital heart disease has consistently im \u00ad proved over the past 2 decades. As a consequence, more young adults are presenting with both historical and contemporary repairs, and with both anticipated and completely un\u00ad anticipated complications. Surgery for adult congenital heart disease continues to evolve in Canada, and even the recent rapid progress in percutaneous and hybrid approach\u00ad es to congenital heart disease has had no impact on the volume or the complexity of surgical cases. Tech\u00ad nological advances now permit the treatment of both relatively simple and very complex anatomical and pathophysiological problems using percutaneous techniques. Manag\u00ad ing adult congenital heart disease patients now means choosing from the surgical and interventional op\u00ad tions available and determining which cases will truly benefit from novel therapies and which will re\u00ad quire only what has always been done. We will continue to need well\u00ad integrated congenital heart disease programs that permit collaboration between adult and pediatric medical and surgical subspecialists. Over the past 2 decades the survival of pediatric patients after surgery for congenital heart disease (CHD) has consistently improved, with in-hospital mortality rates now routinely below 3%. With this advance more children are now surviving and presenting as young adults with both historical and more contemporary repairs and therefore with both anticipated and completely unanticipated complications. This means we must look at the different levels of complexity of adult CHD and the array of surgical and interven- tional options, and determine which cases will truly benefit from novel therapies and which will require only what has always been done. Surgical management Modern surgical management of con- genital heart disease began on 26 August 1938 with the first document- ed successful ligation of a patent duc- tus arteriosus (PDA) in a 7-year-old patient by Dr Robert Gross in Bos- ton.1 The operation was scheduled while surgeon-in-chief Dr William Ladd was on vacation for fear that Ladd would not allow the ground- breaking surgery to go ahead. Later this led to an irreparable rift between the two surgeons, despite confirming that native defects of the heart and great vessels were amenable to surgi- cal repair. As Dr Gross stated in his case report, at that time 50% of the children affected by PDA could be expected to die in infancy and the remainder would suffer the consequences of heart failure and, potentially, Eisen- menger syndrome, which would lead to an early death in the third or fourth decade of life. PDA ligation is now performed at the bedside in the neo- natal intensive care unit in 30 minutes or less. Since this beginning, cardiac sur - gery for congenital defects has made great strides, but at every step there has been tension between the possible benefits of innovation and the risk of causing more harm than existing ther - apies or the natural history of the dis- ease. This tension was very apparent in the 1980s when therapy for transpo- Dr Campbell is a congenital heart disease surgeon in the Pacific Adult Congenital Heart (PACH) clinic, Division of Cardiology, St. Paul's Hospital.

This article has been peer reviewed.374 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgSurgical and interventional management of adult congenital heart disease sition of the great arteries underwent a revolution as atrial-level repair was replaced by an arterial-level operation developed principally by Dr Jatene of the University of Sao Paulo. For the first time, the coronary arteries of children were dissected and trans- posed from the pulmonary root to the neoaorta, a procedure that would have been considered impossible in 1975. After repeated efforts, Jatene and his team developed a programmatic approach to the management of these children; even so, Jatene's review of his first 116 patients revealed an early mortality rate of almost 21%, with only 33% of surviving patients hav- ing normal function and a good ana- tomic repair.2 Over this same period, centres experienced with atrial-level repairs achieved early mortality rates of 2% to 3%. However, 25 years later it appears that the long-term benefits of a systemic left ventricle clearly outweigh the risks of a more complex neonatal operation as these children have grown into adults with improved survival and better exercise toler - ance.3 Thus the challenge for man- agement of congenital heart disease remains: How do you decide which procedure is safest when one of the procedures is novel and the disease process is unknown? The different forms of adult con-genital heart disease requiring man- agement ( Table ) can be grouped as follows: Category 1. Previously undiagnosed pediatric disease that presents in adulthood. Category 2. Anticipated residual di- sease following a pediatric surgical procedure or palliated pathology. Category 3. Unanticipated deterio- ration following a pediatric surgical procedure or palliated pathology. Understandably, most new lesions will initially present as category 3 dis- ease. Once several patients with simi- lar anatomy are identified, what was initially thought of as unanticipated becomes anticipated and a new algo- rithm for care is developed. Category 1 disease The most common category 1 con- dition leading to surgical referral 15 years ago was ostium secundum atri - al septal defect (ASD). Now with the refinement and expansion of catheter- based technologies surgeons see few- er isolated atrial septal defects. Inter - estingly, the increased scrutiny of patients with atrial septal defects for possible catheter-based closure has identified a large number of patients with associated anomalous pulmo- nary venous return who cannot under - go catheter-based closure and are therefore referred for more complex surgical repair with venous baffling of the anomalous veins. So despite the large number of ASD cases being managed in the catheterization labo- ratory, the identification of underdiag- nosed patients means the number of surgical cases has actually increased. Asymptomatic ventricular septal defects are surprisingly common as an incidental echocardiographic find- ing but few are found to shunt. Clefts and parachute- morphology mitral valves in adulthood with a gradual pro- gression of regurgitation or stenosis and can be occasionally misinterpret- ed as a more routine anatomy ame - nable to conventional repair. This can lead to the rare intraoperative consul- tation for the congenital heart disease surgeon in a colleague's operating room, and heightens the importance of having a well-integrated CHD program with collaboration between adult and pediatric medical and surgi- cal subspecialists. Category 2 disease The most common category 2 con- dition leading to surgical referral remains pulmonary insufficiency associated with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Up until the 1980s, the vast majority of surgical repairs for TOF Complexity Examples Outcome Category 1 disease Previously undiagnosed pediatric disease presenting in adulthoodLow Atrial mitral valveGood Category 2 disease Anticipated complications from pediatric repair or palliated pathologyModerate Pulmonary insufficiency following repair for following repair for atrioventricular septal defect, failure of Fontan repair, systemic right ventricle failure following atrial switch procedureVaries Category 3 disease Unanticipated complications from pediatric repair or palliated pathologyHigh Neoaortic valve failure following arterial switch, systemic ventricular dysfunction following repair for ALCAPA (anomalous left coronary artery from pulmonary artery)UnknownTable. Forms of adult congenital heart disease requiring management.375 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgSurgical and interventional management of adult congenital heart disease involved a vertical incision crossing the pulmonary valve and rendering it incompetent. Over time the volume load on the right ventricle creates dilatation and eventually a decrease in ventricular function that can lead to symptoms. A great deal of research has been performed to determine the right ventricular volumes above which an adverse surgical outcome can be expected and whether earlier restoration of pulmonary competence will lead to a more rapid return to normal ventricular dimensions. Oth- er considerations include timing of valve implantation, valve type, and the possibility of future percutaneous valve implantation. Category 3 disease The most complex and challenging cases for the surgeon involve catego- ry 3 disease, as patients in this cate - gory generally have survived the most severe forms of pediatric CHD. They often have diminished systemic ven- tricular function, either due to a right ventricle in the subaortic position or as a consequence of multiple episodes of cardiopulmonary bypass. There is presently little evidence to guide tim - ing or determine the type of repair that is best for these patients. For patients who have received a classic right atrial to pulmonary anastomosis as the final stage of their single-ventricle palliation, their atri- um eventually dilates and becomes an inefficient capacitance chamber for systemic venous drainage, which leads to decreased forward flow into the pulmonary circulation and ab- dominal congestion. These patients are considered to have a failed or failing Fontan circulation,4 and as a result are candidates for the more contemporary Fontan repairs that have been developed. Much remains poorly understood about this patient population. Similarly, when patients with a subaortic right ventricle be- gin to develop ventricular dysfunc- tion, their generally young age and tolerance of cyanosis can mean they tolerate pulmonary edema and di- minished cardiac output much bet - ter than older ischemic cardiac pa- tients. As single-ventricle anatomy and multiple sternotomies make the prospect of implanting a ventricular assist device daunting, CHD patients with minimal symptoms but severe dysfunction are often overlooked for this therapy and therefore have great difficulty qualifying for car - diac transplantation.5 Establishment of a separate congenital heart disease transplant list has been discussed in several countries, but does not yet exist in North America. Surgery for adult congenital heart disease continues to evolve in Cana- da. Even the recent rapid progress in percutaneous and hybrid approaches to complex heart disease has had no impact on the volume or the com- plexity of surgical cases seen in our centre. Instead, with an ever-growing population of pediatric CHD patients who will require reintervention in fu- ture, we expect to be providing more options for patient management and working to minimize the complexity of procedures that will be needed over time. As the pediatric CHD popula- tion continues to age, more late post- operative complications will be rec- ognized and the number of patients with category 3 disease will increase. And as we saw with the work of Dr Gross and Dr Jatene, surgeons will continue to weigh possible benefits against the risk of a new intervention, and in time new surgical treatments will evolve. Interventional management Technological advances now allow us to treat both relatively simple and very complex anatomical and patho - physiological problems using per - cutaneous techniques. Interventions for adult CHD have for some time employed devices and techniques that are referred to as \"structural heart disease interventions.\"6 These inter - ventions require the operator to have expertise in congenital heart disease and the unique surgeries and connec- tions that many of these patients have had in the past. Broadly speaking, interventions fall into two main cat - egories: those for closing abnormal connections and those for relieving obstructions. Closing abnormal connections The primary goal in closing an abnormal connection is to obtain or improve separation of the oxygenated arterial circulation from the deoxy - genated venous circulation. Consid - erations include the effect on symp- tom status, the vasculature, cardiac chambers, and/or physiology. Closure of connections can also be performed to prevent paradoxical embolization, depending on the clinical scenario and the lesion in question. Small connections that have no significant hemodynamic effect or present little risk for paradoxical embolization are often followed clinically. Although there are several devic - es available to close abnormal vascu- lar connections, the most commonly used devices worldwide are occlud- ers manufactured by St. Jude Medical in St. Paul, Minnesota. These devices are made from a deformable nickel and titanium alloy that allows pas- sage through a catheter and rely on a screw-release mechanism that allows the device to be controlled until it is deliberately released ( Figure 1 ). Dif- ferent series are designed specifically for closure patent foramen ovale, patent ductus arteriosus, and vascular connections.376 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.org Surgical and interventional management of adult congenital heart disease Atrial septal defects. There are vari- ous atrial septal defects that can be repaired with closure devices, with the most common being the ostium secundum atrial septal defect. The direction and magnitude of the shunt in an ASD patient is determined by the size of the defect and the rela- tive compliance of the right and left ventricle. The shunt occurs predomi- nantly from the left atrium to the right atrium and can lead to right atrial and right ventricular dilation, arrhyth- mias, and right-sided heart failure. Although it is rare to develop pulmo- nary hypertension, if this does occur closure should be undertaken only after careful consideration. The commonly used Amplatzer atrial septal defect occluders come in sizes ranging from 4 to 40 mm, with retention discs that are 8 to16 mm larger than the waist. All patients are prescreened with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to confirm there is an adequate rim of atrial sep- tal tissue to safely anchor the closure device and ensure there are no other associated congenital heart defects that would preclude percutaneous closure. After the size of the defect is established using transesophageal or intracardiac echocardiography, the device is positioned and released once the position and stability are con- firmed. Although large defects and multiple defects are more challenging Step 1: Delivery sheath is withdrawn to expose left atrial retention disc. Step 2: Left atrial disc is fully deployed to prepare for pulling entire mechanism back to atrial septum. Step 3: Waist of device (sized to fit defect) is deployed. Step 4: Delivery sheath is pulled back to right atrium to begin deployment of right atrial retention disc. Step 5: Device is fully deployed, with left and right retention discs positioned on either side of atrial septum, and placement and security of device are checked. Step 6: Delivery cable is unscrewed and removed. Figure 2.

In the developing fetus, the ductus arterio - sus between the pulmonary artery and the descending aorta is the connec- tion that enables passage of oxygen- ated blood from the mother's placenta directly to the systemic circulation. When this fails to close shortly after birth, blood shunts from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. Indications for closure include a significant shunt that affects the left heart chambers or pul- monary pressures. More controver - sially, closure may also be considered as a way to reduce the long-term risk of endarteritis in the event of systemic bacteremia. Patent ductus arteriosus comes in a variety of configurations. When small, such defects may be closed with coils, while larger defects may be closed with one of many Amplatzer devices ( Figure 3 ). Fistulas. Fistulas are connections and can be arteriovenous or venovenous. Fis- tulas can also occur between a cardiac chamber and vein or artery. Indications for fistula repair include the establish- ment of hemodynamic significance, deoxygenation, and endocarditis. Clo- sure of a fistula commonly involves a vascular ( Figure 4 4. ductus arteriosus Figure 3. A: Patent ductus shown from contrast injection from the aorta.

Typically, the structure to be treated is crossed with a guide wire and then prepared with a balloon. Although the balloon may be a definitive treatment, con- temporary procedures usually employ stents to improve the immediate and long-term result. A variety of wires are available along with balloon and stent products that range from sever - al millimetres to 30 mm in diameter. Stents are typically made from stain - less steel and alloys of platinum and iridium or cobalt and chromium, and may be used as bare metal scaffolds or with a covering of polyethylene years before undergoing heart trans- plantation. Given the significantly abnormal anatomy, the transplant surgeon needed to construct unique connections to provide venous return from the patient to the donor heart. In the postoperative period, one of these connections from the head and neck did not remain patent and the connec- tion from the inferior vena cava was restrictive because it was necessary to use a portion of a pre-existing con- duit. These anomalies were success- fully treated by percutaneous stent placement in a two-stage procedure. Treatment also included working directly with a device manufacturer to create a custom-made covered stent, a requirement in cases where the anat - omy is very complex and there is no product readily available.8,9 Figure 5. Stents commonly used for treating congenital heart disease. From left: expanded and unexpanded Cheatham-Platinum (CP) NY). Figure 6.

There are no clear indications for treating obstruc- tions involving the venous circula- tion. However, even a small pressure gradient can be important in inhib- iting venous return. Also, since the pressure is typically assessed and measured at rest, a low pressure gra- dient can be expected to worsen on exercise when greater venous return is required to increase cardiac output. An example of a repair for an extreme case of obstructed venous return is shown in Figure 6 . The patient origi- nally had complex congenital heart disease and was palliated with a num- ber of surgical procedures over many A CB D379 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgSurgical and interventional management of adult congenital heart disease Aortic and valvular obstructions. Indications are usually clearer for treating aortic and valvular obstruc- tions; these issues can often be resolved with interventional proce- dures as shown in Figure 7 . Aortic coarctation is an example of an obstruction that can be success- fully managed without complex sur - gery using a contemporary approach that employs covered stents. In gen- eral, a peak-to-peak systolic pressure gradient of less than 20 mm Hg is an indication for intervention, although other factors, such as the presence of systemic hypertension, left ventricu- lar hypertrophy, or extensive collater - als, will also influence the manage - ment decision. Although the more common example of percutaneous aortic valve implantation has been well described,10 percutaneous implanta- tion was originally used for valves in the pulmonary position for patients with significant right ventricular out- flow tract obstruction or severe pul- monic regurgitation.11 The first valve available was approved in Canada in 2007. The Melody valve (Medtron- ic, Minneapolis, MN) is constructed from bovine jugular vein and is indi- cated for relief of obstruction and/ or regurgitation in right ventricular to pulmonary artery conduits rang- ing from 14 to 22 mm. The number of adult patients who can benefit from implantation of this valve has been limited despite improved tech- niques, largely because of the small valve size. Recently, the SAPIEN XT valve from Edwards Lifesciences has become the valve of choice because of the availability of larger sizes more suitable for use in adults. Summary Since the first successful ligation of a patent ductus arteriosus by Dr Robert Gross, cardiac surgery for congenital Aortic coarctation is an example of an obstruction that can be successfully managed without complex surgery using a contemporary approach that employs covered stents.Figure 7.

D: Stenosis seen in image C is resolved with placement of a large stent (Johnson and Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ), which also helps address significant pressure gradient and pulmonary valve incompetence by providing an anchoring site for a SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA).

Today management for adult CHD addresses problems in patients with previously undiagnosed pediatric disease that presents in adulthood, anticipated residual disease following a pedi - atric surgical procedure, and unan- ticipated deterioration following a pediatric surgical procedure. Techno- logical advances also now allow us to treat both relatively simple and very complex problems using percutane- ous techniques. Broadly speaking, interventions fall into two main cat - egories: those for closing abnormal connections and those for relieving obstructions. With a growing population of patients with adult congenital heart disease and the developing technol- ogies available to us, we will con - tinue to need well-integrated CHD programs that permit collaboration between adult and pediatric medical and surgical subspecialists. We will also need to consider which is the most appropriate surgical or interven- tional option for each patient. Competing interests None declared. References 1. Gross RE, Hubbard JP .

ABSTRACT: Special considerations for the management of adult congen\u00ad ital heart disease include pregnancy\u00ad related cardiovascular disease, pul\u00ad monary arterial hypertension, and arrhythmias. Improvements in the treatment of congenital heart dis\u00ad ease mean that more women with congenital heart disease are reach\u00ad ing childbearing age. In BC the Car \u00ad diac Obstetrics clinic at St. Paul's Hospital provides coordinated care for pregnant women with cardiac conditions. The clinic also offers preconception counseling so that couples can make informed choices about pregnancy. Another service based at St. Paul's Hospital, the Pa\u00ad cific Adult Congenital Heart clinic, helps manage patients with pulmo\u00ad nary arterial hypertension, a pro\u00ad gressive condition affecting around 10% of adult congenital heart dis \u00ad ease patients. Agents used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension in\u00ad clude endothelin receptor antago\u00ad nists and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. The Pacific Adult Con\u00ad genital Heart clinic also manages patients with a significant arrhyth\u00ad mia, often the first manifestation of deterioration in complex congenital heart disease. Complications that can result from arrhythmias include heart failure, thromboembolism, and sudden cardiac death. A range of complementary imaging modali\u00ad ties aid in the management of all these conditions by enabling the as\u00ad sessment of ventricular and valvu\u00ad lar function (echocardiography and tification of right ventricular volume (multidetector computed of coronary ste\u00ad nosis (coronary CT angiography). Complications in adult con- genital heart disease (CHD) include pregnancy-related cardio vascular disease (CVD), pul- monary arterial hypertension (PAH), and arrhythmias. Patients with these complications can benefit from a vari- ety of treatments and management approaches. They can also benefit from advances in diagnostic imaging.

The only current guidelines for managing CVD during pregnancy2 emphasize the following aspects of care: Counseling and managing women of childbearing age with suspected cardiac disease should start before pregnancy occurs. Pregnant women with CVD should be managed by specialized interdis- ciplinary teams. High-risk patients should be treated in specialized centres. Diagnostic procedures and inter - ventions should be performed by specialists with expertise in manag - ing pregnant patients. The nature of CVD in pregnancy differs from one country to anoth- er. In Western countries, the risk of acquired CVD in pregnancy has increased because of greater age at first pregnancy and growing rates of diabetes, hypertension, and obesi- ty. Also, the treatment of congenital heart disease has improved, resulting in more women with CHD reaching childbearing age.3 In Western coun-tries heart disease is now the major cause of maternal death during preg- nancy.4 Pregnancy induces changes in the cardiovascular system to meet the increased metabolic demands of the mother and fetus. These changes include increases in blood volume and cardiac output, and reductions in sys- temic vascular resistance and blood pressure. Along with other physio- logical demands of pregnancy, these changes are variably tolerated by women with CVD, and in some cases pregnancy should be avoided. There are many tools available to determine the cardiovascular risk of pregnancy in women with CVD.5,6 Certainly the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of maternal cardiovas- cular risk2 is the most straightforward and helps to stratify pregnancy risk in a broad sense.7 A more granular risk assessment can be made using risk scores and lesion-specific research data. Obstetric care A special multidisciplinary team for the care of pregnant women with CVD operates at St. Paul's Hospi- tal in collaboration with BC Wom-en's Hospital ( Figure 1 ). The Car - diac Obstetric (COB) clinic, the first of its kind in Western Canada, was established 15 years ago to serve the growing number of women with car - diac conditions who require special - ized cardiac and obstetric care. This clinic sees patients once a week and is attended by one of two designated cardiologists, the maternity clinical nurse specialist, and the COB nurse patient educator. This is also a teach- ing clinic that is attended by cardiolo- gy residents, congenital heart disease fellows, and maternal-fetal medicine fellows. Women referred to the clinic have a range of cardiac conditions that are either acquired or congenital. Initial consultation is provided and the fre- quency of follow-up is determined by the severity of the underlying disease and the clinical status of the patient. Care provided through the clinic ranges from conservative follow-up and minimal intervention to more active management, which might include the following: Pharmacological treatment for complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, pulmonary hyperten- sion, and thromboembolism. Interventions such as electrical car - dioversion, cardiac catheterization, ablation for arrhythmias, percutane - ous closure of atrial septal defects, and mitral valvuloplasty. Cardiac surgery. The integral role of obstetrics in this clinic ensures that both car - diac and obstetric care are provided in a planned and coordinated fash- ion. Many patients are referred from other parts of BC, and whenever pos- sible support is given so that women with low or moderate risk can de- liver in their community. The clinic has worked hard to organize patient- specific care plans regardless of the patient's risk level or place of deliv-Figure 1.

These highlight individual car - diac and/or obstetric concerns while helping to reassure and guide medical teams with patient management dur - ing pregnancy, labor, and delivery. There is a monthly conference where the cases of all women fol- lowed through the clinic are dis- cussed and care plans are reviewed by the members of the multidisciplinary COB team. A wide range of com - plex cardiac conditions have been successfully managed through the clinic. Patients have included those with cyanotic heart disease, single- ventricle physiology, severe pulmo- nary hypertension, and mechani - cal heart valve replacement. Many moderate-cardiac-risk and all high- cardiac-risk women are followed and deliver their babies at St. Paul's Hospital. The COB clinic also has a well-established registry and research is a very important component of the program. Preconception counseling An additional essential service offered by the COB team is preconception counseling. It is imperative that cou- ples understand the risk to maternal health posed by a pregnancy. Con- siderations include the risk of a car - diovascular complication in pregnan- cy, labor, or delivery; the long-term impact of pregnancy on the progres- sion of underlying cardiac disease; and the possible effect of a cardiac lesion on maternal life expectancy. Understanding these risks allows cou- ples to make informed choices about pursuing pregnancy. In some cases, women have been told previously that they should not become preg- nant, when in fact this may not have been appropriate advice. In other cas- es, women with high-risk conditions such as pulmonary hypertension and cardiomyopathy may not be aware of all their risks and the care required through a complex pregnancy. Another important aspect of care for young women with CVD is relat - ed to their risk of bearing a child with congenital cardiac defects. The risk for parents without CVD is approxi- mately 1%. The risk can be higher in parents with hereditary conditions, and in general the risk is higher when the mother rather than the father is affected by CVD.8 Depending on the type of maternal heart disease, the recurrence risk in offspring varies between 3% and 50%. Pulmonary arterial hypertension Pulmonary arterial hypertension is common in adult CHD, complicat- ing around 10% of all cases.9,10 PAH is a progressive condition resulting in hypertrophy and proliferation of the small pulmonary arteries, which can cause increased resistance to flow across the pulmonary circula- tion, right ventricular failure, and, ultimately, death.11 While the condi- tion is incurable, patients have ben- efited over the past 20 years from the development of remarkable therapies that slow the remodeling process and result in prolonged life and improved symptoms.12,13 In patients with congenital heart disease, PAH is triggered by sys- temic to pulmonary artery shunting. The increased blood flow through the pulmonary circulation induces the remodeling of the pulmonary vascula- ture that produces PAH.14,15 Increased flow through the pulmonary arteries results in functional and structural changes to the small pulmonary arter - ies.15-17 These changes increase the resistance to flow and result in a pro- gressive increase in pulmonary artery pressures. Eventually, the pressures in the pulmonary circulation may rival those in the systemic circulation and reverse the direction of the shunt. The consequent shunting of deoxygenated blood from the right side to the left side of the heart results in the chronic hypoxemia and cyanosis associat- ed with Eisenmenger syndrome, the most advanced form of PAH associ- ated with CHD.18 This form of pul - monary hypertension represents a subtype of WHO group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension.19,20 Factors influencing its development include the complexity, location, and size of the CHD lesion18,21 The most common presenting symptom is breathless- ness.16 Syncope is an ominous prog- nostic symptom that portends a poor outcome.22 Screening for PAH The screening test of choice for pul- monary arterial hypertension is a transthoracic echocardiogram. An estimated pulmonary systolic pres- sure greater than 35 mm Hg, especial - ly if accompanied by right ventricular enlargement or dysfunction, should raise concern for PAH.23 The diagno- sis of PAH is based on invasive pres- sure measurement at cardiac cath- eterization. In PAH, catheterization reveals elevated pulmonary artery pressures (mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 25 mm Hg) and low left atrial pressures (wedge pres- sure less than 15 mm Hg), along with elevated pulmonary vascular resis- tance (greater than 3 Wood units).11 Given the rarity and complexity of PAH associated with CHD, it is essen- tial that evaluation and management proceed in a centre with expertise in the management of both CHD and PAH. Therapy for PAH Currently, agents for PAH approved for use in Canada include the pros- tanoid 384 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgSpecial considerations in the management of adult congenital heart disease and macitentan), the phosphodiester - ase type 5 inhibitors (sildenafil and tadalafil), and the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat. These agents were approved primarily on the basis of trials done in the gen- eral WHO group 1 PAH population. However, there are a few notable ex- ceptions where patients with PAH associated with CHD were studied specifically,24-28 or are being studied specifically.29 Unfortunately, research results so far show that therapy with these agents slows but does not halt or reverse pulmonary vascular remodel- ing. Many patients eventually worsen despite optimal pulmonary hyperten- sion therapy. For these patients, either lung transplant, lung transplant with cardiac surgery to repair the congen- ital defect, or combined heart-lung transplant are ultimately required. In British Columbia, care for patients with CHD-associated PAH is centralized at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver at the Pacific Adult Con - genital Heart (PACH) clinic, the first such clinic in Canada and the model for other adult CHD centres. At the clinic, each patient is seen by both a pulmonary hypertension expert and an adult CHD cardiologist. This has been a highly successful collab- orative venture that has resulted in markedly improved communication between health care providers and much more efficient and effective care for patients. Patients followed through this clinic are frequently on pulmonary arterial hypertension ther - apy, including endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, or a combination of these agents. A strong partnership between the clinic and general cardiologists, respirologists, internists, and prima- ry care physicians outside the Lower Mainland allows these patients to be followed in their local communities throughout the province. Arrhythmias Arrhythmias are often the first mani- festation of deterioration in complex CHD, and can lead to further cardiac decompensation if not treated on a pri- ority basis. Arrhythmias in adult CHD should be identified, investigated, and treated promptly with input from an adult CHD centre. A thorough clini- cal history, physical examination, and hemodynamic assessment are essen- tial. If any associated symptoms, heart failure, and/or hemodynamic abnormalities are identified, prompt referral to an adult CHD heart rhythm specialist is indicated. Up to 30% of adult CHD patients have significant arrhythmia as an ad- ditional diagnosis. Arrhythmias are the leading cause of morbidity, im - paired quality of life, emergency room visits, hospitalization, and mortality in this patient population.30 The entire spectrum of arrhythmias is encoun- tered in adult CHD, with several types often coexisting in the patient at pre- sentation or afterwards. Several fac - tors make the heart more susceptible to rhythm disorders in adult CHD, in- cluding congenitally displaced or mal- formed sinus nodes primary myocar dial disease; or residual sequel - ae; and intra-atrial or intraventricular conduction propagation. Certain adult CHD lesions are associated with a very high risk of rhythm problems. For example, in congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, approximate- ly 20% of patients develop com- plete atrioventricular node conduc- tion block by adulthood and require pacemaker implantation.31 In patients with prior surgery in the region of the sinus node or its arterial supply (e.g., patients who have undergone a Mus- tard or Senning procedure for trans-position of the great arteries), inci- dence of bradycardia with sinus node dysfunction is high.32 Approximately 50% of adults with CHD develop an atrial tachyar - rhythmia during their lifetime.33 Intra- or flutter is the most common tachyarrhythmia in adult CHD due to scar-related abnor - malities. Although atrial fibrillation is relatively uncommon in the younger adult CHD population, the prevalence of atrial fibrillation increases with age. It is important to note that atrial arrhythmias can often be difficult to detect in this population and the clini - cian needs to maintain a high index of suspicion as atrial arrhythmias can lead to catastrophic events. Ventricu- lar arrhythmias are the leading causes of sudden death in several subtypes of CHD. Although the absolute inci- dence of cardiac arrest remains rela- tively low (approximately 0.1% per year), the overall risk is up to 100 times higher than in an age-matched control population.34 Investigating arrhythmias Accurate delineation of arrhythmias can be accomplished with 12-lead electrocardiogram, Holter monitor - ing, cardiac event loop recorders, implantable loop recorders, and inter - rogation of already implanted devic- es such as pacemakers or defibrilla - tors. An electrophysiological study (EPS) may be considered when the conventional diagnostic workup is unrevealing in adults with CHD and symptoms suggest sustained arrhyth- mia. An EPS can also be indicated in cases with unexplained syncope and high-risk anatomical substrates associated with primary ventricular arrhythmias or poorly tolerated atri strates include tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries with atrial switch surgery, and systemic or 385 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgSpecial considerations in the management of adult congenital heart disease single-ventricle anatomy. However, an inability to induce an arrhythmia in the electrophysiology lab does not fully exclude the possibility of a clini - cal arrhythmia.35 Many complications can occur as a result of arrhythmias, includ- ing heart failure, thromboembolism, and sudden cardiac death, and it is important to ensure that worsening hemodynamics are not the cause of the arrhythmia. Adults with CHD who have new-onset or worsen- ing arrhythmias and those who have been resuscitated after sudden cardiac death should undergo hemodynamic assessment, including detailed imag- ing with echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and/ or cardiac catheterization. New or worsening regurgitant or obstructive lesions, shunts, ischemia, ventricular dysfunction, and coronary abnormali - ties can all precipitate arrhythmias. Managing arrhythmias Managing arrhythmias in adult CHD patients can be complex and may involve additional considerations: Coexisting sinus or atrioventricular node dysfunction. Large scar formation and other ef- fects of previous cardiac surgery. Underlying hemodynamic lesions. Vascular access issues. The patient's childbearing potential. Such considerations can make input from an adult CHD arrhythmia specialist vital. For example, if pace- maker implantation is recommended for a patient with a heart that is dif- ficult to access because of baffles and abnormal anatomy, endovascular rather than epicardial lead placement may have to be considered. Vascu- lar access can also be an issue in a patient requiring electrophysiology studies and ablation therapy because pharmacological therapy is ineffec- tive. Again, impenetrable scar tissue, baffles or conduits, and abnormal intracardiac connections may have to be taken into account. Arrhythmia management should also include risk assessment for sudden cardiac death, heart failure, and thromboembolic risk\u2014details beyond the scope of this article but readily available from the Heart Rhythm Society30 and Canadian Car - diovascular Society.36 Role of imaging in adult CHD With advances in imaging technol - ogy and the longer life expectancy of CHD patients, the role of diagnos- tic imaging in this patient population has expanded. Echocardiography is the main routine imaging modality in adults with CHD, enabling assess- ment of ventricular function, valvu- lar function, and integrity of surgical repairs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with its excellent spatial reso- lution and ability to assess ventricu- lar and valvular function without the use of ionizing radiation, has played an essential role in the evaluation of adult CHD. Concerns about potential stochastic effects of ionizing radia - tion have previously limited the use of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). However, the introduction of radiation dose-reduction strategies and recent advancements in CT tech - nology have made MDCT an essen- tial tool for the evaluation of many patients with CHD. Recent advance - ments include submillimetre spatial resolution in all imaging planes, the ability to synchronize the acquisition to the ECG, and temporal resolution as low as 66 msec. The imaging modalities now com- monly used in adult CHD for diagno- sis ( Figure 2 ), assessment ( Figure 3 ), and follow-up all have strengths and weaknesses. MRI is the most common non- invasive imaging modality used to support echocardiography. It offers excellent three-dimensional assess- ment and visualization of the often complex postsurgical anatomy and highly reproducible quantification of left and right ventricular volumes and systolic function. It is also com- Figure 2.

Such serial follow-up is warranted after tetralogy of Fallot repair to assess for degree of pulmonary insufficiency as well as size and function of the right ventricle; after coarctation repair for assessment of aortic size and repair site complication; for the quantifica- tion of ventricular volumes and func- tion in patients with complex cardiac anatomy; and for evaluation of surgi- cal repair integrity and aortic dimen- sions. MRI-derived endpoints can also be essential to management in these circumstances. Many adult CHD patients cannot undergo MRI assessment because they suffer from claustrophobia, they have metallic coils in place that may heavily degrade image quality, or they have an implanted cardiac device. Fortunately, rapid improve- ments in MDCT have helped fill this imaging gap. Given the good con - cordance between MDCT and MRI findings, multi detector computed tomography is being used increas- ingly for the quantification of right ventricular volumes and function in those patients unsuitable for MRI assessment. MDCT is able to evalu- ate the configuration and anatomical dimensions of the right ventricular outflow tract, which are major factors when determining whether a patient is suitable for percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement. Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is now well established as the gold standard for noninvasive detection and exclusion of coronary stenosis. CCTA is also being used increasingly for evaluation of the coronary arter - ies in patients with coronary anoma- lies, coronary fistulas, and Kawasaki disease, and after surgical repair for CHD requiring coronary artery ma - nipulation. When combined with findings from clinical and physiological assessment, information from these complementary imaging modalities plays a key role in diagnostic and treatment decision making. Obtain- ing images in more complex adult CHD cases requires a multidisci- plinary team with specific expertise and knowledge. Often the images are reviewed with the entire team so that different perspectives and interpreta - tions can be integrated and considered in a clinically meaningful way. Summary Pregnancy-related cardiovascular disease, pulmonary arterial hyper - tension, and arrhythmias are com- plications that can affect adult CHD patients. Figure 3.

In BC a special multidisciplinary Cardiac Obstetrics clinic at St. Paul's Hospital provides coordinated care for pregnant women with cardiac con- ditions. In addition, the clinic offers preconception counseling so that cou- ples can make informed choices about pregnancy. The Pacific Adult Congenital Heart clinic, also based at St. Paul's, helps manage patients with pulmo- nary arterial hypertension, a pro - gressive condition affecting around 10% of adult CHD patients. Patients followed through this clinic are fre- quently on PAH therapy, includ- ing endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, or a combination of these agents. Other adult CHD patients requir - ing follow-up are those with a sig- nificant arrhythmia, often the first manifestation of deterioration in complex CHD. Complications that can result from arrhythmias include heart failure, thromboembolism, and sudden cardiac death. Adult CHD patients with any of the complications discussed here can benefit from recent advances in im - aging technology. A range of com- plementary modalities now enable assessment of ventricular and valvu- lar function (echocardiography and magnetic resonance tification of right ventricular volume (multidetector computed of coronary ste- nosis (coronary CT angiography).

ABSTRACT: Patients with congenital heart disease require lifelong sur \u00ad veillance for arrhythmias, ventricu\u00ad lar failure, and complications asso\u00ad ciated with childhood surgery. When pediatric patients with congenital heart disease become adults they can be lost to follow\u00adup or experi\u00ad ence lapses in care that expose them to greater risk of adverse health out\u00ad comes. A successful transition and transfer from pediatric to adult care supports youth attachment to both a primary care provider and a spe \u00ad cialized cardiology clinic\u2014ensuring quality and continuity of care. Tran\u00ad sition refers to a process that begins in early adolescence and continues through early adulthood when health care management shifts from the family to the patient. Transfer is an event that occurs when the respon\u00ad sibility for patient care moves from one health care team to another. In BC pediatric patients with congenital heart disease are transferred from the Children's Heart Centre to the Pacific Adult Congenital Heart Dis\u00ad ease program at age 18. Resources that can aid in transition and transfer include toolkits developed through the Transitioning Responsibly to Adult Care initiative and information provided by the iHeartChange web\u00ad site. Primary care considerations for young adult patients include cardiac surveillance and screening, sexual and reproductive health, and psy\u00ad chosocial health. The population of congenital heart disease patients is growing and aging, and continued attention will be needed to ensure these patients move successfully from pediatric to adult care.Population estimates indicate there are approximately 12 000 adults with moderate and se- vere congenital heart disease (CHD) in British Columbia. The significant increase in patient numbers (estimated growth to be more than 5% per year) is attributable to the excellent survival outcomes for young patients with CHD achieved in past decades and the greater awareness of services for these patients. Services include pediatric care provided through the Children's Heart Centre at BC Children's Hos- pital (BCCH) and adult care provided through the Pacific Adult Congenital Heart Disease (PACH) clinic at St. Ms LeComte is a clinical nurse specialist in the Pacific Adult Congenital Heart (PACH) clinic, Division of Cardiology, St. Paul's Hospital.

Ensuring a successful transition and transfer from pediatric to adult care is critical to maintaining patient health in adulthood. There are 15 specialized adult CHD centres across the country, all belonging to the Canadian Adult Con- genital Heart network or CACH net- work (www.cachnet.org). The PACH clinic is one of five that offer a full range of services and qualifies as a supraregional centre. CACH network has been instrumental in establishing templates and guidelines for standard- ized follow-up of many adult CHD conditions. Building on this work, the Canadian Cardiac Society (CCS) con- vened a panel of international experts for an adult CHD consensus confer - ence in 1996.1 Foremost among the proposals arising from this forum was a recommendation that all patients be referred to specialized centres for on- going care. Mylotte and colleagues documented an increase in referrals to specialized centres in Quebec after publication of the CCS recommenda- tions in 1998, and demonstrated that referral was independently associated with a significant decrease in mortal- ity, supporting the model of special- ized care for patients with adult CHD.2 Pacific Adult Congenital Heart clinic The PACH clinic was established at Shaughnessy Hospital in 1988 to re- spond to a gap in health services for adults with CHD, and moved to St. Paul's Hospital in 1993. The PACH team, a multidisciplinary group of health professionals with advanced training in adult CHD, is a unique provincial resource that provides comprehensive health services to CHD patients. The core team includes adult and pediatric cardiologists, car - diac surgeons, cardiac radiologists, patient educators (registered nurses), a clinical nurse specialist, a psycholo- gist, a genetic counselor, and a social worker. Additional specialists are re- cruited as required. Services provided include consultation, ongoing medi- cal care, cardiac surgery, cardiac in- tervention, electrophysiology proce- dures, diagnostic imaging, obstetrical care, and patient and family education and counseling. Patients are discussed at week- ly case conferences and bimonthly morbidity and mortality rounds. Car - diology fellows, residents, medical students, and other health care profes- sionals in training also attend, which ensures ongoing education for those caring for this patient population. There is a PACH physician on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to assist physicians and other health care pro- viders throughout the province. The PACH team provides comprehen - sive, cost-effective care to adults with CHD. A team approach to care is integral to optimizing the health of this com- plex patient population. The PACH patient educators are the initial point of contact for both patients and commu- nity health care providers. The patient educators provide case management and liaise on a daily basis with the PACH team to support patient well- ness and assist with the challenges of navigating the health care system. During clinic visits, patient-centred education is based on a chronic dis- ease self-management model. When patients have a better understanding of their individual cardiac condition they are able to recognize concerning symptoms, communicate effectively with their health care providers, and determine when it is appropriate to seek medical attention. Patient educa- tors are available to provide ongoing support in these areas and to facili - tate self-management by connecting patients with resources when nec- essary. Telehealth services support patients and their health care provid- ers to manage their CHD and facili- tate additional patient education out - side clinic hours. The PACH clinic currently fol - lows 2700 active patients and has a wait time of 3 to 4 months for patients to be seen on a nonurgent basis. The volume of patients served has almost tripled in the last decade and the clin - ic has been advocating for expanded services. To accommodate the grow- ing population of adults with CHD throughout BC, a closer-to-home care model, patterned on the success A team approach to care is integral to optimizing the health of this complex patient population.391 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgEnsuring a successful transition and transfer from pediatric to adult care in patients with congenital heart disease of BCCH's Cardiology Partnership Program, is being explored to bring adult CHD services to communities outside the Lower Mainland. Partner - ing with communities and local health care providers has proven successful when serving other populations with chronic health conditions. Bringing the expertise of adult CHD specialists to communities across the province would support care providers in local communities to deliver quality care to this group of complex patients. Moving from pediatric to adult care Currently most children born with CHD are surviving, and can be ex - pected to thrive well into their adult years. There are now more adults than children with CHD. With the surgical advancements of the past several dec- ades, 95% of pediatric congenital heart disease patients will now trans- fer to adult care, the largest growth in this population being youth with com- plex CHD.3,4 Adults with CHD are pursuing advanced education, build- ing careers, and starting families of their own. Lifelong cardiac follow-up is required to achieve the best health outcomes for these patients. To sup- port seamless cardiac care across the lifespan of a congenital heart patient, a structured transition process fol- lowed by a transfer of care is neces- sary. Transition and transfer A successful transition and transfer from pediatric to adult CHD care sup- ports youth attachment to a primary care physician and specialty clinic(s) and ensures continuity of care. Tran- sition refers to a process that begins in early adolescence and continues through early adulthood when health care management shifts from the family to the patient.5,6 Transfer is an event that occurs when the patient moves from one health care team to another. When transition and trans- fer from pediatric to adult health care are less than optimal, the repercus- sions can be serious, and may include hospital admissions, adverse health events, and even death.7 The poten- tial for residual disease and compli- cations following childhood manage- ment of CHD necessitates lifelong surveillance for arrhythmias, ventric - ular failure, and the need for further surgery.3 An estimated 30% to 70% of CHD patients are lost to follow-up or experience lapses in care,8,9 situations that expose them to greater risk of adverse health outcomes. Gaps in care are more frequent in males, in those with mild and moderate defects, and in patients with a history of follow- up outside an adult CHD clinic.4,8,9 Additional challenges to successful transition include patient adherence, relocation, and attachment to a spe- cialty clinic.6 As CHD patients move from a family-centred pediatric model of care to an autonomous adult model, self-management and self-advocacy skills become essential.10 Transition and transfer must be seen as essential elements in the care of patients with CHD. Expert consensus recommends that structured plans be developed to facilitate the transition process.6 Multiple tools and strategies have been developed and are being evalu- ated to support the transition and transfer process for youth with CHD as they move from the Children's Heart Centre at BCCH to the PACH program at St. Paul's Hospital when they reach age 18. ON TRAC initiative Transitioning Responsibly to Adult Care (ON TRAC) is a provincial initiative that supports youth with chronic health conditions as they pre- pare to move from pediatric care and then as they transfer and attach them- selves to the adult health care system. Using a framework from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Triple Aim framework, ON TRAC consists of four separately funded projects fo- cused on policy change, clinical prac- tice, health system performance, and youth engagement. Key stakeholders are involved at every level to inform decisions, develop and test tools, and shape recommendations. ON TRAC is supported with funding from the Vancouver Foundation, BCCH, Child Multiple tools and strategies have been developed and are being evaluated to support the transition and transfer process for youth with CHD.392 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgEnsuring a successful transition and transfer from pediatric to adult care in patients with congenital heart disease Health BC, and the Shared Care Com- mittee (SCC) and Specialist Services Committee (SSC)\u2014joint committees of Doctors of BC and the BC Ministry of Health. ON TRAC reflects work done by groups of pediatric and adult care providers, patients, and families to address gaps that have traditionally been a challenge in the transition from pediatric to adult care by: Preparing youth and families with skills to function in the adult sys- tem. Supporting health care providers through clinical guidelines, train - ing, tools, and online resources. Defining the role of community- based family physicians in provid- ing continuity of care. Defining appropriate referral path- ways and care requirements for youth with complex health condi- tions. The ON TRAC package of transi - tion and transfer tools for CHD pa - tients, family members, and care pro- viders was developed to ensure that a comprehensive transfer of care occurs when the transition is complete. The package includes: Transition Clinical Pathways (TCP) form: Developed through BCCH, this form is used to guide the prepa- ration of youth and document their readiness to manage their care in the adult care system. The TCP is provided to adult specialists and community-based family practi- tioners at the time of transfer. The form lists cardiac-specific tests and reports and highlights areas where additional education and support are required to help the young pa- tient acquire the knowledge and skills needed for self-management. (www.bcchildrens.ca/transition-to -adult-care/Documents/TCPCOM PLEXCARDIOLOGY .pdf) Medical Transfer Summary (MTS) form: Developed with the support of BCCH and the SCC, this form ensures that the family physician, community care providers, and the specialty clinic receive a compre- hensive summary of the medical history (including details about medica- tions, immunizations), psychoso- cial considerations future care. (www.bcchildrens .ca/transition-to-adult-care/Docu ments/MTSCARDIOTemplate Dec2015.pdf) Transition Care Management Plan (TCMP): Developed with the sup- port of the SSC, the TCMP helps community care providers un- derstand the care requirements of patients with CHD. The TCMP consists of background informa- tion (purpose, brief description of lesion and management, recom- mendations for use of the plan) and delineates the role of the primary care physician and adult CHD spe- cialist. It outlines the potential risks associated with the specific le- sion, health surveillance and clini- cal evaluation recommendations, sexual and reproductive health considerations, and noncardiac sur - gery and procedures. The TCMP also outlines patient counseling recommendations for medications, exercise, and lifestyle consider - ations. TCMPs will be available online beginning November 2016. The TCMP website will contain the template and tips on how to devel- op a plan. These materials will be posted on the ON TRAC website in the health care provider toolkit. ON TRAC website: The website provides access to toolkits for youth, families, and health care providers. The youth toolkit helps patients de- velop the skills and obtain the sup- port required for an effective tran- sition into adulthood and the adult health care system. With the help of videos, self-directed activities, and other resources, youth can develop self-advocacy and self-management skills, obtain peer support, engage in educational, vocational, and financial planning, and learn more about sexu- al health and healthy lifestyle choic- es.

(www.ontracbc.ca) iHeartChange The website iHeartChange (https:// iheartchange.org) is a CHD-specific, empirically studied Internet resource developed for youth, families and friends, and health care providers. The website provides introductions to adult care teams in many North American communities, medical and lifestyle information, and suggestions for becoming independent and cop - ing with CHD. Users must create an account to access the site, but there is no cost or restriction otherwise. Youth can earn a Transition Diploma by vis- iting the various sections of the site and answering questions about living with CHD.11 Primary care considerations The primary care physician plays an essential role in the transition and transfer process. Children and youth who are not well connected to a pri - mary care physician may not devel- op an effective relationship with the health care system as young adults.12 Given the centralized nature of sub- specialty care, young adult CHD patients may also not learn about the resources available in their home com- munities.13 In addition, concerns have been raised by general internal medi- cine specialists regarding inadequate exposure and knowledge regarding children with complex pediatric dis- orders and the unique health and psy- chosocial aspects of these adolescents and young adults.14 Young adults who have a strong relationship with a community physi- cian are more likely to have a success-ful transition to adult care and to re- ceive appropriate health maintenance advice and ongoing care regarding the following primary care consider - ations. Surveillance, screening, and counseling Patients with CHD and acquired val- vular heart disease are at risk for in- fective endocarditis and may require antibiotic prophylaxis.15 As well as being considered for appropriate anti - biotic prophylaxis, patients should be screened for acquired cardiac risk factors such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, and counseled regarding nutrition and the use of to- bacco, marijuana, alcohol, and drugs. Lifestyle choices such as body pier - cing and tattoos should also be dis- cussed. Sexual and reproductive health Discussion may be needed about con- cerns regarding body image that can affect a young patient's self-esteem and have an impact on sexuality and sexual choices. The risk of having a child with CHD should be reviewed with both men and women, and fetal echocardiography should be offered to all prospective parents. Specific issues regarding contraception and pregnancy must be discussed with women. Most women with CHD have no limits on contraceptive choice, and counseling can focus on efficacy and individual needs. The exception is women with an increased thrombo - sis risk in which the use of combined estrogen/progestin oral contracep- tives should be avoided. This group can use progestin (only) agents, such as oral or implanted agents. Preconception counseling to re- view the potential risks and safety of a pregnancy may be organized with the Cardiac Obstetrics (COB) clinic at St. Paul's Hospital. Sports and physical activity participation The vast majority of youth and young adults with CHD can participate in physical activity and sport with mini- mal restrictions. Exercise recommen- dations outlined by the congenital cardiologist should be supported by the primary care provider. Psychosocial health Health care providers may fail to detect psychosocial distress if they do not ask about it or deliberately screen for it as part of routine care. The most straightforward way is to ask patients about specific challenges or difficult feelings that they may be experienc- ing in daily life, and to provide appro- priate mental health referrals when needed. In North America, approxi- mately 1 in 3 adults with CHD have clinical levels of depression and anxi- ety,16-19 even when these patients are assumed to be well adjusted by their cardiologists.16 Regardless of for - mal psychiatric status, many adults with CHD face potential psychoso- cial challenges as a result of growing up with a complex health condition. Common challenges include disease management, intrapersonal and emo- tional issues, impaired social func - tioning, educational and vocational difficulties, and poor health behav- iors.20-23 It is unclear whether psy- chosocial functioning is worst among patients with more complex CHD.23 A number of factors24,25 may contribute to lower psychological functioning: Female sex. Low capacity for exercise. Restrictions placed by physician. Body image concerns/perception of scarring. Perceived health status. Loneliness/social anxiety/fear of negative evaluation/poor social support/poor social problem- solving abilities.394 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgEnsuring a successful transition and transfer from pediatric to adult care in patients with congenital heart disease Poor academic performance. Perceived financial strain. Many patients with CHD report feeling \"different,\" and the therapeu- tic relationship may improve if both patients and providers view them- selves as partners of equal status in the health care process. There are a number of excellent review papers about common psychosocial issues in CHD for the interested reader.23,25-27 Referring patients to the PACH clinic Patients age 18 and older with mod- erate and severe congenital heart dis- ease ( Table ) should be referred to the PACH clinic (see Box for contact information). Patients with simple disease may benefit from visiting the clinic once to confirm that their diag- noses are correct. Patients with sim- ple disease may also visit the clinic under special circumstances such as during pregnancy, or to obtain advice on treating complications such as arrhythmias. Patients with an urgent referral can be seen within days. For non- urgent referrals, the wait time is approximately 3 to 4 months. Before an appointment is booked, the clinic obtains all previous cardiac catheter -ization and cardiac surgical reports. Each patient is unique and surgi- cal repairs may have been modified. Reports from previous consultations and procedures (pediatric cardiology, cardiac surgery, and adult cardiology) are helpful, as are imaging reports. The clinic orders appropriate inves- tigations prior to the patient's clinic appointment, usually on the same day for patients from outside the Lower Mainland, so that a comprehensive assessment can be provided at the time of the consultation. Summary Approximately 12 000 adults with moderate and severe congenital heart disease live in British Columbia. Pediatric patients with CHD are fol - lowed through the Children's Heart Centre at BCCH and are transferred to the PACH program at St. Paul's Hospital at age 18. To accommodate the growing population of adults with CHD, a closer-to-home care model is being explored as a way to bring adult congenital cardiology services to additional communities throughout BC. A successful transition and trans- fer from pediatric to adult care sup- ports youth attachment to a primary care provider and ensures that conti- nuity of care is maintained. Resourc- es that aid in transition and transfer include toolkits developed for the ON TRAC initiative and the iHeart- Change website. Primary care considerations in- clude surveillance and screening, sexual and reproductive health, and psychosocial health. Patients with moderate and severe CHD should be followed by the multidisciplinary team at the PACH clinic, while those with simple disease may benefit from visiting the clinic once to confirm that their diagnoses are correct. The population of adults with CHD is growing and aging.

I am deeply honored to have been asked by his family to write a few words about my very good friend and colleague. Jim leaves behind his best friend and bride of 55 years, Dixie; his daughters Lisa (Brian), Shelley (Ron), and Jackie (Mark); his son, Robert (Theresa); and a brood of 10 grandchildren who all adored him. First and foremost Jim was a Prai- rie boy, and you could take the boy from the Prairies but you could never take the Prairies away from the boy. Jim was born 82 years ago in Consort, Alberta, population 700 souls and home to two famous personages: Jim Holmes and singer k.d. lang. Follow- ing his formative years in Consort, the family moved to Mirror, Alberta. During his teen years Jim worked as a fireman on the steam engines of the day. He also became an accomplished baseball player, and it is rumored that he was scouted by one of the big American League teams. Undergraduate studies were at the University of Alberta, and then med- ical school followed by postgraduate studies in internal medicine at the Montreal General Hospital, and an exchange in Charlotte, North Caro - lina, and the famous Hammersmith Hospital in London, England. These studies came to an untimely halt when Jim's brother, Jack was tra- gically killed in an air crash and Jim and Dixie returned to Canada to com- plete his fellowship at the University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton.Jim and Dixie moved to Kelow- na in 1965 and he practised internal medicine at what was then known as the Knox Clinic. My wife, Bitten, and I came to Kelowna 1 year prior to Jim's arrival and our friendship developed quickly. This friendship was cemented by nearly 45 years of annual bird hunting trips to the Prai- ries for the four of us. Jim was in his element on these trips and many were our exploits. He was a fan of W.O. Mitchell and his book Who Has Seen the Wind, and he always delighted in showing us the wind. While ranging across the Prairies, Jim would bring the vehicle to a screeching stop and we would all hop out and actually look at the wind. Not at the grass and trees but, when the light was right, you could actually see the wind! This will stay with me forever. I would now like to review for you the advances in medicine made at our Kelowna General Hospital thanks to Dr Jim Holmes. Jim started the first respiratory service in our hospital and introduced the I.C.U. and Emer - gency Department to the Bird respir - ator, which was cutting edge at the time. This was followed some years later by Jim introducing our hospital's first dialysis program using peritoneal dialysis. This is now a full hemodialy - sis program. Jim then established the first cancer clinic in Kelowna and the Interior. He got the first chemotherapy program developed and indeed was our very first oncologist in Kelowna. He then worked incredibly hard to get our full-service cancer clinic to where it is today. This legacy will be hard to match indeed! Jim will be sorely missed by his friends and colleagues, and our thoughts and best wishes are with his wife, Dixie, and their family. \u2014Jim Tisdale, MD KelownaDr G. Barrie Purves 1942-2016 Dr Barrie died 11 March 2016 from complications of multiple myeloma for which he had been suc- cessfully treated for nearly 14 years. He is survived by this wife, Sherrill Purves; three daughters; and four grandchildren. Dr Purves graduated from the University of Saskatchewan in 1967 and, after interning at Chicago Cook County Hospital, moved to BC to do his residency in neurosurgery at Van- couver General Hospital/UBC Hospi- tal, which he completed in 1975. Dr Purves was active on the committee that negotiated the first PARI contract for UBC residents. He then joined Dr Brian Hunt at Lions Gate Hospital and together they built a busy practice in North Vancouver, which extended to include Burnaby with active privi- leges at Burnaby General Hospital. They maintained full coverage of these services with a 1-in-2 call for 12 years before they were joined by a third neurosurgeon. Dr Purves also found time to serve as head of the Department of Surgery at Lions Gate Hospital, then chief of staff at Lions Gate Hospital in the 1980s, and as the North Shore representative for Doc-397 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgtors of BC from 1982-84. In 1992, frustrated by the lack of resources to treat the neurosurgery patients in BC, Dr Purves left the province to join three neurosurgeons in a neurosurgery group in Sioux City, Iowa. He worked there at two hospitals (Mercy Medical Center and St. Luke's Medical Center) and then played an important role in establish- ing a Speciality Surgical Center in North Sioux City, South Dakota. His interpersonal skills were also critical for establishing a multidisciplinary group practice called the Center for Neurosciences and Spine. He retired from that practice in 2004 after 2 years of treatment for multiple myeloma. Fortunately Dr Purves was able to enjoy another 12 years of pursuing his hobbies and friendships, which included a passion for good food and wine, travelling the world to see the wine-growing regions, teaching neurosurgery for 1 month for each of 3 years in Indonesia with the inter - national group FIENS, hunting and building, and enjoying his grandchil - dren as they arrived. Dr Purves is remembered by patients, friends, and family as a car - ing, competent, and compassionate man who enjoyed life with a twinkle in his eye, and who endured the tri - als of his medical treatments for many years with grace and fortitude. \u2014Sherrill Purves, MD North Vancouver \u2014Brian Hunt, MD North VancouverDr John William Ibbott 1929-2016 The death of Dr Bill Ibbott on 26 May 2016 marks the end of a remark- able medico-political career. It is worth remembering that the weekend demanded a great deal of Dr Ibbott's otherwise private life with so many official board meetings held both pro- vincially and nationally. I served on many executive pro- vincial and national boards with Dr Ibbott, and knew him well while he was president of the then-BCMA from 1975-76 and I from 1976-77 (and 1982-83). It was true that we were often in opposition to each other but this had some valuable political advantages. When we met with pro- vincial health ministers we were able to use our most effective arguments and I do not remember Dr Ibbott ever using our political disagreements at such meetings. Dr Ibbott had a total devotion to high-quality health care for all Canadians. It will be for this that he will be remembered by so many of us, and we owe him gratitude for his lifetime commitment. \u2014William Jory, MD London, UKThanks to the following advertis- ers for their support of this issue of the BC Medical Journal.

Between 1990 and 2015, Work- SafeBC saw nearly 6000 shoulder dislocations, with 27.8% occurring in patients age 25 or younger. Surgery has often been reserved for cases of recurrence, but the literature suggests that young patients may benefit from primary surgical stabilization sooner rather than later. The primary concern with shoul- der dislocations in young patients\u2014 after acute management\u2014is recur - rence. Recurrence rates for young patients range from 54% to 100%.2-14 The upper limit of what constitutes a \"young patient\" varies slightly from paper to paper, but it is usually con- sidered to be between the ages of 20 and 25. Recurrence rates decrease as the patient ages; the older the patient, the lower the risk of recurrence\u2014to the point where the recurrence rate is around 6% in patients over 40 years old.4 The concern with recurrence is twofold: increased risk of arthropa- thy, and bony loss necessitating a more invasive surgical stabilization procedure. Radiographic evalua- tion for degenerative changes at 25 years following initial injury found a prevalence rate of 56%, as compared to approximately 20% in the general population.15 Shoulders with no recur - rence were found to have less arthrop- athy than those that became stable over time or were persistently unsta- ble. Patients whose shoulders were surgically stabilized had no difference in terms of moderate or severe degen- erative changes compared to soli- tary dislocators.15 The second - rence concern, both the glenoid and humeral Hill-Sach's lesions\u2014a compression fracture of the humeral head\u2014are estimated to occur in 40% to 90% of all primary disloca - tions and near 100% of recurrent dis- locations.16,17 Sufficient glenoid wear can necessitate a more invasive and complex bony procedure (such as a Latarjet), or can lead to failure of a soft-tissue procedure (such as a Ban- kart repair) if not recognized. Glenoid insufficiency has been reported in up to 40% of primary dislocations and up to 90% of patients with recurrent shoulder instability.16,18,19 A quantita - tive study on glenoid bone loss found an exponential relationship between the degree of anterior glenoid flatten - ing and the number of dislocations.18 Because of the high incidence of recurrence in young, first-time trau- matic shoulder dislocators, as well as the detrimental effects of recur - rence, there is a movement toward primary surgical stabilization. Stud- ies have shown a marked reduction in the recurrence rate when this group of patients is treated with a primary repair compared to conservative man- agement using immobilization tech- niques.20-23 There is also evidence for surgically stabilized shoulders having a lower rate of arthropathy, as com- pared to shoulders with recurrent instability.15,24 In fact, as mentioned earlier, a 25-year prospective study found stabilized shoulders to have no significant difference from solitary dislocations in terms of moderate/severe arthropathy, but had apprecia - bly less than shoulders with recurrent instability.15 Historically primary traumatic an- terior shoulder dislocations have been treated conservatively, and surgical stabilization has often been reserved for cases of recurrence. The data sug- gest that the cohort of young patients with high-demand activities or occu- pations may be better served with pri- mary surgical stabilization. As such, patients under age 25 with a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation should be referred to an orthopaedic shoulder specialist for a discussion regarding the risks and options. Patients under age 20 are the most likely to benefit from primary stabilization. For further information or assistance If you have questions or require assis- tance with a worker patient, especially one who is less than 25 years of age, with a traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation, please contact a medical advisor in your nearest WorkSafeBC office. \u2014Derek Smith, MD, FRCS(C) WorkSafeBC Orthopaedic Specialist Advisor References 1.

The following notable changes are now in effect across Canada: The upper age limit for donating has been eliminated. Donors over the age of 71 no longer need to have their physician fill out an assess- ment form before donating blood. Donors who have a history of most cancers (e.g., breast cancer, thyroid cancer, prostate cancer) will be eli - gible to donate if they have been cancer free for 5 years. This change does not apply to those with a his- tory of hematological cancers (e.g., lymphomas, leukemia, melanoma). Donors who have recently received most vaccines, such as a flu shot, will no longer need to wait 2 days before donating blood. Donors who were born in or lived in some African countries (Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Niger, and Nigeria) are now eligible to do- nate blood. HIV testing performed on blood donors can now detect HIV strains found in these coun- tries. Geographic deferrals affecting West- ern Europe have been revised based on scientific evidence that indicates the risk of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has decreased since January 2008. Donors who spent 5 years or more in Western Europe since 1980 are deferred from donating blood, but Canadian Blood Services is now including an end date of 2007. Do- nors who reached the 5-year limit in Western Europe after 2007 will now be eligible to donate blood. The complete policy changes are available at www.blood.ca/en/blood/ recent-changes-donation-criteria.

First clinical guidelines in Canada for pain following spinal cord injury Researchers at Lawson Health Re- search Institute in Ontario have de- veloped clinical practice guidelines for managing neuropathic pain with patients who have experienced a spinal cord injury. The research team worked with care providers at Park- wood Institute, part of the St. Joseph's Health Care London family, and an international panel to address the unique challenges for managing pain during recovery and rehabilitation. Dr Eldon Loh, Lawson researcher and physical medicine and rehabili- tation specialist at St. Joseph's, and his team recognized that pain can be an overlooked part of a spinal cord injury and plays a major factor in the success of rehabilitation. The results of the 3-year process led to recom - mendations for screening and diag- nosis, treatment, and models of care. Important clinical considerations accompany each recommendation. The research will inform new tools and resources for care providers and patients. The new guidelines have been published in Spinal Cord and are available online at www.nature.com/ sc/journal/v54/n1s/full/sc201688a .html. The Ontario Neurotrauma Foun- dation and Rick Hansen Institute pro- vided funding for the research study. Seniors with undiagnosed hearing loss can become isolated UBC Okanagan researchers exam- ined the impact of undiagnosed or untreated hearing issues in seniors age 60 to 69. The study found that for every 10-decibel drop in hearing sensitivity, the odds of social isolation increased by 52%. Among the sample of seniors, a 10-decibel reduction of hearing sensitivity was also associ- ated with cognitive declines equiva- lent to almost 4 years of chronological aging. Lead author Dr Paul Mick is a physician and clinical assistant pro- fessor at UBC's Southern Medical Program. The study examined data collected between 1999 and 2010 by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a survey that samples 5000 people each year across the United States. The survey exam- ined demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related issues. Dr Mick would like to expand his re- search to see if interventions such as a hearing screening program similar to what is done for young children could positively impact health outcomes for Canadian seniors. The study, \"Is hearing loss asso- ciated with poorer health in older adults who might benefit from hear - ing screening?\" was published in the May/June 2016 issue of Ear and Hearing. Depression screening tools not accurate for children and adolescents According to new Canadian research, there is insufficient evidence to show that the various short questionnaires physicians use to ask about symptoms of depression in children and adoles- cents accurately screen 6- to 18-year- olds for the disease. Researchers believe this calls into question the use of these assessment tools for this group and raises worries about possi- ble misdiagnosis of the disease in this age range. To assess the quality of the screen- ing tools that are currently being used to identify depression in children or adolescents, researchers carried out a search of the medical evidence look- ing for studies that put the screening tools to the test. They identified only 17 studies where the test results from the screening tools were compared with results from a diagnostic inter - view to determine if the children or adolescents in the study actually had depression. Lead author Dr Michelle Rose- man, who is affiliated with the Jewish General Hospital's Lady Davis Insti- tute for Medical Research in Mon - treal, and colleagues then assessed the methodology and results of these 17 studies. They found that most of the studies were too small to make a valid determination about the accu- racy of the screening tools and that the methods of most studies fell short of expected standards. They also found that there was inadequate evi- dence to recommend any single cutoff score for any of the questionnaires. (Patients scoring above a pre-defined cutoff score are considered likely to be depressed, whereas patients below the cutoff are not.) Researchers suggest that, given the inaccuracy of the tools currently being used, some children could end up mislabeled as depressed, and that large, well-designed studies that pres- ent results across a range of cutoff scores are needed to properly assess the accuracy of depression screening tools in children. The study, \"Accuracy of depres- sion screening tools to detect major depression in children and adolescents: Continued from page 403 Doctors of BC Annual Report survey, winner Congratulations to Dr Katharine McKeen of Victoria, winner of the Doctors of BC 2015-16 Annual Report survey contest.

Middle-age memory decline a matter of changing focus According to a study by McGill Uni- versity researchers, the inability to remember details that begins in early midlife (the 40s) may be the result of a change in what information the brain focuses on during memory formation and retrieval, rather than a decline in brain function. Senior author Natasha Rajah, di - rector of the Brain Imaging Centre at McGill University's Douglas Institute and associate professor in McGill's Department of Psychiatry, identifies that a key question in current memory research concerns which changes to the aging brain are normal and which are not, and that most of the work on aging and memory has concentrated on understanding brain changes later in life. This research was aimed at ad- dressing what happens at midlife in healthy aging and how this relates to findings in late life. In the study, 112 healthy adults ranging in age from 19 to 76 years were shown a series of faces and were asked to recall where a particu - lar face appeared on the screen (left or right) and when it appeared (least or most recently). Researchers then used functional MRI to analyze which parts of brain were activated during recall of these details. Dr Rajah and colleagues found that young adults activated their visu- al cortex while successfully perform- ing this task, while middle-aged and older adults didn't show the same level of visual cortex activation when they recalled the information. Instead, their medial prefrontal cortex was activated. Even though middle-aged and old- er participants didn't perform as well as younger ones in this experiment, Dr Rajah suggests that it may be wrong to regard the response of the middle- aged and older brains as impairment, but rather that it may reflect changes in what adults deem important infor - mation as they age. Researchers also concluded that middle-aged and older adults might improve their recall abil - ities by learning to focus on external rather than internal information. Dr Rajah is currently analyzing data from a similar study to discern if there are any gender differences in middle-aged brain function as it relates to memory, noting that women go through a lot of hormonal change at midlife. The question is, how much of these results is driven by post - menopausal women? The study, \"Changes in the modu- lation of brain activity during context encoding vs. context retrieval across the adult lifespan,\" was published in the October 2016 issue of Neuro- Image. This research was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and by a grant from the Alzheimer's Society of Canada. Half of patients with depression are inadequately treated UBC research shows that about 50% of British Columbians with depres- sion are not receiving the basic level of care, and authors say the findings highlight the challenges of accessing mental health services across Canada. It is estimated that 1 in 20 peo- ple experience depression each year. Joseph Puyat, a PhD candidate in UBC's School of Population and Public Health and a research meth- odologist at the Centre for Health pulsimeter Continued from page 404 407 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgpulsimeter Evaluation and Outcome Sciences, and his colleagues reviewed health data from almost 110 000 British Columbians diagnosed with depres - sion by physicians between 2010 and 2011, and examined whether these individuals received either one of the two recommended treatment options: antidepressants or psychotherapy. They found that only 13% of people received at least four psychothera- py or counseling sessions and 47% received antidepressant medication for at least 12 weeks. Overall, about 53% received the minimum threshold of treatment. Researchers believe that their findings underestimate the full extent of the problem since many people do not seek or receive a diagnosis for their depression because of issues around stigma or access to a physi- cian. Mr Puyat compared these find- ings to results from the Statistics Canada 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey and found that the BC data are comparable. In the national survey, 4 out of 10 Canadians who struggle with depression indicate they are not accessing any services to treat depression. He suggests that provinces need to look at the services covered for mental health and how patients access care (e.g., Canadians only receive public health coverage for counseling from medical doctors, yet many family physicians don't have the time or training to provide counseling services). The study, \"How often do indi- viduals with major depression adequate treatment? A population-based, data linkage study,\" was published in the July 2016 issue of the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry . Scientists develop microneedle system to monitor drugs Researchers at UBC and the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) in Switzerland have created a microneedle drug-monitoring system that could one day replace blood draws and improve patient comfort. The system consists of a small thin patch that is pressed against a patient's arm during medi- cal treatment and measures drugs in the bloodstream painlessly without drawing any blood. The tiny needle- like projection, less than 0.5 mm long, resembles a hollow cone and doesn't pierce the skin like a standard hypo- dermic needle. Researcher Sahan Ranamukhaa- rach chi, a PhD student and Vanier scholar in UBC's Faculties of Ap- plied Science and Pharmaceutical Sciences, developed this technology during a research exchange at PSI. Microneedles are designed to punc- ture the outer layer of skin, but not the next layers of epidermis and the dermis, which house nerves, blood vessels, and active immune cells. The microneedle created by Mr Ranamukhaarachchi and his col- leagues was developed to monitor the antibiotic vancomycin, which is used to treat serious infections and is administered through an intravenous line. Patients taking the antibiotic un- dergo three to four blood draws per day and need to be closely monitored because vancomycin can cause life- threatening toxic side effects. Re- searchers discovered that they could use the fluid found just below the out- er layer of skin, instead of blood, to monitor levels of vancomycin in the bloodstream. The microneedle col- lects less than a millionth of a mil- lilitre of fluid, and a reaction occurs on the inside of the microneedle that researchers can detect using an opti- cal sensor. This technique allows re - searchers to quickly determine the concentration of vancomycin. The microneedle monitoring system is described in a paper pub- lished in the July 2016 issue of Sci - entific Reports, \"Integrated hollow microneedle-optofluidic biosensor for therapeutic drug monitoring sub-nanoliter volumes.\" Correction: Dr Erik Paterson, 1941-2016 Dr Paterson's year of graduation from the University of Glasgow School of Medicine was incorrectly listed as 1960 in the In Memoriam piece pub- lished in the BCMJ [2016;58:319- 320].

Canadian technology uses speech to track Alzheimer disease A new technology that analyzes a person's natural speech to detect and monitor Alzheimer disease and other cognitive disorders won the AGE- WELL Pitch Competition: Technol- ogy to Support People with Demen- tia. The tablet-based assessment tool records short samples of a person's speech as they describe a picture on the screen and extracts hundreds of variables from the samples. Because of word-finding diffi- culties, people with Alzheimer dis- ease will tend to pause more between words and the complexity of their vocabulary is reduced. The technol- ogy uses artificial intelligence to analyze about 400 variables, such as pitch, tone, prosody (rhythm), and rate of speech, as well as pauses and choice of words. In the laboratory, the software can reliably identify Alz- heimer disease, Parkinson disease, and aphasia with between 85% and 100% accuracy. Researchers are set to begin field tests in assisted living and home care settings. The tool will be used in sen- iors' facilities to improve ongoing monitoring of residents' cognitive health, provide family members with quantifiable updates, and help people plan when it's time to transition to a higher level of care. Liam Kaufman, CEO and co- founder of Winterlight Labs, devel- oped the tool with Dr Frank Rudzicz, Maria Yancheva, and Katie Fra- ser of the University of Toronto. Dr Continued on page 409408 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgInfluenza vaccine has been admin - istered to pregnant women since the 1950s, initially to those with high-risk medical conditions such as chronic heart or lung disease and later to health care workers. Since the 1990s, use in pregnancy has been expanded more broadly in many countries in recognition of the risk of influenza-related complications and benefits to both mother and infant, with even higher rates of use in pregnancy during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic because of severity of the infection in pregnancy. In the United States, influenza vaccine coverage in pregnant women has exceeded 50% since the 2009-10 season,1 and while seasonal uptake data in pregnancy are not available in Canada, coverage among pregnant women in BC dur - ing the 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 cam - paign was 54%. Inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended for all pregnant wom- en at any stage of pregnancy during the influenza season, typically from November through April each year.2,3 Benefits include maternal protection against influenza-associated morbid - ity, including hospitalization for car - diopulmonary complications, the rate of which progressively increases with duration of the pregnancy and is max- imal in the third trimester. Maternal immunization is also associated with reduced risk of influenza and associ- ated hospitalization of the infant, and infants born to vaccinated women have lower rates of prematurity, low birth weight, and being small for their gestational age.4 Protection of the in- fant occurs through two mechanisms: directly through passive transfer of bc centre for disease control Influenza vaccine in pregnancy: Is it safe? humoral immunity from the mother in utero, and indirectly through cocoon- ing by immunization of close house- hold contacts and caregivers. Direct protection by infant vaccination is not achievable with current vaccines prior to 6 months of age. Historically, both drugs and vac- cines have been used sparingly in pregnancy. Avoidance of vaccines has been largely based on theoreti - cal concerns about teratogenicity of live vaccines such as rubella and vari- cella, which have not been borne out. A secondary consideration for avoid- ing vaccines has been that an anom- aly will be misattributed to vaccine, especially if received in the first tri- mester. Influenza vaccination during pregnancy is associated with a brief increase in maternal inflammatory biomarkers, but this response is not associated with fetal development and risk of congenital anomalies.5 At its June 2013 meeting, the World Health Organization Global Advisory Com- mittee on Vaccine Safety concluded from their review of vaccine safety in pregnancy that there is no evidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes from vaccination in pregnancy with inac- tivated virus (including influenza), bacterial, or toxoid vaccines.6,7 The historical precautionary ap-proach to use of vaccines in pregnan- cy and over two decades of recom- mendations for influenza vaccination in pregnancy mean that much of the data on influenza vaccine safety in pregnancy originate from observa - tional studies, including database reviews and postmarketing surveil- lance, instead of randomized trials; nevertheless, these have concluded that influenza vaccine is safe during pregnancy, including multidose prod- ucts containing thimerosal as a pre- servative.8-10 Additionally, many more recent studies have been conducted and several reviews of the literature have been published since 2009, as- sessing both 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 and seasonal inactivated influenza vaccines. These studies and reviews have examined the occurrence of pre- term birth, fetal death, stillbirth, spon- taneous abortion, and congenital mal - formations.11-13 These reviews have found an overall lack of association between influenza vaccine receipt and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and physicians can confidently reas- sure pregnant women about safety of influenza vaccines in pregnancy. Re- view authors commented on the need to define standards for future studies of vaccine safety in pregnancy to en- sure consistently defined end points; for instance, fetal death was variably defined in studies at gestations rang- ing from over 12 to over 25 weeks or over 500 grams. To this end the US National Institutes of Health con - vened an international consensus con- ference on harmonized safety moni - toring of immunization in pregnancy in late March 2016. Development of standards should pave the way for more consistent reporting of results from future studies, including pool- ing of results for meta-analyses.

At the same time the colonies were advertising for talent from Great Britain\u2014places like Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia had very active embassies in the UK at that time, recruiting people special feature Q&A with Dr Alan Ruddiman: Doctors of BC President 2016-17 Dr Ruddiman has practised full-service rural generalist medicine in the Okanagan Valley for the past 20 years. He lives and works in Oliver. BCMJ associate editor Joanne Jablkowski spoke with Dr Ruddiman 1 month into his presidency about his background, life experiences, and his ideas for the future of health care in BC. Here is a condensed version of their conversation. By Joanne Jablkowski to bring their talent, come overseas, build a new life\u2014and my parents saw opportunity in that. What ended up selling them on South Africa was that the embassy staff did a really good job promot- ing the fact that if you came to South Africa as a young immigrant couple and were hardworking there was no ceiling to what you could achieve. We were very privileged to move to South Africa while the country was going through some transformative and difficult changes, and to have been part of that history and change was phenomenal. How do you think that environment shaped your interests? When we arrived in the late 1960s there was a one-party state in the country, and the ruling government had been in power since 1948. So, having come from a country where you could promote yourself based on your skills and abilities, in South Africa one was very confronted by the class system, part of the colonial legacy. My parents raised us to recognize that we were going to be confronted by apartheid, but to be careful where we raised questions, explaining that everything was not as it appeared. We had access to a wonderful edu- cational system, and I have to say that in the '60s, '70s, and '80s, South Africa probably offered its citizens one of the most reliable and complex education systems in the world, even Photo: Lionel Trudel Photography Ltd.411 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgthough there was a significant dispar - ity in who had access to education at that time. After high school I selected a uni- versity where race was not considered as an access point, and Wits Univer - sity prided itself on challenging the government that there needed to be freedom of access to postsecond- ary education. That was a wonderful breeding ground for my activism and formed the qualities that framed my leadership profile. After you earned your medical degree in South Africa in the 1980s, what prompted your move to Canada? Most people will probably antici- pate that I chose to move because of the challenging political situation. It wasn't that; it was the challenging economy. Interest rates were phenom- enally high. When I graduated from medical school the interest rate on a credit card was something like 32% per annum. Interest rates on a mortgage were in the double digits. And I had a sizable student loan\u2014I came from a blue collar working family, so my fam- ily didn't finance my education. My dad co-signed my student loan and I accumulated that debt through 6 years of medical school and then through my internship and residency, so I was really motivated to clear my debt before I decided what my medical career was going to look like. Speaking to others, Canada seemed very welcoming to South African-trained physicians and other international medical graduates, and it didn't take long before I found a locum opportunity on the Prairies. The idea was to earn enough within 6 to 12 months that I could clear my stu- dent debt and decide what my medical career would look like after that. Do you have a memory from your first days in Canada that made an imprint on your professional direc- tion? When I started practising in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, even as a new entrant to Canada who could speak the language and was pretty well versed on the culture, I was confronted by how different medicine appeared to be. In South Africa people would arrive at hospitals or community clin - ics with sometimes very pressing health issues; the disease processes were sometimes very advanced. We were faced with the whole spectrum of what medicine could present to young doctors. In my Canadian community clinic I didn't see that same spectrum of nas- ty diseases. There were more nuances to medicine here. People presented much earlier in the context of their ill - ness. The person sitting across from me in the clinic would often look very, very well, as opposed to the sick, ill, and injured people that I had seen as part of my training in South Africa. You have two daughters who are now developing their own career paths. What advice do you give them about how they should shape their futures? We traveled a lot with the girls when they were young and we've given them, I hope, a broad global perspec- tive on how small this planet really is, how closely connected we are as human beings, and that we can all serve in different ways. We didn't raise either of our daughters to con- sider medicine or teaching, which is my wife's profession, as being the only two ways of serving society and having social accountability. And it shows in their behaviors. They value service; they're connected to society. My youngest daughter is definitely the most environmentally responsible person in our family. I think we've done a really good job in allowing our girls to embrace diverse thought. We look forward to seeing what careers they will choose. They have unique personalities and are going in different directions\u2014our oldest is working in hospitality and the hotel industry, and our youngest is doing a science degree at UBC at the Oka- nagan campus. What is the best advice you were ever given? My dad was a wonderful mentor. He left school at 16 with a grade 10 education and he said to me on many occasions, \"Alan, in knowledge there is power.\" He also provided me with an appreciation that talent comes through hard work and application\u2014 thousands of hours spent doing the same thing produces expertise. Tell me about your life in Oliver. How do you like to spend your time? It's very busy, but balanced. Hav- ing grown up in a family that valued the outdoors, I've always embraced experiencing what the world can give us. Not all rewards have to be mon- etary. We were an outdoor family\u2014in South Africa it's called caravanning, here it's RVing\u2014and when looking at where I'd like to live and work in Canada, the Interior of BC, and par - ticularly the South Okanagan, most closely represented the climate and geography that I was familiar with from my childhood. Also, because I trained at a gen - eralist hospital\u2014even though I had aspirations when I was younger to specialize in internal medicine or anesthesia\u2014when I came to Can- ada I embraced rural life and I felt I could contribute more by living and working in a rural community than I could in an urban or metropolitan community. I think service is really important\u2014caring about your neigh- bor, caring about the health of your community, not just one patient at a time as a family doctor or specialist might encounter in their practice, but thinking beyond that and being curi- ous about what can make your com- munity more vibrant. special feature Continued on page 412412 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgspecial feature If I can look back on my career one day and say that my community is more vibrant because of my pres- ence and the influence I've had, then I'll be a very happy professional when I retire. As an avid sailor, what is your dream sailing trip? We've lived the dream. Since the girls were very young Christina and I talk - ed about taking a year off for a sab- batical, and when our girls were 14 and 16 we did it. With a lot of thoughtful planning, we bought a boat in Florida and sailed for a year\u2014down the East Coast of Florida, we crossed the Gulf Stream of the Atlantic (some of the most diffi- cult waters for sailors to cross because the weather can be really unexpect- ed), and then we landed in the Baha- mas. There are 600 to 800 islands in the Bahamas, and when you get out to the outlying islands you start to experience what living and working in the Caribbean can be like. We lived aboard the boat for a year. The girls were excellent crew members. And the fact that we could all take responsibility for one another's well-being and safety and the wholesomeness of what we were doing was fantastic. Whether it's for 3 months or a year, I encourage all my colleagues to consider taking a sab - batical. It's energizing to disconnect from the day-to-day routines that put such significant demands on us. You get a chance to reflect on where you are in your career, your profession- alism, to consider if you are serving in the way that you were attracted to medicine to be able to do, what parts of your career you are finding reward- ing, what the challenging areas are. It was a really good introspective year. As a mid-career physician, I could reflect on what I would like to do moving forward, and to identify what was truly important to me and what else could I do to support society. What life lessons stand out to you from traveling with your family? We've tried to raise our girls to appre- ciate that we live in a society that is based on consumerism, in the first world, and whether it's the consump- tion of information or the overcon - sumption of food, or having to keep up with the Joneses and have the best, those shouldn't be values that drive us to feel that we've lived a complete life. The bigger question we should all be asking is, when I look back, am I going to know that I left the world in a better place than when I entered it? My measure of a satisfying life is the answer to, have I valued the people I have relationships with, and do they value me? I think you've truly lived when you're no longer anonym- ous, when you have a connectivity within your community, and when you're recognized for your work and your efforts. Do you have any other interests that could have swayed you to follow a career path other than medicine? My father had a strong and profound influence on me. Those who know me know I love telling a good story, I love debate, and I love being pro- vocative in terms of questioning the conventional ways of doing things or the traditional values and views that society holds. I also have a few health issues, one of which is that I was born with a lazy eye, or strabismus, which was corrected through surgery when I was young, but I've been challenged with my vision in the affected eye. In my high school it was expected that you participate in sporting activities, and the way that you demonstrated your sporting prowess at a boys-only high school was to play something like rugby or cricket. And I wanted to pur - sue that, but because of my eye dis- ability my dad suggested I think about other activities. He knew that get- ting hurt and damaging my good eye could be problematic and pointed me toward debating. I was never a good public speaker, it was certainly one of my phobias in high school, and my dad recognized that to be a confident person you have to be able to share your views and opinions. I considered law as a career in high school as well. Though because the legal system is based on Dutch Roman law in South Africa, my dad saw that as being limiting if I ever wanted to work in other jurisdictions, and we had many good evenings ban- tering about what life could look like and what a career could look like. And it was at that point that I started to reflect more on my mother's val - ues\u2014she was a registered nurse. In talking to my mum, and recognizing there were a few doctors in our family lineage, I started to think more about medicine as a way of defining who I was as a professional. And boy has it ever turned out well. So that explains how you acquired your interest in medicine, or is there more to that story? It goes further back than that. I often think about whether medicine selects the individual, or whether the individ- ual selects medicine. When I was in elementary school my very best friend's father was the principal, so I really admired the family. My friend James and I did everything together, and when he declared early on that he wanted to be a doctor I thought, you know what, James wants to be a doctor, I'll be a doctor too, that will be a great thing to do. And that stuck in my brain. While I was debating what my life would look like with my father, that thought reoccurred, and I decided to stick with what I had originally signed up to do. In the end, James became a teacher, like his father, and I became the doctor. I think most doctors have such a defining moment in their life\u2014an experience as a child, or a circum-Continued from page 411413 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.org rural health care leadership in BC and has been foundational in creating the space for my voice to come forward for the entire profession in BC. As a true friend, Granger has taught me to lead with a respect for all colleagues, specialists and GPs. The so-called divide between generalists and spe- cialist shouldn't exist, and it's going to be one of my challenges this year to see if we can enhance the conversa- tion about uniting the medical profes- sion in BC. We have a huge opportunity to seek system improvements in BC this year. We are hosting the CMA Gen- eral Council, where Dr Avery is to be inducted as the national president, our own association has a strong provin-cial voice, and the federal Minister of Health is also a doctor. This is an excellent chance for the association to invest its energies in being part of a national conversation. Can you tell me about a pivotal time in your career? On one Sunday morning in 2002 I was the emergency department doc- tor at my local rural community hos- pital in Oliver, and I was Doctor of the Day, so I was covering all the patients in hospital on behalf of my colleagues who had the weekend off. There was a page over the hospital intercom\u2014\"Dr Ruddiman to the emergency depart- ment, stat!\" I gave up my duties at the stance where the idea of medicine as a potential future career shows up, a moment from which their desire to want to help others stems. Do you have any professional heroes? They shift and change throughout life. One of my early heroes in medi- cine was my professor of anatomy at the University of Witwatersrand, Phillip Tobias. He was also a pal- aeoanthropologist, and I remember one of the defining lectures he gave in medical school. He took us to a cave west of Johannesburg called the Sterkfontein Caves, where the earli- est human hominids were discovered, and he stood there, lecturing to 240 young medical students while hold- ing a skull in his hands. That vision is embedded in my brain. He had a very gentle voice, he was very well respected in South Africa and by the international medical community, and I thought, wow, if someone from our university can command that much respect, then I should really embrace my own career. It was a principle- defining moment for me. Dr Anna Reid stands out for me in the context of Canadian health care. Dr Reid, who is a past president of the CMA, is a humble leader who has proven that women can put their footprint on service and leadership in medicine. And we need more women leaders in health care, both in BC and in Canada. I look too to the Honourable Jane Philpott, our federal Minister of Health. She's got an incredibly pow- erful life story. She spent time prac- tising medicine and doing volunteer work in Africa and, unfortunately, lost a young child to a treatable illness simply because there weren't enough resources available locally when they were needed. The other person whose career I've admired and who has been a fantastic mentor to me is Dr Granger Avery. Granger welcomed me into special feature Continued on page 414 Photo: Lionel Trudel Photography Ltd.414 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgnursing station, ran down the hall, and ran into my wife. As soon as I saw her I thought, on no, there's something wrong with one of our daughters, I'm the emergency doctor, this is going to be horrible. And she said, \"Alan, I want you to take a big breath. Your dad has come into the emergency department with crushing chest pains.\" I think to administer one's skills to a member of your community is already some- times not at arm's length\u2014you know a lot of the people socially, your kids play together\u2014but to be called upon to administer care to your father when he's having a heart attack, for me, that helped shape where I needed to provide advocacy. We need the right resources across all of our commun- ities across BC\u2014metropolitan, rural, urban, and remote. I activated all the protocols I would for any other patient, but to have to deliver emergency medical care to my father was a sobering reminder that if I hadn't embraced all the generalist pieces of being a family doctor my dad may not have had an opportunity that day to receive the best care. I'm for - tunate to have had a great team\u2014all the nurses were phenomenal\u2014and I called a colleague in as soon as could. I didn't want to be the person respon- sible for my dad's success or failure with his acute health crisis, but I'm sure glad that I was trained to admin- ister the care that he needed while I got the rest of the team together. There are communities across the province where patients present every day with pressing medical needs, and to not have skilled professionals in those communities to deliver care to those people when they need it would simply be underservicing British Col- umbia. How has your role as a general practitioner evolved since you started practising? What's evolved is a deeper under - standing for the social determinants of health. It's not always about health care. I think health care is only respon- sible for about a quarter of what makes people sick. A bigger component is the life that people have\u2014where they live, what level of income they have, what kind of education they have, the early childhood development they were exposed to, whether they live with a disability. Of course, whether you have access to health care and whether you have acute or chronic ill - ness is really important, but genetics also comes into play. Did you inherit good genes from your parents? The other piece that I'm becom- ing more aware of is the damage that's being done to our planet and the related health issues. We have a huge responsibility as doctors to exer - cise our professional voice on issues of social determinants of health. The Council on Health Promotion has done stellar work over the years to highlight areas where doctors can advocate for social changes that can produce health. It shouldn't just be about managing sickness. Have your patients' expectations changed as well? The family practice I inherited almost 20 years ago was from a doctor who had been the family doctor for these patients for 20 to 30 years, so the average patient was in their early- to mid-60s. Jumping forward 20 years, my latest practice profile tells me that my average patient is now 76 years old. So I've got a 20-year relationship with people who have, for the most part, moved into the later part of their lives. When I have interviews with these patients I hear the most pro - found and provocative things because these people have lived sometimes very full lives, and their expectations and understanding of what it means to have a healthy life is very different from the opinion of someone who is 20. Elderly people are very clear on how they want their care delivered. They have very well-shaped ideas on what the health care system can do to support them. The one thing I've been delighted to have established in my practice is the opportunity to have conversations around end-of- life and advanced-care planning with my patients. Where we have pres- sure sometimes is from family mem- bers, children, grandchildren who don't embrace the values that elderly patients express about how they want to be cared for when they're con- fronted with an incurable disease or illness, or simply when they get to a place in life where they feel that they have reached the end. That is a societal conversation we have to have. Instead of always deploying maximal resources and the most specialized care options, which may be futile, we should be asking, what can we do to support you to have the best quality of life at this point in your life? My elderly patients have helped and educated me to become an advocate in that regard. Do you find that's a difficult shift for doctors? I think we have to be careful in how we characterize medicine. A fulfill- ing medical career as a specialist or a general family physician isn't about saving all lives all the time, it's about making a fundamental difference in the life of the person sitting in front of you when they're confronted by acute or chronic illness. We shouldn't be in the business of simply focusing on saving lives, we should be focus- ing on making a difference in the lives of the people we encounter as part of this wonderful profession. What do your patients think of your role as president? I have developed relationships with my patients over the past 20 years\u2014 and many of them are now individu- als who are closer to the end of their life than to the part of their life when they were most productive\u2014so for me to be absent from my community special feature Continued from page 413415 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgmultiple times per week is quite chal- lenging for them. I'm very fortunate to have a young female physician locum, a recent graduate from the UBC family medicine program, who embraces the same values that I do, is very professional, is a generalist phy- sician, and has made a commitment to supporting me in my practice and my patients for the year. I feel reassured knowing there are colleagues like my locum who are willing to step up, though I do know there is angst within my patients about when I'm going to be in the office next. I'm back filling in my practice right now for when my locum is away and when there are oth- er gaps in coverage to make sure I can continue to practise clinical medicine. Could you tell me about a personal achievement that stands out for you? There are many moments that have made me smile. Being recognized by your peers in a way that is uninvited, for example, is humbling\u2014there are so many good doctors in this province who fly under the radar and aren't rec- ognized for their contributions and service. We need to do more of that\u2014 recognize these contributions to med- icine, to patients, to communities. A number of years ago, I think it was 2008, I was recognized by the Society of Rural Physicians of Can- ada to be awarded a Fellowship of Rural and Remote Medicine in Can- ada. At that point I probably had arrived at a place where my career was evolving and I was starting to contribute beyond one patient at a time. To this day I wear the lapel-pin I was presented with as a reminder to myself of being recognized for serv- ing well. And I think that is part of why we choose medicine\u2014we have to embrace the tenants of profession- alism, advocacy, and service. Conversely, could you tell me about a challenge or regret? Thinking back to when I was in uni- versity, and when South Africa was going through profound change, I feel a little disappointed and embarrassed that I didn't do more in terms of activ - ism for change in the country. I was politically active, but I didn't do it in as brave a way as I probably could have concerning the social injustices that were occurring in the country. My parents raised us to question what appeared to be the real world\u2014how law was applied, how a large portion of society was disadvantaged\u2014and considering the empathy that was generated in our home I'm disap- pointed in myself when I think back. Having taught Family Medicine R1 residents in their family medicine rotation, what is your impression of the challenges that medical stu- dents and residents face today? They're coming into medicine at a time when so many changes are oc- curring\u2014just the exponential growth in how we access and share informa- tion is unprecedented\u2014and as ex- citing as that is it's also incredibly challenging because we need to filter what is factual, what is scientifically based. As doctors we pride ourselves on being the experts in medicine, and there are so many career opportun- ities available for young doctors, but we have to understand that the foun- dation of a general medical education is generalism. We also have to think about social accountability\u2014there's a social contract that we have in Can- ada with the federal and provincial governments\u2014we are responsible for giving back to society. To this end, we need to require from our univer - sities and medical students as broad- based a generalist training in medical school as possible before they choose an area of specialty. There needs to be a strong foundation of generalism, both in specialty practice and family medicine. What are your concerns about the future of family medicine in this province?My biggest concern would be that we promote sub- and superspecializa - tion as the only ways to derive satis- faction from a medical career. We're very privileged to gain a world-class, strong, scientific education in Canada, and we don't want to dilute that sci- entific capital by gaining a significant medical education and then stream- ing off into a superspecialized area. I don't think that serves society well. When it comes to serving individual patients, communities, regions of the province I think it's the generalism in medicine that needs to be promoted as the primary way that we invest our energies as taxpayers and as society looking after the health care needs of our populations. What health care issue do you think is not getting enough attention right now? We've recently seen the formation of the First Nations Health Authority, and I think we have a lot to do sur - rounding Aboriginal health in BC. We don't give it enough attention, and we have to build that into the social fab- ric. We need to be culturally sensitive. We need to respect the custodianship that First Nations in our province have for being responsible to the plan- et. They are leaps and bounds ahead of where we are in understanding that if we don't look after our planet, it won't look after us. We can do bet- ter in terms of building relationships with our First Nations partners across health care and beyond. The other piece that deserves on- going attention is simply bringing specialists and generalists back to- gether as a united profession so we can tackle these tough issues. What technological developments in medicine are you excited about? One of the greatest investments that governments and societies can make in health care is around how we choose to organize, fund, and support special feature Continued on page 416416 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgactivities around information technol- ogy and information management. Having a patient medical record that is dynamic, current, accurate, and that truly reflects the health of a patient will go a long way to reducing unnec- essary health care costs and the burden of medical errors, and ensuring safely delivering care to patients. We need to look at how we integrate information technology effectively to reduce the duplication and multiple layers of bar - riers that we have by trying to accom- modate 6, 8, 10 different information technology delivery systems. I hear citations of privacy as the issue that's limiting us from remov- ing various IT barriers, but if you ask patients if privacy is the biggest issue for them, they'll say absolutely not, it's about access. They want health care providers to have their most cur - rent medical information in front of them when they're being asked to be partners in their own health care. If we can't deliver that, we're doomed to fail in health care in 2016. You are also highly engaged on Twitter. How has social media affected your practice and your interactions with your patients and colleagues? We have a responsibility as a profes- sion to engage with one another, and social media is a huge opportunity to share our voice and express our opin- ions with the public and with govern- ment. I encourage my colleagues to look at social media as a way to get their professional voice out there, to talk about their concerns. It has helped my career in cutting through red tape\u2014being able to reach leaders who I might otherwise not have tradi- tional relationships with. You've spoken about the import - ance of collaborative efforts be - tween all health care providers and partners. What specific improve - ments or opportunities do you think greater collaboration will result in that are currently underdeveloped? When we talk about team-based care we need to understand who all the partners are who are responsible for producing outcomes. The doctor- patient relationship is fundamental. It is the most-valued relationship in health care, so we can't undo that. There has to be a strong physician voice, and a credible and safe place for the patient voice to land. But we also need to recognize who the other partners in health care are. We cer - tainly look to the provincial govern- ment for its leadership and we look to the societies that support family physicians and specialists. We need to bring those voices together and to work with allied health care profes- sionals, our nursing colleagues, our pharmacy colleagues, licensed prac - tical nurses, social workers, physio- therapists, the list goes on. We need to bring the right providers together and have meaningful conversations about delivering timely and efficient care to patients, reducing unnecessary admissions to hospital, and rooting out areas where there is unnecessary risk to patients. Two pertinent research examples come to mind. First, the Common- wealth Fund released a report in late 2014 showing that Canada scores 10th out of 11 in First World nations when you look at the matrices of how their health care systems are mea- sured. We need to sit down with the governments of the day and have a conversation about transforming, not just tweaking, health care for the gen- erations ahead. Second, OECD data tells us that the safest hospitals in the world have a maximum bed occupancy of about 85% at any given time. When I listen to colleagues both close to me and around the province, it's not unusual to hear that our hospitals have occu- pancies of over 100%. That's a prob- lem. We need to make our hospitals more efficient, we need to improve access, and we need to admit the right patient to hospital at the right time. Recruitment and retention chal- lenges in BC continue to be top of mind. What do you envision as a way to overcome the enduring obstacles? Recruitment and retention is no longer on the radar of only our rural communities; there's a desperate need for recruitment both in urban and rural and remote communities. Yes, there continues to be a dispro- portionate allocation of where phys- icians choose to live and work\u201425% of BC's population lives and works in rural communities, yet only 11% to 14% of doctors choose to work in these communities. We need to invest in rural-proofing BC, but we need to talk about the greater need as well. If we look at where the biggest invest - ment in health care is, it goes back to the conversations around generalism, and those occur at our postsecondary education institutions. Universities need to grow their understanding of why investment in generalist med- ical training is going to serve society well. Absolutely, we need the broad range of world-class specialists in this province that we already have, who can continue to support patients when they need that type of care most, but we're now at a place where, because of the system of delivering care that we've developed in rural commun- ities, we're better prepared to inform the urban conversation about what organizing services can look like. Maybe we can take the rural model and have a conversation with urban and metropolitan communities and get back to the day when generalist, hospital-type care was the foundation for what most people need. What drives you? I grew up with two brothers and a younger sister, so there was always a competitive streak in our house- hold, and I think competition is very special feature Continued from page 415417 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orghealthy. Those who know me recog- nize that I can be impatient, some- times tenacious, but I tend to organize those qualities around opportunities. Yes, I can be impatient when I see that we are not organizing our ener - gies efficiently in health care across the province, but it's also about tak- ing those energies and recognizing that if we can't produce meaningful change, we're going to tire out a lot of the people who are demonstrating leadership in BC's health care system. We need to move from collaboration to truly enacting the partnerships that we've created, and I see this as one of the most important areas that I can contribute to as the Doctors of BC president. As president, what are you most interested in doing straight out of the gate? The trajectory for the president is short\u2014365 days\u2014so I didn't come out with a clearly defined 100-day ac- tion plan because I think that's arti- ficial. I have a strong mandate that's organized around embracing diverse thought, so I'm traveling extensively around the province right now, going to small communities, meeting with individual doctors, hearing the indi- vidual physician's voice, and giv- ing them the chance to tell us what's working well, or where the health care system needs to improve; that's important. I've made a promise to myself that I'm going to keep physically and emo- tionally healthy, as I could exhaust myself if I have to reach as many phy- sicians in their own communities as I can if they themselves can't get to Vancouver from time to time. Being a connector, I have some phenomenal relationships with phy- sicians around the province, and I think my role as president is to help promote and support the activities of these physicians in their own roles as physicians of influence.special feature Do you have any concerns about achieving everything you set out for your year as president? All of the goals I promoted in my campaign, I think, are achievable. But I think it's most important that I lay a stronger foundation for the associa - tion to stand on when it moves for - ward. We've got a strategic plan that's about to be renewed and updated, we're looking at governance reform within the association, these are important pillars. The profession points its fingers at the association sometimes and says that we're simply not addressing cer - tain needs, but we need to understand why we're organized as an associa- tion. Let's not forget, we have the Col- lege of Physicians and Surgeons, we have the Health Professions Act, we have the provincial government and health authorities. The Doctors of BC mission is to promote a social, eco- nomic, and political environment in which members can provide BC citi - zens with the highest quality of health care while allowing the doctors that we're serving to have a great profes- sional life and receive fair economic reward. And that occurs in a public- ly funded health care system, so we have to partner with society through the government and health authorities and other professions to ensure we can produce an improved system as we move forward. That change starts with having a collective will across those partners to transform health care in 2016. If the Commonwealth Fund tells us we are 10th out of 11, then we're failing. We don't yet have a renewed Ca- nadian Health Accord, so I look for - ward to working with the provincial government and the presidents of other provincial and territorial medi- cal associations and starting a con- versation with the federal Minister of Health if the opportunity allows. Let's talk about creating a sustainable health care system in Canada for the next 30 to 50 years. Recognizing, as you do, that change takes time, where would you like to see the association in 10 years? I would like to see Doctors of BC con- tinue to be the strong representative voice for all doctors in the province, with a high-functioning Board that does executive work on behalf of the association while allowing the asso- ciation's committees to grow their relationships with health authorities and government to make sure we're addressing the basic health care needs of all BC citizens. In 10 years I would love to see that there are no wait lists or access issues in the province. It occurs in other countries; we should have the same in this province . We have a huge responsibility as doctors to exercise our professional voice on issues of social determinants of health. The Council on Health Promotion has done stellar work over the years to highlight areas where doctors can advocate for social changes that can produce health. It shouldn't just be about managing sickness.418 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.orgMEDICAL CBT Various locations and dates When you learn medical cognitive behavior therapy's ultra-brief tech- niques, you'll feel much more com- fortable handling the many \"supraten - torial issues\" in your practice.

It's a time for new classmates, new teachers, and new challenges. As parents, we focus on academics and ensuring our chil - dren get the best education that will give them a good start to their lives. However, do we also consider the importance for our children to be physically active? A lot of our chil - dren will be involved in sports and this will help them reach the goal of being active for 60 minutes per day, the recommended amount of physical activity for children aged 5 to 17. But what if our children are not involved in sports? How can we ensure they also get the recommended amount of activity? In addition to being physically active, the amount of sleep children get is increasingly being recognized as important. The 2016 ParticipAC- TION Report Card on Physical Activ - ity for Children and Youth1 empha- sized the importance of sleep. As a result, 24-Hour Movement Guide- lines for Children and Youth2 have been released, which emphasize the importance of an appropriate amount of sleep for children. For children age 5 to 13 years, 9 to 11 hours of sleep is recommended, and 8 to 10 hours per night is recommended for those age 14 to 17. Without adequate sleep children are too tired to be active, and when they are not being active it makes it more difficult for them to sleep. These guidelines also empha - size the importance of limiting recre- ational screen time to minimize sed-entary time. These are all factors that we as parents need to be aware of. Do we as health professionals also have a responsibility to educate school-age children in these impor - tant areas? This begs the question of what our role is in health promotion for children. How can we play a role in promoting the importance of being physically active to children when we typically see children in the office only when they present with an ill - ness? The ParticipACTION Report Card continues to rank our kids' activ - ity level at a D-, which means less than 20% reach the guidelines of 60 minute per day. There is no silver bul- let that will magically make children suddenly become more active. Every- one needs to do their part to help increase activity levels, reduce screen time, and help kids get the sleep they need and eat and drink healthy foods and beverages. This means parents, day-care operators, schools, parent advisory committees, community and recreation centres, sports teams, transportation systems, built environ- ments, governments, and, yes, health care professionals and systems all play a role. This article is the opinion of the Council on Health Promotion and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.As we move into the fall we, as health care professionals, have oppor - tunities to lead the way in promoting good health to our children. Schools will have a renewed focus on pro- moting physical activity to children, led by the Directorate of Agencies for School Health (DASH) BC and Action Schools BC, with new govern- ment funding. During October the Doctors of BC Be Active Every Day initiative will be challenging school children to follow the Live 5-2-1-0 message: 5 or more fruits and vegetables each day, no more than 2 hours of recre- ational screen time per day, at least 1 hour of physical activity per day, and 0 sugar sweetened drinks per day. As well this year we will incorporate the importance of adequate sleep. We hope to work with schools to engage as many students as possible. That means we need doctors in every com- munity to step up and help us lead the way in promoting these important health habits. October will also see an initiative for children to be active in Walk and Wheel to School Week (3 to 7 October). Let's make it hap- pen!

Com- puterized medical records, lab, and pharmacy classifieds Continued on page 428427 bc medical journal vol. 58 no. 7, september 2016 bcmj.org We often have conversations with our medical professional clients that start something like this: \"I was visiting with a colleague the other day between cases and they were telling me I should...\" The ideas shared during these visits are likely good ideas, but the key is to understand that what might be the right idea at the right time for your colleague may not be the right idea for you at this time. It is important to recognize your career decisions will uniquely match your personal circumstances and needs. Every professional practice goes through a series of stages in its evolution. From a tax perspective, failure to plan properly at each stage of your practice lifecycle may result in significant financial consequences or lost opportunities down the road. The first step to effective tax planning is to understand what stage your practice is at today. Getting Started: As you embark on your medical practice, you need to choose an initial structure that will match your initial financial goals. These goals likely include retirement of any remaining education debt and looking towards a possible home purchase. Consideration should also include your current personal circumstances. Do you know where you plan to build your practice? Are you married? Do you have children or other dependents? Creating a Financially Efficient Practice: At this point, your practice has demonstrated to you that you will be able create financial resources to meet your personal cost of living and accumulate wealth for your future financial goals. If you have not already done so, incorporation of your practice can usually add more power to your savings.Wealth Accumulation: At this stage, you are enjoying a very profitable practice that is creating the financial resources for an expanding list of personal and financial goals. You are not likely ready to retire but you can start thinking about how you want your retirement to look and structure a plan to get there. After Practice: A very common reminder to our medical professional clients is \"you don't give the money back after you stop practicing.\" The wealth you have accumulated now needs a plan that works with your retirement savings (RRSP or IPP), government benefits and other income sources. This will include estate planning, income tax minimization and capital gains considerations. Over the next several articles, we will look at each of these stages in more depth to point out how your tax structure and strategies should evolve as your practice grows.
