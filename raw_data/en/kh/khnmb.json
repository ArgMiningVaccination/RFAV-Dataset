Summary Alternative medicine involves the use of various therapies and products and health care practices, most of which have not been proven thoroughly tested or proven effective. Some alternative medicine might even use some proven traditi onal practices but be comes alternative used for p urposes outside their original scientifically proven use . Complementary medicine or integrative medicine is a combination of alternative treatments or therapies used along w ith generally accepted and scientifically proven and established medicine. These may hold pro mise but are yet unproven. The shared claim of all of alternative medicine is a c laim to help or cure that is often not based on the scientific method and thorough testing. Much of it relies on pseudoscience and therefore remains outside of standard medical science. Most alternative medicine lacks proven scient ific validation of its effectiveness . Whatever research and testing that has been done is insufficient, methodologically flawed and not of high quality. There may be some examples where alternative medicine or therapies might help, however the scientific validation and proof are lacking. Policy History Date Action 8/2022 Annual policy review.
