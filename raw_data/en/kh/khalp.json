Our nutritionist expert Helena Thomas Harman recommends the following: Fitting in some gentle walks, yoga sessions, or relaxing swims may be able to help with specific symptoms of perimenopause, such as hot flushes, mood swings or insomnia. [Yoga](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/the-health-hub/mind-body/what-is-yoga/), in particular, is thought to be able to help menopausal women sleep better.4 The practices that are often recommended for women going through menopause include: Neuroscientist Tara Swart explains that this activity affects our temperature and pain receptors, creating a shock response.6 She also explains that this then makes our bodies compensate with endorphins and natural painkillers to balance it out, which coincidentally has a positive impact on our mood, resilience, immunity, and longevity.

The hormonal changes that take place during peri and menopause can affect things like bone density as your oestrogen levels drop.7 And that's where strength training comes in. The act of meditating is well known for having a variety of positive impacts on our health, whether it's reducing stress levels, decreasing anxiety, improving attention span, or generating kindness.9,10,11,12 The list goes on. But did you know meditation is one of the best natural remedies for perimenopause symptoms? But if you are new to it, listening to a calming meditation soundtrack may help you to be more present if you struggle to focus on your breath.

There are a few studies that suggest compounds known as endocrine disruptors (EDCs) are found in some beauty products and these could, potentially, have an effect of our hormone systems.14,15,16 Equally as important as the products we use on our skin, our clothes can also impact our health - especially for peri and menopausal women. Wearing more natural fabrics may also help when experiencing hot flashes or sweating. Some of the better materials include bamboo, cotton, and linen as they are often more breathable and naturally moisture-wicking - which helps the sweat to evaporate easier during a hot flush. Another way to support perimenopause is by taking licensed herbal products and food supplements. Key ingredients to look out for in these products include: For more information on how these supplements could help you, head to our article on [8 of the best perimenopause supplements](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/the-health-hub/conditions/womens-health/menopause/best-perimenopause-supplements). As always, if you're considering taking any of these supplements and are unsure if they're suitable for you, speak to a health professional before trying them out. Our expert highlighted that research has shown that stabilising [blood glucose levels](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/the-health-hub/conditions/blood-sugar/what-is-blood-sugar/) is effective for reducing hot flashes. Luckily there are a few natural ways that you can achieve this. Studies have indicated that consuming a big meal that is high in calories at nighttime can have a negative impact on blood sugar levels, so it's best to eat your meals earlier in the day.17 Handpicked content: [Blood sugar balance tips](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/the-health-hub/conditions/blood-sugar/4-blood-sugar-balance-tips/) This applies to people of all ages, but an increased intake of fruit and vegetables and limiting processed foods may help with some symptoms of perimenopause. The last up on our list of natural perimenopause remedies is a natural lubricant. Vaginal dryness is a common issue that is reported by women at all stages of the menopause, which can feel itchy, cause pain during sex and make you need to urinate more than usual.20 Thankfully, using a natural lubricant may help ease some discomfort. Some of the best natural lubricants are water-based, which won't damage condoms or cause discomfort, or plant-oil-based products, which may damage condoms. Some studies have shown an increase in [foods rich in phytoestrogens](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/the-health-hub/conditions/womens-health/menopause/foods-for-menopause/) beneficial for several symptoms as they have a mild effect on the body by mimicking the effects of estrogen.21,22,23 Our nutrition expert points out that \"It is best to eat these foods regularly and in sufficient quantities with most women seeing effects after taking for 2-3 months. Ideally, 2-3 portions spread throughout the day have better effects than one large portion.\" Some phytoestrogen foods include: It is best to seek medical advice if the symptoms you're experiencing are getting in the way of your everyday activities and you're struggling physically or emotionally. It is also advisable to seek medical advice if you are experiencing menopausal symptoms before age 45, as your GP can provide you with [menopause](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/the-health-hub/conditions/womens-health/menopause/what-you-should-know-about-the-menopause/) advice and help.
