Your COVID-19 Digital Vaccine Record (DVR) is an electronic vaccination record drawn from the data stored in the District of Columbia's immunization information system (DOCIIS) and is an official record issued by the District of Columbia. The DVR includes a QR code that (when scanned by a SMART Health Card reader) will display the same information as your paper CDC vaccine card: your name, date of birth, vaccination dates and vaccine manufacturer. You may also continue to use your CDC card as proof of vaccination in addition to other possible options such as a digital or physical proof of vaccination from your provider/pharmacy or other jurisdictions. How do I request a Digital Vaccine Record? Visit [vaccinerecord.dc.gov](https://vaccinerecord.dc.gov) to request your Digital Vaccine Record. Complete the online form with the required fields and click submit. How will my Digital Vaccine Record be delivered? When your vaccination record is found, you will receive a link delivered to the email or mobile phone number associated with the vaccination record. * After entering your four-digit PIN, you will see your COVID-19 vaccination information including your name, date of birth, vaccination date(s), and vaccine manufacturer. You will also receive a scannable QR code confirming your vaccine record is authentic. *Note: If you are an iPhone user, you may need to check the \"Unknown Senders\" message folder if your configuration includes it. Can I save my Digital Vaccine Record on my smartphone? Yes. If you're an iPhone user, you can save your digital vaccine record to the Apple Health app with the iOS 15 operating system. You will need to use your Safari web browser to complete the process. Alternatively, you can print or save the picture to your camera roll on all smartphone mobile devices. If I get an Additional or Booster Dose AFTER I receive a DVR, will it show on my digital vaccine record? If you receive an Additional dose or Booster dose, it will not automatically reflect on your digital vaccine record. You will need to re-submit the form to request a new Digital Vaccine Record. We recommend waiting up to 10 days for your new dose to display in the District of Columbia's Immunization Registry. How long after my COVID-19 vaccination can I request a Digital Vaccine Record? DC Health is experiencing a high volume of DVR requests. Please allow sufficient time for your vaccination information to process. Will my information remain private? Yes. Filling out the form on the portal does not provide instant access to your digital vaccine record. The link to your digital record requires a PIN that you create and is sent only to the mobile number or email associated with your immunization record. To protect your privacy, the QR code on your digital record can only be scanned and read by a SMART Health Card-compliant device. How long do I have to use the link? Can I reset my pin? You have 24 hours from the time you receive the link to enter your four-digit PIN and access and save your Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record. If you don't save your digital record, the link will expire, but you can start over and reset your pin at the [vaccinerecord.dc.gov](https://vaccinerecord.dc.gov) If you can't remember your PIN, after 24 hours you can use the same process and create a new PIN. Can I use my Digital Vaccine Record as proof of vaccination outside of the District of Columbia? Your Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record includes a SMART Health Card QR code which can be used as proof of vaccination in select states and countries outside the US. Check with local authorities to see if they accept the SMART Health Card as proof of vaccination. How long does it take to receive my Digital Vaccine Record after I submitted the form? You should receive a SMS or email with a link to the Digital Vaccine record within 15 minutes of submitting the form. If you do not receive a link, please resubmit. I received a text or email saying my record was not found. Why did this happen and what should I do? If you received a message through SMS or email that indicates no record was found, that means your COVID-19 Vaccination record does not exist in DC Health's database. This can also occur if you made an error while submitting your Digital Vaccine Record form. You can attempt to resubmit the form using the same information you used when you signed up for the vaccination. If the error continues, you can chat with our [Virtual Assistant](https://vaccinerecordsupport.dc.gov/) to create a support ticket and receive assistance in identifying the cause of the issue. As a reminder, DC Health cannot guarantee all users will be issued a digital vaccination record if their vaccination information submitted during a remediation request does not match data submitted by a District-located vaccine provider. DC Health's database holds COVID-19 vaccination records for more than 1.5 million persons, supplied by dozens of vaccine providers. Many records received are incomplete or duplicated. While DC Health works hard to match the information received to create an accurate record for each person, not all persons' vaccination records will be immediately and accurately matched. DC Health continues to make enhancements to the matching processes to improve the database's completeness and accuracy. How long will it take DC Health to resolve my case? Upon submission of a remediation ticket, a link will be sent to you to upload relevant documents that will be attached to your case number. DC Health is experiencing a high volume of DVR requests. Please allow sufficient time for your case to be resolved. On my QR Code, it shows my Lot Number as \"Not provided by provider\" what does that mean? Is my QR code still valid? Yes, your QR Code is still valid. \"Not provided by provider\" indicates the Lot Number is missing from the Vaccine Record from your healthcare provider. You may be able to correct this information by chatting with our [Virtual Assistant](https://vaccinerecordsupport.dc.gov/) to create a support ticket. On my QR code, it shows my vaccine manufacturer as COVID-19, Unspecified. What does that mean? Is my QR code still valid? Yes, your QR Code is still valid. \"COVID-19, Unspecified\" indicates the Manufacturer is missing from the Vaccine Record from your healthcare provider You may be able to correct this information by chatting with our [Virtual Assistant](https://vaccinerecordsupport.dc.gov/) to create a support ticket. What if I don't know who my vaccine provider is when filling out the Digital Vaccine Record Remediation Form? You can email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#196f787a7a7077786d7c7d7a597d7a377e766f) to request your vaccine provider information. Where can I submit a ticket or case if I am having issues with my Digital Vaccine Record? You can have your issue investigated by chatting with our [Virtual Assistant](https://vaccinerecordsupport.dc.gov/) to create a support ticket. I am a parent or guardian. Will I be able to request a Digital Vaccine Record for my child(ren)? Yes; you can request a Digital Vaccine Record for your child or children if you have their vaccination information that was used at registration at the time of the appointment. I am a business who needs to verify QR codes. How do I obtain a QR reader? There are several applications available to download on a mobile device that will read QR codes. However, please ensure it is a device that is SMART Health Card-compliant. If I received a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine outside of the District of Columbia, or through a federal entity (e.g., Department of Defense, Indian Health Services, or Veterans Affairs), can I submit that vaccination record as well to be added to my Digital Vaccine Record? At this time, vaccinations administered out-of-state (e.g., Virginia, Maryland) or by a federal entity (e.g., Department of Defense, Indian Health Services, or Veterans Affairs), are not submitted to the District of Columbia Immunization Information System and cannot be added to your DC DVR. If you are interested in receiving a separate digital record for any vaccines administered out-of-state or by a federal entity, please contact the state or federal agency that provided your vaccination.
