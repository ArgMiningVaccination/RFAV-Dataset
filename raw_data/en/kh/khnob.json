Traditional Chinese Medicine is a natural and effective way to treat inflammatory skin conditions. It's able to target what disrupted the natural flow in your body so it may be restored to its healthy order. Western medicines such as steroid therapies can suppress the symptoms but this will not cure the cause. Most times flare ups can reoccur because the core of the issue is not being treated with this method. Eastern herbal formulas are different because they are specifically created for you and your skin condition to fight the underlying cause and prevent it from coming back. The roots of the issue are being addressed so the condition can fully heal. The herbal formula created will include various herbs and can be taken either in a capsule or granule form. The custom fit formula will not only treat the skin condition but also elevate your body as whole. Your overall health will be helped as the skin condition is being treated. Skin conditions ranging from mild to severe can be treated with these formulas and treatment duration will vary depending on the case. "}
