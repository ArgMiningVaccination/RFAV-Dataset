This plan, in conjunction with the Health Emergency Operations Center (HEOC) Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), provides guidance for all types of public health emergencies and disasters. This AHERP describes roles, responsibilities and the all-hazards concept of operations for a public health response, while the HEOC SOP contains specic steps to activate the HEOC and establish an Incident Command System (ICS) across the department. During an emergency or disaster, these two documents will be used by response sta to establish operations and implement incident structure for the public health and medical response. This plan is intended to work in concert with the Arizona State Emergency Response and Recovery Plan (SERRP), which is maintained by the Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Aairs (DEMA). The AHERP, HEOC Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and other plan annexes may guide the Public Health and Medical - Emergency Support Function (ESF) 8 and other ESF support roles during all-hazards responses across the state. ADHS is the lead agency for ESF 8 but also may play support roles for other ESFs including; Communications (ESF 2), Mass Care (ESF 6) and External Aairs (ESF 15). Figure 1 explains the relationship between the SERRP, AHERP, the HEOC SOP and plan annexes. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 6 April 2023 The department also maintains a variety of support annexes which provide additional guidance to emergency response sta for specic functions (E.g., Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) Plan, Receipt Stage and Storage Annex (RSS) and the Crisis Standards of Care (CSC) Plan). These functional annexes are all-hazards in nature and can be used to support many types of responses. In addition to the support annexes, other specic plans were developed to address challenges posed by various public health incidents see Appendix A . Figure 2 explains the relationship between this plan and these documents. Scope This plan supports responses to all levels of public health emergencies and disasters, from local responses with state involvement, to interstate and even international incidents. In keeping with the Incident Command System (ICS) concepts of flexibility and scalability, all or part of the procedures contained in this plan may be used to support response eorts depending on the scope of the emergency or disaster. This plan is applicable to all types of natural and human-caused disasters including chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRNE), weather and natural disasters, terrorism and technological failures intended to support the statewide healthcare and local public health system. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 7 April 2023 Situation Overview Emergent events requiring public health or medical assistance are a viable threat and can happen at any time. Any event which may disrupt the public health or healthcare system may be enough to trigger an emergency activation. This document is the guide on how to navigate the Department's response. ADHS incorporates elements of the National Incident Management System (NIMS) into emergency operations. The department's incident command structure, the Public Health Incident Management System (PHIMS), is NIMS compliant. PHIMS integrates multiple department-wide program activities into a cohesive and modular emergency response structure capable of expanding or contracting to t the size of the emergency or disaster. A wide variety of organizations, systems and resources can be used to support a public health response within the state. Additional state specic resources may include: Arizona Coalition for Healthcare Emergency Response Arizona Disaster Pediatric Coalition Senior Advisory Committee (for emergency preparedness) Homeland Security Senior Advisory Committee Arizona Disaster Burn Care Network Arizona Tribal Executive Committee (AzTEC) Arizona State Citizen Corp Council Arizona Emergency System for Advance Registration of Health Professionals (AZ-ESAR-VHP) Poison Control Centers (Phoenix and Tucson) Radiological Injury Treatment Network (RITN) Arizona Healthcare Associated nfection (HAI) Multidisciplinary Advisory Group Arizona Local Health Ocers Association (ALHOA) Arizona Local Public Health Emergency Response Association (ALPHERA) Arizona State Emergency Council During a disaster, HEOC sta will work with partner organizations and systems to support the public health and medical response. The Department may send a liaison to serve as All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 8 April 2023the Health and Medical Services Coordinator at the State Emergency Operation Center (SEOC), which is coordinated by DEMA. This position is typically staed by an ADHS representative with substantial experience managing responses and is crucial to maintaining operational control and situational awareness during responses. At-Risk Individuals This plan encompasses coordination and support for at-risk populations, including limited English prociency (LEP) populations, geographically isolated individuals, access and functional needs (AFN) groups, people with serious mental illness (SMI), and others requiring behavioral healthcare. Response strategies will consider the medical and public health needs of groups such as people with disabilities, pregnant women, children, senior citizens and other sub-groups as dictated by the response. Planning for at-risk individuals occurs on several levels within Arizona. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and ADHS use the Communication, Maintaining Health, Independence, Support and Safety and Transportation (CMIST) framework to identify and understand at-risk individuals with AFN when planning for, responding to, and recovering from a disaster. The CMIST Framework provides a useful and flexible framework for emergency planning and response that emphasizes a person's needs without having to dene a specic diagnosis, status or label. During a disaster, it has been observed that certain at-risk individuals, specically those with AFN, have required additional response assistance before, during and after an incident. These additional considerations for at-risk individuals with AFN are vital towards inclusive planning for the whole community, and have been mandated for inclusion in federal, state, territorial, tribal, and local public health emergency plans by the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. In addition, Arizona Healthcare Coalitions will be called upon during an emergency event to share information throughout their members to ensure that the needs of at-risk individuals are addressed. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 9 April 2023Planning Assumptions All-hazards emergency responses will be guided by this plan and applicable public health support and other specic annexes. This plan was developed to support any type of disaster including active shooter incidents, cyber security breach, explosive ordnance device, infectious disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic, and wildres. ADHS may apply the following assumptions during activation of this plan: Activation of the AHERP may be based on minimal information. Activation of public health support may occur as more information is collected and deemed appropriate. Will serve as a communication bridge between local and tribal health departments, the SEOC and federal partners (E.g., HHS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)). Will support local and tribal response through personnel and resource support requests. Under Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) \u00a7 36-136 , if deemed necessary and eective, identify and prescribe isolation and quarantine measures. Activation of the AHERP can be triggered by any of the following: Emergency, disaster or occurrence causing one or more local and tribal health partners to surpass resource capabilities Emergency, disaster or occurrence with potential public health consequences Activation of the SEOC Alerts from the Homeland Security National Terrorism Advisory System may prompt partial or full plan activation. International Planning Assumptions As a border state, the Department sta routinely works with partners in Mexico. The Oce of Border Health (OBH) coordinates and integrates public health program eorts to identify, monitor, control and prevent adverse health events in border communities. The OBH also strengthens cross-border public health collaboration with the Secretar\u00eda de Salud de Sonora en Sonora, Mexico. The Arizona Health Alert Network (AzHAN) may be used to facilitate communication, health alerts and updates between Arizona and Mexico. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 10 April 2023Arizona epidemiology personnel coordinate with their Sonoran counterparts through the state's electronic disease surveillance system known as the Medical Electronic Disease Surveillance and Intelligence System (MEDSIS). Public health personnel use a Spanish version of the system, which allows the state to easily share bi-national cases with Sonora. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 11 April 2023This system will be used to share real-time data across the border during a response. The U.S. Mexico Border Health Commission promotes sustainable cross-border partnerships to address border health challenges. Outcomes include increased community and inter-agency networking relationships, information sharing and educational opportunities. During a disaster, the Arizona Mexico Commission will support economic recovery, transportation and emergency management. Given the heightened need for cross-border coordination in preventing and responding to emergencies, the Commission established the Emergency Management Committee in November 2003 to enhance preparedness and response throughout the Arizona Sonora region. ADHS will coordinate with these bi-national organizations and federal partners to coordinate cross-border emergency response activities. Concept of Operations This section outlines the public health and medical response components that may be performed during a disaster. These components represent actions that state can take to support a disaster response (i.e., state, local, tribal, and healthcare system partners can do). They correspond with the six domains and the fteen capabilities published by the CDC in the P u b l i c H e a l t h P r e p a r e d n e s s C a p a b i l i t i e s N a t i o n a l S t a n d a r d s f o r S t a t e a n d L o c a l P l a n n i n g (2018). In addition to these dened response roles for public health, this section also covers continuity of operations (COOP) planning, which will be a critical component for disaster responses. T h e C o n t i n u i t y o f O p e r a t i o n s - E x e c u t i v e M a n a g e m e n t P l a n ( C O O P - E M P ) will be used to manage response elements that are internal to the department (E.g.,Human Resources, emergency procurement, cost reimbursement) and ensure that essential functions identied by department leadership continue during the emergency response. Biosurveillance Biosurveillance operations include both laboratory testing for biological and chemical agents and surveillance and epidemiology for all types of hazards. In many cases, sta from these two functional areas work closely together to collect, analyze and assess data for public health responses. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 12 April 2023P u b l i c H e a l t h L a b o r a t o r y T e s t i n g Primary emergency response functions for laboratory testing include managing laboratory activities, performing sample management, testing and analysis for routine and surge capacity, supporting public health investigations and reporting results. The Arizona State Public Health Laboratory (ASPHL) maintains biosafety plans, chemical hygiene plans, and an I n c i d e n t R e s p o n s e P l a n . The purpose of these plans is to describe the response procedures for handling emergencies encountered during laboratory operations. ASPHL has a F i r e / E m e r g e n c y E v a c u a t i o n P l a n documenting procedures for actual emergencies and evacuation drills. ASPHL works closely with the Bureau of Infectious Disease and Services (BIDS) to notify the sta of high priority samples and other relevant data. Details regarding laboratory emergency response procedures can be found in the A S P H L C o n t i n u i t y o f O p e r a t i o n s A n n e x . Surge capacity and emergency response are also addressed in this continuity plan. ASPHL can conduct a wide variety of tests to support public health and medical operations. Examples of tests conducted at the facility can be seen in Figure 3. F i g u r e 3 All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 13 April 2023 In an emergency, certain portions of the laboratory, (such as bio-threat and chemical agent testing) can be made available during evenings and weekends. The Arizona State Health Laboratory emergency line can be accessed by calling: 6 0 2 - 8 8 7 - 9 2 8 3 . ASPHL is a member of the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) and functions as a conrmatory level laboratory. It is the reference laboratory for the State of Arizona. The laboratory has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. The purpose of this MOU is to provide surge capacity for other labs during public health response. P u b l i c H e a l t h S u r v e i l l a n c e a n d E p i d e m i o l o g i c a l I n v e s t i g a t i o n Key response functions for this capability include conducting public health surveillance and detection, conducting investigations, recommending, monitoring and analyzing mitigation actions. Recent infectious disease responses have highlighted the importance of coordination between state, local, tribal and federal agencies, as well as contact tracing and active and passive monitoring of potentially exposed persons. As part of the eorts to detect and respond to an outbreak of infectious disease or bio-threat event, state, county and tribal health departments have developed a web-based application called MEDSIS to electronically capture disease information from Arizona hospitals and clinical laboratories. Local, tribal, and state public health can use the system to document disease and outbreak investigations in addition to managing aected cases. This system is used to support public health operations during all types of emergencies and disasters. During a response, the system will shorten reporting lag time, facilitate secure data sharing between the state, county and tribal health departments and decrease the burden on reporting sources. Community Resilience Community resilience includes both preparedness and recovery. Preparedness comprises all on-going, day-to-day activities (E.g., planning, training, exercising) intended to improve readiness for all types of emergencies and disasters. As a result, preparedness is not considered part of this response plan. Community recovery is a key part to any response. During the recovery phase, communities will need to assess impacts and set priorities for a \"return to normal\" and in some cases must redene what \"normal\" means for their community. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 14 April 2023C o m m u n i t y a n d H e a l t h c a r e S y s t e m R e c o v e r y Community recovery is the ability to collaborate with community partners, (E.g., healthcare organizations, business, education and emergency management) to plan and advocate for the rebuilding of the public health and healthcare systems to at least a level of functioning comparable to pre-incident levels, and improved levels where possible. Key functions may include identifying and monitoring public health and healthcare system recovery needs, and implementing corrective actions to mitigate damages from future incidents. Countermeasures and Mitigation This domain encompasses key capabilities for a public health response including medical countermeasures (MCM), medical supplies and materiel, non-pharmaceutical intervention and responder safety and health. This also includes many of the medical and non-medical actions the health and medical system can take to protect the public against a CBRNE threat. M e d i c a l C o u n t e r m e a s u r e s Key functions for this capability include identication and initiation of submitting federal requests for medical countermeasure materiel, conducting MCM distribution operations and recovery of durable medical equipment. MCMs may be used to respond to all disaster types (E.g., CBRNE, pandemic influenza), for some responses, local supplies and caches may also be used. Larger responses requiring federal distribution of assets will involve state level receipt storage and shipping (RSS) of assets to local receiving sites for further distribution. See the M e d i c a l C o u n t e r m e a s u r e s P l a n and R S S O p e r a t i o n a l A n n e x for additional information on MCM management. M e d i c a l M a t e r i e l M a n a g e m e n t a n d D i s t r i b u t i o n This capability encompasses the ability to acquire, maintain protocol (E.g., cold chain storage or other storage protocol), transport, distribute and track medical materiel (E.g., pharmaceuticals, gloves, masks and ventilators) during an incident and to recover and account for unused medical material, as necessary, after an incident. See the R S S O p e r a t i o n a l A n n e x for additional information. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 15 April 2023A variety of medical materials may be required to support all-hazards responses. As with MCMs, local supplies and caches of medical materiel will be used rst during a response. N o n - P h a r m a c e u t i c a l I n t e r v e n t i o n This capability includes the ability to recommend strategies for disease, injury and exposure control. Strategies that can be included in a non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) are outlined in Figure 4. F i g u r e 4 During a response, subject matter experts (SME)s in the HEOC will work with their local counterparts to implement appropriate NPI strategies. Coordination with public information sta is key to informing the public and implementing these actions. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 16 April 2023 R e s p o n d e r S a f e t y a n d H e a l t h This capability is the ability to protect healthcare workers, rst responders, front line sta and public health workers responding to an incident. Key functions include the identication of responder safety and health risks, safety and personal protective needs, coordination with partners to facilitate hazard-specic safety and health training and monitoring of responder safety and health. Emergency medical and psychological care for rst responders may need to be coordinated with healthcare and behavioral health partners. SMEs within the HEOC will work with response partners to develop guidance and implement strategies for responder safety and health. Incident Management This domain includes emergency operations and all the interagency coordination required to manage a response, procure resources and maintain situational awareness. In addition, Continuity of Operations is addressed in this section. The state is not typically responsible for on-scene incident or emergency management, but rather functions as a coordination entity lling a gap between the local response and resources needed from the state or federal level. E m e r g e n c y O p e r a t i o n s C o o r d i n a t i o n Emergency operations coordination is the ability to direct or support the public health and medical response to any type of emergency or disaster. Key response functions include conducting preliminary assessment to determine the need for public activation, activating the HEOC, developing an incident response strategy, managing and sustaining the statewide public health response, demobilization and evaluation of the public health response and recovery. During a public health emergency the Department will assist in procuring resources utilizing its authorities outlined in Title 36 of the A.R.S. and capabilities in coordination with other support agencies. They will allocate available resources based on identied priorities in coordination with local and tribal health departments, state-designated healthcare coalitions and federal partners. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 17 April 2023Two physical locations have been identied for the HEOC, the primary location is at the main ADHS building and the alternate location is on the Arizona State University campus. There are also resources and technical expertise to establish a virtual HEOC. Both physical and virtual HEOCs are viable methods to respond to a public health incident. Additional information regarding activation, ongoing operation, and demobilization of the HEOC are contained in the H E O C S O P . The H E O C R e l o c a t i o n P l a n outlines steps for activating and operating the Department's alternate operations center location. These and other supporting plans can be found in the Plans Library located in the shared HEOC drive. C o n t i n u i t y o f O p e r a t i o n s In many cases, there may be a COOP component to an emergency response whereas essential functions must be maintained at all times. For the complete execution of COOP and a list of agency priority functions, please refer to the C O O P - E M P : Succession During AHERP activation, the Director or designee maintains responsibility for control and direction of the operations. Should the Director become unavailable or incapacitated, the predetermined order of succession and delegations of authority will take eect, and terminate when these channels have resumed. The delegations of authority, referred to as deputations, are found in A.R.S. \u00a7 36-136(C). The following delegations of authority have been identied: 1) Orderly succession of ocials to the position of the Director in the case of absence, vacancy, or inability of the Director to act, especially during an emergency or national security emergency 2) Lines of succession for key positions identied in the Continuity Personnel Roles and Responsibilities chart. Delegations of Authority and Lines of Succession can be found in the C O O P - E M P . All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 18 April 2023Information Management This domain involves two critical capabilities, Emergency Public Information and Warning and Information Sharing. Together these capabilities address the internal and external communication pathways as well as strategies for information exchange with the public. E m e r g e n c y P u b l i c I n f o r m a t i o n a n d W a r n i n g Key functions for this capability include activating the public information system, determining the need for a joint public information system, establishing and participating in information system operations, establishing avenues for public interaction and issuing public alerts. Departmental public information and crisis communications procedures are covered in the C r i s i s E m e r g e n c y R i s k C o m m u n i c a t i o n ( C E R C ) P l a n which outlines communication strategies for an emergency response or internal crisis, including steps and considerations for activation of a Joint Information System (JIS). I n f o r m a t i o n S h a r i n g This capability focuses on the ability to conduct a multijurisdictional, multidisciplinary exchange of health-related information and situational awareness data. This includes the routine sharing of information and issuance of public health alerts to federal, state, local, tribal levels of government and the private sector. During public health emergencies, the HEOC may use platforms such as the AZHAN, WebEOC, and GovDelivery for information sharing. In addition, MEDSIS data are reported to CDC electronically via HL7 case notications for most of the reportable conditions. For conditions not reported via HL7, epidemiology sta use their standard protocols to manually upload data from the state's MEDSIS to CDC's Secure Access Management Services (SAMS) portal using the National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance (NETSS) le format. Procedures for this electronic information sharing are documented in the ADHS C D C N E T S S U p l o a d P r o t o c o l . Epidemiology sta will make all reasonable attempts to meet CDC requests for sending additional, situation-specic data, which may be via line-lists, a separate SAMS application or other mechanisms. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 19 April 2023Surge Management This domain includes four key capabilities associated with a mass casualty event, public health crisis, or other catastrophic disaster with a signicant number of casualties and/or evacuees. Surge management encompasses fatality management, mass care (sheltering), medical surge within the healthcare system and volunteer management. F a t a l i t y M a n a g e m e n t A multitude of programs and plans may need to come together to support fatality management operations. The Bureau of Vital Records (BVR) may expand operations to handle a surge in death certicates. These procedures are covered in the O c e o f V i t a l R e c o r d s C r i s i s M a n a g e m e n t P l a n . Additionally, the preparedness sta and state-level behavioral health sta could be called upon to support family assistance operations. M a s s C a r e This capability is the ability to coordinate with partner agencies to address the public health, medical and mental/behavioral health needs of those impacted by an incident at a congregate location. This includes the coordination of ongoing surveillance and assessment to ensure that health needs continue to be met as the incident evolves. See the ESF 6 (Mass Care) portion of the SERRP for more information on the roles and responsibilities during a response requiring evacuation and sheltering. M e d i c a l S u r g e Medical Surge is the ability to provide adequate medical evaluation and care during events that exceed the limits of the normal medical infrastructure of an aected community. It encompasses the ability of the healthcare system to survive a hazard impact and maintain or rapidly recover compromised operations. Alternate care sites (ACS) may also be used to alleviate medical surge. The A l t e r n a t e C a r e S i t e P l a n provides considerations for local jurisdictions when establishing temporary healthcare access points. During a catastrophic response, additional guidelines may be needed to address the overwhelming number of patients. See the C r i s i s S t a n d a r d s o f C a r e ( C S C ) P l a n for additional considerations, indicators, and tactics for medical surge management, including conventional, contingency and CSC. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 20 April 2023As with medical care, the demand for behavioral health services may increase during a disaster. Regular behavioral healthcare, including treatment of serious mental health (SMI) populations, and those with substance dependence, may be disrupted. Additional demand for behavioral health services (E.g., new cases) may arise from the disaster including grief counseling for disaster casualties and their families, as well as psychological rst aid for rst responders and other community members. V o l u n t e e r M a n a g e m e n t This capability comprises the identication, recruitment, registration, credential verication and engagement of volunteers to support the jurisdictional response to incidents of public health signicance. Key functions include the coordination, notication, organization and demobilization of volunteers. See the M e d i c a l S u r g e P e r s o n n e l a n d P u b l i c H e a l t h V o l u n t e e r C o o r d i n a t i o n P l a n for additional information on volunteer management. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 21 April 2023Organization and Assignment of Responsibilities A variety of PHIMS chart positions are detailed in the HEOC SOP. Additionally, many of the public health support annexes provide further guidance on organization roles and responsibilities based on function or hazard. The positions listed in Table 1 provide an overview of some of the roles and responsibilities for HEOC sta. T a b l e 1 Role Responsibilities A g e n c y A d m i n i s t r a t o r Oversees all PHIMS activities Makes nal policy decisions H E O C M a n a g e r Oversees HEOC sta including the section chiefs Implements the Incident Action Plan (IAP) / Incident Coordination Plan (ICP) Authorizes resources as needed by the Command Sta Authorized demobilization and conducts the hot wash debrieng Coordinates the completion of the After Action Report/Improvement Plan P u b l i c I n f o r m a t i o n O c e r Develops material for use in media briengs Obtains HEOC Manager's approval of media releases Informs media and conducts media briengs S E O C L i a i s o n O c e r Assists in establishing and coordinating interagency contacts Keeps agencies supporting the incident aware of the incident status Assigned to the SEOC S a f e t y O c e r Identies hazards associated with the response, assesses risk, and reports to the HEOC Manager Reports instances of injury, illness, or exposure Reviews the IAP/ICP for safety implications All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 22 April 2023Role Responsibilities S t a t e E p i d e m i o l o g i s t Provides epidemiological information as needed Serves as the media spokesperson, when appropriate O p e r a t i o n s C h i e f Conducts human and or animal case surveillance Characterizes a disease outbreak Disseminates data internally and to stakeholders Handles public, media and healthcare provider inquiries Develops public messages and oversees risk communication Makes regular updates to local and tribal health departments and tribal jurisdictions Communication and resource tracking with hospitals, urgent care centers and other facilities P l a n n i n g C h i e f Development and maintenance of IAP Completion of PHIMS briefs into situation reports Writing of Governor's reports as necessary Maintenance of the Incident Action Log if HEOC is activated Track plan activation and maintenance Establish an operational battle rhythm Implement the Planning P L o g i s t i c s C h i e f Coordinates receipt, stage, storage and distribution of goods and supplies Distribution of resources to receiving locations Oversees the obtainment of goods and services such as: Facilities Communication equipment and systems Personnel (above and beyond routine need) Public health communication and information sharing F i n a n c e a n d A d m i n i s t r a t i o n C h i e f Oversees procurement of items Maintenance of contracts Evaluation of overtime All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 23 April 2023Direction, Control, and Coordination During AHERP activation, the Director will assign an HEOC Manager to coordinate emergency response activities and oversee HEOC command and general sta (E.g., Finance, Logistics, Operations, and Planning Section Chiefs). The command sta and the HEOC Manager will work together to keep the Director and policy advisors well informed. S e e A p p e n d i x C f o r t h e H E O C o r g a n i z a t i o n a l c h a r t , a l s o k n o w n a s t h e P H I M S c h a r t . The HEOC manager will also coordinate with the SEOC Health and Medical Services Coordinator (staed by ADHS sta personnel), local health departments, tribal partners, and other local, state, tribal and federal agencies. Within the response structure, various policy groups will convene to advise the Director. The Public Information Ocer (PIO) sta will address public information including internal and external communications. The COOP Policy Group will work with the Director to continue or reinstate essential functions. The Vaccine and Antiviral Priority Advisory Committee (VAPAC) will be convened to develop policy for the allocation of scarce medical countermeasures. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 24 April 2023During a catastrophic disaster impacting the statewide healthcare system, the Arizona CSC plan will guide the public health and medical response. Health policy experts and partners from healthcare, public health, emergency management, legal sta and other disciplines will form the State Disaster Medical Advisory Committee (SDMAC). This committee will work with the Director to develop guidance for healthcare organizations and providers to maximize healthcare resources and promote a compassionate and comprehensive response across the state. The relationship between these policy groups is described in Figure 5 below. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 25 April 2023 Direction Control and Coordination for Emergency Response R o l e R e s p o n s i b i l i t y H E O C M a n a g e r Will be supported by the State Epidemiologist, PIO, Liaison Ocer, Safety Ocer and the Section Chiefs. Responsibilities within the PHIMS remain with the HEOC Manager until they are assigned to another individual. When the Operations, Planning, Logistics or Finance responsibilities are established as separate functions under the HEOC Manager then: They are managed by a section chief and can be supported by other functional units called Branch Managers, Group Supervisors and Unit Leads. Will execute the strategies approved by the Director and the above-mentioned policy groups to manage the Operations, Planning, Logistics, and Finance Sections. In addition, this individual may develop the HEOC Incident Action Plan (IAP) or Incident Coordination Plan (ICP) independently or in conjunction with the Planning Section. I A P / I C P is utilized when ADHS has a primary role in the response (E.g., pandemic influenza, Ebola) and includes the objectives and strategies to manage the public health and medical response. The IAP/ICP is a written plan that sets forth the incident objectives and reflects the tactics necessary to manage an incident during an operational period. An ICP may be developed during an Incident Complex where two or more individual incidents in the same general proximity are assigned to a single incident commander. O p e r a t i o n s S e c t i o n Personnel from various programs and disciplines will sta the Operations Section as needed. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 26 April 2023R o l e R e s p o n s i b i l i t y Sta for this section are identied and routinely used to support exercises and public health responses.

Sta for this section are identied and routinely used to support exercises and public health responses. G e n e r a l S t a Are assigned to the Operations, Planning, Logistics or Finance Section. The PHIMS structure ( Appendix B) can expand and contract depending upon the severity and nature of the incident. Sta for the Operations, Planning, Logistics and Finance Sections are identied and routinely used to support exercises and public health responses Emergency Management Assistance Compact The Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) oers assistance during governor-declared states of emergency through a responsive, straightforward system that allows states to send personnel, equipment and commodities to help disaster relief eorts in other states. This program also allows for states to transfer services, such as shipping newborn blood from a disaster-impacted lab to a lab in another state. The HEOC will coordinate with the SEOC, via the SEOC Health and Medical Branch Director, for any resource requests that require the use of EMAC. Figure 6 below illustrates the life cycle of an EMAC request. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 28 April 2023F i g u r e 6 Information Collection, Analysis and Dissemination Information will be collected, analyzed, and disseminated throughout the HEOC and to external partners. The Planning Section is primarily responsible for information collection, subject matter experts across the HEOC will perform information analysis, and the Logistics Section and the JIS is responsible for information dissemination. In keeping with ICS guidelines, a number of standard reports, meetings, and systems are used to manage information. These include the IAP/ICP, situation reports, command sta meetings and JIS. Incident Action/Coordination Plan The IAP/ICP is developed by the Planning Section in conjunction with command and general sta. The plan covers the incident's primary goal and objectives and subsequent actions that are assigned to specic sta members. It is an active document and can change throughout the course of a response. The Planning Section maintains the plan and incorporates changes from the response as needed. ICS forms which make up the IAP/ICP can be found in the HEOC network Library or on FEMA's website . PHIMS Situation Report The PHIMS Situation Report may be incorporated into the response. This document is coordinated and maintained by the Planning Section with input from command and general sta. If implemented, a frequency and sharing mechanism will be decided upon at that time. Situation report templates can be found in the HEOC network library however the response may dictate the nal elements of the document. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 29 April 2023 Command Sta Meetings Command and general sta meet regularly during the incident to share information and resolve issues outlined in the situation reports. Section chiefs will be responsible for communicating key information downstream within their respective sections. Public Information and Joint Information Systems During a response, ADHS may be working with partner agencies to coordinate a JIS, either virtual or in person. The JIS will work closely with the department PIO to develop public messaging related to the health and medical components of the response. This information may include protective actions, health alerts, frequently asked questions, public service announcements and other health related information. Additionally, the information gathering and media monitoring functions of the JIS will be important for all response partners, including public health and medical responders. Information from the media and the general public (including online sources) will help HEOC personnel and public information ocers tailor messaging and response strategies to address hot-topic issues in a timely manner. See the C E R C P l a n for additional information on public information and messaging. Communications Juvare \u00ae - EMResource https://emresource.juvare.com/ EMResource is a hospital Emergency Medical Services (EMS) diversion computer system that is used daily by hospitals and rst responders to communicate capacity levels and help recognize when patient diversion is an optimal choice. The Department is able to notify hospital emergency departments statewide. In addition, it has the capability of notifying local and tribal health departments of outbreak alerts and other messages. The system enables hospital facilities to update their available bed status and to also respond to other inquiries. The type of events that engage the EMResource are incidents involving mass casualty, burn, explosion, chemical, radiation, trauma, biological, law enforcement action, evacuation, natural disaster, National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) (federally requested bed polls) and amber alerts. The hospitals and the county and tribal health departments do not have the capability to send out alerts unless passed on to the control centers, which are Phoenix Fire, Mesa Fire, and Tucson public service answering points (PSAP)s, as well as Bureau of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (BPHEP). All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 30 April 2023AZ-ESAR-VHP The AZ-ESAR-VHP project is designed to address the utilization of health care volunteers for adequately lling positions across the range of public health tasks required during an incident response, and in augmenting hospital and other medical facilities to meet crisis and surge capacity needs. This system currently performs the following functions: Register professional health care volunteers. Apply industry/association credentialing and licensing standards to registered volunteers. Allows for the rapid verication of the identity, credentials, and qualications of registered volunteers during an emergency. Redundant Communication Methods Cell phones (phone calls and text messages), landline phones, radios, and web-based software applications (E.g., Google, WebEx, etc.) will be the primary means of communication between any eld operations (E.g., RSS sites, dispensing sites, etc.), the HEOC, and SEOC. In the event of a loss of power or communications, ADHS retains redundant communication options such as 800 MHz radios, cellular internet communications (VOIP and mobile Wi-Fi). Selected sta are also enrolled in the GETS/WPS program which allows for priority cellular communications during an emergency. Arizona Emergency Information Network Arizona Emergency Information Network The Arizona Emergency Information Network (AzEIN) on-line system is an internet-based source of public information. AzEIN combines information from a wide variety of health and human service providers through a single information network that can easily be accessed by caseworkers and the public at large. In addition, Arizona citizens can access disaster response and homeland security information through the Emergency Bulletin System (EBS) of the AzEIN system, including assistance locating disaster relief organizations and services and obtaining accurate updates regarding threats and disasters. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 31 April 2023The Arizona Health Alert Network https://han.health.azdhs.gov/index.php The AzHAN was developed as part of the eort to enhance the public health response capabilities for the State of Arizona. This program was created to address the communications needs associated with both public health response and daily operational sharing of information for planning and disease surveillance. The AzHAN was designed around 6 major objectives which are outlined in Figure 7. F i g u r e 7 ADHS 24-Hour Information Line A 24-hour menu driven information line exists for the Department and it is overseen by the Arizona Department of Administration (ADOA). Information messages are available in English and Spanish. It is possible to track the number of callers who called, number of callers that selected English, number of callers that selected Spanish, and the number of callers who hung up. It is also possible to determine the number of callers for each available message. The dedicated phone lines are: ( 6 0 2 ) 3 6 4 - 4 5 0 0 or ( 8 0 0 ) 3 1 4 - 9 2 4 3 . WebEOC TM https://azdema.webeocasp.com/azdema/default.aspx This system may be used to establish and maintain situational awareness between the SEOC and the HEOC during operations. Situation reports, IAPs, weather data, emergency declarations and other key events can be posted on the web-based platform. This electronic system may reduce reliance on email and other forms of communication and help reduce redundant information. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 32 April 2023 Authority to Initiate Actions 1. The Agency Director of ADHS, or designated appointee, holds primary responsibility for activation of the HEOC and PHIMS. This power is also vested to the Assistant Director of Public Health Preparedness Services and the Bureau Chief of the BPHEP. 2. Implementation of the AHERP will come from the HEOC Manager or appointed ocial. Administration and Finance ADHS sta from operations, information technology, human resources, nance and accounting may be called upon to assist with emergency operations. Participation from these groups will occur within the HEOC Finance Section and within the COOP Policy Group (see PHIMS Chart for more information). Specic roles identied in the Finance Section may include the Finance Section Chief, the Procurement Branch Director, Services/Contracts Supervisor, and the Cost Reimbursement Supervisor. Finance and administration will be instrumental during the resource request process. Following traditional emergency management and response practices, all incidents begin at the local level. Local governments may request technical assistance from the state. Finance and administrative sta will be needed to track costs associated with technical assistance, including any sta deployments to local health departments. Finance sta will also be involved in tracking any cost reimbursement associated with deploying medical countermeasures or other medical materiel allocated to local health departments. See the M e d i c a l C o u n t e r m e a s u r e s P l a n for more information on the resource request process. MCM and materiel may originate from dierent federal and state agency programs and funding streams. These assets may have varying specics regarding federal request processes, administrative procedures, duciary policies and legal limitations. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 33 April 2023Emergency Procurement During any emergency, there may be a need for the procurement of goods and services to further response eorts. Therefore, ADHS has developed a S t a n d a r d W o r k f o r E m e r g e n c y P r o c u r e m e n t and an E m e r g e n c y C h e c k l i s t to address situations that pose a threat to the public health system and the welfare of the public's safety through the utilization of statewide procurement contracts and state purchasing cards (P-Cards). This procurement process gives ADHS the authority to respond to procurement needs in a fast and flexible way during a declared disaster. Emergency Funding to Counties and Tribes The BPHEP maintains active Intergovernmental Agreements (IGAs) with counties and tribes across the state that can be used in an emergency for pass-through funding. Expedited Hiring of Contract Sta In the event of an emergency, the HEOC Manager can authorize the emergency hiring of contract sta to supplement needed operations. The fast-tracking of hiring contract sta is coordinated by the Logistics Section through the Finance Section. Refer to the C O O P - E M P for the steps involved in accelerating the hiring of contract sta. Plan Development and Maintenance ADHS plan review and revision involves three levels Level 1 - Cosmetic and cursory internal review Level 2 - Operational stakeholder review for content updates Level 3 - Complete Plan Overhaul In collaboration with internal and external stakeholders, BPHEP takes the lead in reviewing and revising the plan to ensure: 1. The plan will be evaluated through exercises or real-world events regularly. ADHS and stakeholder participation will vary and is dependent on the scope of the exercise or event. The associated corrective actions, lessons-learned, and best practices will be implemented and integrated as appropriate. 2. The maintenance of the plan will include a review by communicating through email, telephone, or in-person meetings with operational stakeholders as dictated by the level of review identied. This will occur at a minimum of every three years and in conjunction with an exercise or real-world event. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 34 April 20233. Public comment is available for emergency preparedness plans directly through ADHS' website. 4. The revised plan will be posted to the ADHS public-facing website and led in the agency's HEOC online library. In addition, the updated and approved plan will be shared with all operational stakeholders and other partners to promote local and state emergency planning alignment.

Situation Overview The likelihood of a wildre in the State of Arizona remains extremely high as drought conditions remain in eect. Wildres have been identied as a climate-sensitive hazard in the state according to the Climate and Health Adaptation Plan . In 2020, there were 2,524 reported wildres that burned approximately 979,000 acres. Between 2011-2020 there were 4 notable res: Wallow (2011), Horseshoe 2 (2011), Woodbury (2019), and Bush Fire (2021). Combined these res burned more than 1 million acres according to the National Interagency Fire Center. These events have been caused by a combination of drought, human-causes, lightning, and high temperatures. The largest impacts have occurred in the northern part of the state, such as in Coconino County according to the Arizona Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) Explorer . Additional Planning Assumptions Full community evacuations creating need for mass care and sheltering Medical surge to hospitals and urgent cares for smoke inhalation Epidemiological and lab testing and surveillance for food and water contamination that can result from responder mitigation eorts All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 52 April 2023Response Activities A D H S B r a n c h A c t i v i t y Geographical Information System (GIS) Mapping of licensed facilities and group homes near the impacted area.

Situation Overview Despite its generally dry climate, many places in Arizona are at risk of flooding. As heavy rainfall drains o steep terrain, flash flooding downstream is common. In the deserts, the heavy rainfall hits dry, hardened ground and quickly runs o into normally dry washes that are generally un-bridged. An example of a flood risk would be the summer monsoon season thunderstorms. These storms drop large volumes of rain in 30 minutes or less statewide ( S i t u a t i o n O v e r v i e w e x c e r p t f r o m t h e V u l n e r a b i l i t y A s s e s s m e n t f o r F l o o d i n g i n A r i z o n a , 2 0 1 6 , A D H S C l i m a t e a n d H e a l t h P r o g r a m ) . There are multiple strategies that the Department uses to identify and provide support for vulnerable critical facilities (E.g., nursing homes, schools, childcare centers, hospitals, long-term care centers and other healthcare facilities). Primarily, ADHS uses a licensed facility interactive map that shows a street-level view of all licensed facilities and gives key facility information. Additional Planning Assumptions This appendix applies to all flood types (E.g., flash flood, over bank (river/stream) flooding, urban, ground failures/dam breaks, and fluctuating lake levels) as well as all severity of floods (E.g., localized flash flooding, 100-year floods, and 500-year floods). All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 57 April 2023Response Activities Flooding can occur at many levels from a simple reported flood watch to massive flooding resulting in evacuations, EMS transport disruptions, and drinking water impacts. The HEOC will activate and respond appropriately to the level of disruption.

Situation Overview The NWS identies heat as the single deadliest weather event in the United States, responsible for more fatalities per year than floods, lightning, tornadoes, and hurricanes combined. In Arizona, heat was responsible for 2,429 deaths between 2010 and 2020. Of these, 1,748 were heat-related deaths of Arizona residents and 681 were non residents. By recognizing a heat wave in its early stages, actions can be taken by state, county, tribal, and local public health agencies to mitigate the public health impact. Data shows that extreme weather events, such as heat waves, will continue to become more frequent as well as more severe. Observed warming trends suggest that Arizona will experience signicant warming in the coming years which, in turn, could have a signicant impact on air quality, public health, and critical infrastructure. For this reason, long term planning for extreme weather events, such as extreme heat, is critical to ensure the health and safety of all Arizonans. Additional Planning Assumptions The State of Arizona experiences several, consecutive days of triple-digit heat throughout the summer; these are normally coupled with warm, overnight temperatures as well. By the time an extreme heat incident starts (extreme heat watch/warning) the window for preventative action is very short. The populations at risk from heat-related illnesses are vast with varied ages, pre existing health conditions, socio-economic factors, religious beliefs, and locations. Heat stroke is fast setting and has a high mortality rate. Early identication and prevention are essential in prevention. Warning and messaging systems are already established by the NWS using various media outlets (news, radio, web, etc.).

While much of the information herein may cover an incident at Palo Verde Generating Station (PVGS), full details of this type of response can be found in the S t a t e o f A r i z o n a / M a r i c o p a C o u n t y O s i t e E m e r g e n c y R e s p o n s e P l a n P a l o V e r d e G e n e r a t i n g S t a t i o n plan. Situation Overview Radiological or nuclear events can pose unique challenges to health and human safety resulting in cascading eects in the hospital and healthcare system. Radiological emissions vary in resulting eects to the human body. In addition, they cannot be seen or heard and are odorless. These emissions however are detectable and measurable with appropriate detection equipment. State subject matter experts for this type of event are the Bureau of Radiation Control (BRC) - Arizona Department of Health Services, 91st Civil Support Team, Technical Hazards Branch - Department of Emergency and Military Aairs, Department of Energy, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. I n c i d e n t T y p e D e s c r i p t i o n Radiological Dispersal Device (Dirty Bomb) A dirty bomb is a mix of explosives, such as dynamite, with radioactive powder or pellets. When the dynamite or other explosives are set o, the blast carries radioactive material into the surrounding area. Contamination and exposure threat. Radiological Exposure Device (RED) Radioactive material or an object containing radioactive material can expose people to radiation without their knowledge. Such objects are called Radiological Exposure Devices (REDs), or hidden sealed sources. Exposure threat Transportation Accident Accidents involving the transport of radioactive materials could result in debris, contamination, and exposure on major roadways. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 73 April 2023Improvised Nuclear Device (IND) An explosion that produces an intense pulse of heat, light, air pressure, and radiation resulting in fallout. Palo Verde Generating Station The largest nuclear power plant in the United States. Additional Planning Assumptions Local government authorities have response plans in place to deal with a radiological emergency. The initial response phase may be complicated by the fact that the incident site could be a mass casualty scene, possibly a life-threatening hazard area, and a crime scene. Based on the severity of the event, sheltering-in-place may be used as a protective action. Local hazardous materials teams have proper equipment and training to search, detect, and characterize radioactive materials. Potassium iodide (KI) or other prophylactics may be distributed to the public (based on recommendations of the Department of Emergency and Military Aairs DEMA, ADHS or other public health agencies). PVGS Below is some specic technical information regarding an incident at PVGS. E m e r g e n c y P l a n n i n g Z o n e s The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has established two Emergency Planning Zones (EPZs) around each commercial nuclear power plant in the nation. The zone within 10 miles (16 km) of the plant is designated the Plume Exposure Pathway EPZ and the region within 50 miles (80 km) from the plant is designated the Ingestion Exposure Pathway EPZ. This plan documents the health response activities at both of these EPZs in response to an event at PVGS. EPZs are dened as osite areas for which emergency response contingency operations are planned to protect the public health and safety in the event of a xed nuclear facility incident. P l u m e E x p o s u r e P a t h w a y E P Z The plume EPZ lies entirely within Maricopa County and has a radius of 10 miles from the plant center. The principal sources of radiation dose are direct exposure from a passing plume of radioactive material and inhalation of radioactive materials resulting from immersion in the plume. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 74 April 2023I n g e s t i o n E x p o s u r e P a t h w a y E P Z The Ingestion EPZ lies within Maricopa County and extends to a radius of 50 miles from the plant center. If the Ingestion Exposure pathway extends to the 50-miles, it may also aect La Paz, Pinal, Yavapai and Yuma counties.

The activity also represents the number of radiations emitted. Curie (Ci), Becquerel (Bq) Absorbed Dose The absorbed dose is the radiation energy absorbed per unit mass of an organ or tissue. Rad, Gray (Gy) Eective Dose Eective dose is calculated for the whole body. It is the addition of equivalent doses to all organs, each adjusted to account for the sensitivity of the organ to radiation. Rem, Sievert (Sv) Exposure Typically by gamma radiation, your body has absorbed energy. Rad, rem, Sv, Gy Contamination A person has radioactive material on their clothes or body.

Distance Increasing your distance from a source will greatly reduce your exposure. Distance vs exposure principles follow the inverse square law where I 1 D 1 2 = I 2 D 2 2 Shielding Use proper shielding based on the radiation type to block emissions from your body. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 86 April 2023Epidemiologic Surveillance and Exposure Registry Forms Epidemiologists will conduct public health surveillance after an event to understand the burden of disease or amount of exposure in the community. Knowledge of illnesses, injuries, and deaths are critical measures of disaster status and conditions. Health surveillance attempts to provide situational awareness for decision makers such as public health and emergency response authorities. Several standardized surveillance forms have been developed that may be used after a radiological incident to collect surveillance information, as follows: 1 ) Morbidity Surveillance Forms (individual and aggregate) to capture active surveillance of medical conditions and other disaster related outcomes 2 ) Mortality Surveillance Forms (individual and aggregate) to identify number of deaths related to the disaster/event and provide basic mortality information 3 ) Shelter Needs Assessment to record environmental assessments of shelters and evacuation centers 4 ) Exposure Registry Form to capture contact information of persons potentially exposed to radiation and identify long-term health consequences to further inform the need for ongoing care or public health measures as well as developing health education and disease prevention measures.

In addition to radiological contamination, there may be more traditional food safety circumstances to contend with such as proper refrigeration of foods in the event of a power outage and an adequate supply of potable water for hand washing and washing of equipment and utensils. The Food Safety and Environmental Services Program is the regulatory authority for retail food establishments, which include facilities such as produce warehouses, food processors engaged in intrastate commerce, food service at special events, school food service (school cafeterias), restaurants, grocery stores, and convenience stores. The Arizona Department of Agriculture is responsible for the safety of eggs, dairy, raw meats, grains and fresh fruits and vegetables (in the eld or on the farm). The ADA has the authority under (A.R.S. \u00a7 3-107) to abate, suppress, control, regulate, seize, quarantine or destroy any agricultural product or food that has been adulterated or contaminated as a result of an incident at a commercial nuclear generating station. See the table before for the , FDA Recommended Derived Intervention Levels (DILs) for Human Food and Animal Feed. All-Hazard Emergency Response Plan Page | 102 April 2023 Federal Response The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) coordinates the federal government response to radiological incidents of national signicance in accordance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5 and the National Response Framework. The Nuclear/Radiological Incident Annex of the National Response Framework describes how the coordinating agencies and cooperating agencies support the Department of Homeland Security's overall coordination of the response. Coordinating agencies have specic nuclear/radiological expertise and assets to respond to an incident. If the incident or threat of an incident falls below the threshold of a nuclear/radiological Incident of National Signicance, then the activities mentioned for the coordination and cooperation agencies in the Nuclear/Radiological Incident Annex of the National Response Framework may take place without the coordination of DHS. The United States Attorney General generally acting through the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has lead responsibility for criminal investigation of terrorist acts or terrorist threats. (For a complete list of federal roles and responsibilities, refer to the Nuclear/Radiological Incident Annex of the National Emergency Response Framework).
