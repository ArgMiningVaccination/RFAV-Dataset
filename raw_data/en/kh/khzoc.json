Acupuncture points for weight loss are also a service that removes toxins from the body. The practice is a part of traditional Chinese medicine and is known for balancing the flow of energy or life force \u2014 known as chi or qi (chee). The flow of energy is believed to flow through a vast network of pathways in your body. By inserting needles into specific points along these pathways, those who practice acupuncture believe energy flow will re-balance, and whatever is disrupting the normal flow of energy will be eliminated.
