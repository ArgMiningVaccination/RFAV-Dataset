Pruitt* The cachet that India currently enjoys on the world stage is linked largely to the booming high-tech and se rvice economies associated with its megacities. Yet in terms of sheer num bers, India is not an urban nation. About a third of India's population lives in urban areas, though that figure is rising quickly. One projection indi cates that thirty-one villagers will continue to show up in an Indian city every minute over the next forty- three years \u2014 700 million people in all. Lack of sustainable development in rural areas is a major force behind the massive rural-to-urban migration across Asia. An enormous challenge currently facing India and many of its neighbors is thus how to manage the migration. One aspect of that challenge is providing for the nation's rural remnant \u2014 for those who are left behind in villages and towns as cities burgeon and sprawl. To mitigate rural-to-urban migration and accommodate growth that is sustainable both environmentally and economically, India must attend to rural development. This means responding to infrastructure deficits in order to meet some very basic needs (e.g., water, sanitation), but it also means providing education and health care, along with rural econo mic development through strategic thinking about agricultural producti on and job creation. Meeting this challenge has clear implications for how the nation of India, along with its state and local governments, distribute government resources. This Article considers India's uneven development across the rural- urban axis through the lens of th e capabilities framework developed by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. The capabilities approach argues for universal human rights based on a reco gnition of each human being \"as an * Professor of Law, University of Californi a, Davis.

Nussbaum also refers to equality as an aspect of capabilities, linking it in particular to dignity and seeing it as a salient concern in relation to core socioeconomic rights, such as those to he alth care and education. Nussbaum's thinking on capabilities ha s been greatly informed by her time in India and by the situation th ere. Further, Nussbaum references the rural-urban axis as among the power disparities relevant to citizens' realization of capabilities. In usin g a capabilities frame for assessing India's approach to rural development, this Article attends particularly to the life, bodily health, and education capabilities, arguing that India should aspire to a degree of parit y across the rural-urban axis in providing these foundational capabilitie s. Further, the Article analogizes rurality to disability and gender as a crucial characteristic to which government should attend in programming to meet the needs of rural citizens. The Article also considers briefly the potential of the Indian Constitution to mitigate distributive inequities associated with government's relative neglec t of rural populations. Finally, the Article discusses what is at stake for India and the rest of Asia in staking out a path of sust ainable development that explicitly considers the rural-urban axis. This path should move beyond the parallel tracks of urban planning and rural development so that development and planning go hand in hand along the rural-urban continuum and across the nation. Regional towns and small cities are sure to be a critical part of any solution to the present state of grossly uneven development.

It is in the cities \u2014 in the big metropolises like Mumbai and Bangalore, but also in the thousands of smaller towns that have swollen over the last couple of decades \u2014 that the future of India is being shaped.10 That urban center of economic gravity and the concomitant poverty and lack of opportunity in the countryside are both the cause and consequence of contemporary migration patterns in India. That migration is, in short, one \"of despair.\" 11 It is a migration that \"depresses wage-rates, denudes rural areas of innovators,\" and \"leads to rising social costs of urban poverty,\" all without actually reducing chronic poverty. 12 As such, it is hardly a tenable or sustainable solution to a nation's social or economic woes.13 India's dramatically uneven development places enormous strain on that nation's rural population, as well as on the various scales of government that serve them. This urbanization juggernaut thus challenges the nation of India and its component government entities14 \u2014 along with international donors and development agencies engaged there \u2014 to consider the extent to which urbanization is the answer to India's woes, as well as the ways in which a metrocentric development path creates as many problems as it solves. 15 If urbanization, 10 Id. 11 Axel Wolz, G LOBAL DONOR PLATFORM FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT , THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS \u2014 A JOINT NARRATIVE 16 (2005), available at http://www.donorplatform.org/ load/9509. 12 Id. 13 See id . at 16-17 (describing that rural-to-urb an migration is not generally seen as indicator of econom ic growth unless it is followed by nation's improved agricultural productivity).

What should the development priorities be, and how can India distribute government resources in order to foster them? This Article takes up these questions and others with particular attention to what I call India's \"rural remnant\" \u2014 those left behind in what are popularly referred to as villages by the urban migration juggernaut. In particular, I look at how India's economic and development policies under-serve rura l populations, thus fueling the migration. While India provides the specific context for this analysis, many of the observations are relevant to the rest of Asia and, indeed, the world. Rural-to-urban migration is a powerful phenomenon worldwide, and Asia is a \"hot spot\" for it. 16 One reason is that a rural- urban income gap persists in Asia, even as it has narrowed in recent decades in much of the world.17 Agriculture and rural-related activities provide the livelihoods of three-quarters of the world's poor,18 a great m a n y o f t h e m i n A s i a .19 If poverty alleviation and endowment with capabilities is the goal, policy makers must attend to the rural context in which so many of the world's poor live.20 16 In China, for example, over 32% of th e 34.1 million migrants during the period between 1985 and 1990 were internal migrants. See Canfei He & Patricia Gober, Gendering Interprovincial Migration in China , 37 I NT'L MIGRATION REV. 1220, 1226 (2003).

Nu ssbaum also notes that the capabilities framework's use to make \"comparisons of life quality\" and, thus, provide an alternative to \"standard measures, such as GNP per capita and utility\" is a secondary, \"weaker,\" use than its role as \"philosophical underpinning for . . . basic constitutional principles.\" Id. at 5-6. 23 See infra notes 216-17 and accompanying text. 24 See infra notes 218 and accompanying text. 25 See infra notes 218 and accompanying text. 26 NUSSBAUM , FRONTIERS OF JUSTICE , supra note 21, at 76-78. These are: 1. Life . Being able to live to the end of a human life of normal length; not dying prematurely, or before one's life is so reduced as to be not worth living. 2. Bodily Health . Being able to have good h ealth, including reproductive health; to be adequately nourished; to have adequate shelter. 3. Bodily Integrity . Being able to move freely from place to place; to be secure against violent assault, including sexual assault and domestic violence; having opportunities for sexual satisfaction and for choice in matters of reproduction. 4. Senses, Imagination, and Thought . Being able to use the senses, to imagine, think, and reason \u2014 and to do these things in a \"truly human\" way, a way informed and cultivated by an adequate education, including, but by no means limited to, literacy and basic mathematical and scientific training. Being able to use imagination and thought in connection with experiencing and producing works and events of one's own choice, religious, literary, musical, and so forth. Being able to use one's mind in ways 810 University of California, Davis [Vol. 44:803 development27 in India: (1) life, (2) bodily health, and (3) education.28 I do so because these three are foundational to the realization of most protected by guarantees of freedom of expression with respect to both political and artistic speech, and freedom of religious exercise. Being able to have pleasurable experiences and to avoid non beneficial pain. 5. Emotions. Being able to have attachment s to things and people outside ourselves; to love those who love and care for us, to grieve at their absence; in general, to love, to grieve, to expe rience longing, grat itude, and justified anger. Not having one's emotional development blighted by fear and anxiety. (Supporting this capability means supporting forms of human association that can be shown to be cruc ial in their development.) 6. Practical Reason. Being able to form a conception of the good and to engage in critical reflection about the planning of one's life. (This entails protection for the liberty of conscience and religious observance.) 7. Affiliation. a. Being able to live with and toward others, to recognize and show concern for other human beings, to engage in various forms of social interaction; to be able to imagine the situation of another. (Protecting this capability means protect ing institutions that constitute and nourish such forms of affiliation, and also protecting the freedom of assembly and political speech.) b. Having the social bases of self -respect and non humiliation; being able to be treated as a dignified being whose wort h is equal to that of others. This entails provisions of non discrimination on the basis of race, sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, caste, religion, national origin. 8. Other Species. Being able to live with concern for and in relation to animals, plants, and the world of nature. 9. Play. Being able to laugh, to play, to enjoy recreational activities. 10. Control over one's Environment. a. Political. Being able to participate effectively in political choices that govern one's life; having the right of political participation, protections of free speech and association. b. Material. Being able to hold property (both land and movable goods), and having property rights on an equal basis with others; having the right to seek employment on an equal basis with others; having the freedom from unwarranted search and seizure. In work, being able to work as a human being, exercising practical reason and entering into meaningful relationship s of mutual recognition with other workers. Nussbaum's list is not set in stone. She recognizes that it may require editing or additions in the future. Id. 27 \"Rural development\" might be seen as a redundant term because only rural areas are, almost by definition, undeveloped and, therefore, in need of development. I assume, however, that rural livelihoods and economies can be developed and 2011] Human Rights and Development for India's Rural Remnant 811 other capabilities.29 Indeed, both Sen and Nussbaum sometimes set these three apart as a cluster, inviting analysis of them as related and yet distinct from other capabilities, which are more in the nature of civil and political rights.30 diversified in ways that do not n ecessarily result in urbanization. See Lisa R. Pruitt, Deconstructing CEDAW's Article 14: N aming and Explaining Rural Difference , 17 W M. & MARY J. WOMEN & L. 347 (2011) [hereinafter Deconstructing CEDAW's Article 14 ]; see also infra note 285 and accompanying text (dis cussing Escobar and the issue of individual autonomy in re lation to development). 28 Nussbaum expresses and categorizes educat ion as an aspect of the capability she labels \"Senses, Imagin ation, and Thought.\" N USSBAUM , FRONTIERS OF JUSTICE , supra note 21, at 76. 29 Professor Jennifer Prah Ruger, for example, writes of \"central health capabilities [as] prerequisites for other capabilities, such as developing abilities, using talents, and carrying out plans\" associated with the other capabilities. Jennifer Prah Ruger, Global Health Justice , 2 P UB. HEALTH ETHICS 261, 268 (2009). Ruger asserts that \"certain aspects of health capability sustain other aspects of human flourishing, because without life itself, no other human functionings are possible.\" Id. at 266. She continues: \"Health needs \u2014 for physician care and medication, for instance \u2014 map directly to health functionings, which in turn map to health capabilities.\" Id.; see also Jennifer Prah Ruger, Health, Capability, and Justice: Toward a New Paradigm of Health Ethics, Policy and Law , 15 C ORNELL J.L. & PUB. POL'Y 403, 407-08 (2006). Professor Gregory Alexander similarly writes, \"life, including certain subsidiary values such as health\" is among the functionings \"necessary for a well-lived life.\" Gregory S. Alexander, The Social-Obligation Norm in American Property Law , 94 C ORNELL L. REV. 745, 764-65 nn.72-73 (2009) (listing freedom to make deliberate choices, practical reasoning, and sociality as among other functionings). It is not clear, however, that Nussbaum would agree with the prioritizatio n of these capabilities. Indeed, it might not be within the spirit of Nussbaum to focus on one capability (or a few) to the neglect of others. See Michael Ashley Stein & Penelope J.S. Stein, Beyond Disability Civil Rights , 58 H ASTINGS L.J. 1203, 1217-18 (2008). To be considered just political arrangements under Nussbaum's capability scheme, States must provide sufficient resources to enable people to be raised up to the basic threshold level of ten central capabilities. Further, since each capability is a separate component in her theory, States cannot provide for one capability beyond the threshold (for instance, a superlative healthcare system), while denying or limiting another (e.g., denying women the franchise or limit ing its salience). Id. at 1217-18 (footnotes omitted). 30 In grappling with requirements of adequacy versus equality of capabilities, Nussbaum generally advocates only adequacy in relation to socioeconomic-type rights. NUSSBAUM , FRONTIERS OF JUSTICE , supra note 21, at 292-93. With respect to education and health care, however, she suggests that \"adequacy does appear to require something close to equality.\" Id. at 294; see also infra text accompanying notes 238-43. As for Sen, he links \"unfreedom\" to poverty's consequences, writing about health care and education in particular. Sen states that sometimes \"unfreedom links closely to the lack of public facilities and social care, such as the absence of epidemiological 812 University of California, Davis [Vol. 44:803 In Part I, I provide a statistical portrait of poverty in India, with particular attention to differences across the rural-urban axis. That part includes a brief history of Indian development, including poverty amelioration efforts, with a particular focus on investments and interventions in the agricultural an d other rural sectors. It documents rural-urban disparities in infrastructure and services that have a direct impact on life and bodily health (e.g., water, sanitation and health care) and also discusses investment in education. This part illustrates rural disadvantage so that I can analyze these disparities through the lens of capabilities theory in Part II. There, I argue that many among India's rural remnant are denied the core capabilities that would permit them to flourish as human beings and enjoy a wider range of capabilities. I further assert that \u2014 consistent with capabilities thinking and, indeed, with its own Constitution \u2014 India has an obligation to provide adequately for its rural residents. Throughout this Article, I draw illustrations of rural disadvantage from Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger , an award-winning novel that features an Indian story of rural-to-urban migration. The tale of Balram, the novel's central character and narrator, illustrates and enriches this discussion about lif e and deprivation in rural India. While The White Tiger is a work of fiction, the novel's depiction of rural disadvantage and the government corruption 31 that further entrenches it closely reflects what data, empirical studies, and media reports tell us about contemporary India. Indeed, Adiga has opined elsewhere about the way in which Indian development should proceed in order to bridge the rural-urban programs, or of organized arrangements for health care or educational facilities, or of effective institutions for the maintenance of local peace and order.\" S EN, DEVELOPMENT AS FREEDOM , supra note 2, at 4.

Adiga contends that such intermediate cities would facilitate job growth and improve living space, thus fostering a more humane and moderate rural-to-urban transition. Like Adiga, I believe that a nationally coordinated approach to India's economic and population growth is desirable. Such an approach would attend to both rural development and urban planning, while also seeing these endeavors as closely related. Indeed, the United Nations International Fund for Agricultural Development (\"IFAD\") has endorsed this approach in its Rural Poverty Report 2011 , noting the benefits rural populations garner from regional towns and small cities. 33 I.

B. A Short History of Indian Development Following independence at the middle of the twentieth century, India's development strategy was one of heavy industrialization, a process that often came at the expense of the agricultural sector.48 Between 1951 and 1956, for example, the Indian government allocated 31% of its budgets to the agricultural sector, but government expenditures on the rural sector fell to approximately 20-25% over the next five years.49 Investment in rural development has since continued to decline, with many \"urban and growth-oriented\" development initiatives largely neglecting rural India.50 As one scholar expresses it, policies concentrating on economic growth rather than on \"equity and equality, have widened the gap between 'urban and rural' and 'haves and have-nots.' \" 51 Indeed, rural-urban income gaps remain wider across Asia than in any other world region.52 Meanwhile, IFAD's Rural Poverty Report 2011 categorizes India as a nation with a \"high level of hunger and slow progress in improving it.\"53 Fostering sustainable economic growth and development is the most effective way to increase overall welfare for India's rural population.54 47 Id.; see also Lydia Polgreen, Indian State Empowers Po or to Fight Corruption, N.Y.

While some push for the development of large industrial farms as a solution to rural povert y, others argue that smaller farms represent the preferable path for the agricultural sector. Drawing from lessons from the Green Revolution, 69 of which India is often held out as a model,70 the GDPRD Report advocates agricultural development, among other types of region-specific intervention, to help alleviate rural poverty.71 Agricultural growth in the small farm sector can also generate employment opportunities, which are good for the poor and achieve favorable distribution between rural and urban sectors.72 While modern farming methods often increase output, they also tend to diminish the need for agricultural labor, thus ultimately driving migration to the city. 73 They may also lead to soil degradation and other environmental problems.74 For those countries in early stages of development, the Report suggests that small farms often achieve higher economic efficiency and higher land productivity using less development of rural infrastructure will likely serve as essential part of solution to both rural and urban poverty in long-run). 68 See id. at 5; see also RURAL POVERTY REPORT 2011, supra note 33, at 178-79 (discussing \"sustainable agricultural in tensification\" and the need to produce sufficient food for the world's growing popu lation while also preserving and restoring the natural resources base). 69 The Green Revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s was a time when scholars, economists, and politicians began to redirect their focus toward improving the agricultural sector.

Compared to large farms, small farms have higher land capital productivities and lower labor productivities,75 which is beneficial in a country like India, which has a labor surplus.76 A \"vibrant small farm sector\" also deters rapid rural-to-urban migration. 77 Because India already experienced a degree of agricultural development during the Green Revolution,78 however, the advantages of small farm development may now be diminished.79 In any event, various Indian laws impede the growth of large-scale, intensive production agriculture. Traditional inheritance laws entitle all children to equal shares in their parents' property,80 resulting in fragmentation of property ownership that makes it difficult for farmers to use modern farm equipment because they cannot achieve the requisite economy of scale.81 The fragmentation of land holdings challenges major investors, which seek to develop quickly and on a large scale.82 Despite the significance of the agri cultural sector to rural India, some studies suggest that the Indi an government should concentrate its poverty alleviation initiatives in other vehicles for long-term growth.83 Strategic investment in non-agricultural job development in 75 Wolz, supra note 11, at iii (noting that small farms play important role in rural poverty reduction and in mitigating rural-to-urban migrations because they are associated with \"higher land productivity, lower capital intensities, and expenditure patterns that promote growth\"). 76 See MUKUNDAN , supra note 37, at 11-13. 77 Wolz, 11, at iii. 78 Cassen & McNay, supra note 34, at 183 (highlight ing strong link between poverty reduction and increased expenditure on rural infrastructure as result of government-launched Green Revolution). 79 Wolz, supra note 11, at 9 (noting that diminut ion of benefits associated with small farms occurs as countries develop and labor becomes more scarce relative to land and capital). 80 M UKUNDAN , supra note 37, at 10. 81 Id. at 11; see also RURAL POVERTY REPORT 2011, supra note 33, at 89 (reporting that India's \"average landholding size fell fr om 2.6 hectares in 1960 to 1.4 hectares in 2000\"). 82 Wal-Mart's current efforts to gain a foot hold in India are illustrative: it started small by purchasing produce from local farmer s while investing in low-tech agricultural innovation with and for them.

To maximize the benefit to the rural poor , aid initiatives must target rural communities based on assessment of educational levels and professional skills. Fostering industries like carpentry, food processing, and artisan trades can both assist with rural development and alleviate some strain on agricultural employment. 84 Development of these smaller sectors, however, is complicated by issues like illiteracy, irregular supplies of raw materials, and access to start-up credit and capital.85 Poverty responds less to economic growth in some states than in others.86 Among the factors that impede the poor's ability to benefit from economic growth are inequality of land distribution, low levels of education and literacy, and uneven development between rural and urban areas. 87 States with higher literacy rates, for example, are likely to feature more and better opportuni ties for nonagricultural economic growth.88 Antecedent inequalities in rural places thus limit the capacity for industrialization and growth of service sectors to alleviate rural poverty.89 Other \"productivity-enhancing\" investments, including rural infrastructure (e.g., roads and electricity) and other forms of rural development that directly target the rural poor,90 contribute to poverty Committee on the Elimination of All Form s of Discrimination Against Women, Consideration of Reports Submitted by States Parties Under Article 18 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women : Combined Second and Third Periodic Reports , \u00b6 292-96, U.N.

Life and Bodily Health I came to Dhanbad after my father's death. He had been ill for some time, but there is no hospital in Laxmangarh, although there are three different foundation stones for a hospital laid by three different politicians before three different elections. When he began spitting blood that morning, Kishan and I took him by boat across the river. We kept washing his mouth with water from the river, but the water was so polluted that it made him spit more blood. There was a rickshaw-puller on the other side of the river who recognized my father; he took the three of us for free to the government hospital. There were three black goats sitting on the steps to the large, faded white building; the stench of goat feces wafted out from the open door. The glass in most of the windows was broken; a cat was staring out at us from one cracked window. **** . . . There was no doctor in the hospital. The ward boy, after we bribed him ten rupees, said that a doctor might come in the evening. The doors to the hospital's rooms were wide open; the beds had metal springs sticking out of them, and the cat began snarling at us the moment we stepped into the room.

Adiga goes on to explain why there was no doctor 824 University of California, Davis [Vol. 44:803 Strong connections exist between bodily health and access to basic provisions and services such as clean water, advanced sanitation, and health care. The lack of these basic amenities often leads to illness or premature death. Statistics indicate that nearly 70% of all deaths and 92% of deaths from communicable diseases occur among the poorest 20% of the population.101 In India, waterborne infections account for roughly 80% of illnesses, leading to an annual loss of 73 million workdays and an annual death rate of 1.5 million.102 In rural areas, infectious and communicable diseases \u2014 most of them preventable \u2014 cause the majority of deaths.103 Indeed, the incidence of all diseases is twice as high in rural areas than in urban ones.104 A significant factor at the hospital. \"Why isn't there a doctor here, uncle?\" I asked. \"This is the only hospital on either side of the river.\" \"See, it's like this,\" the old Mus lim man said. \"There's a government medical superintendent who's meant to check that doctors visit village hospitals like this.

Water and Sanitation Infrastructure Since its independence, India has made great strides in developing its water supply infrastructure.106 Rapid improvement of drainage and irrigation systems has been one of its major successes.107 Despite these improvements, however, India still faces many challenges in providing clean water to its burgeoning populace, including those associated with a shrinking supply of groundwater and the advent of urbanization. 108 Because urban centers are associated with higher demands for water and infrastructure, rural areas \u2014 especially those adjacent to urban clusters \u2014 often suffer water shortages. 109 The limited extent and sophistication of water and sanitation infrastructure in rural areas is in stark contrast to that in urban India. Statistics paint a bleak portrait of this aspect of rural underdevelopment. While about half of urban residents have access to water and sanitation systems, only about a fifth of rural residents do. 110 Approximately 5.4 million of India's total 7.2 million \"dry latrines\" (i.e., communal toilets that do not flush) are located in urban areas.111 In thirteen of India's twenty-eight states, the vast majority of rural households do not have any latrine, 112 with as few as 3.9% of Orissa's residents and as few as 5.5% of Madhya Pradesh's residents having latrines.113 Of more than 4000 Indian towns, only about 5% have a 105 Id. at 131; see also infra notes 130-76 and accompanying text. 106 PLANNING COMM'N, GOV'T OF INDIA, W ATER SUPPLY & SANITATION 15-16 (2002), available at http://planningcommission.nic.i n/reports/genrep/wtrsani.pdf. 107 Id. at 15. 108 Id. at 15. 109 Id. at 16. 110 K.J.

In rural areas, it has \"been esti mated that 94 percent of houses lack latrines, 97 percent lack separate bathrooms, and 68 percent of the people depend on ordinary well-water. The houses of the poor usually lack minimum amenities like an approach road, drinking water, drainage, electricity and basic cleanliness.\" Nirmala Murthy et al., How Well Do India's Social Services Programs Serve the Poor? 3 (Pol'y Research & External Aff., Working Paper No. 491, 1990). 113 See Mavalankar & Shankar, supra note 112, at 317 tbl.13.1.5 . 826 University of California, Davis [Vol. 44:803 partially complete sewage system.114 It comes as little surprise, then, that the most common method of excretion in rural India is open defecation.115 Despite the dire need, improvements in water and sanitation have been slow to reach rural areas. Between 1988 and 1998, the percentage of households with no latrine declined from 89.0% to 82.5% in rural areas, while it fell from 31.8% to 25.5% in urban locales.116 If implementation of improved sanitation in rural areas continues at the current pace, full coverage will not be achieved for some three quarters of a century.117 One 2004 report contemplates a \"future where even the poor have telephones but not toilets or clean water.\"118 The World Bank estimates that poor sanita tion and lack of clean water cost India between $3-8 billion per year, or 1.5% to 3% of the country's GDP. 119 Under the Indian Constitution, wate r and sanitation are principally the responsibility of local governments, called gram panchayats .120 The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India indicates that state governments are primarily responsible for water supplies, storage, and sanitation. 121 The 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution of India further allocate responsib ilities across the rural and urban divide.122 Rural governments,123 specifically the intermediate level of 114 Nath, supra note 110, at S21. 115 Id.

M OHANTY , supra note 14, at 360. After the passage of the Seventy-Third Amendment of the Constitution of India, each state is required to have a three-tiered Panchayati Raj consisting of : (i) village level government (also referred to as the \"Gram Sabha\" with a membership including v illagers and/or voters in the area); (ii) intermediate level (also frequently referred to as the \"Panchayat Samiti\" headed by an 2011] Human Rights and Development for India's Rural Remnant 827 local government, are responsible for providing a supply of drinking water.124 While the central government has no duty to supply water, it must allocate funds, encourage research, and \u2014 perhaps most importantly \u2014 ensure the implementation of water supply programs. 125 In line with these obligations, the central government has made efforts to assist in providing adequate water supplies to rural areas. An example of such an effort is the establishment of the Ministry of Rural Development, a branch of the central government responsible for monitoring various aspects of rura l development, including drinking water and sanitation. 126 Although this effort is commendable, allocations and expenditures for improved water supply and sanitation remain unimpressive.127 From 1987 through 2001, the central government allocated 2% of its budget for water supply and sanitation, whereas 17% of the budget was allocated for telecommunication services.128 One study indicates that the central government allocated less than half of the funds required for sanitation.129 To make matters worse, the Centrally Sponsored Rura l Sanitation Programme spent just 49% of allocated funds in 2000. This data gives little hope for significant short-term improvement in India's rural water and sanitation infrastructure. 2. Health Care As with other measures of development, stark disparities in health care access and resources exist across the rural-urban divide. While the level of the Indian government's expenditure on health care has remained fairly constant over the past five years at about 5% of total expenditures, 130 which is less than 1% of GDP,131 only about a fifth of elected Chair Person); and (iii) district leve l (also frequently referred to as the \"Zila Parishad\" with a membership that is directly elected).

For example, the central government passed the Model Public Health Act in 1951 and revised it in 1987, but most states have not adopted the Act. Consequently, while some municipal areas still have public health facilities and regulations in place, such infrastructure is rarer in small towns and rural locales.167 By failing to adopt a unified standard and permitting municipalities to retain their own regulations, less developed areas suffer health care deficits.168 Compounding difficulties in gaining access to health care is the fact that just one tenth of Indians have any form of health insurance.169 Almost 60% of the average citizen's total annual expenditures are on medical care, and 25% of Indian people who are hospitalized become impoverished while attempting to cover their medical expenses. 170 That is, they must borrow heavily or sell assets to cover medical costs, causing many to fall below the poverty line.171 A study of rural families' health care expenditures found that \"70% of families spend 60% of their annual income on health\" while 93% of health care expenditures went to \"curative and emergency care.\"172 Further, because public-sector health services are \"ill-equipped and unaccountable,\"173 poor families must often use private services which leave them \"spending a higher percentage of their income on health than do the rich.\" 174 At the national level, focus is sh ifting towards creating a \"federal\" authority, designed similarly to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.175 The oversight agency's design, combined with funding sources like the NRHM and the National Sanitation Mission, have the potential to transform the state of public health services in India.176 All could have profound impacts on India's rural sector. 167 Id. at 6. 168 Id. 169 See Ranjit Devraj, Hunger Haunts Hospitals , INTER -PRESS SERVICE , Jan. 3, 2010, http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49877. 170 See id. 171 See id.

But we never ever saw rotis, or yellow daal, or pickles, and everyone knew why: the school teacher had stolen our lunch money.

He was going to undertake a Gandhian protest to retrieve his missing wages \u2014 he was going to do nothing in class until his paycheck arrived in the mail.

Due to a shortage of resources and lack of political will, the syst em suffers from high pupil-teacher ratios, poor infrastructure, an d inadequate teacher training.184 Government schools in rural areas remain particularly poorly funded and understaffed.185 Inadequate school buildings and uneven distribution of state grant funds often compound the challenges facing rural teachers.186 Of India's 700,000 rural schools, only one in six has 179 Data from 1998-99 show that the gap between educational opportunity for rural and urban children increases with the child's age, as does the gender gap.

For those in the younger age group, about 90% of urban females and 92% of urban males were atte nding school, while only 83% of rural males and 75% of rural females attended. The percentage of urban children aged 11-14 attending school was 85% for males and 83% for females, while on ly 61% of rural females and 79% of rural males in the same age group were attending.

In rural areas, 26.4% of males and 40.8% of females dropped out of school compared with their urban counterparts, of which 13.2% of males and 17.1% of females dropped out. 190 The contrast between urban and rural in the percentage of children who never attended school is less stark.

Like the right to life, the right to education is embodied in Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. In 1992, the Supreme Court of India formally expanded its interpretation of Article 21 to hold that the \" 'right to education' is concomitant to Fundamental Rights enshrined [in] the Constitution.\" 195 The court held that \"every citizen has a right to education under the Constitution.\"196 The following year, the supreme court decided Unnikrishnan v. State of Andhra Pradesh acknowledging that while the right to education is not expressly a Fundamental Right, \"it is implicit in and flows from the right to life guaranteed under Article 21.\" 197 The court went on to say that the right to education means: \"(a) every child/citizen of this country has a right to free education until he completes the age of fourteen years and (b) after a child/citizen completes 14 years, his right to education is circumscribed by the limits of the economic capacity of the State and its development.\" 198 Following Unnikrishnan ,199 the Indian Parliament enacted the 86th constitutional amendment, which made elementary education a fundamental right. 200 Although lauded as a progressive step, the amendment necessitated the drafting of a separate bill to implement this right. After years of controvers y, the Indian Parliament passed the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act in 2009.201 Under that law, education is now free and guaranteed for children ages six to fourteen.202 The Indian Constitution further requires the State to provide early childhood care and ed ucation for all children up to the age of six.203 195 Mohini Jain v.

The school that any given child attends is dictated largely by the deeply entrenched class system and the family's ability to pay.205 In urban areas, wealthy and socially elite children are funneled into prestigious private schools or schools funded by the government and ma naged by state education boards. Schools run by municipalities and ot her local governments, typically the only type available to rural ch ildren, usually educate the poor.206 One approach to reducing the cost of education is the use of \"parateachers,\" instructors without th e professional qualifications of teachers who therefore earn far less. The use of parateachers emerged in the 1990s, when several states adopted plans to promote primary education. 207 Between 1994 and 1999, a bout 220,000 parateachers were appointed across 10 states, a number that more than doubled by 2001.208 States turned to parateachers in response to teacher shortages, absenteeism, and many teachers' unwillingness to work in rural 204 GOVINDA & JOSEPHINE , supra note 186, at 10. 205 Marie Lall, The Challenges for India's Education System 4 (Chatham House Briefing Paper, 2005), available at http://www.chathamhou se.org.uk/files/3233_ bpindiaeducation.pdf.

Because parateachers must be appointed in communities where they live, their presence can foster a sense of community, bridging a social and physical gap that often exists between students and teachers. See GOVINDA & JOSEPHINE , supra note 186, at 19; Francois LeClercq, Education Policy Reforms and the Quality of the School System: A Field Study of Primary Schools in Madhya Pradesh, India , DEVELOPMENT ET INSERTION INTERNATIONALE 17 (Document de Travail No. DT/2003/12, Oct. 2003), available at www.dial.prd.fr/dial_p ublications/PDF/Doc_ travail/2003-12.pdf. Lower qualif ication standards, compensati on, and a lack of a peer support structure in remote areas, however, raise concerns regarding the quality of education parateachers provide. Id. at 19-20. Taken in a different light, one study suggests that because parateachers are usua lly employed on shorter contracts than traditional teachers, there is increased pressure to perform, thus leading to greater effectiveness despite their inferior training.

Ctr. for the Study of African Econ., Working Paper No. WPS/2010-15, 2010), available at www.csae.ox.ac.uk/working papers/pdfs/2010-15text.pdf.

It does so with a view of informing India's development path and priorities, including appropriate attention to the rural-urban axis. II. R URAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH A CAPABILITIES LENS Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbau m developed the capabilities framework for evaluating human welfare as an alternative to standard social contractarianism theories. 211 Nussbaum and Sen assert that focusing on resources (e.g., GDP, national poverty rates) and/or utility fails to take into account roadbl ocks to human dignity, including imbalances in power along various axes.212 The major departure of the capabilities approach from traditional contractarianism is the former's reliance on functional capabilities, su ch as the ability to live to an old age or engage in meaningful relationships, as the measure of human welfare.213 Nussbaum maintains that the capabilities approach is as 209 GOVINDA & JOSEPHINE , supra note 186, at 15. 210 Kingdon et al., supra note 178, at 141 (reporting that parateachers earn one- fifth to one half of what fully qualified teachers earn). For example, parateachers have been recruited for years in Madhya Pradesh, but the state government recently passed legislation requiring both parateachers and state-certified teachers to be classified as simply \"teachers\" in reporting. Govinda & Josephine, supra note 186, at 16. In Gujarat, the Seventh All India Survey of 2004 estimated 43.08% of primary level and 31.79% of upper primary level teachers were parateachers. This compares to 14.31% of parateachers at the primary level and 13.35% at the upper primary level for urban areas in the same state. Id. at 17-18. The official position regarding the use of parateachers is that it is appropriate to: (1) expand access to school in underserved communities; (2) eliminate single-teacher schools and multi-grade teaching; and (3) reduce high pupil-teacher ratios. Atherton & Kingdon, supra note 207, at 2. 211 NUSSBAUM , FRONTIERS OF JUSTICE , supra note 21, at 3-8 (noting that social contractarian theories were expressed principally in John Rawls's A Theory of Justice ). 212 Id. at 164-68. Nussbaum cites an example of a person in a wheelchair. No matter what level of resources this person receives, there are still issues of a lack of mobility. Capabilities address this need for a redesign of social spaces that a focus on resources or utility cannot. Id. at 167-68. Sen also takes up the issue of variabilities among what he calls \"contingent circumstances,\" which influence the use individuals can make of a given set of commodities . He lists personal heterogeneities, environmental diversities, variations in social climate, differences in relational perspectives, and distributi on within the family. S EN, supra note 2, at 70-71. 213 NUSSBAUM , FRONTIERS OF JUSTICE , supra note 21, at 165; see also supra note 26 (listing capabilities). 840 University of California, Davis [Vol. 44:803 successfully universal as the traditional approach, while still acknowledging and protecting the heterogeneous nature of human welfare.214 Because the capabilities approach compliments human rights and second-wave rights movements, it is a significant source of influence in both the international human rights and development communities, as well as among rights theorists more broadly. 215 Agency is a hallmark of the capabilities framework, which recognizes each human being \"as an agent and an end\"216 and focuses on \"what people are able to do and be.\"217 In particular, Nussbaum calls for a \"threshold level of each capability\"218 below which citizens are not truly functioning as humans. Nussbaum and Sen distinguish between capabilities and what they label \"functionings,\" which are the ways in which people act on, or realize the possibilities associated with, their capabilities. 219 Professor Jennifer Prah Ruger similarly explains capabilities as the build ing blocks or prerequisites of functionings, specifically in relati on to the life and bodily health capabilities.220 \"Health capabilities,\" she wr ites, \"represent the ability of individuals to achieve certain health-related functionings. The difference between health capabilities and health functionings is the difference between the freedom to achieve and achievement, and there is feedback between the two.\"221 In short, functionings are the fruition of capabilities, and the capabilities framework recognizes that different 214 NUSSBAUM , FRONTIERS OF JUSTICE , supra note 21, at 179-83. 215 Id. at 284-86; see also Sandra Fredman, Engendering Socio-Economic Rights , 25 S.

Geography's Relevance to Capabilities The capabilities approach, especially as Nussbaum expounds upon it in Frontiers of Justice , can be deployed as a frame for assessing well- being, or the lack thereof, for an y population group or individual.223 Nussbaum often uses it, for example, to discuss the situation of women.224 In that context in particular, she attends to space and place, both implicitly and explicitly. Nu ssbaum's work has been greatly informed by time spent in India, and her writing evinces attention to geography in its use of many place- specific illustrations. She typically notes, for example, the region or particular place from which anecdote or data is drawn, sometimes noting the rural character of a place.225 In doing so, Nussbaum implies that wo men and children, in particular, are often worse off in rural places than in urban ones.226 Nussbaum 222 Further, Nussbaum focuses on the distinction between capabilities and functionings using, among other examples, fasting for religious purposes on the one hand and starvation on the other. The first would reflect a capability but not a functioning, while the latter would reflect a lack of capability. N USSBAUM , WOMEN AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT , supra note 22, at 87.

In addition, Nussbaum expressly recognizes the rural-urban axis as embodying power differentials. In writing about the failures of traditional contractarianism, she notes that it fails to acknowledge imbalances of power and ability associated with various characteristics, and she enumerates inequalities \"between rural and urban populations\" as among such characteristics. 227 Indeed, the rural-urban axis is surely one of the most powerful and salient axes of (dis)advantage in nations like India, which are at once both developed and developing. India, along with other so-called BRIC countries, 228 is highly urbanized in parts, but also features vast undeveloped, rural swaths, where huge segments of its population live. It is in such countries where development is so dramatically uneven that inequalities between rural and urban are most stark. As expressed in a study of spatial inequality sanctioned by the United Nations, \"the rural-urban divide in developing countries is often associated with other differences linked to the provision of infrastructure, the development of capital markets, education, health care, and so on.\" 229 It is thus also in these countries that the challenges of rural development and managing rural-to-urban migration put so much at stake.230 Within a capabilities framework, then, geography \u2014 rurality in particular \u2014 might be thought of as a handicap that profoundly shapes the lives of otherwise \"normal\" people.231 That is, if urban residents are taken as a norm in terms of access to government 227 NUSSBAUM , FRONTIERS OF JUSTICE , supra note 21, at 225 (writing of \"inequalities of class, caste, race, religion, ethnicity, and between rural and urban populations\" in addition to those associated with gender). 228 The BRIC reference is to Brazil, Russia, India, and China. 229 Anthony Shorrocks & Guanghua Wan, Spatial Decomposition of Inequality 14 (U.N.

Place is thus a roadblock to the realization of capabilities,234 in part because of uneven development and in part because the government fails to ameliorate the service- provision consequences of that unevenness. Space, too, presents particular challenges235 because serving spatially far-flung populations impedes the achievement of economies of scale and tends to drive up the per capita costs of service delivery.236 232 See Lisa R.

Adequacy, Equality, and the Hybrid Concept of Parity Nussbaum's recognition of power disparities, including that associated with the rural-urban axis, suggests a concern with equality. Indeed, in addition to calling for a minimum threshold of each capability or right \u2014 what is often referred to as \"adequacy\" in various U.S. legal contexts 237 \u2014 Nussbaum also references equality as a goal.238 She writes: We have seen that the idea of dignity is spelled out from the beginning in terms of equality: it is the equal dignity of human beings that demands recognition. Here the idea of equality is essential: we must add it to the bare idea of dignity in order to articulate the goal in an adequate way.239 Nussbaum elsewhere summarizes the salience of equality as a goal with respect to differen t types of capabilities: Some capabilities must be secured to citizens on a basis of equality, or equal dignity has not been respected. Others, however, do not seem to have this intrinsic relationship to dignity; with these, the ca pabilities approa ch supplies a threshold of adequacy. 240 Nussbaum thus distinguishes between socioeconomic rights on the one hand and civil and political rights on the other, suggesting adequacy is the standard for the former, equality the standard for the latter. Elsewhere, however, she articulates a standard that appears to be a hybrid of adequacy and equality when rights such as education and health care are at stake. Nussbaum writes: Marketplace: Reading 'Between the Assassinations ,' supra note 32. 237 See Pruitt, Equal Protection, Child Poverty and Place , supra note 236, at 802 (arguing that minimum level of food and shelter are necessary to meet dignity right guaranteed by Montana Constitution, particularly as regards child subjects, who are not autonomous but are necessarily dependent); Pruitt & Colgan, Justice Deserts , supra note 236, at 219 (observing that standard for provision of counsel to indigent defendants is adequacy rather than equality); Anna Williams Shavers, Rethinking the Equity v.

At least where primary and secondary education are concerned, adequacy does appear to require something close to equality, or at least a very high minimum . . . . The same is true of basic essential health care. 241 Nussbaum thus acknowledges the desire for equality in relation to socioeconomic rights such as education and health care, the very ones that are my focus here.242 I am going to call this hybrid concept \u2014 241 Id. at 294 (providing U.S. example of edu cation funding disparity: \"If education, for example, is arranged as it currently is in the United States, in such a way that students in a rich school district may have as much as 75 to 100 times as much spent on them as is spent on students in a poor district, such an allocation does seem to be an intrinsic violation of a norm of equal dignity and equal political liberty\"). She also discusses what geographers call scale, specifying that access across national boundaries should be roughly equal, at least where these foundational capabilities are at issue. Nussbaum writes, \"In the international case we should aggressively pursue equality between nations in capabilities that ar e especially closely lin ked to the idea of equal human dignity, including primary and secondary education and access to basic health care.\" Id. at 294. See also id. at 269 (discussing variations across national boundaries and, therefore, recognizing relevance of \"place\"). 242 Id. at 292-93.

It is to fail to recognize their equal human dignity. Id. She subsequently writes: For the capabilities approach, at any rate, equality is important at the very base of the theory; for it is not just human dignity that must be respected, it is equal human dignity. This role for equality, however, does not entail that equality is a reasonable goal with regard to all the central capabilities, a position that has been the target of reasonable criticism by Ronald Dworkin and others. Some capabilities must be secured to citizens on a basis of equality, or equal dignity has not been respected. Others, however, do not seem to have this intrinsic relationship to dignity; with these, the capabilities approach supplies a threshold of adequacy. Some nations and individuals may prefer a more egalitarian solution with these capabilities as well. But it seems likely that if we want a political conception that can achieve an overlapping consensus among people who differ in their comprehensive ethical and religious doctrines, especially when we are considering transnational transfers of wealth, this conception is more likely to prove broadly acceptable than one that insists on equality in all the central capabilities. 846 University of California, Davis [Vol. 44:803 which is part adequacy, part equality \u2014 \"parity.\" It is a standard lower than strict equality that nevertheless is relative, a standard that does compare what different populations get in terms of government services. Interestingly, Nussbaum most often ar ticulates the goal of parity in the international or transnational context \u2014 that is, among nations.243 She also articulates it, however, in reference to subnational units and regional variations, writing, \"[a]ny theory of justice that aims to provide a basis for decent life chances and opportunities for all human beings must take cognizance both of inequalities internal to each nation and of inequalities between nations.\" 244 Nussbaum also notes the \"complex intersections of these inequalities in a world of increased and increasing global interconnection.\"245 In other words, the global is the local, and vice versa.246 It is not clear why Nussbaum appears to see gross disparities between access to these foundational services and the capabilities they endow as more objectionable across international boundaries than across state or municipal boundaries. Indeed, it is arguably more logical to expect pa rity within a nation-state than among nation-states. 247 C. Distributive Disparities Across the Rural-Urban Axis My project brings these observations about the relevance of geography to capabilities together with a discussion of parity. It does so in relation to geographic distribution of resources related to the Id. at 295 (footnotes omitted). 243 For example, Nussbaum asserts that, among other limitations, traditional contractarianism too easily assumes an equal balance of power between nations.

See supra text accompanying note 241. In addition, her concer n that greater expectatio ns of equality regarding capabilities may impede international co nsensus regarding capabilities seems to support the point. See infra note 261 and accompanying text. 2011] Human Rights and Development for India's Rural Remnant 847 most fundamental capabilities: life, bodily health, and education. I see the capabilities framework as aspiring to a degree of parity regarding these, including parity across the rural-urban axis.248 Other scholars have offered somewhat similar arguments regarding spatial inequalities and distributive justice, albeit without the focus on rural disadvantage per se . Professor Gregory Alexander, for example, argues that \"human flourishing requires distributive justice, the ultimate objective of which is to gi ve people what they need in order to develop the capabilities necessary for living the well-lived life . . . .\" 249 H e e x p a n d s o n t h i s i n p a r t i c u l a r i n r e l a t i o n t o t h e v e r y core capabilities that are my focus, writing: If human capacities such as survival (including physical health), the ability to engage in practical reasoning, and to make reasoned decisions about how to live our lives are components of the well-lived life, then surely we are all obligated to support and nurture the social structures without which those human capabilities cannot be developed. 250 In a similar vein, Professor Jennifer Prah Ruger's discussion of health care resources and access refers to parity not only among nations but also within them: Global inequalities in, and threats to, health capabilities are morally troubling simply because they are morally arbitrary, so often just an accident of birth in an impoverished or remote country or county . These inequities require rectification; morally arbitrary accidents should not control one's health or survival. 251 Professor Denise Meyerson has also written of distributive inequities within nations, discussing them as possible violations of constitutional equality guarantees.252 Most recently, Professor Sandra Fredman has 248 See NUSSBAUM , FRONTIERS OF JUSTICE , supra note 21, at 71 (referring to distribution of wealth and income as relevant to capabilities). 249 Alexander, supra note 29, at 768. 250 Id. at 769. 251 Ruger, Global Health Justice , supra note 29, at 266 (emphasis added). 252 See Denise Meyerson, Equality Guarantees and Distributive Inequity , 19 P UB.

The Role of the State This recent work by Meyerson and Fredman reminds us that the state plays a role in creating distribu tive inequities, and it must play a role in ameliorating them.254 Nussbaum and Sen's capabilities framework also has clear implications for nation-states, which they see as playing a critical role in endo wing citizens with capabilities. Nussbaum writes, for example, that \"in certain core areas of human functioning a necessary condition of justice for a public political arrangement is that it delivers to citizens a certain basic level of capability.\" 255 Sen similarly talks of \"social opportunities of education and health care\" possibly requiring \"public action.\"256 This focus on the role of the state is, of course, not only grounded in capabilities; it is widely recognized by policy makers. The 2005 GDPRD, for example, observes that \"the poor are poor because policies, laws and regulations (or absence of them) circumscribe their opportunities.\" 257 Institutional change is thus necessary \"to enable pro-poor growth.\"258 Nussbaum links capabilities directly to law, calling it a \"political doctrine,\" albeit an incomplete one, which can be \"embodied in a list of constitutional guarantees.\"259 Elsewhere, she presents capabilities as \"the philosophical underpinning for an account of basic constitutional principles that should be respected and implemented by the 253 Sandra Fredman, Positive Duties and Socio-Econ omic Disadvantage: Bringing Disadvantage onto the Equality Agenda , 2010 E UR.

If we agree with Nussbaum's assertion that when \"people are systematically falling below the threshold in any of these core areas\" the situation is \"both unjust and tragic, in need of urgent attention,\"265 then rural residents' systematic deprivation of the core capabilities of life, bodily health, and education demands government intervention. The Indian Constitution lays a partial groundwork for action that would ameliorate disparities in the provision of core services. This is reflected in the construction of Article 21 to include the rights to health care and education and in the constitutional embrace of affirmative action and substantive equality. The next subpart proposes remedial actions that the Government of India and its subnational governing units should take to bring rural residents up to parity with their urban counterparts, thereby achieving greater spatial equality and fostering more even development. 260 NUSSBAUM , WOMEN AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT , supra note 22, at 5. 261 Id. at 103.

Remedial Responses Focusing on what the state should do to ameliorate grossly uneven development as it impacts life, bodily health, and education takes us back to Nussbaum and Sen's recognition of the significance of context and of different variables that may influence the level of resources needed for different persons to achieve their capabilities. In short, they recognize the import of antecedent inequalities. 266 As Fredman has observed, their attention to context is akin to substantive equality.267 \"Equal consideration for all,\" Sen writes, \"may demand very unequal treatment in favour of the disadvantaged.\"268 Among other factors, Sen notes the relevance of \"environment al heterogeneities,\" of which the rural-urban continuum is an aspect.269 Nussbaum explains that the 266 NUSSBAUM , FRONTIERS OF JUSTICE , supra note 21, at 99 (discussing needs of impaired persons for \"atypical social arrangements\" to live productive lives); N USSBAUM , WOMEN AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT , supra note 22, at 68-69 (discussing \"need to devote more resources to those who encounter obstacles,\" such as the obstacle patriarchy represents to women's literacy); id. at 99 (asserting that \"[a]nalyzing economic and material rights in terms of capabilities thus enables us to set forth clearly a rationale . . . for spending unequal amounts of money on the disadvantaged, or creating special programs to assist their transition to full capability\"); A MARTYA SEN, INEQUALITY RE-EXAMINED 1 (1992); see also Stein & Stein, supra note 29, at 1216-17 (noting, in discussion of capabilities, that \"individuals may require different levels of resources in order to achieve their potential\"). 267 Fredman, supra note 215, at nn.65-66 (2009); NUSSBAUM , WOMEN AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT , supra note 22, at 69 (noting need not only for \"formal equality of opportunity, but also truly fair equality of opportunity\"); id. at 25 (noting that Indian Constitution, which she praises, does not understand equality in \"bare formal way\"). 268 AMARTYA SEN, INEQUALITY RE-EXAMINED , supra note 266, at 1.

S EN, DEVELOPMENT AS FREEDOM , supra note 2, at 70-71. Nussbaum elsewhere similarly focuses on the individual's context when writing: To treat A and B as equally well-off because they command the same amount of resources is, in a crucial way, to neglect A's separate and distinct life, to pretend that A's circumstances are interchangeable with B's, which may not be the case. To do justice to A's struggles, we must see them in their social context, aware of the obstacles that the context offers to the struggle for liberty, opportunity, and material well being.

One study of spatial inequality in the developing world similarly opines that \" uniform institutional arrangements such as nation-wide policies are likely to make a negative contribution.\"273 Nussbaum uses the examples of women and the disabled to illustrate the varying needs of individuals and the significance of context. Of the disabled, Nussbaum writes, \"A person whose limbs work well needs few resources to be mobile, whereas a person with paralyzed limbs needs many more resources to achieve the same level of mobility.\" 274 Noting that the developed world may take for granted too much and therefore not notice variations because we \"can afford to bring all individuals to a high level of physical attainment,\" she writes: If we wish to bring all citizens of a nation to a given basic level of educational attainment, we will need to devote more resources to those who encounter obstacles from traditional hierarchy or prejudice: thus women's literacy will prove more expensive than men's literacy in many parts of the world. . . .

She is very sensitive to gender-based power imbalances. 276 Nussbaum elsewhere also acknowledges power disparities across the rural-urban axis. We could thus subs titute \"rural\" for \"women\" in the preceding paragraph and generate an argument for special attention to rural populations. That is, raising literacy among rural populations may require more resources than doing so among urban populations. This reality is attributable to the enhanced cost of serving spatially dispersed populations. It is also lik ely attributable to attitudes from those within and without rural commun ities, attitudes associated with the stasis and custom that typically mark rural places. 277 Thus, a similar statement that recognizes the challenges associated with rural development might sound like this: If we wish to bring all citizens of a nation to a given basic level of educational attainment, we will need to devote more resources to those who encounter obstacles from [spatiality, infrastructure and human capital deficits, tradition, or prejudice]: thus [fostering literacy and other capabilities among rural populations] will prove more expensive [than that of urban populations] in many parts of the world.

Failure to attend to rural development \u2014 esse ntially deferring to the present state of grossly uneven development and even exacerbating it with development efforts that merely driv e rural residents to cities \u2014 will only aggravate spatial inequalities in access to government services, as the urban juggernaut gains force, and the rural remnant languish. C ONCLUSION \"If I were making a country, I'd get the sewage pipes first, then the democracy . . .\" ARAVIND ADIGA , THE WHITE TIGER278 Adiga provocatively suggests that socioeconomic rights \u2014 such as those associated with the life and bodily health capabilities \u2014 are more important than civil or political ones. In fact, the two varieties of capabilities are not at odds. Sen explains: [T]here is strong evidence that economic and political freedoms help to reinforce one another . . . . Similarly, social opportunities of education and health care, which may require public action, complement individual opportunities of economic and political participation and also help to foster our own initiatives in overcoming our respective deprivations. 279 Nevertheless, this statement about the relative priorities of the state by The White Tiger 's central character should get us thinking about the ways in which the absence of core infrastructure associated with life, bodily health and education prevents India's rural residents from enjoying not only those capabilities, but also others associated with civil and political rights \u2014 with democracy itself. This Article has focused on disparities across the rural-urban axis within the nation-state of India. Martha Nussbaum has called us to attend to such inequalities \"internal to each nation\" 280 because we 278 ADIGA, supra note 1, at 80. 279 SEN, DEVELOPMENT AS FREEDOM , supra note 2, at xii. Elsewhere Sen implies the synergy or complementarity of political rights with socioeconomic ones, calling for the \"removal of major sources of un-freed om: poverty as well as tyranny, poor economic opportunities as well as systematic social deprivation, neglect of public facilities as well as intolerance or overactivity of repressive states.\" Id. at 3. 280 NUSSBAUM , FRONTIERS OF JUSTICE , supra note 21, at 225. Elsewhere she refers to all citizens \"of a nation\" getting a basic level of attainment. N USSBAUM , WOMEN AND 854 University of California, Davis [Vol. 44:803 want to provide \"decent life chances and opportunities\" to all.281 Elsewhere she writes, \"We may or may not want to improve the lot of the worst off . . . but we certainly shouldn't make decisions without knowing how they are doing.\"282 The vast majority of India's worst off are rural. Not only are they lacking resources and power, in the context of an increasingly metrocentric world, they have been rendered nearly invisible. India should not make decisions without seeing them, without attending to the rural-urban axis as a very powerful basis of disparities in well-being and opportunity. That India is becoming more urban by the day \u2014 the percentage of its population living in rural areas declining \u2014 do es not justify inaction. Nussbaum asserts that \"problems cannot be ignored or postponed on the grounds that they affect only a small number of people,\" 283 but India's rural population is far from small and will remain robust for decades, even if the urban juggernaut maintains its current pace. India's development process should, to use the terminology of Sen, eliminate unfreedoms, including serious deficits in capabilities that are critical to fostering human and social capital. If India's \"development\" efforts drive rapid, unsustainable urban growth by neglecting rural populations and aggravating \"desperation and hunger in the countryside,\" 284 they will not endow the poor with capabilities. If India's development strategy is one that simply fuels the urban juggernaut by, for example, supporting intensive production agriculture, thereby eliminating rura l jobs, the present state of uneven development will only become more uneven, and more of the rural poor will simply join the urban poor. Who gets what in India \u2014 who enjoys particular capabilities \u2014 will continue to be enormously influenced by where one lives, as spatial inequalities are aggravated. For development to occur in a way that truly endows citizens with freedom, citizens' agency must be respected. Thus, the central capabilities concept of human autonomy should be invoked in shaping development's path. Development trajectories should respect the desires and priorities of rural re sidents in a way that makes rural populations the subjects of development, and not only its objects. 285 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT , supra note 22, at 68. 281 NUSSBAUM , FRONTIERS OF JUSTICE , supra note 21, at 225. 282 NUSSBAUM , WOMEN AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT , supra note 22, at 62.

They should have a say in the course of rural development and not be merely ends for India to achieve modernity, urbanization, or increased production for the market. To foster capabilities along the rural-urban continuum, India needs a plan that attends concurrently to both urban planning and rural development. India and other nations facing similar migration challenges \u2014 many of them in Asia \u2014 should unhinge \"urban\" from \"planning\" and \"rural\" from \"development\" and recognize that all places along the rural-urban continuum \u2014 as well as the relationships among these places \u2014 need both planning and development. 287 So do the relationships among these places. That is, India needs a master plan to even out the country's development path, a plan that considers the types of sustainable developmen t that will optimize all citizens' capabilities, regardless of the popula tion size and density of where they live. In establishing such a plan, India should consider the role that smaller urban centers might play, rather than mindlessly fueling the megacities bandwagon. 288 Various choices along the rural-urban continuum \u2014 that is, various sizes of population clusters wi th different degrees of economic integration with surrounding rural areas \u2014 offer different degrees of economic sustainability.289 A 2007 Report of the UN Population Fund Women , supra note 15, at 726-27. See also Pruitt, Deconstructing CEDAW's Article 14 , 27, at 392 (noting that CEDAW iden tifies both rural areas and women as objects of development). 286 Interestingly, Article 14 of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (\"CEDAW\") also suggests the importance of human autonomy in relation to deve lopment, specifying rural women' s right to \"participate in the elaboration and implementation of deve lopment planning at all levels.\" CEDAW Deconstructing , supra note 27, and in Pruitt, The Promise of CEDAW for Rural Women , supra note 15, at 732, 749-50. 287 The Global Donor Platform for Rural Development (\"GDPRD\") recognizes the interdependence of rural and urban economies, observing that \"rural development and rural opportunities are necessarily part of larger national economic systems, and the overall economic policy must provide space and support for rural development reflecting the possibilities of the rural poor. Ch ange at the sectoral level is essential, for it is here that the critical, but narrower , agricultural issues are determined.\" Wolz, supra note 11, at 42. 288 This is consistent with what Adiga has suggested, and with some economists' proposals to solve problems created by mass migration to megacities.

Paradoxically, cities may also hold our best chance for a sustainable future.\"290 One reason often noted for cities' promise in relation to long-term sustainability is that urbanization correlates to lower fertility rates.291 Policy makers rarely acknowledge, however, that higher rural fertility rates are surely in part a function of lack of access to contraception. 292 That is, better delivery of health care to rural residents \u2014 including reproductive health \u2014 would surely close the gap between rural and urban birth rates.293 Further, lower urban fertility rates do not make cities more attractive forms of development per se . In the developing world in particular, problems of \"inadequate water and sanitation, poor air quality (inside houses as well as outside) and limited or no waste disposal\" 294 loom large. Internal migration will in many instances \"convert[] the rural poor into urban poor,\"295 a phenomenon well small and medium size population clusters, as well as the increasing integration of rural and urban economies). 290 U.N.
