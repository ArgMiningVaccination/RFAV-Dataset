The 2016 -17 base does not reflect expenditures for DSHS programs that occurred prior to the transfer of those programs to HHSC. If the 2016 -17 base was recast to include all programs at HHSC in 2018 -19 then funding levels for the biennium are estimated to be $193.7 million in General Revenue Related Funds ($1.5 billion All Funds) below that base.

General Revenue/General Revenue -Dedicated (GR/GR -D) Limit and Four Percent Reductions. The Health and Human Services Commission's ( HHSC) four percent reduction determined by the Legislative Budget Board (LBB) and Office of the Governor was $262.9 million in GR/GR -D. HHSC's Legislative Appropriation Request (LAR) included a reduction of $179.9 million in GR/GR -D, which exceeded the establish ed Limit for 2018 -19 by $83.0 million in GR/GR -D. The agency was required to identify where they would further reduce their LAR request by $83.0 million in GR/GR -D and HHSC identified reductions in Medicaid Long -term Care Waivers, TANF Cash Assistance, Fam ily Violence Services, Regulation, and Administration .

Recommendations maintain Medicaid Long -term Care Waivers at the 2016 -17 appropriated level (see Selected Fiscal and Policy Item #4) . Recommendations provide funding for TANF Cash Assistance based on LBB projected increases in caseload and grant per recipient (see Selected Fiscal and Policy Item #11). Recommendat ions restore HHSC identified reductions in WIC program formula rebates with offsetting administrative savings (see Selected F iscal and Policy Item #26). 2. Eighty -fourth Legislature, Agency Consolidation Update . Senate Bill 200, Eighty -fourth Legislature, 2015, the agencies' Sunset bill, significantly reorganizes and consolidates the five legacy agencies into three agencies \u2014Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC), Department of Family and Protective Services ( DFPS), and Department of State Health Services (DSHS) \u2014by September 1, 2017. The Sunset Advisory Commission identified problems in the health and human services system, including program fragmentation, organizational misalignments, and unclear accountabilit y. The goal of restructuring the agencies is to achieve greater efficiencies and coordination across all programs. Similar pro grams are combined , and adminis tration is consolidated into HHSC . Pursuant to the bill, DFPS and DSHS are authorized to continue a s independent agencies with Sunset dates each of September 1, 2023, and the consolidated HHSC is authorized to continue with a Sunset date of September 1, 2027. Senate Bill 200 established a Transition Legislative Oversight Committee (TLOC ) and required the Executive Commissioner to submit a transition plan by March 1, 2016, to the TLOC, the Governor, and the Legislativ e Budget Board (LBB). The plan submitted in March was revised to address concerns of the TLOC that administrative activities were still t oo spread out among programs, and that client services were not consolidated fully, and submitted again in August 2016. Senate Bill 208, Eighty -fourth Legislature, 2015, transfers the Vocational Rehabilitation (including the Criss Cole Rehabilitation Ce nter), Business Enterprises of Texas, and Independent Living Services for Older Persons Who Are Blind programs from the Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Serv ices to the Texas Workforce Comm ission as of September 1, 2016. Program consolidations h ave proceeded acc ording to the transition plan. Client services programs were consolidated at HHSC by September 1, 2016 (fiscal year 2017), and the transfer of institutional and regulatory services is planned to occur by Septemb er 1, 2017 (fiscal year 2018 ). However, o n January 9th, DSHS informed the LBB that the Texas Center for Infectious Disease (TCID) would remain at DSHS instead of transferring to HHSC. Health and Safety Code Sec. 531.02041 requires the executive commissioner to submit a report to TLOC detailing any substantial organizational cha nges to the initial transition p lan. A revised plan, indicating TCID would remain at DSHS, has not been submitted to TLOC. Current recommendations align with the August 2016 Health and Human Services System Tra nsition Plan, which transfers TCID to HHSC. 6Section 3 Agency 529 1/27/2017 The figure below is a timeline of the planned consolidation activities. 3. Medicaid and CHIP Program Financing. Financing of the Medicaid and CHIP programs is based on an array of matching rates that determine the amount of state funds (General Revenue, General Revenue -Dedicated, and Other Funds) and the amount of Federal Funds. The primary matching rate for Medicaid client services is the Fe deral Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). Each s tate has a different FMAP, ranging from 50 to 83 percent, based on its per capita personal income (PCPI) relative to the nation's PCPI. The chart below shows Texas FMAPs for federal fiscal years 2008 to 2019, which were used as the basis for budg et recomme ndations affected by FMAP except in Goal A, Medicaid Client Services (see Selected Fiscal and Policy Issue #4) . Federal fiscal year 2019 FMAP is an estimate developed by the LBB; final federal fiscal year 2019 FMAP will not be available until the fall of 2 017. 7Section 3 Agency 529 1/27/2017 The CHIP program (client services and administrative services) is matched at the Enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percenta ge (EFMAP), a more favorable rate with a state share that is a 30 percent reduction to the state share under FMAP. Addition ally, under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, a 23 percentage point increase to EFMAP became available for federal fiscal years 2016 to 2019. The increase applies to the CHIP program and certain children e nrolled in Medicaid who were previously eligib le for CHIP. Certain other Medicaid services are matched based on EFMAP without the 23 percentage point increase. The followi ng table shows EFMAPs for 2015 to 2019 (and the effect of the 23 percentage point increase), which were assumed in budget recommend ations except in Goal A, Medicaid Client Services (see Selected Fiscal and Policy Issue #4) . 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 EFMAP 70.64% 69.99% 92.33% 92.82% 93.17% Other matching rates are available for client services in the Medicaid program including 90/10 for family planning services, an enhanced match under the Community First Choice Program for certain long -term-care services, and a 50 percent reduction to the state share under FMAP for certain services provided through the Money Follows the Person Demonstration. Most administrative services under Medicaid receive a 50 percent federal match, but some services are e ligible for 90/10 or 75/25 matching rate s. 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Medicaid Client Services. The Eighty -fourth Legislature, 2015, passed Senate Bill 200, which, among other items, consolidates Medicaid client services provided by the Department of Aging and Disability Services (DADS) into the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC). In 2018 -19, Goal A, Medicaid Client Services, includes funding for client services formerly provided by DADS and those historically provided by HHSC. Recommendations include $56.4 billion in All Funds, including $23.0 billion in General Revenue Funds, for these client services, maintaining them at the 2016 -17 appropriated level. Because 2016 -17 appropriations were maintained at the method - of-financing level, recommendations do not reflect actual anticipated matching rates or expe cted changes in revenues. 2016 -17 amounts do not assume supplemental funding for fiscal year 2017. Current LBB projections anticipate a cost in 2016 -17 above appropriations of $2.5 billion in All Funds ($1.2 billion in General Revenue Funds). This does no t represent the amount that will need to be provided in a supplemental bill due to adjustments related to transfers and the agency's authority to expend certain revenues in excess of appropriations. 2018 -19 amounts do not include funding to support projec ted caseload growth, maintain fiscal year 2017 average costs, or fund anticipated increases in cost due to medical inflation, higher utilization, or increased acuity. The projected cost to fully fund client services in 2018 -19 is $62.3 billion in All Funds ($25.7 billion in General Revenue Funds). Fully funding this projected level would require an additional $5.9 billion in All Funds ($2.6 billion in Gen eral Revenue Funds) above 2018 -19 recommendations. 9Section 3 Agency 529 1/27/2017 5. Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Recommendations include $1,970.4 million in All Funds ($149.4 million in General Revenue Funds) for CHIP Client Services, a decrease of $9.0 million in General Revenue Funds (an increase of $156.3 million in All Funds) from the pr ojected 2016 -17 biennial level. Increases in All Funds are associated with caseload growth and maintaining fiscal year 2017 premiums, offset by a reduction to the Health Insurance Prov iders Fee. A net more favorable Enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Pe rcentage (EFMAP) and the reduction in the Health Insurance Providers Fee offset increases in caseload and cost at the General Revenue level. A biennial comparison of General Revenue Funds appropriated and recommended for CHIP is displayed below: Adjusted Appropriated2$153.2 M Estimated $158.4 M Maintain FY2017 Cost $3.2 MCost Growth3 $5.2 M 1Does not reflect an offsetting surplus in CHIP Contracts and Administration expected to reduce the supplemental need to $4.8 million in General Revenue. 2 2016 -17 General Appropriations Act adjusted for net increase in program -generated revenues (premium co -payments, drug rebates, and experience rebates). 3 An estimated $5.2 million in General Revenue ($74.5 million in All Funds) for cost growth is not included in the recommendati ons. 4A reduction of $23.4 million in General Revenue for a net m ore favorable Enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (EFMAP), including an additional month of the 23 percentage point increase to EFMAP pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, and a $0.6 million reduction in General Revenue fo r lower Health Insurance Providers Fee due to the Moratorium on Annual Fee on Health Insurance Providers included in the federal Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 .Recommended $149.4 M 10Section 3 Agency 529 1/27/2017 a. Caseload . Following significant declines in the 2014 -15 biennium, primarily associated with the transition of certain children from CHIP to Medicaid pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, caseloads returned to growth in 2016 -17 and are projected to continue growing throughout the 2018 -19 biennium. CHIP Perinatal caseloads, which declined slightly in fiscal years 2014 through 2016 are assumed to remain flat in fiscal years 2017 through 2019. Recom mendations include $11.7 million in General Revenue ($127.2 mill ion in All Funds) in 2018 -19 for caseload growth. b. Premiums. Recommendations maintain fiscal year 2017 average costs in the 2018 -19 biennium. Maintaining the higher fiscal year 2017 average costs for two years results in increased costs of $3.2 million in General Revenue ($37.3 million in All Funds). The recommendations do not include funding for cost growth in the 2018 -19 biennium, estimated to be $5.2 million in General Revenue Funds ($74.5 million in All Funds). Most services in the CHIP program are provided through managed care with monthly premiums paid to managed care organizations (MCOs). Services provided outside of the monthly premiums include delivery supplemental payments made to the MCOs and payments for vaccines and newborn screening made to the Department of State Health Services. Proposed fiscal year 2017 premiums included significant growth, particularly for pharmacy and dental services. The proposed p remiums were partially disapproved by the LBB . Fiscal year 2017 LBB projections assume a reduction to these premiums and these lower premiums are maintained in 2018 -19 recommendations. Cost growth estimates assume fiscal year 2018 -19 premiums will grow from this lower base. c. EFMAP . The EFMAP, which is th e matching rate for the CHIP program, will be less favorable in federal fiscal year 2018 than federal fiscal year 2016 but is projected to be more favorable in federal fiscal year 2019 than federal fiscal year 2017. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act in cluded a 23 percentage point increase to EFMAP for most services from October 1, 2015 until September 30, 2019. All months in the 2018 -19 biennium are matched at the increased percentage, compared to 23 months in the 2016 -17 biennium. The net effect is mor e favorable matching rates in the 2018 -19 biennium than in the 2016 -17 biennium, resulting in a reduction of $23.4 million in General Revenue Funds and an equal increase in Federal Funds. The federal fiscal year 2018 EFMAP is final. F ederal fiscal year 201 9 EFMAP will not be finalized until the fall of 2017. d. CHIP Reauthorization . The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) extends funding for CHIP through federal fiscal year 2017. The Affordable Care Act prohibits states from restricti ng CHIP eligibility standards, methodologies, or procedures from enactment until September 30, 2019 (maintenance - of-effort requirement). Under current law, states will receive their final federal CHIP allotments in three installments, with t he final instal lment made on April 1, 2017. In prior years, states were required to spend their allotments within two years; however, under MACRA, a state may only carry tw o-thirds of unspent federal fiscal year 2017 funds into federal fiscal year 2018. Without federal budgetary action, all states will likely exhaust their federal CHIP allotments at some point in federal fiscal year 2018. The 23 percentage point increase in EFMAP and the ability to apply EFMAP to certain Medicaid expenditures if federal CHIP funds are u sed both contribute to increases in the rate at which federal CHIP funds are expected to be expended. Because Texas is operating a separate CHIP program (rather than a Medicaid -expansion CHIP program), the state would not be obligated to continue funding t he CHIP program once federal funds run out, despite the maintenance -of-effort requirement. Recommendations assume new federal funds will become available to continue the program in 2018 -19. e. Health Insurance Providers Fee. Recommendations assume a reduction to General Revenue Funds of $0.6 million ($8.4 million in All Funds) related to payment of the Health Insurance Providers Fee and associated taxes. The federal Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 included a moratoriu m on payments for fee year 2017, which would have been reimbursed by the state during fiscal year 2018. Although the amount of the fee to be paid in fiscal ye ar 2019 is higher than fiscal years 2016 and 2017, there is a net reduction due to only making one year's payment. Recommend ations include $1.0 million in General Revenue Funds ($15.3 million in All Funds) for payment of the fee in fiscal year 2019. 11Section 3 Agency 529 1/27/2017 6. Medicaid and CHIP Contracts and Administration . The Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) performs administrative functions for Medicaid through a claims administrator and Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMIS) contract with vendors collectively known as the Texas Medica id and Healthcare Partnership (TMHP). As managed care in Medicaid expanded , managed care organizations have taken on certain functions, such as claims adjudication and prior authorization for claims originating from their clients. TMHP still adjudicates c laims for fee -for-service (FFS), processes encounter data for both FFS and m anaged care, and perform certain other claims administrator functions. Costs for maintaining and upgrading the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), which automates many of the claims administrator functions, are fixed and not reduced in proportio n to the number of clients in FFS . In the Summer of 2014, Accenture became the primary contractor for TMHP by signing an emergency contract with HHSC after the previous contract with Xerox was terminat ed. Xerox is currently being sued by t he Texas Attorne y General for improper prior authorizations related to dental services , but continues to manage pharmacy claims and rebates for the agency under a separate contract . The emergency contract with Accenture and ongoing expenditures with Xerox resulted in incr easing costs for the TMHP contract. HHSC, generally, elected to utilize budget flexibility provided in the 2014 -15 and 2016 -17 General Appropriations Acts to transfer funds from Medicaid client services to pay for the increasing cost of the TMHP contract, thereby creating a supplemental need in entitlement services. The commission did not avail itself of the supplemental appropriation process for the increasing cost of the TMHP contract directly or submit Exceptional Items i n Legislative Appropriation Reque sts to address the TMHP contract that would have allowed for full legislative consideration of the increased cost of the contract. Contract oversight of previous vendors including Xerox was found to be ineffective by HHSC internal audits. HHSC has since r eorganized and strengthened contract oversight processes, though no new audits have assessed how well the new processes are working. In order to further strengthen the contract oversight process, recommendations include removing the budget flexibility prov ided in the 2014 -15 and 2016 -17 General Appropriations Acts that allowed the agency to transfer funds from Medicaid client services to pay for increasing Medicaid -related contract costs. (See Rider 130, Transfers: Authority and Limitations, and Rider 174, Limitation on Transfer Authority - Medicaid & CHIP Contracts and Administration) Recommendations also include a new budget rider to require HHSC to form an Executive Steeri ng Committee, including the Quality Assurance Team, that would provide additional o versight for the TMHP contract, report any budget over runs to the Legislative Budget Board , and seek approval from the Legislative Budget Board and the Governor prior to expending appropriations on cost overruns . (See Rider 172, Texas Medicaid and Healthca re Partnership (TMHP)) The TMHP contract is currently being re -bid and the request for proposal (RFP) issued by HHSC allows for the cont ract to be broken apart by functional areas to provide more oversight, but it is not known when the process will be completed and if the contract will be broken apart. A s HHSC requests proposals, it faces a concentrated market of a few vendors. Of states and territories who contract out this function, 85.4 percent contract primarily with one of three companies: Hewlet t Packard Enterprise, Xerox, or Molina Medicaid Solutions. 12Section 3 Agency 529 1/27/2017 7. Women's Health Funding. Recommendations include $284.6 million in All Funds ($260.9 million in General Revenue ) for the 2018 -19 biennium. This includes funding recommendations for the Breast and Cervical Cancer Services (BCCS) Program that transferred from the Department of State Health Services (DSHS) in fiscal year 2017. When including historical funding for Women's Health Programs at DSH S and HHSC , recommendations provide an increase of $ 30.9 million in All Funds ($3 0.4 million in General Revenue Funds) above 2016 -17 spending levels. HHSC reported that actual program expenditures for fiscal year 2016 totaled $99.6 million in All Funds, and administrative and outreach expenditures totaled to over $10.3 million for fiscal year 2016. Estimates for the 2016 -17 biennium hold fiscal year 2016 to actual program expenditures, and adjusts fiscal year 2017 All Funds to 89.8 percent of a ppropriatio ns based on the percent of appropriations expended in fiscal year 2016. Estimates of the 2016 -17 biennium also assume the approved distribution of HHSC's fiscal year 2016 request to expend $50.0 million in General Revenue pursuant to former HHSC Rider 76, Women's Health Programs ($12.0 million in General Revenue for fiscal year 2016 and $38.0 million in General Revenue for fiscal year 2017). Recommendations maintain fiscal year 2017 funding for both fiscal years of the 2018 -19 biennium. Women's Health Expen ditures by fund type is shown below: Source: Legislative Budget Board; Health and Human Services Commission On July 1, 2016, HHSC consolidated the Expanded Primary Health Care Program (EPHC) and the Texas Women's Health P rogra m (TWHP) into the Healthy Texas Women P rogram to serve women between the ages of 1 5 to 44 who are at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). HHSC reported 114,026 Healthy Texas Women recipients as of December 2016 . The agency projects an average of 231,480 Healthy Texas Women recipients each month for fiscal year 2018 and an average of 232,670 Healthy Texas Women recipients each month for fiscal year 2019. The Family Planning P rogram transferred to HHSC from DSHS, and was reconfigured to offer additional services t o Texas residents under the age of 64 who are at or below 250 percent of the FPL. HHSC reported serving 23,484 clients in the Family Planning Program Fund Type Federal and Other Funds General Revenue Expended/Recommended Unexpended Funds 13Section 3 Agency 529 1/27/2017 8. Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) Services. Recommendations for the 2018 -19 biennium include $282.4 million in All Funds ($60.7 million in General Revenue Funds) for Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) services, an increase of $5.5 million in All Funds ($5.1 million in General Revenue) over 2016 -17 spending levels, in order to fund projected caseload growth . Caseloads grew 3.7 percent in fiscal year 2016, the highest rate of growth since eligibility changes were made in fiscal year 2012. Projections assume similar growth in fiscal year 2017 and growth for the 2018 -19 biennium based on population projections. Average cost for the 2018 -19 biennium is forecasted at the fiscal year 2017 level. Average monthly service hours of 2.87 per child in fiscal year 2016 are maintained through fiscal year 2019. The table below illustrates projectio ns for ECI caseload: FY 2015 FY 2016 Trend FY 2017 Trend FY 2018 Trend FY 2019 Trend Average Monthly Number of Children Served in Contracts : HHSC works with contractors to provide ECI services for the state. The Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services (DARS) worked with a total of 49 contractors in fiscal year 2016 and HHSC worked with 47 contractors in fiscal year 2017 to provide ECI services. In fiscal year 2016, three contractors gave notice of intent to t erminate their contracts with HHSC to provide ECI services. Two current contractors assumed caseloads for regions in West Texas an d East Texas counties, and HHSC secured a new contract with a c ontractor to assume caseloads for regions in North Texas. In December 2016, o ne contract or from the Texoma region provided notice of intent to terminate for fiscal year 2017. HHSC reports it does not have a new contractor for the Texoma region as of January 2017, and is working with current contractors to determine interest in ass uming the caseload for the region. The general provisions of each ECI contract require the contractor to assist wit h the transition of families and children to other appropriate ECI programs in the event that the contract is terminated, without specifying how long the assistance will take place for after contract termination. Recommendations modify former DARS Rider 8, Reporting on Early Childhood Intervention, to require HHSC, in the event that a contract is terminated, to submit a report to the Legislative Budget Board and the Governor 's Office that details termination plans. The report would include the final date that the contractor is expected to provide assistance for clients transitioning into another contractor's caseload. b. Medicaid Billing : Included in each ECI provider's contract is a maximum amount to be reimbursed by HHSC, and an amount to be collected by the provider from Medicaid billings for Targeted Case Management (TCM) , Specialized Skills Training (SST) services, and Medicaid Administrative Claiming (MAC) costs . TCM activities assist children and their families in receivi ng medical, social, educational, developmental, and other appropriate services, and include activities like referrals and development of a care plan. SST services may include physical and occupational therapy and audiological services. MAC includes costs r elated to administering activities that support the ECI program. The Texas Medicaid plan changed TCM billing procedures in fiscal year 2012 and providers could only bill in 15 -minute increments instead of billing by the hour, causing an expected decline in TCM collections. However, TCM collections continue to decline six years later despite no further policy changes , resulting in the agency using additional IDEA Part C Federal Funds to make up the difference between projected and actual TCM collections . HHSC indicated that they expect a further decline in average monthly TCM collections per Medicaid child , but are not able to provide clear reasons for the continuing decline . Additionally, fiscal year 2016 MAC billings through March are showing a 38.6 percent decline over the prior year. The agency is also not able to provide a clear reason for the emerging decline in MAC billing. Recommendations hold TCM collections and MAC billing to fiscal year 2015 levels in fiscal years 2017 through 2019 . Recommendations also assume the level of fiscal yea r 2016 collections for SST in fiscal years 2017 through 2019 . Recommendations revise former DARS Rider 8, Reporting on Early Childhood Intervention to require HHSC to submit a report on provider revenue for Medicaid bill ings. Recommendations also introduce a new rider to require HHSC to provide technical assistance to providers on TCM billing procedures, and to amend the state Medicaid plan to bill for pooled increments (lower than 15 minutes) of TCM. See Rider 69, Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) Services: Medicaid Billing . Recommendations have account ed for the decline in TCM billings, but ECI service providers continue to bill at significantly lower levels each fiscal year. The decline in TCM billings and the decline in MAC collections since fiscal year 2011 are detailed in the chart s below: 14Section 3 Agency 529 1/27/2017 Source: Legislative Budget Board ; Health and Human Services Commission Note: MAC data lag by 6-9 months.

State Office Expenditures : HHSC reported in previous fiscal years that they were unable to draw down matching funds for operating expenses related to providing ECI services. The United States Code of Fede ral Regulations provides a 50 percent match for ECI activities that are for the proper and efficient administration of the state plan (42 CFR \u00a7433.15 (a)), including costs associated with staff salary, fringe benefits, and travel -related expenses. A 75 percent match is also available for using an approved Medicaid Management Information S ystem (MMIS) for processing monthly contractor billings. Recommendations move state office expenditures out of Strategy D.1.3, ECI Services , into Strategy D.1.4, ECI Respite and Quality Assurance, in order to separate state office expenditures from client services expenditures . Recommendations assume a c hange to the method of finance for state office expenditures , and include a new rider requi ring HHSC to bill for all eligible operating expenses . See Rider 69, Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) Services: Medicaid Billing. d. Maintenance of Effort (MOE) Requirements : In order to receive Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Part C Federal Funds , the state's non -federal expenditures for the ECI program must equal, at a minimum, non -federal expenditures from the most recent preceding year for which complete data are available. Recommendations include fundi ng to meet the MOE re quirement of $48.3 million in General Revenue and Other Funds in fiscal year 2018. Because General Revenue increased in fiscal year 2019 above the 2017 level, the MOE will increase in the 2020 -21 biennium. The need for additional General Revenue was reduce d by including an additional $5.0 million in TANF Federal Funds in each fiscal year of the 2018 -19 biennium. 9. Autism Program. Recommendations include $14.2 million in All Funds ($14.2 million in General Revenue Funds) for the 2018 -19 biennium. Recommendations revise former DARS Rider 28, Autism Program Provisions, to remove language regarding comprehensive services. Comprehensive Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) treatment services, which are used to treat multiple chall enging behaviors, will discontinue on August 31, 2017. As of the start of fiscal year 2016, children eligible to receive services w ere enrolled into Focused ABA treatment services only, which is used to treat a specific challenging behavior. Recommendations also include deleting former DARS Rider 27, Unexpended Balances within the B iennium: Autism Program. The Autism Program's contrac ts are considered grants, and as long as the grants are awarded before the end of the appropriation year, the awards may be expended for up to an additional two fiscal years for their intended purpose. Autism services are provided by 21 contractors, and are available in 10 of 11 Health and Human Services regions. As of November 2016, two of the new contractors were still build ing capacity, and two contractors are in the process of opening secondary sites in their service areas to serve additional children . The graph below illustrates the number of children served through the Autism program and the number of children on the interest list for the program from fiscal years 2014 to 2016. Contractors keep an interest list of children who are eligible for servic es but are unable to be enrolled in the program at the time services are requested. The interest list is maintained according to date of request f or services. Families whose children are receiving services through other programs may either request to be re moved from the interest list or choose to remain on the list while receiving other services. The projected number of children on the interest list is 1,178 for the end of fiscal year 2018 and 1,237 for fiscal year 2019 . The agency expects to serve an avera ge of 577 children per month in the 2018 -19 biennium. 16Section 3 Agency 529 1/27/2017 Source: L egislative Budget Board; Health and Human Services Commission 10. Community -Based and Client Services Programs with Waiting and Interest Lists. Medicaid w aiver and non -Medicaid community -based programs administered by HHSC keep an interest list of individual s who have identified an interest in receiving services, but have not yet been determined eligible to receive services. Individual s who have been on the interest list the longest, and who have been determined eligible to receive services, take priority for enrollment into services. The number of applicants on in terest lists for community -based programs as of November 2016 is shown be low: November 2016 Interest List Counts Community Living Assistance and Support Services 58,049 Deaf Blind with Multiple Disabilities 206 Home and Community -based Services 81,678 Medically Dependent Children's Program 19,5611 STAR+PLUS 19,880 Texas Home Living 60,912 Note: List management policy allows for individuals to sign on to multiple interest lists.

There will continue to be an interest list to receive MDCP -like services in STARKids. Several client services programs administered by HHSC keep waiting lists consisting of individua ls with a completed service plan . Individuals are removed from the waiting list and enter into services when other individuals in the program no longer require services and if funding for the program is still avai lable.

Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Cash Assistance. Recommendations provide an increase of $ 4.9 million in All Funds ( $0.2 million in General Revenue ; $4.7 million in TANF Federal Funds ) above 2016 -17 spending levels for the TANF Cash Assistance program to fund projected increases in caseload and grant per recipient . Caseloads in the TANF Cash Assistance programs have mostly declined since fiscal year 2004. Projections assume 1.0 percent caseload growth in fiscal years 2017 through 2019 in the TANF program, the TANF State Program for two-parent families, and the One -Time Payments for Children . Recommendations include continue d funding for the Maintenance of Effort (MOE) level of $48.3 million in Gener al Revenue for TANF annually . Grant per recipient historically increases each year because the maximum grant is tied to the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) , which in turn is tied to the Consumer Price Index . Projections assume an increase in the grant per recipient amount of 1.0 percent for fiscal year 2018 and 2.1 percent for fiscal year 2019 based on projected growth in the FP L. Recommendations maintain the eligibilit y for TANF at 17 percent of FPL . The decline in TANF caseload is discussed on the following page : 18Section 3 Agency 529 1/27/2017 Following the enactment of House Bill 2292, S eventy -eighth Legislative Session , 2003, Regular Session, Texas instituted several changes to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, including full -family sanctions, in which a violation of the Personal Responsibility Agreement (PRA) results in all adults and children in t he household losing all TANF payments for at least one month. Repeat violations result in program disqualification. These changes led to steep declines in TANF enrollment. However, the 2003 policy changes do not fully explain the continued decrease in TANF participation. In September 2003, the first month of reform implementation, the number of average monthly TANF recipients declined by 17.6 percent. With the exception of a small recession - related uptick in FY 2010, the number of TANF recipients continues to decline 13 years later. The average monthly number of TANF recipients declined by 302,000 ( -82.1 percent) between fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2016. Ad ult recipients declined from 91,000 to 9,000 average monthly recipients ( -90.1 percent) and child recipients declined from 277,000 to 57,000 ( -79.5 percent). Between fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2016 year - to-date, the number of average monthly TANF rec ipients declined by 45.8 percent. Similarly, TANF one -time payments have fallen from 523 average payments monthly in fiscal year 2007 to 111 payments monthly in fiscal year 2016. This trend is not unique to Texas. TANF caseload has fallen by 17 percent na tionwide since its peak in 2010. To some degree, this decline may be due to state -level policy changes. However, many states are experiencing caseload decreases in the absence of specific policy change. Total TANF applications remain near the 2003 level, but approval rates have steadily declined. The primary reason for disapproval reported by the agency is \"client action,\" generally related to failure to submit required paperwork or comply with program requirements. The high number of denials due to cli ent action suggests that these individuals may not find the program worthwhile given the requirements, or may find it logistically difficult to comply with application requirements. The average monthly grant per recipient is $74.05 in fiscal year 2016, up from $56.17 in fiscal year 2000. Income eligibility standards vary widely by state, and is approximately 11.0 percent of the federal poverty level in Texas. Based on data provided by HHSC, 3.6 percent of Texans in poverty received TANF in 2014, compared to 23.0 percent of individuals in poverty nationwide. 050,000100,000150,000200,000250,000300,000350,000400,000TANF Recipients, Monthly Average Adult Recipients Child Recipients0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40% 05,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,00035,00040,000TANF Applications, Monthly Average Approved Applications Denied Applications Percent Approved 19Section 3 Agency 529 1/27/2017 Note: Recommendations for the Health and Human Services system for the 2018 -19 biennium do not factor in the use of the TANF block grant used for the Department of Family and Protective Services' (DFPS) critical needs request. The critical needs request approved by the Governor's Office a nd the Legislative Budget Board provides $72.5 million in additional TANF fe deral funds in fiscal year 2017 for non -staff expenditures and allocates General Revenue from non -staff expenditures into the Child Protective Services Direct Delivery Staff Program. A shortfall of $27.4 million in TANF federal funds is estimated in fiscal year 2019. 12. The Office of Immigration and Refugee Affairs (OIRA). Recommendations reflect a decrease of $100. 3 million in Federal Funds, and 15.0 FTEs, from 2016 -17 spending levels. The state -run Refugee Assistance program is expected to stop providing services on January 31, 2017. The program is primarily federally funded. House Bill 432, Eighty -third Legislature, Regular Session, 2013 established the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) as a charitable organization for the purpos e of administering a grant program for donations received by state employees. Contributions collected are awarded as grants to pub lic and nonprofit organizations that provide assistance to domestic victims of human trafficking. On September 21, 2016, the State Refugee Coordinator from HHSC informed the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) that, if the amended state plan was not approved, HHSC would be unable to certify its state plan and would thus exit the Refugee Resettlement Program. The plan was not approved by the ORR, and the program's notice of termination began on October 1, 2016. State -provided s ervices are expected to end as of January 31, 2017. ORR has not yet announced what non- profit entity will assume responsibility for the program. HHSC and ORR are in discussions to determine who will be responsible for covering expenses after the termination date. 13. Statewide Behavioral Health Strategic Plan and Coordinated Expenditure Proposal. Recommendations amend Article IX Sec. 10.04, Statewide Behavioral Health Strategic Plan and Coordinated Exp enditure Proposal to : 1) require annual updates to the strategic pla n, inventory of behavioral health programs, and the coordinated expenditure proposal; 2) require a breakout of the methods of financing; 3) provide an estimate of Medicaid behavioral health expenditures; 4) add the Texas Education Agency, Texas Workforce Commission, and the Department of Housing and Community Affairs to the provision; and 5) update the informational listing of appropriations for behavioral health programs included in the recommendations . Agencies included in the informational listing of ap propriations are required to designate an individual to serve as a member of the behavioral health coordinating council. 14. Behavioral Health. a. Community Mental Health Services . Recommendations include an overall increase of $31.0 million in General Revenue Related Funds (decrease of $12.0 million in All Funds) in Strategy D.2.1, Community Mental Health Services for Adults, and a decrease of $21.5 million in General Revenue Related Funds ($51.5 million in All Funds) in Strategy D.2.2, Community Mental Health Services for Children, from 2016 -17 spending levels. Recommendations for Strategy D.2.5, Behavioral Health Waivers, maintain 2016 -17 appropriations for the YES Waiver and for the Home and Community Based Services -Adult Mental Health (HCBS -AMH) program. Recommendations reflect the transition of clients into STAR Kids beginning November 1, 2016. Projected fiscal year 2017 expen ditures have been reduced by $3.8 million in Genera l Revenue Match for Medicaid ($8.7 million All Funds) from Strategy D.2.1, Community Mental Health Services for Adults, and $ 1.2 million in General Revenue Match for Medicaid ($2.6 million All Funds) from Strategy D.2.2, Community Mental Health Services for Children, to reflect this transition. Recommendations reflect fiscal year 2017 appropriated levels with adjustments to remove: 1) $17.0 million in General Revenue Related Funds ($4 3.1 million All Funds) per fiscal year for the NorthSTAR program, which was discontinued January 1, 2017; 2) $8.6 million in General Revenue per fiscal year for one -time transition funding to the Local Men tal Health Authorities that are expected to provide community services to certain former NorthSTAR clients; and 3) Approx imately $5.9 million in General Revenue Related Funds ($13.7 million All Funds) expenditures for STAR Kids indicated above. 20Section 3 Agency 529 1/27/2017 Recommendations include $32.0 million in General Revenue ($38.6 million All Funds) each fiscal year to biennialize funding fo r non-Medicaid community behavioral health services that were previously available through t he NorthSTAR program, and $54.8 million in General Revenue Funds ($62.6 million All Funds) to address the waiting list for community mental health services for adults an d children. See Selected Fiscal and Policy Issue #1 5 and #1 6. b. State Hospitals . Recommendations include a decrease of $21.0 million in General Revenue for one -time capital projects at the state mental health facilities, including $18.3 million in General Revenue for the one -time repair and renovation of state hospitals , $1.7 million in General Revenue for critical IT projects and $1.0 million General Revenue for state hospital cameras . HHSC is requesting an exceptional item for re pair and renovation of state facilities, which includes $95.5 million in General Obligation Bond Proceeds for the state hospitals. (see Section 5, Items not Included in Recommendations, Exceptional Item 19). The agency has also submitted a placeholder exce ptional item for new construction at state hospitals (see Section 5, Items not Included in Recommendations, Exceptional Item 22). The graph below shows historical requests and appropriations for repairs and renovations of state hospitals. There is no Gen eral Obligation bond authority available for appropriation in the 2018 -19 biennium. See Article IX, Sec. 17.10, Improving State Hospital Facilities, and Other State Facility Needs, for intent language to appropriate funds to address critical capital needs in the 2018 -19 Biennium. Repairs and Renovations at the State Hospitals. Note: Agency indicated need reflects the cost of construction projects that each state hospital determined to be the highest priority in the Legislative Appropriation Request for each biennium. The estimated deferred maintenance cost for state hospitals was $145.1 million as of March 16, 2016 , with a total project cost of $222.0 million if all deferred maintenance items were turned into projects. Project cost includes costs for co nstruction, management, surveying and testing, administration fees, environmental abatement, construction Agency 529 1/27/2017 State psychiatric facilities must maintain accreditation by the Joint Commission in order to receive federal reimbursement. T o maintain accreditation, hospitals must comply with environment of care standards which require buildings to be maintained in a safe and therapeutic manner that is conduciv e to clients' recovery. State psychiatric facilities must also comply with the minimum requirements of National Fire Protection Association 101 Life Safety Code and associated codes and standards, which include fire sprinkler systems, fire alarms, firewalls, smoke barriers, emergency power and lighting, and other requirements necessar y to pr otect building occupants from danger caused by smoke, fire, and toxic fumes. 15. Community Mental Health Services for Adults Waiting List. The graph below illustrates the number of adults served through community mental health programs and the number of individuals on the waiting list for these services at the end of each fiscal year . The Department of State Health Services was appropriated $46.1 million in General Revenue in the 2014 -15 biennium for the purpose of eliminating the adult waiting list for services. The number of adults on the waiting list decreased from 4,197 in September 2013 to 360 in August 2014. The Department received $9.4 million to serve an estimated 960 individuals on the wa iting list as of May 1, 2015 in the 2016 -17 biennium. The c urrent adult waiting list is 1,575 as of August 31, 2016. Recommendations include $54.4 million in General Revenue ($62.2 million in All Funds) to address the waiting list for communi ty mental health services for adults. Recommendations assume an average cost to remove one adult on the waiting list of $4,908, and estimate that the waiting list at the en d of the 2018 -19 biennium would be 12, 675 adults based on current population growth if no additional funding was provided .

Community Mental Health Services for Children Waiting List. The graph below illustrates the number of children served through community mental health programs and the number of children on the waiting list for these services. The Department of State Health Services was appropriated $2.1 million in General Revenue in the 2014 -15 biennium to serve childre n on the waiting list. The current children's waiting list is 91 as of August 31, 2016. Note that the fiscal year 2017 number of children served is the current target, and that the agency has consistently overserved the target in previous fiscal years . Recommendations include $0.4 million in General Revenue Funds ($0.6 million All Funds) to address the current and projected wa iting list for community mental health services for children. Recommendations assume an average cost to remove one child from the w aiting list of $5,100, and estimate the waiting list at 91 children at the end of the 2018 -19 biennium if no additional funding was provided . The agency does not anticipate the waiting list would grow significantly from the current waiting list, which is d ue primarily to a shortage of psychiatrists at the local mental health authority serving the Rio Grande Valley.

YES waiver. The Youth Empowerment Services (YES) waiver provides home and community -based mental health services to children and youth between ages 3 and 18 with a mental health disorder of such severity that otherwise they would either need inpatient psychiatric care, threaten the success of their foster care placement, or be relinquished to state custody by their parents. The YES waiver sets aside certain Medicaid eligibility requirements (in this case, it disregards parental income) to provide home and community -based services to kids with a severe emotional disturbance (SED). YES waiver services may include respite care for families a nd caregivers; specialized therapies, including art, recreational, mus ic, and animal -assisted; minor home modifications; and supportive family -based services to help the family learn healthy interactions. A waiver amendment appr oved by CMS in July 2016 expanded YES eligibility to include children and adolescents in the stat e's conservatorship. The table below shows the total YES waiver enrollment and corresponding appropriations to the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC). Enrollment General Revenue Federal Funds Other Funds All Funds Average All Funds Cost per Enrollee 2011 85 Human Services Commission Note: 2017 enrollment projections and explanation for Cost Per Enrollee variance are forthcoming from HHSC. Recommendations include $24.4 million in General Revenue Funds ($58.6 million in All Funds ), for the 2018 -19 biennium to continue the program at fiscal year 2017 appropriated levels . 18. Civil and Forensic Capacity at the State Hospitals. In fiscal year 2012, a forensic capacity lawsuit (Taylor v. Lakey) found that forensic patients must wait no longer than 21 days to be placed in a state mental health facility. To meet this increased demand, DSHS expanded the number of forensic beds within the state hospitals and contracted with additional community hospitals for civil beds. Forensic patients have, on average, significantly longer lengt hs of stay (118 days as compared to 42 days for civil patients), and the costs for inpatient se rvices for forensic patients are borne entirely by the state. The longer length of stays associated with forensic patients re sult in fewer patients per year receiving services and consistent increases in the proportion of forensic patients to non -forensic patients. As of October 24, 2016, there are 285 individuals on the waiting list for Maximum Security Units at North Texas State Hospital Vernon Campus and Rusk State Hos pital, including 250 individuals who have been waiting for more than 21 days, and 97 in dividuals on the waiting list for non -Maximum Security Units, 6 of whom have been waiting for more than 21 days. In fiscal year 2015, the average daily state hospital census was 2,236 including 1,125 civil patients (50.3 percent) and 1,11 1 forensic patie nts (49.7 percent). The percentage of forensic patients has increased by 7.5 percent from fiscal year 2013. Costs for inpatient forensic patients are funded by the state, whereas civil patients may have third party insurance to fund the cost of inpatient treatment. Third party reimbursement will continue to decrease as the ratio of forensic to civil patients increases. Recommendations include $21.1 m illion in Mental Health Appropriated Receipts , a decrease of $7.8 million from 2016 -17 spending levels, due to the decrease in the proportion of civil patients . General Revenue in the amount of $7.8 million is recommended in place of reduced Mental Health Appropriated Receipts. 24Section 3 Agency 529 1/27/2017 19. State Supported Living Centers (SSLCs) . Recommendations include $ 558.9 million in General Revenue Related Funds ($ 1,293.5 million All Funds) in Strategy G.1.1, State Supported Living Centers, to provide services to individuals at the State Supported Living Centers , and include the following: A reallocation of $27.8 million in General Revenue Related Funds ($70.2 million All Funds) in oversight budget to Strategy L.1.1, Enterprise Oversight and Policy including agency related payroll health insurance and retirement contributions, medical supplies, medications, Qualit y Assurance Fee payments, food for residents, settlements and judgments, postal services, employee training, and non -capital maintenance. An additional $4.6 million for MLPP - Utility Savings is reallocated to Strategy G.4.2, Capital Repair and Renovations . A decrease of $0.6 million in General Revenue Related Funds ($1.3 million All Funds) for the 2018 -19 biennium for salary clawback. An additional $1.7 million in General Revenue Related Funds ($2.3 million All Funds) were reduced from the 2016 -17 base sp ending levels. See Selected Fiscal and Policy Issue # 25 for more information on the salary clawback. Recommendations assume 10.0 percent of fiscal year 2017 budgeted expenditures are variable and reduce the variable portion of expenditures by the project ed caseload decline of 2.9 percent in each of fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Recommendations include a reduction of $0.8 million in General Revenue Related Funds ($1.9 million All Funds) in fiscal year 2018, and $1.6 million in General Revenue Related Funds ( $3.2 million All Funds ) in fiscal year 2019. Annual expenditures per resident are projected to increase over fiscal year 2017 levels by 2.4 percent in fiscal year 2018 and 5.1 percent in fiscal year 2019. See the graph on the next page for a comparison of costs per resident over time . Appropriations for oversight and for MLPP have been included in this chart for the purposes of making a meaningful comparison to prior fiscal years. See below for a chart comparing overall appropriations for SSLCs over time . Recommendations modify former DADS Rider 28 , State Supported Living Center Oversight, to notwithstand other appropriation and transfer authority in the General Appropriations Act and limit expenditures for SSLCs to appropriations. Expenditures may only exceed appropriations for SSLCs with approval from the LBB and the Governor. The proposed rider language includes a 15 business day auto -approval clock.

Recommendations include $0.9 million in General Revenue - Dedicated Account No. 5049, State Owned Multicategorical Teaching Account in Strategy D.3.1, Indigent Health Care Reimbursement (UTM B), a biennial reduction of $8.9 million in General Revenue Related Funds from 2016 -17 spending levels , as part of HHSC's four percent reduction. Funds in this strategy are used to reimburse the University of Texas Medica l Branch for indigent health care costs. UTMB indicated that loss of this funding will cause a reduction in the number of patients served but has not provided an estimate. Funding for this account is comprised of un claimed lottery prizes. Per Government Code sec. 466.408, of available unclaimed lottery prizes, not more than $20 million in prize money each year may be deposited to Account 5049 to provide indigent health care services. Not more than $5 million may be appropriated to HHSC to be used to support the provision of inpatient hospital services along the Texas - Mexico border, and not more than $5 million shall be deposited to the fund for veterans' assistance. All prize money not deposited or appropriated for the above purposes must be deposited to the credit of the foundation school fund. 21. Department of Justice Settlement Agreement. In 2009, the state of Texas and the U.S. Department of Justice entered into a settlement agreement regarding services provided to individuals with intellectual disabilities in state -operated facilities as well as the transition of such individuals to the most integrated setting appropriate to meet their needs and preferences. Under the terms of the agreement, independent monitoring reviews are conducted semiannually at each SSLC to determine compliance within each of 20 substantive sections of improvement listed in the settlement agreement. The agency continues to provide updates on each center's overall compliance ratings and individual campus initiatives to improve compliance with particular sections of the agreement. 22. Texas Civil Commitment Office - Administrative Attachment. Government Code, \u00a7 420A.011, establishes the Texas C ivil Commitment Office (TCCO) as an independent state agency administratively attached to the Department of State Health Services. SB 200, Eighty -fourth Legislature, 2015, directed the Executive $12,328$13,549$14,389$15,111$16,537$17,595$18,731 $18,873 $19,319 $19,840 $0$5,000$10,000$15,000$20,000 05001,0001,5002,0002,5003,0003,5004,0004,5005,000 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Census Average Monthly Cost per Resident 26Section 3 Agency 529 1/27/2017 Commissioner of HHSC to define, identify, and consolidate client services from the health and human services system to the Commission. While TCCO was not identified for transfer in the Transition Plan submitted to the Transition Legislative Oversight Committee, HHSC transferred TCCO as a clien t service on September 1, 2016. TCCO items of appropriation ar e reflected in the HHSC budget structure. The Legislature should consider a statutory change to reflect TCCO's administrative attachment to HHSC. 23. Texas Civil Commitment Office - Senate Bill 746. There is no longer a state funding limit to the number of civil commitment trials that can be conducted each fiscal year due to SB 746, Eighty -fourth Legislature, 2015, which shifted jurisdiction for civil commitment trials from the Special Prosecutions Un it (435th District Court in Montgo mery County), to the individual's last county of conviction for a sexually vio lent offense. TCCO is statutorily required to provide supervision and treatment to all civilly committed sexually violent predators (SVPs). TCCO projects the number of civilly committed SVPs to be 340 in fiscal year 2018 and 409 in fiscal year 2019. As of October 31, 2016, there are 256 civilly committed SVPs. The cost to treat one SVP per year is approximately $50,000. T CCO submitted Exceptional Item 60, requesting an additional $1.2 million in fiscal year 2018 and $3.9 million in fiscal year 2019 to treat and supervise the projected increas e in SVPs. 24. Office of Inspector General . The Office of Inspector General (IG) is administratively at tached to the Health and Human Services Commission, and the Inspector General is appointed by the Governor. The IG's primary purpose is to prevent, detect, and investigate fraud, waste, and abuse throughout the entire health and human services system. The IG is currently organized into eight divisions: Investigations, Audit, Inspections, Chief Counsel, Medical and Dental Profess ionals, External Relations, Data and Technology, and Operations. During the 2014 Sunset Review, the IG was subjected to its first comprehensive evaluation since inception in 2003. The Sunset Review found that the IG was not focused on its core responsibilities and did not produce fair, defensible, and demonstrated results. Additionally, the former leadership of the IG played a primar y role in the mishandling of the 21CT contract that impacted contracting practices throughout the state. The Eighty -fourth Legislature, 2015, passed Senate Bill 207, which required , among other items, the IG to report quarterly on the agency's performance, defines the IG role in managed care investigations and oversight, and establish es prioritization criteria for investigation processes. The shift from a fee -for-service to a managed care health -care delivery model poses a significant challenge for the IG. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 78.1 percent of Medicaid enrollees in Texas received their health care through a Managed Care Organization as of July 1, 2014 and it is pr ojected that the percentage of managed care clients will increase during the 2018 -19 biennium. The IG is charged with auditing the MCOs and coordinating fraud, waste, and abuse prevention with Special Investigation Units (SIUs) operated by the MCOs. Instead of auditing or coordinating investigat ions in one syst em under the fee -for-service model, the IG is responsible for doing so across 23 systems (22 MCOs and the remaining fee -for-service system). The agency is developing and implementing strategies to address this challenge. Recommendations introduce new HHSC Rider 173, Office of Inspector General Report, directing the IG to detail its strategies, the status of implementation efforts, and on -going challenges related to the expansion of managed care. Recommendations also include a new outcome performance measure , Amount of Medicaid Overpayments Identified in collaboration with Special Investigation Units, to monitor the efficiency and effectiv eness of its investigative processes related to SIUs. 25. Administrative Cost Adjustments . Recommendations include a n increase of $30.6 million in General Revenue Related Funds ( a decrease of $221.6 million in All Funds) related to several adjustments across the agency for FTE allocations, salaries, and indirect administrative costs. The changes are detailed below: Full Time Equivalent Adjustment -Recommendations reflect a decrease of $39.1 million in All Funds ($21.3 million in General Revenue Related Funds) and 421.7 FTEs in the 2018 -19 biennium to align with reported filled positions in fiscal year 2016 and remove persi stently vacant FTEs from the agency's cap. Recommendations maintain the commission's requested average cost for an FTE in each a ffected strategy in each fiscal year of the 2018 -19 biennium. The reduction is reflected in Strategies B.1.1, Medi caid Contracts & upport Tech; L.2.2, Regional Program Support. 27Section 3 Agency 529 1/27/2017 Comptroller of Public Accounts (CPA) Salary Transfer Clawback -Recommendations provide a $ 14.3 million in All Funds ($ 6.5 million in General Revenue Rela ted Funds) reduction in the 2016 -2017 base and a $18.8 million in All Funds ($9.3 million in General Revenue Related Funds) reduction in the 2018 -19 biennium to align with actual amounts expended pursuant to Article IX, \u00a718.02, Appropriation for a Salary I ncrease for General State Employees, 2016 -17 General Appropriations Act. Article IX, \u00a718.02 provides authority to increase compensation by 2.5 percent for general state employees to mitigate the increased member contribution rate paid to the Employee Retirement System (ERS). Mitigation of the increased member contribution rate was inte nded for t hose employed as of September 1, 2015. The reduction is reflected in Strategies G.1.1, State Supported Living Centers; G.2.1 Care Intake & Access; and L.1.1, HHS System Supports. Indirect Administrative Cost Adjustment -Recommendation include $96 0.4 million in All Funds ($31 9.2 million in General Revenue Related Funds) for indirect administrative cost, representing a 14. 6 percent decrease from the 2016 -17 base . Included in the 14.6 percent decrease from the 2016 -17 base is a 5.35 percent decrease from th e commission's baseline request . The recommendations align indirect administrative cost s based on consolidation pursuant to Senate Bill 200, Eighty -fourth Legislature, 2015 . The base level funding allocated to the Health and Human Services Commission from the former Department of Aging and Disability Services, the former Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services, the Department of Family and Protective Services, and the Department of State Health Services is reflected in Goal L, System Oversight & Program Support. The recommendations reallocate the General Revenue -Related savings from the 5.35 percent decrease to S trategy E.1.2, Provide WIC Services, to restore the agency's four percent reduction in Genera l Revenue -Dedicated WIC Rebates Account No. 8027 (See Selected Fiscal and Policy Issue 26). The Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) is responsible for the oversight and coordination of all programs and services provided by the agencies comprising the HHS System. Additionally, HHSC is responsible for providing administrative and support functions for the HHS S ystem. The costs incurred by HHSC to support the HHS System are allocated to the commission and the other HHS agencies in accordance with the Public Assistance Cost Allocatio n Plan (PACAP). The PACAP is a document submitted for approval to the US Department of Health and Human Services and provides a nar rative description of the agency's organization and the procedures employed for allocating costs incurred by the HHS System. 26. Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Rebates Account No. 8027. Recommendations include restoration of the agency's four percent reduction in General Revenue - Dedicated WIC Rebates Account No. 8027 by $17.6 million for the 2018 -19 biennium. Recommendations also includes an additional $9.7 million in General Revenue - Dedicated WIC Rebat es Account No. 8027 based on the average percent increase of 2. 2 percent in revenue collected from fiscal years 2012 through 2016. This is offset with administrative savings in General Revenue -Related funds, as discussed in Selected Fiscal and Policy Issue 25. These funds, in combination with federal cash grants, fund the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which provides supplemental f oods and nutrition education for pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women, and infants and children up to age five who have nutritional -related health problems. WIC State agencies are required by law to competitively bid infant formula rebate contracts with infant formula manufacturers, and receive rebates from the m anufacturer f or each can of infant formula purchased by a WIC participant. WIC rebates and interest earnings associated with the rebates may only be expended on adminis tration of the WIC program. 27. The Center for the Elimination of Disproportionality and Disparities. No funding is included for the Center for Elimination of Disproportionality and Disparities for the 2018 -19 biennium, reflecting a decrease of $4.1 million in All Funds ($0.4 million in General Revenue Funds) from 2016 -17 spending levels and 25.9 FTEs per fiscal year . 28. Capital Needs and Projects. Recommendations include the following related to Capital needs and projects: Vehicle Replacement -Recommendations include $0.6 million in General Revenue Funds (a decrease of $3.0 million from the 2016 -17 base ) to replace 16 vehicles projected to exceed 150,000 miles in the 2018 -19 biennium. Facilities - Recommendations include $4.5 million in General Revenue Related Funds i n Strategy G.4.2, Capital Repairs and Renovations, for capital repair and renovation projects at the State Supported Living Centers, and $7.6 million in General Revenue for MLPP for State Supported L iving Centers and the state 28Section 3 Agency 529 1/27/2017 hospitals, which includes a reduction of $ 23.3 million in General Revenue Related funds ($ 49.9 million All Funds, including $ 22.6 million in GO Bond Proceeds) for one-time capital repairs and reno vations as well as to reflect the end of the Sprinkler System Subsidy for Home and Commun ity-Based Services homes . HHSC included an exceptional item for repair and renovation of state facilities, which includes $93.0 million in General Obligatio n Bond Proceeds for the State Supported Living Centers. (see Section 5, Items not Included in Recomm endations, Exceptional Item 19 . See also Selected Fiscal and Policy Issue 1 4 for a discussion of capital needs at the state hospitals ). Costs for maintaining buildings include upkeep and repairs to prevent further deterioration, and replacement of any mat erials, equipment, or fixtures that cannot be repaired in a cost effective manner. The agency projects the total maintenance costs for the State Supported Living Center s at $144.4 million for the 2018 -19 biennium. State Supported Living Centers must comply with the minimum requirements of National Fire Protection Association 101 Life Safety Code and associated codes and standards, which include fire sprinkler systems, fire alarms, firewalls, smoke barriers, emergency power and lighti ng, and other requiremen ts necessary to protect building occupants from danger caused by smoke, fire, and toxic fumes. Centralized Accounting and Payroll/Personnel System (CAPPS) -HHSC is one of the hub agencies for the CAPPS. Recommendations reduce base funding for CAPPS by $0.3 million in All Funds ($0.1 million in General Revenue Related Funds) for the 2018 -19 biennium to align with the estimate provide d by the Comptroller of Public Accounts for PeopleSoft licenses. Recommendations also include the corresponding adjustment to c apital budget authority. Master Lease Purchase Program (MLPP) -Recommendations reflect a reduction for the MLPP of $0 .8 million in General Revenue Funds to align with the estimate provided by the Texas Public Finance Authority for energy and water conservation projects at the State Supported Living Centers and State Hospitals. Recommendations also include the corresponding adjustment to capital budget authority. Texas Integrated Eligibility Redesign System (TIERS) -Recommendations reflect an increase of $0.6 million in All Funds (a decrease of $20.6 million in General Revenue Related Funds) for TIERS capital projects and system support to maintain overall funding levels provided by the Eighty -fourth Legislature. The Health and Human Service s Commission (HHSC) provides eligibility services to clients for stat e and federal programs such as SNAP Food Benefits, TANF, CHIP, and Medicaid and TIERS is the eligibility system utilized by HHSC benefits offices throughout Texas. Subsequent to the Eight y-fourth Legislature, HHSC received approval for two Advanced Planning Documents from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that provided enhanced federal financia l participation (FFP) rates to certain aspects of the TIERS capital project. H HSC utilized the enhanced FFP rates to leverage the appropriated General Revenue and procure expanded services and projects during the 2016 -17 biennium that had not been presented to the Eighty -fourth Legislature. Recommendations also include a Rider 171, Texas Integrated Eligibility Redesign System (TIERS), requiring HHSC to submit quarterly reports to the Legislative Budget Board and the Governor for the TIERS project and restricting the agency's ability to expand the project without approval from the Leg islature. Recommendations for Special Provisions Relating to All Health and Human Services Agencies include edits to Section 4, Federal Match Assumptions and Limitations on Use of Available General Revenue Funds, clarifying that the provision applies to al l enhancements to federal matches. Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) and Enterprise Data Governance (EDG) -Recommendations include $13.2 million in All Funds ($1.8 million in General Revenue Funds) for the EDG project. Recommendations do not include any funding for the EDW project and the commission is projected to lapse $ 54.0 million in General Revenue Match for Medicaid for the project in the 2016 -17 biennium. Not including funding for EDW in the baseline request was part of its four percent reduction and recommendations reallocate the portions to the EDG project and other administrative functions. Prior to the 2018 -19 biennium, the EDW and EDG projects were funded jointly as one project under the EDW umbrella. The EDW project is the consolidation of HHS System data from the Health and Human Services Commission, Department of Family Protective Services, and Department of State Health Services into a single data repository f or the purpose of facilitating data analytics and reporting. The EDG project includ es assessment of the available HHS System data and the development and establishment of common data definitions, standards, policies, and procedures. 29Section 3 Agency 529 1/27/2017 The EDW project began in fiscal year 2008, but HHSC terminated the project on June 28, 2016, due to the complications associated with HHS System consolidation pursuant to Senate Bill 200, Eighty -fourth Legislature, 2015 . It is anticipated that HHSC will restart the EDW project at some point after the 2018 -19 biennium. Recommendations continue the EDG project to further develop standard data practices for the HHS System. Recommendations also include Rider 170, Enterprise Data Governance, requiring HHSC to submit quarterly reports to the Legislative Budget Board and the Governor on the status of the EDG projec t. 29. Healthcare Delivery Model Comparison Report, Article IX Sec. 18.07, HB 1, Eighty -fourth Legislature. HHSC was directed to collaborate with the Employee s Retirement System (ERS), the Teacher Retirement System (TRS), and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) to analyze potential v ariations in utilization, cost, reimbursement rates and quality of care among each of the aforementioned healthcare sys tems, and identify outliers and improvements for efficiency and quality that can be implemented within each system . See Appendix F for a more detailed summary of the report, including a discussion of cost drivers in each healthcare system. Overall, the a nalysis found that utilization measures were generally consistent; where differences emerged, they could be explained by the differing population characteristics of the clients served by each system, or by differen ces in reporting methodology. However, w ith no common data source, and no centralized actuarial review to adjust for differences in demographics, health acuity, funding, plan design, and data quality, the authors of the report found it difficult to draw reliable conclusions . Additionally, t he report does not address the goal of providing improvements for efficiency and quality that could be implemented in each system. Rather, it concludes with \"next steps,\" including developing a more sophisticated methodology for analyzing different data sets a nd developing standardized comparative data. To that end, the recommendations include Art IX, Sec. 10.06, Analysis of Certain Healthcare Data, which requires HHSC, ERS, T RS, TDCJ and the Department of State Health Services to develop a plan for an integ rated health care information system that can be used to compare data related to their healthcare systems. 30. Medicaid Cost Containment Update . HHSC was directed to achieve $373 .0 million in General Revenue savings pursuant to Rider 50, Medicaid Funding Reduction and Cost Containment, in the 2016 -17 biennium. The agency's September 12 , 2016 report provides a General Revenue savings estimate projected to be $137.2 million. The following items and savings estimates were provided: Item Estimated General Revenue Savings (in millions) Increase fraud, waste , and abuse prevention and detection $25.8 Changes to premium structure for MCOs and contracting tools to reduce costs and increase efficiency. $6.8 Renegotiate more efficient contracts, including reducing the administrative contract profit margin and establish rebate provisions where possible. $3.9 Implement fee -for-service payment changes and managed care premium adjustments that incentivize the most appropriate and effective use of services. $10.2 Increase efficiencies in the vendor drug program. $15.6 Increase third -party recoupments and create a pilot program on motor vehicle subrogation. $10.5 Implement addi tional initiatives identified by HHSC. $6.0 Acute care therapies services - rate and policy changes $58.4 TOTAL Cost Containment $137.2 In November 2016, HHSC provided additional savings initiatives for fiscal year 2017. This includes an enhanced federal match rate related to TIERS eligibility staffing ($40.0 million in General Revenue), reduced acute care and general hospital imaging fees ($5.7 million in General Revenue), r eform of anesthesia reimburs ement ($2.1 million in General Revenue), Enterprise Data Warehouse lapsing funding ($4.5 million in General Revenue), and other IT and ad ministrative savings ($2.7 million in General Revenue). DSHS provided three initiatives totaling $2.8 million in Gener al Revenue, and DADS provided two initiatives totaling $4.1 million in General Revenue. 30Section 3 Agency 529 1/27/2017 The total for all these additional items is $62.0 million in General Revenue and $63.4 million in All Funds. While these add itional savings are not assumed in the fis cal year 2016 -17 base, we are monitoring. 31. Earned Federal Funds. Recommendations increase the projected Earned Federal Funds (EFF) for HHSC and reduce the projected EFF for Article II overal l in fiscal years 2018 and 2019 to reflect HHS System con solidation pursuant to Senate Bill 200, Eighty -fourth Legislature, 2015, and the historical trend of decreasing EFF over time (see table below). Earned Federal Funds are dollars received in connection with a federal program, but by governing agreement are not required to be spent on federal programming. The most common examples of EFF are 1) interagency contracts paid from another agency's federal funds; 2) deposi tory interest earned on federal funds; and 3) sale of fixed assets purchased with federal funds . The increase at HHSC reflects the consolidation of the Department of Aging and Disability Services, the Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services, and programs from the Department of State Health Services and the Depart ment of Family and Protec tive Services into HHSC. Agencies are provided General Revenue and are required to collect EFF at the level established in Article IX, Sec. 13.1 1, Definition, Appropriation, Reporting and Audit of Earned Federal Funds, or return General Revenue to the trea sury in the amount equal to that not collected. Fiscal Year EFF 2014 $12,300,000 2015 $12,300,000 2016, estimated $12,300,000 2017, projected $12,300,000 2018, recommended $16,007,017 2019, recommended $16,007,017 32. Reporting Requirements and Agency Compliance. To assist in legislative oversight, the 2016 -17 General Appropriations Act contains several reporting requirements in the HHSC bill pattern, Article II Special Provisions, and Article IX General Provisi ons. The following chart shows the status of over 100 discrete reporting requirements in Article II for the 2016 -17 biennium. 31Article II 1/27/2017 1 Article II, Health and Human Services Reporting Requirements - Senate Citation of Reporting Requirement Required Report Content Required Biennial Frequency Late in 2016 -17?

The cost decreased due to removing operating costs the agency erroneously included as part of the development costs. The duration increased due to the delay in signing the contract with the implementation vendor. The project was completed on May 30, 2016. The purpose of the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) project was to provide accurate and consistent reporting of Medicaid/Medicare data for Texas. The project, initially designed to collect Medicaid and Medicare data from the health and human services agencies into one main database for a single source of reliable information. The information provided for the health and human service agencies would be used internally to conduct data analysis to detect and prevent fraud and abuse. The EDW project was canceled in June 2016 by the agency. Potential vendors were notified that the contract would not be executed. According to the agency, the project was halted due to the transformation and reorganization of the Health and Human Services System. QAT requested that Health and Human Services Commission close-out the EDW project while continuing oversight for the EDG program. The EDG governance refers to the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the data employed in health and human service enterprise. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 Implementation project is 26.0 percent over-budget and 21.0 percent over duration. The cost and duration increase are both due to the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (HR 4302), which creates a one-year correction for the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) Medicare physician payment formula. This change created an large number of system changes as the project was approximately 65.0 percent complete at the time of the change. The project was completed on March 31, 2016. Nursing Facility Specialized Services Tracking System is 38.0 percent over duration. The current estimated project completion date was extended to August 2017 from March 2017. This is based on a revised Texas Medicaid & Healthcare Partnership (TMHP Project Work Plan was approved by HHSC in their November 2016 report to QAT. HHSC included additional months for post-production verification and project closeout activities. The Protecting People in Regulated Facilities project is 21.0 percent over-budget and 52.0 percent over duration. The cost increased due to the implementation of two additional modules for the Waiver Survey and Certification Policy Rules & Curriculum Development databases. The duration increased seven months due to procurement delays, this affected the implementation phase by an additional two months for the project. In the agency's December monitoring report, HHSC extended the completion date from December 30, 2016 to April 28, 2017. The variance in the project end-date is due to a delay in the Vendor signing the HHS Data Usage Agreement (DUA)/Acceptable Use Agreement (AUA) which also increases the duration for end-user testing. This extension will not have an impact to the overall project cost. The State Supported Living Center Electronic Health Record Electronic Life Record project was 56.0 percent over duration. The duration increased by twelve months due to the extended procurement activities and contract negotiation timelines for software procurement. The project provides the ability to have a comprehensive view of a resident's health record. The system securely shares the health record and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) data for SSLC residents. The project was completed on August 31, 2016. Agency 529 1/27/2017 52Health and Human Services Commission Quality Assurance Team HighlightsSection 3 Related to Projects Transferred from DSHS 15 16 17 18The Contracts Process Improvement project is 29.0 percent under-budget and 33.0 percent over duration. The cost decreased due to lower contract costs than the original estimated costs in the project Business Case. The duration increased five months due to the agency adding additional time for testing the Invoice/Payment module. The project was completed on August 31, 2016. The Purchased Health Services Unit & Title V Maternal Child Health System project is 138.0 percent over-budget and 92.0 percent over duration. Increases were due to two separate contract amendments that modified the scope of the project to include the procurement of document scanners and additional functionality and development for an electronic web based application for client eligibility determination and billing - Integrated Business Information System (IBIS). IBIS replaced the Automated System for Kidney Health Information Tracking system (ASKIT). In August of 2012 the available funding and capital was insufficient to award the vendor the entire amount of the proposed project. DSHS entered into the contract with Peak Systems / Denim Group for the available funding, with the intention of awarding the remaining amount of the contract with additional funding in fiscal year 2013. In February 2015, the schedule was extended by one year due to additional software procurement, training provided for system support, and data migration analysis performed. The project, authorized to begin in fiscal year 2006 for a duration of 47 months, was appropriated $7.2 million in All Funds for project development. The project was appropriated $17.8 million in fiscal year 2008 for completion of the project. WIC WIN Evolution is a project to replace the current TX WIN (Texas WIC Information Network) management information system. The TX WIN system is outdated and no longer supported. TX WIN will be replaced by TXIN (Texas Integrated Network), which will also serve as the back-end Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) processing system. In May 2014, DSHS re-baselined the project which identified estimated development costs of $60.0 million with a new completion date of March 2017. In August 2015 the project experienced delays in negotiations with vendors and internal approvals for contracts. Once the vendor was hired, it was determined by the agency that the vendor could not complete some deliverables which increased the costs and duration. Final estimated costs are $62.1 million (Federal Funds) with a estimated completion date of April 20, 2018.The Clinical Data Exchange for Behavioral Health project is 12.0 percent under-budget and 66.0 percent over duration. The cost decreased due to lower contract costs than the original estimated costs in the project Business Case. The duration increased due to agency procurement process changes that resulted in a key contract not being finalized until later than planned. The project was completed on May 31, 2016.

The EDG governance refers to the overall management and standardization of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the data employed in health and human service enterprise. Current expended costs to date for the EDG Project is $15.6 million while final close-out expenditures to date for the EDW portion are $26.5 million. QAT requested that these cost numbers need to be updated as part of a revised Business Case, Project Plan and the EDW Project Close-Out Report. These are currently in development and are expected to be sent to QAT for review and approval. CAPPS Financials Upgrade This project was authorized to begin in fiscal year 2016 as a 24 month project and was appropriated $13.0 million in All Funds for project development. The new HHSC CAPPS Financials System will be implemented as a participating HUB agency system, hosted at the State Data Centers located in the San Angelo Data Center (SDC) and Austin Data Center (ADC). HHSC as a participating HUB agency, uses CAPPS Financials as a stand alone system within the decentralized processing model that reports to the Uniform Statewide Accounting System (USAS) and whose transactional data interfaces with the data warehouse which resides at the Comptroller of Public Accounts. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 Implementation - Compliance with Federal HIPAA This project was authorized to begin in fiscal year 2014 as a 39 month project and was appropriated $5.0 million in All Funds for project development. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a system for coding diseases, signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases. The ICD coding system is used worldwide for morbidity and mortality statistics, reimbursement systems, and automated decision support in health care. The ICD code set has been revised from ICD-9 to ICD-10 to allow for an expansion in the number of conditions that can be captured (almost twice as many) and support more comprehensive analysis.

The goal for this project is to design a uniform assessment program that maintains federal compliance and ensures that clinical assessments are administered systematically, independently, and transparently. The system is intended to track and provide reporting on a wide range of variables and to deliver accurate assessment data to ensure Individual Support Plans (ISPs) are fair, equitable, and based on objective need of individuals with an Intellectual Disability. This project was authorized to begin in fiscal year 2014 as a 23 month project and was appropriated $4.6 million in All Funds for project development. DADS used a Deliverables-Based Information Technology Services (DBITS) Vendor to perform application development, maintenance and support services. This project when complete, will provide a consolidated database system to replace the current disparate Regulatory Services applications. The project end-date was changed from 08/31/2016 to 12/30/2016 to provide time to design and implement the Waiver Survey and Certification and Policy, Rules and Curriculum systems.This project was authorized to begin in fiscal year 2016 as a 22 month project and was appropriated $1.5 million in All Funds for project development. The Long Term Services and Supports (LTSS) System was developed as part of the Balancing Incentive Program (BIP) project during the 2014-15 biennium. HHSC designed and developed the LTSS screening tool and the data sharing web services. This is intended to share LTSS data with Local Intellectual and Developmental Disability Authorities (LIDDA) as well as with Aging and Disabled Resource Centers (ADRC) including development of benchmarks for appropriate care, setting payment rates, and identifying strategies that promote better use of state and federal resources. This project was authorized to begin in fiscal year 2016 as a 15 month project and was appropriated $4.0 million in All Funds for project development. This project would modify the Long Term Care (LTC) Online Portal, of the Texas Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS). This system would create a electronic request processing and tracking process that will allow Nursing Facilities to make online requests for authorization to deliver recommended specialized services and electronically file the appropriate assessments and certifications for the service requests as part of the Preadmission Screening and Resident Review program. Agency 529 1/27/2017 56Health and Human Services Commission Quality Assurance Team HighlightsSection 3 10 11 12 13State Supported Living Center Electronic Health Record Electronic Life Record Project This project was authorized to begin in fiscal year 2014 as a 21 month project and was appropriated $19.2 million in All Funds for project development. One of four Information Technology (IT) projects under the BIP program, the State Supported Living Center (SSLC) Electronic Health Record/Electronic Life Record (EHR/ELR) project is complete and the benefit is to improve technology and information sharing between the agencies that promote client independence and to provide additional community-based service options. The project consists of SSLC Infrastructure Upgrades, Statewide Video Conferencing for SSLCs, and a PC refresh of approximately 2,000 mobile devices to replace existing PC desktop and laptop devices. Included is approximately 800 kiosks running CareTracker software that enables assisted living facilities to eliminate paper documentation. In June 2015 the agency reported to QAT that the original planned project completion date was extended 10 months due to procurement activities and contract negotiations for the software procurement. State Supported Living Center Electronic Scheduling System This project was authorized to begin in fiscal year 2014 as a 23 month project and was appropriated $1.9 million in All Funds for project development. The purpose of this project is to ensure that there is sufficient staff with the required skills to meet residents' needs and to comply with Department of Justice requirements at the SSLCs. The SSLC Electronic Scheduling System (ESS) project automates labor intensive scheduling and timekeeping processes. Implement Information Security Improvements and Application Provisioning Enhancements This project was authorized to begin in fiscal year 2016 as a 24 month project and was appropriated $2.6 million in All Funds at HHSC for project development. DADS originally initiated an interagency contract with HHSC for this project. Application Provisioning refers to the configuration, deployment and management of Information Technology systems. The purpose of this project is to implement the IBM Guardium real-time database security and monitoring solution to continuously monitor data access operations in real time to detect unauthorized actions based on detailed contextual information. This project includes remediation of applications that have been identified as having vulnerabilities, and will minimize interruptions to critical business functions.State Supported Living Centers (SSLC) Document Management System This project was authorized to begin in fiscal year 2016 as a 23 month project and was appropriated $1.9 million in All Funds for project development. The document management system (DMS) will integrate directly with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. The DMS will help ensure that the EHR system provides a full view of a resident's health record, images of paper records, and medical information. The implementation of a DMS will assist HHSC/DADS to collect data about health outcomes and to respond accurately on those outcomes to better serve the individuals in SSLCs. Imaging and digitizing paper records for SSLC residents will provide secure and immediate access to client history and client medical information in a secure method and will be designed to reduce administrative functions related to the handling of paper records.

This project will impact data records in the Clinical Management for Behavioral Health Services (CMBHS) system. DSM IV had minimal information for symptoms to receive a diagnosis. DSM-5 will capture a full range of symptoms for a particular diagnosis, while having the ability to track treatment progress. Additionally, the data collected will be transferable among other state agencies in comparing population data. Clinical Data Exchange for Behavioral Health This project, authorized to begin in fiscal year 2014 for a duration of 17 months, was appropriated $1.4 million in All Funds for project development (Information System Improvements). The project is under budget due to vendor contracts being negotiated to less than the estimated cost but the duration has extended due to agency procurement delays. The Clinical Data Exchange for Behavioral Health (CDE4BH) project added functionality to the current state hospitals' Electronic Health Records (EHR) system including: Enabling an electronic exchange of Continuity of Care Documents (CCD) between state hospitals. Delivering/receiving CCDs to/from the DSHS Health Services Gateway (HSG) to exchange CCDs with the external Electronic Health Record systems such as those utilized by Local Mental Health Authorities (LMHAs), the entities usually responsible for providing care to clients discharged from the state hospitals. Contracts Process Improvement - eGrants The project was initiated through a Biennial Operating Plan amendment and was authorized to begin in fiscal year 2015 for a duration of 23 months. The agency estimated costs of $1.9 million in All Funds for project development. The cost decreased due to vendor contracts being negotiated to less than estimated cost in the project Business Case. The duration increased due to the agency adding additional time for testing the Invoice/Payment module. The project implemented a standardized contract process from contract signature/initiation to contract closure for sub-recipient contracts. The project is expected to reduce the contracting cycle time by 25.0 percent. The project is also expected to assist with workflow automation and monitoring and will interface with HHSC accounting and business systems to ensure data standardization. Purchased Health Services Unit & Title V Maternal Child Health System The project was initiated through a Biennial Operating Plan amendment and was authorized to begin in fiscal year 2012 for a duration of 26 months. The agency estimated costs of $3.6 million in All Funds for project development. Increases were due to two separate contract amendments that modified the scope of the project to include the procurement of document scanners and additional functionality and development for an electronic web based application for client eligibility determination and billing - Integrated Business Information System (IBIS). IBIS replaced the Automated System for Kidney Health Information Tracking system (ASKIT). The project was designed to create and implement a centralized information management system to replace two existing legacy applications: the Children with Special Health Care Needs Management Information System and the Automated System for Kidney Health Information Tracking. DSHS extended the project end date and increased the budget multiple times due to staff attrition and system failures that have resulted in delays in service to clients and providers. Agency 529 1/27/2017 58Health and Human Services Commission Quality Assurance Team HighlightsSection 3 18Women Infants and Children (WIC), WIC Information Network (WIN) 19 20Mental Health Clinical Management for Behavioral Health Services (CMBHS) Complete RoadmapThe Women Infants and Children (WIC), WIC Information Network (WIN) project is 149.0 percent over-budget and 197.0 percent over duration. Originally the project was planned to be completed in two phases over a four year period. The first phase was estimated to be $7.2 million for WIC to procure a vendor to research system alternatives, conduct a feasibility study and make recommendations for procuring or developing phase two. Phase two was to be developed in accordance to the analysis performed in phase one. The estimated costs for phase two was $17.8 million for a total cost of $25 million. The project direction has changed twice since the project began in fiscal year 2006. Originally, DSHS planned to implement a modified commercial off-the-shelf state agency model (SAM) system. At that time, the SAM system was under development by the USDA. However, due to significant delays in development, DSHS changed direction and hired a vendor to design, develop, and implement a WIC management information system in fiscal year 2010. In September 2013 DSHS realized that the vendor's project director was not actively involved in any onsite interactions to lead and guide crucial areas of the project. According to DSHS, the vendor did not provide an updated schedule as required in the contract. As a result of these actions, DSHS canceled the contract which was mutually agreed upon by both parties. Continuing the project or starting a new project was discussed internally and with the Quality Assurance Team. However, the agency determined that canceling the project would present a significant risk to federal funding. These actions caused changes in the project direction, and a new estimated completion date the project was extended to March 31, 2016. These changes and delays caused the agency to lapse capital budget authority in the 2014-15 biennium. To continue the project, the agency requires additional authority for fiscal years 2016-17. The agency executed a request to exceed for $8.3 million in Capital Authority for fiscal year 2017. On November 8, 2016 Capital Authority was provided which allows DSHS to procure a vendor to replace the current Texas WIN System with a new web-based system. This phase will also include the procurement of a Quality Assurance Contractor for Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) services. DSHS now anticipates the project will be completed in April 2018 with estimated costs of $62.1 million. Mental Health Integration The project, authorized to begin in fiscal year 2016 for a duration of 20 months, was appropriated $6.8 million in All Funds for project development. The purpose of the project is to upgrade, migrate and transform the mental health functions of the legacy Client Assignment and Registration (CARE) system by converting/migrating legacy applications to new technology. An important outcome is to ensure that the HHS agencies no longer have any direct dependency on mental health (MH) data stored or processed within the CARE application which should reduce and/or eliminate costs associated with information resources supporting mental health programs on the mainframe. The project, authorized to begin in fiscal year 2016 for a duration of 20 months, was appropriated $1.9 million in Al Funds for project development. The project will modify current mental health and substance abuse functionality within CMBHS for use in reporting performance data for Substance Abuse Recovery Support and the Texas Children Recovering from Trauma. Upgrades include the following: Tracking services and outcomes for additional mental health and substance abuse programs; support third party billing and attestations; eliminate the backlog of application change requests; and interface with the contract management system (eGrants).

This adjustment represents a 10 percent reduction of General Revenue associated with the following one-time projects: 1) Fleet Operations, 2) Regional Laundry Equipment, and 3) TIERS project costs financed through the Master Lease Payment Program. The agency indicates that this reduction will have no programmatic effects.$357,719 $357,719 0.0 $0 * No 2) Method of Finance Swap According to the agency: This item would reduce General Revenue - Dedicated appropriations for rebates in the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program by $21.1 million per fiscal year. Federal statute requires that collected rebates only be used for the WIC program or to offset costs to the federal grant. An appropriation reduction would have no impact on the program due to the availability of Federal Funds. This item would also reduce General Revenue appropriated to the agency for vendor drug rebates in Strategy D.1.6, Kidney Health Care strategy by $4.6 million and Strategy D.1.7, Children with Special Health Care Needs strategy by $0.4 million. General Revenue related to vendor drug rebates may not be expended until rebates are collected, and the client services program historically does not expend this GR. The agency proposes to reclassify these rebates from General Revenue to Appropriated Receipts. NOTE: Reducing this GR without reclassifying to Appropriated Receipts would significantly impact both programs.$52,378,829 $52,378,829 0.0 $0 * NoBiennial Reduction Amounts Agency 529 1/27/2017 148Health and Human Services Commission Summary of Ten Percent Biennial Base Reduction Options Recommendations - SenateAppendix E Priority Item Description/Impact GR & GR-D All Funds FTEsPotential Revenue LossReduction as % of Program GR/GR-D TotalIncluded in Introduced Bill?Biennial Reduction Amounts 3) Provider Rate Reductions According to the agency: This item would reduce various rates paid to providers in the 2018-19 biennium. All health and dental providers would be subject to the rate reductions except for certain primary care providers whose reimbursement levels would increase to the Medicare level pursuant to the Affordable Care Act. This reduction is expected to have a negative impact on client access to Medicaid services, as reduced reimbursement to providers could result in some providers deciding to no longer participate in the Medicaid program.

The agency anticipates that this reduction would have a significant impact on the Medicaid and CHIP programs, and on IT projects and support. The Texas Medicaid Management Information System is the largest item impacted.

The agency anticipates that the freezing of eligibility positions will impact the program's ability to maintain a low vacancy rate for eligibility determination staff. There are several external factors impacting staffing levels for eligibility determination including 1) changes in caseload or caseload mix, and 2) laws and standards for timeliness and accuracy of case decisions and benefit determination, which include federal standards that determine the receipt of bonuses or imposition of penalties.

During fiscal year 2016, HHSC has experienced a vacancy rate of approximately six percent. The majority of the reductions are in areas that support the delivery and management of client services including Medicaid, CHIP, the Office of Inspector General, and Information Technology. The agency anticipates that this reduction will cause significant disruption of services in audit and investigative activities, contract monitoring oversight, and ability to respond to technology and business needs.

Below is a summary of each component of the report, which includes an executive summary, a description of report scope, an overview of cost drivers , a description of each system, and discussion of the comparison measures used in the report. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND REPORT SCOP E Each agency population has unique demographic and health characteristics, which creates challenges for cross -agency comparisons. Each system also has differen t funding sources and plan designs. Some plans impose high deductibles while other require no cost sharing, which can greatly affect a decision about whe n, where and how often healthcare services are accessed . Overall, the analysis found that utilization measures were generally consistent; where differences emerged, they could be explained by the differing population characteri stics of the clients served by each system, or by differences in reporting methodology. With no common data source, and no centra lized actuarial review to adjust for differences in demographics, health acuity, funding, plan design, and data quality, it is difficult to draw reliable conclusions. The analysis of rei mbursement rates was excluded from this report, due to concern abou t reporting legally protected proprietary and confidential information at ERS and TRS. The report notes that publishing rates could have the unintended consequence of encouraging providers to demand the highest publi shed rate. The report also mentions th at since Medicaid has a large volume of business, it is possible for the prog ram to suppress rate increases; additionally , the report cites evidence that federal Medicare price increases stimulate private practice payer contracting costs. One positive o utcome from this effort is a strengthened relationship among the affected agencies. However, the report does not address the goal of providing improvements for efficiency and quality that could be implemented in each system. Rather, it concludes with \"nex t steps,\" including developing a more sophisticated methodology for analyzing different data sets and developing standardized comparative data. COST DRIVERS The following cost drivers have the greatest cross -agency impact. Aging M embership (p.2) Highest plan costs for ERS and TRS occur among those age 50-64 years, especially among the younger retiree population. 153 Appendix F Agency 529 1/25/2017 Specialty Drugs (p.4) Prescription drugs are a significant dri ver for ERS and TRS; there is no mention of the impact to Medicaid. Most specialty drugs are biologics ( medical products made from natural sources ) and generally there are no generics available. At ERS, specialty drugs increased from 2.7 percent of total drug plan cost in fiscal year 2001 to 31.0 percent of drug plan cost in fiscal year 2015. Infectious Diseases like Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hep atitis C (p.4) Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is at epidemic level in baby boomer population in the U.S. HCV can lead to cirrhosis which is associate d with liver cancer. The Hepatitis C drug Harvoni is the costliest drug in HealthS elect in fiscal year 2015. TDCJ has offenders with HCV and HIV . Changing Hospital Marketplace (p.4) ERS spends more on hospital costs than any other service. Reasons hospital costs are increasi ng: o Labor shortages , especially nurses o Uncompensated care , which shifts costs to existing payers o Credit issues including facility expansions and collection issues Physician owned hospitals are increasing, which focus on revenue generating specialties like cardiology or orthopedic surgery. The shift leaves commun ity hospitals without opti ons to subsidize high cost of emergency room care, obstetrics and mental health services by uninsured an d Medicaid patients. Large hospital buyouts of flagging rural and community hospitals lead to increased prices an d anti -competitive behavior. A recent example is the Wichita Falls -based system which had 90 percent market sha re of inpatient services and inpatient rates 70 percent higher than the closest competitors. (US DOJ, Office of Public Affairs, 2011). Managing High Cost Conditions (p.5) Diabetes is trending up in Texas ERS looked at cost effectiveness of prevention program. TRS C are - diabetes i s one of most common chronic conditions. TRS Active Care - diabetics cost 3 times more than the average plan cost per member. Low participation in wellness or disease management programs (p.6) Lack of incentives results in low participation in most voluntary wellness programs, increased costs to health plans and reduced member's quality of life. 154 Appendix F Agency 529 1/25/2017 SYSTEMS I. HHSC - Medicaid Offers healthcare benefits to low -income children, pregnant women, children in foster care, SSI recipients and those with disabi lities. Certain clients receive long -term services and supports. Serves 5.1 million participants. Over half of all Texas births are Medicaid -funded. Two delivery models o Managed care (STAR, STAR+PLUS, STAR Health) o Fee-for-service (FFS) - services prior to managed care organization (MCO) enrollment or carved out services , including: Case management Early childhood intervention Medical transportation Third-party administrators manage FFS, medical and pharmacy benefits. Funded by state general revenue and matching federal funds. The plan required a supplemental appropriation in fiscal year 2015. Key Cost Drivers Increasing enrollment - rose 6 .0 percent from 2011 to 2014 Aged, blind, disabled - although population repre sents 24 .0 percent of Medicaid clients in fiscal year 2015, their care is the costliest, accounting for 59 .0 percent of expenditures. II. TRS Offers healthcare benefits to active public school empl oyees (TRS -ActiveCare) and retirees (TRS -Care) and their dependents. Both plans are self -funded. Report does not capture two Medicare Advantage plans that Medicare -eligible participants can choose. TRS-ActiveCare - 428,000 participants (excludes those in health maintenance organi zation (HMO) plans) o Aetna health plan with two preferred provider plans/one exclusive provider plan; Caremark administers pharmacy benefit. o Funded by state ($900/ fiscal year /employee), school district ($1,800/ fiscal year /employee) and employee contribution s. TRS-Care - 157,000 participants (excludes those in Medicare Advantage plans) o Aetna health plan with three preferred provider plans; Express Scripts administers pharmacy benefit. o Receives state contributions (1.0 percent of payroll), retiree premiums, active public education employees (0.65 percent of p ayroll), and local school districts (0.55 percent of payroll). 155 Appendix F Agency 529 1/25/2017 o Due to rising healthcare costs, the plan required supplemental app ropriations in fiscal year s 2013, 2014, and 2015. Key Cost Drivers Specialty drug costs - TRS-Care specialty drug trend in fiscal year 2015 was 30 .0 percent; non -specialty drug trend was 13 .0 percent. Compound drugs - expansion of compound drug pharmacies drove TRS ActiveCare drug e xpenditures to $30.0 million in fiscal year 2014 (pharmacy trend to 12 .0 percent); implementation of TRS controls resu lted in $0.5 million spent in fiscal year 2015, a decline of $29.5 million from fiscal year 2014. Emergency room use - TRS-ActiveCare use of freestanding ERs has increased since fiscal year 2013, from 7.0 percent to 13 .0 percent of all ER use. A s ignificant portion of services are for non -emergency care. Impact of TRS -Care high -cost claimants - Indivi duals with claims greater than $150,000 we re the primary cost driver in fiscal year 2015. Growth o f TRS-Care population - Since fiscal year 2011, members under age 65 (ineligible for Medicare) grew by 11 .0 percent. In fiscal year 2015, 88 .0 percent of the increase in medical claims was generated by members under age 65. TRS began offering Medicare Part D coverage in 2013. Due to legislative direction to implement cost containment, s tarting January 2017, TRS will only offer Part D to memb ers who have Medicare Part A or B and who are enrolled in the two richest retiree benefit plans. TRS restructured TRS -ActiveCare in 2014 to manage costs; the current plans have higher member cost sharing with more affordable premiums than the discontinued plan. III. ERS The Group Benefits Program (GBP) covered 532,000 participants in fiscal year 2015. Ninety -five percent of employees enroll ed in HealthSelect. Fifty percent of retirees enroll ed in HealthSelect, while 50 percent enroll ed in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. ERS offers three types of health insurance plans: A self -funded point of service plan Three regional HMOs Two MA plans ERS a lso offers optional coverages, such as dental, life, and disability. As of September 1, 2016, ERS began offering a vision plan and a high -deductible health plan with a health savings account. The focus of the report is on claims data for HealthSelect, which accounts for 83 .0 percent of GBP participants (members and dependents). The t otal number of participants in fiscal year 2015 is 439,000 . o A third -party administrator, United HealthCare, manages HealthSelect benefits o Caremark administers the pharmacy benefit o The plan is self -funded, meaning that member and state contributions (not an insurance company) fund all the health care claims and bear all risk for paying for services. 156 Appendix F Agency 529 1/25/2017 o Funded by state (55 .0 percent); local/federal funds (24.8 percent); employees and retirees (14.6 percent); and other sources (7.4 percent). o HealthSelect spending in fiscal year 2015 was $2.5 billion (81 .0 percent of total). HealthSelect administrative costs are less than 3.0 percent of health plan funding. Starting in fiscal year 2011, ERS began creating Patient Centered Medical Homes (PCMH), which hav e reduced the health benefit cost trend below targets. PCMH are physician practices that focus on wellne ss, care coordination, gaps in care, and access to services. They receive an upfront care coordination fee to invest in infrastructure, such as electr onic health records. The PCMH shares in savings with the state. These practices have saved the state more than $50 .0 million, with PCMH practices earning more than $10 .0 million in shared savings payments. Key Cost Drivers Prescription drugs are the most signific ant cost driver due to industry price increases (inflation). o In fiscal year 2014, ERS saw compound drug price inflation of 250.0 percent in the first ten months; the agency took action to lower costs and reduced HealthSelect pharmacy costs by $6 .0 million per month. o Specialty drugs for complex chronic or life threatening conditions increased exponentially . o Specialty drug spending in fiscal year 2015 represented 31 .0 percent of total drug plan co st, compared to 2.7 percent in fiscal yea r 2001. o Hepatitis C drug cost is a top driver in fiscal year 2015 , and projected to increase in fiscal year 2016. The CDC warns that Hepatitis C is a hidden epidemic among baby boomers, predicting those born between 1945 and 1965 are five times more lik ely that other adults to be infected. Harvoni, an antiviral drug for Hepatitis C, rose to number one on the HealthSelect top ten costliest drugs in fiscal year 2015. However, the $85,000 treatment could prevent a costly liver transplant for appropriate c andidates. In this case, the benefits would outweigh the plan cost of the drugs. Aging GBP membership - since 1995, the retiree population has grown 144 .0 percent, while the activ e employee population has grown 2.0 percent. Member cost share for prescriptions has dropped from 39 .0 percent in fiscal year 2004 to 14 .0 percent in fiscal year 2015, while plan cost share increased. IV. TDCJ The Correctional Managed Health Care program is a partnership between the TDCJ, the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) , and the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC), and is operated under the guidance of the Correctional Managed Hea lth Care Committee. Healthcare was provided for 147,000 offenders in fiscal year 2015 o The m ajority of TDCJ offenders are young adults age 20 -44 (60 .0 percent); older adults age 45 -64 comprise 28.0 percent . o The population is highly controlled, so the type and time of medical care they receive can be influenced and restricted more than other populations in this study. o TDCJ contracts with UTMB and TTUHSC for services, including medical, dental, nursing, pharmacy, hospital and mental health se rvices. o The program is funded through state General Revenue appropriations to TDCJ, some other small revenues including offender health care fees and pharmacy rebates. o Due to rising healthcare costs, the plan required a supplemental appropriation in fiscal year 2015. 157 Appendix F Agency 529 1/25/2017 Key Cost Drivers Population growth - TDCJ receives 70,000 new offenders each year, who require medical assessments and health care treatment plans. Aging of population o Increased incidence of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, kidney fail ure and diabetes o Population of aging offende rs increased 45.6 percent from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2015 o Older offenders make up 10.8 percent of the TDCJ population, but account for 40.7 percent of hospital and specialty service c osts. Cardiovascula r diseases (hypertension and coronary artery disease) account for $2.1 m illion in drug expenditures in fiscal year 2015. Kidney failure leading to costly dialysis treatment Asthma me dications cost $2.8 million in fiscal year 2015 Risky behaviors - offender s are more likely to engage in certain behaviors leading to chronic and infectious disease o Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and He patitis C require costly medica tions/treatment HIV medications cost $ 17.5 million in fiscal year 2015 (39.3 percent of all TDCJ pharmaceutical expenditures) Hepati tis C virus cost $2 .0 million in fiscal year 2015 (4.6 percent) and dialysis (2.7 percent) Serious mental illness - 12,843 offenders were diagnosed in fiscal year 2015; the rate has r isen 39.0 percent since 2009; in fiscal year 2105, TDCJ spent $3.9 million (8.8 percent) on psychotropic drugs. Cancer treatment accounts for 2 .0 percent of total drug costs. COMPARISON ACROSS SYSTEMS The comparison u ses measures based on HEDIS (Healthcare Ef fectiveness Data and Information Set). The following analyses do not include Medicare claims, although Medicare encounters are reported for ERS HealthSelect and Medicaid dual enrollees. TRS ActiveCare and TRS Care analyses exclude Medic are encounters. The rates are calculated per 1,000 members. Total yearly expenditures by age group Several caveats are provided with the data . Using the data, calculation of average expenditure per type of client provides information for exploration; see attached worksheet. Most common diagnoses The top five diagnoses by system and age group is reported. Many of the most prevalent conditions are chronic diseases, including hypertension and diabetes. Asthma appears in three child age groups in the ERS system, but not in Medicaid children's groups. Among children, routine care such as immunizations, and respiratory/throat conditions are common. 158 Appendix F Agency 529 1/25/2017 Inpatient Utilization The inpatient utilization r ate describes the frequency with which a patient uses inpatient (such as hospital) services. The rate is very high among Medicaid recipients in the 20- 44 age group , due to the high proportion of women in this cohort, who are likely to have an inpatient ch ildbirth. Rates in Medicaid for the 45-64 and 65 -74 age groups are also much higher than other systems (rates in upper 300s versus less than 100), most likely due to a higher percentage of clients who have a disability. TRS-ActiveCare and ERS populations 64 and under have very similar inpatient stay rates because the populations are demographically similar. The average length of an inpatient stay tends to be slightly higher among the Medicaid age groups. Physician Office and Outpatient Utilization The ph ysician office and outpatient utilization rate describes the frequency with which patients visit a physician or have an outpa tient visit at a hospital (or similar) facility. In the under one year age gro up, the rate for Medicaid is one -third of the rates for TRS and ERS. The rates in every age group for TDCJ are significantly lower than all other systems. Different treatment of Medicare outpatient encounters in the data reported for this study contributes to the difference seen between rates for ERS and TRS (ERS includes them, TRS does not). In the 65 -74 age group, TRS -Care has a rate of 221, while ERS has a rate of 302. In the 75 -84 age group, TRS -Care has a rate of 313, while ERS has a rate of 563. Emergency Department (ED) Utilization The emergency department utilization rate describes the frequency with which patients use the ED for care. Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , the national rate of ED visits among babies under 1 year of age is 873; Medicaid is reported at 646. The Medicaid rate of ED utilization by adults age 20-44 (1 ,026 per 1 ,000) is higher than ERS, TRS and TDCJ, and well above the national average for calendar year 2011 of 445 per 1000. The Medicaid rate of ED utilization by adults age 45-64 (1 ,298 per 1 ,000) is higher than ERS, TRS and TDCJ, and well above the national average for calendar year 2011 of 364 per 1000. There is evidence that adult Medicaid patients use the ED as their safety net; however, this study demonstrates a comparable rate of outpatie nt use among the Medicaid, ERS and TRS adults. Discussion of reasons for high ED use in Medicaid: o Barriers of access to primary care providers (PCP) ; however, outpatient utilization rates are comparable to other systems. o EDs may have larger role than prev iously considered EDs are used to manage unscheduled high -acuity complaints despite access to a PCP; the PCP may not have incentive to receive an unscheduled patient. An emerging role for EDs is as an accelerated diagnosis center - they off er diagnostic technology like computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) , and have access to subspecialists if needed. 159 Appendix F Agency 529 1/25/2017 Management of Chronic Conditions: Asthma Asthma was chosen since it impacts patients among all four systems, affects all age groups, and both genders. The measure shows the total number by age group who were identified as having asthma and the rate at which they were appropriately prescribed me dication. o Medicaid shows rates from 40.0 percent (for age 5 -11) to 87.0 percent (for age 12 -18). o TDCJ shows rates in the mid -80 percent range. o ERS shows rates from 90 percent to 97 percent . o TRS shows rates from 94 percent to 98 percent. There is no discussion provided as to why the Medicaid rates are lower overall and in particular so low among the youngest age group. Behavioral Health Care: Follow -up After Psychiatric Hospitalization The rate of follow -up was chosen since it is related to physical health , and mental health problems can increase the risk of injury. This information can assist in improving patient outcomes as well as finding cost savings. The measu re shows the number of members six years of age and older who were hospitalized with a mental illness diagnosis who were not readmitted within 30 days, and who received a follow -up visit within 30 days. The follow -up visit is defined as a visit to a mental health practitioner or a visit to a non -behavioral health facility with a diagnosis o f mental illness. o The rate of follow -up visit is 32.4 percent for Medicaid. o The rate of follow -up visit is 67.0 percent for TRS -ActiveCare and about 60.0 percent for TRS -Retired and ERS. o The rate is 99.0 percent for TDCJ; this high follow -up rate is like ly achieved by having high control over the offender population. 160 "}
