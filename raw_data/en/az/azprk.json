Essential Oils are the life force of a plant. They are the seeds, stems, leaves and unlike meds they do not expire. Essential oils have been used for centuries and are considered to be the oldest known form of medicine. They have been used in treating many illnesses as well as overcoming emotional, spiritual and physical issues. If you are looking for a more natural way to help your family achieve a greater state of health & wellness, then Young Living's 100% therapeutic grade essential oils are for you. Why Young Living? Young Living has a seed to seal guarantee. They use low temperature steam distillation which preserves the delicate compounds of the plant and this is the key to a high quality essential oil. When distillation is done properly it passes steam through the plant material and condenses the steam to separate the oil from the plant. Young Living strictly adheres to this process. Young Living has been around since 1993 and has its own farms and distilleries. It is the world's largest line of essential oils and blends. The founder, D. Gary Young has traveled the globe discovering how to best support both physical health and emotional wellness. Gary Young established the term \"therapeutic-grade,\" now known as [Young Living Therapeutic Grade (YLTG)](http://us.ylscents.com/cherieschnieders/YLTG), as a guarantee that Young Living will only sell 100% pure, natural, uncut oils that maintain the vital therapeutic potency. His discoveries have allowed hundreds of thousands of people experience the benefits of natural healing.
