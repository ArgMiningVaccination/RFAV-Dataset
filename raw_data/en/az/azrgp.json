Others are less common like polio, but still exist throughout the world and can cause serious illness, hospitalizations and even death to people of all ages. Luckily, we have the ability to protect ourselves from 16 serious diseases during our childhood and teen years, and several additional vaccines to protect ourselves as adults. Learn more about these vaccine-preventable diseases and the vaccines that protect against them below. People in the U.S. still get sick, become disabled and even die because of vaccine-preventable diseases. Please [watch](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/why-vaccinate/personal-stories/vaccine-advocate-videos/) and read [stories](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/personal-stories) from families that were impacted, sometimes tragically, by vaccine-preventable diseases. You have the power to help protect yourself and your family.

Talk your doctor and make sure your whole family is up to date on recommended vaccines. Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is a viral infection that causes an itchy, blister-like rash. Chickenpox is very contagious to people who haven't had the disease before or been vaccinated against it. The virus [spreads mainly by touching or breathing in virus particles](https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/about/transmission.html) that come from the chickenpox blisters, and possibly through tiny droplets from infected people after they breathe or talk. Even though chickenpox is relatively mild for some people, for others it can be a very serious disease leading to severe illness with complications such as infected blisters, pneumonia, bleeding disorders, swelling of the brain, hospitalization and even death. It can be dangerous in mild cases too. When a person gets chickenpox, the virus remains in the body for life, and can reappear as [shingles](https://shotofprevention.com/2021/03/03/before-youre-down-out-get-shingles-vaccines/) once the person is older. Only a person who had the chickenpox can get shingles. Before the chickenpox vaccine was approved in the U.S., approximately 4 million people (mainly children) got sick with the disease each year. About 10,600 people were hospitalized, and 100 to 150 died every year as a result of chickenpox. Today, because of the vaccine, far fewer people are infected or hospitalized with chickenpox. Chickenpox does not only infect children. In fact, the risk of hospitalization and death from chickenpox is increased in adults. [Pregnant women and their newborns who get chickenpox](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/which-vaccines-does-my-family-need/pregnancy/before-becoming-pregnant/) are also at risk of serious health complications from chickenpox. Watch this video to find out why you never want to RSVP \"yes\" to a \"Chickenpox Party\". Chickenpox usually lasts about four to seven days. The most common symptom of the chickenpox is an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters which begin on the back, chest, and face. The blisters change to scabs in about a week. It is common to see blisters and scabs at the same time. Other signs and symptoms, which may appear one to two days before the rash starts, include: The chickenpox vaccine (also known as the varicella vaccine) is the best way to prevent chickenpox in people of all ages. Nine (9) in 10 children who get both doses will be completely protected. There is also a combination vaccine available for children called MMRV that combines the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine with the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine. For the best protection against chickenpox, your child needs to get two doses of the chickenpox vaccine. The first dose should be given between 12 and 15 months old, and the second dose is given between 4 and 6 years of age. Risk of hospitalization and death from chickenpox is increased in adults. If you are an adult who never got the chickenpox and never got the chickenpox vaccine, you need to get two doses of the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine. Chickenpox vaccination is especially important for: To make certain your family is up to date on their vaccines, check out the [CDC's recommended immunization schedules for children, teens and adults](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/child-easyread.html), and talk to your healthcare provider. COVID-19 is a disease caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, including Omicron. COVID-19 is very serious and very contagious. Since the COVID-19 pandemic first began in early 2020, there have been over 86 million COVID cases and more than 1 million deaths due to COVID in the U.S. alone. This data is as of mid-June 2022. See the latest stats from the [CDC's COVID Data Tracker.](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days) Symptoms People with COVID-19 report a variety of symptoms: Long COVID/Long Haul COVID/Chronic COVID While most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of being sick, some people experience post-COVID health conditions. Post-COVID health conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience four or more weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Even people who did not have COVID-19 symptoms in the days or weeks after they were infected with the virus can have post-COVID health conditions. These conditions are often known as \"LONG COVID\", \"LONG HAUL COVID\" or \"CHRONIC COVID\", and they can have different types and combinations of health problems for different lengths of time Medical and public health experts are also looking into a rare, but serious medical condition associated with COVID-19 called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) that can occur in both children (MIS-C) and adults (MIS-A). MIS is a health condition where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. Experts do not yet know what causes MIS. However, they do know that people with MIS had the virus that causes [COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html), or had been around someone with COVID-19. MIS can be serious, even deadly. As of mid-May 2022, over 8000 cases of MIS-C have been reported in children. Learn more about [MIS-C and its symptoms.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/children/mis-c.html) Virus Variants According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant.html), there are multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 circulating around world. Some of these variant viruses - like the Omicron variants - spread more easily and quickly than others, and some cause more serious illness. The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones against virus variants is to get vaccinated against COVID-19. COVID vaccines provide \"fully vaccinated\" people with strong protection against serious illness, hospitalization, and death due to COVID-19. While there have been breakthrough infections of COVID among people who are fully vaccinated, this is expected. COVID vaccines, like all vaccines, are not 100% effective at preventing infection. In addition, people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised due to illness or treatments may not be as protected by the vaccines as those with stronger immune systems. BUT... COVID-19 Vaccines Vaccination is the safest way to help you build protection against COVID-19. COVID-19 can have serious, life-threatening complications, and there is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you. And if you get sick - even if you have no symptoms - you could spread the disease to friends, family, and other vulnerable people around you. The COVID-19 vaccines that have been authorized/approved by the FDA and recommended by the CDC are safe and effective. The specific dosage and dose timing of the COVID vaccine depends on your age, which vaccine you get, and whether you have any health conditions. Learn more about staying up-to-date [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html). Even though COVID-19 vaccines were developed more quickly than usual, vaccine safety was - and continues to be - a top priority in all phases of vaccine development (clinical trials), authorization/approval and post-authorization/post-approval monitoring. While steps to develop the vaccines were streamlined or overlapped, none of them were skipped. If you are not vaccinated, please get the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible to protect yourself and your loved ones. Diphtheria is a bacterial disease that can cause significant complications such as injury to the heart, kidneys and other organs. It can also result in nerve damage and paralysis. The disease can be spread from an infected person (including someone who carries the bacteria but has no symptoms) by coughing and sneezing. Diphtheria can also be spread by contaminated objects like toys. Signs and symptoms of diphtheria usually begin two to five days after a person becomes infected and may include: Vaccination is the best way to protect against diphtheria. The vaccine for babies and children through 6 years old is called DTaP, and it protects against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (also known as whooping cough). The vaccine for preteens, teens, adults and pregnant women is called Tdap, and it also protects against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (whooping cough). The Td vaccine, which is a booster vaccine recommended for all adults, protects against tetanus and diphtheria. For the best protection against diphtheria, children need to receive all 5 recommended doses of the DTaP vaccine. Your child should get a dose at: The Tdap vaccine is the booster shot that helps protect preteens and teens from the same three diseases that the DTaP vaccine protects young children from. All preteens are recommended to receive one dose of Tdap when they are 11 or 12 years old. Teens who did not get the Tdap vaccine at that age should get it as soon as possible. Tdap is especially important for anyone who is in close contact with a baby younger than 12 months of age. The CDC recommends that adults get a Td booster shot every 10 years. To help protect against whooping cough, adults also need a one-time dose of Tdap vaccine. Instead of your next regular Td booster, ask your healthcare provider if you can get the Tdap vaccine instead. It's fine to get the Tdap vaccine even if you were vaccinated with Td less than 10 years ago. Being up-to-date with Tdap vaccine is especially important if you are around (or plan to be around) young children, since infants are particularly vulnerable to [whooping cough and its potentially serious complications](https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/mom/deadly-disease-for-baby.html#:~:text=In%20the%20first%206%20months,mother%20to%20help%20protect%20them). If you are caring for babies, and haven't received your one-time dose of Tdap, talk to your healthcare provider about getting this vaccine as soon as possible. The CDC recommends that all women get a dose of Tdap vaccine during the 3rd trimester (between the 27th and 36th week) of every pregnancy. This helps protect both mom and baby from whooping cough (pertussis) and its serious complications.

Haemophilus Influenzae type b (Hib) is a serious illness caused by a bacteria that most often affects children under 5 years old, requiring hospitalization in the majority of cases. The most common types of serious Hib disease are meningitis (infection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord), pneumonia (lung infection), bacteremia (blood stream infection) and epiglottitis (infection and swelling of the throat). Hib disease can cause lifelong disability and can be deadly. Adults 65 years or older, American Indians, Alaska Natives, and people with certain medical conditions (i.e., sickle cell disease, asplenia, HIV infection, antibody and complement deficiency syndromes, and cancer requiring treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or bone marrow stem cell transplant), are also at increased risk of Hib and its complications. Hib spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Usually, the Hib bacteria stay in a person's nose and throat and do not cause illness. But if the bacteria spread into the lungs or blood, the person will become very sick. Even with treatment, as many as 1 in 20 children with Hib meningitis will die. As many as 1 in 5 children who survive Hib meningitis. Hib causes different symptoms depending on which part of the body is affected. These include: For the greatest protection against Hib, all children younger than 5 years old should get all three or four recommended doses of the Hib vaccine (number of doses depends on vaccine brand). Your child needs doses at the following ages: The CDC also recommends that unvaccinated older children with certain medical conditions, and for people who receive a bone marrow transplant, get the Hib vaccine. Talk to your healthcare provider about what is best for your child's specific situation. The CDC recommends Hib vaccine for unvaccinated adults with [certain medical condition,](https://www.cdc.gov/hi-disease/about/causes-transmission.html) and for people who receive a bone marrow transplant. Talk to your healthcare provider about what is best for your specific situation. To see if your family is up-to-date on their vaccines, look at the [CDC's recommended immunization schedule](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html) for children, teens and adults, and talk to your healthcare provider. Hepatitis A is a serious disease of the liver caused by the hepatitis A virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a severe illness lasting several months. Hepatitis A is usually spread by coming into contact with people with the hepatitis A virus. Or you can get hepatitis A from coming into contact with objects, food, water or drinks that have been contaminated by the feces of a person who has the hepatitis A virus, which can easily happen if someone doesn't properly wash his or her hands after using the toilet. There are [widespread outbreaks of hepatitis A](https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2017March-HepatitisA.htm) throughout the U.S. Since 2016, 33 states have reported approximately 44,600 cases of hepatitis A, more than 27,000 hospitalizations, and approximately 423 deaths. Not all people with hepatitis A have symptoms. In fact, adults are more likely to have symptoms than children. If symptoms develop, they usually appear two to six weeks after being infected and may include: For the best, long-lasting protection against hepatitis A, the CDC recommends that all children get two doses of the hepatitis A vaccine (Hep A) starting at 1 year old. These doses should be given at least 6 months apart. If not previously vaccinated, older children and adolescents can get the Hep A vaccine after 23 months of age. Adults who have not been vaccinated previously and want to be protected against hepatitis A can get the vaccine. The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for the the following groups of unvaccinated people (1 year of age and older) who are at higher risk for hepatitis A: Learn more about vaccines recommended for [travelers, lifestyles and certain jobs](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/adults/lifestyle-jobs-and-travel/). To ensure that your entire family is up-to-date on their vaccines, check out the [CDC's recommended immunization schedules](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html) for all ages, and talk to your healthcare provider. Hepatitis B is a contagious liver disease caused by the hepatitis B virus. When a person is first infected with the virus, he or she can develop an acute (short term) infection. The severity of this infection can range from a very mild illness with few or no symptoms to a serious illness requiring hospitalization. Some people with acute infections are able to fight off the infection. For other people, hepatitis B infection remains and becomes chronic (lifelong), possibly leading to liver failure, liver cancer or cirrhosis (a condition that causes permanent scarring of the liver). According to the CDC, up to 1.89 million people in the U.S. may have chronic hepatitis B infection and each year about 3,000 people in the U.S. die from hepatitis B-related liver disease. Hepatitis B virus spreads through contact with blood, semen or other body fluids from an infected person. People can spread the virus even when they have no symptoms. A person who is unaware that they have hepatitis B can still pass the virus to others. Newborns who become infected with hepatitis B virus have a 90% chance of developing chronic hepatitis B, which can eventually lead to serious health problems including liver damage, liver cancer and even death. Babies and children can get hepatitis B: Adults can get hepatitis B through: Not all people infected with the hepatitis B virus will have symptoms. In fact, many people with a hepatitis B virus do not know they are infected since they do not feel or look sick. However, they can still spread the virus to others. Adults and children over the age of 5 years are more likely to have symptoms. Symptoms usually appear about three months after infection and can range from mild to severe, and may include: For the greatest protection against hepatitis B, children need to receive all three recommended doses of the hepatitis B vaccine (HepB). Your child needs to be vaccinated at the following ages: The Hepatitis B Birth Dose - The first HepB dose, given to your baby within 24 hours of birth, is a safety net. It helps reduce your baby's risk of getting hepatitis B from you or your friends/family members, who may not know they are infected with the disease. It's important to realize that hepatitis B is not strictly a sexually-transmitted disease and many people with hepatitis B have no idea how they got the virus. When a mom has hepatitis B, there's an additional medicine that can help protect her baby against hepatitis B, called the hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). HBIG gives the baby's body extra help in fighting the hepatitis B virus as soon as he or she is born. This shot works best when the baby gets it within the first 12 hours of his life. For the best protection, the baby also needs the full hepatitis B vaccination series. All children and adolescents younger than 19 years of age who didn't receive the Hep B vaccine when they were younger should also be vaccinated. When a pregnant woman seeks prenatal care, she will be given a blood test to check for for hepatitis B infection. This is important because women infected with hepatitis B can pass the virus to their baby during birth. As mentioned above, newborns who become infected with hepatitis B virus have a 90% chance of developing chronic hepatitis B, which can eventually lead to serious health problems including liver damage, liver cancer and even death. To help her baby fight against the hepatitis B virus, the baby will be given hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within the first 12 hours of his or her life. The baby will also be given the full hepatitis B vaccination series. The CDC recommends hepatitis B vaccine for unvaccinated adults aged 19 - 59 years and adults aged 60 years and over with risk factors for hepatitis B. Adults over age 60 without risk factors for hepatitis B may also receive a hepatitis B vaccination. Risk factors for hepatitis B virus infection include: Learn more about vaccines recommended for [travelers, lifestyles and certain jobs.](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/adults/lifestyle-jobs-and-travel/) To ensure that your entire family is up-to-date on their vaccines, check out the [CDC's recommended immunization schedules](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html) and talk to your healthcare provider. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common virus that can cause six types of cancer - cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal, penis and throat cancers [(oropharyngeal cancer). ](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/headneck.htm)HPV also causes genital warts. Around 40 million people in the U.S. are currently infected with HPV and about 13 million people, including teens, become infected with HPV each year. HPV is so common that nearly all sexually active men and women will be infected with the virus at some point in their lives without HPV vaccination. It can be passed even when an infected person has no signs or symptoms. In most cases, HPV goes away on its own and people infected with the virus never knew they had it. However, when HPV does not go away, it can lead to serious health problems such as genital warts and cancer. [According to CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/vaccine/six-reasons.html), every year in the United States, HPV causes 36,500 cancers in men and women. That's the same as the average attendance for a baseball game! The HPV vaccine could prevent approximately 90% of these cancers from ever developing, but only if given before people become exposed to the virus. Genital warts usually appear as a small bump or groups of bumps in the genital area. A healthcare provider can usually diagnose warts by looking at the genital area. HPV-related cancers usually don't have symptoms until they are quite advanced, very serious and hard to treat. [For this reason, it is important for women to get regular pap tests for cervical cancer (in addition to getting vaccinated against HPV).](http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-vaccine-fact-sheet) There is no routine screening test for HPV-associated diseases other than cervical cancer, so its important to visit your doctor regularly for checkups, and get the HPV vaccine to prevent the cancers from ever developing. Download the CDC's graphic - [Don't rely on screening to catch it later. Protect them now with HPV vaccination.](https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/hcp/hpv-important/infographic-hpv-screening-508.pdf) HPV vaccination is cancer prevention. HPV vaccination helps prevent [six types of cancers](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/infectious-agents/hpv/hpv-and-cancer-info.html) caused by HPV in both men and women. HPV vaccination can also help prevent genital warts. There is currently one licensed HPV vaccine for use in the United States called Gardasil 9. Gardasil 9 protects against 9 types of cancer-causing HPV types: 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. The CDC recommends that two doses of HPV vaccine be given to to children starting at 11-12 years of age. The vaccination series should be completed by age 13. The HPV vaccination works best when given at 11 or 12 years old. In fact, cancer protection actually decreases as the age of vaccination increases. Preteens who receive their two shots less than five months apart will require a third dose of HPV vaccine. If your teen hasn't gotten the vaccine yet, talk to their healthcare provider about getting them vaccinated as soon as possible. Teens and young adults who start the HPV vaccination series between 15 and 26 years old will need three doses of HPV vaccine. Three doses of HPV are also recommended for people with certain immunocompromising conditions between 9 and 26 years old. For the HPV vaccination series to be most effective, all vaccine doses should be given to your child before they having any type of sexual activity (before they are exposed to HPV). There is no reason to wait to vaccinate until your child reaches puberty or starts having sex. Some parents may be surprised to learn that sexual intercourse is not necessary for HPV infection. Oral-genital and hand-genital transmission of some genital HPV types is possible. And, a person can become infected during their first sexual encounter. [See the answers](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/hpv/hpv-safety-faqs.html) to commonly-asked questions about HPV vaccination. HPV vaccination is recommended for everyone through age 26 years, if not vaccinated already. Adults 27 through 45 years old (who are not already vaccinated) should speak with their healthcare provider about their risk for new HPV infections and the possible benefits of vaccination. Since HPV vaccine works best for people before they are exposed to HPV, the vaccine might not be as beneficial for this age group. HPV vaccination provides safe safe, effective and long-lasting protection. Numerous research studies have been conducted to make sure HPV vaccines are safe - both before and after the vaccines were approved/recommended for use in the U.S. Before the three HPV vaccines were licensed for use in the U.S. by the FDA, each went through years of testing in thousands of people through [clinical trials](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/VYFInfographic-clinicaltrials-4-23-21.png). After being licensed, the CDC and FDA have continued to monitor the safety of the HPV vaccines through the vaccine safety monitoring systems in the U.S. ( [VAERS](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), [VSD](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vsd/index.html) and [CISA](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/cisa/index.html)). Since the vaccine's introduction in 2006, vaccine safety monitoring and studies conducted by CDC, FDA, and other organizations have documented a good safety record for HPV vaccines. There is no current evidence that HPV vaccines cause fertility problems in women. As part of ongoing safety monitoring of HPV vaccines, CDC has reviewed reports of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), also known as \"premature menopause,\" in [the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html) after both Gardasil 9 and Gardasil vaccination. CDC has also conducted additional safety research on the HPV vaccine in the [ Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD).](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vsd/index.html) [Learn more](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/hpv/hpv-safety-faqs.html) this research. Over 120 million doses of HPV vaccines have been distributed in the U.S. so far and HPV vaccines continue to have a [good safety record](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/hpv/hpv-safety-faqs.html). Like any vaccine or medicine, HPV vaccines can cause side effects, but the most common side effects are mild. They include pain, redness or swelling in the arm where the shot was given; dizziness; fainting; nausea; and headache. The benefits of HPV vaccination far outweigh any potential risk of side effects. To ensure that your entire family is up-to-date on their vaccines, check out the [CDC's recommended immunization schedules](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/index.html) for children, preteens/teens and adults, and talk to your healthcare provider. Flu is a serious, and potentially deadly disease, caused by a virus. It is not the same as the common cold or what people refer to as the \"stomach flu.\" Visit CDC's [FluView](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm) for the latest flu activity. Flu spreads through the air when infected people cough, sneeze or talk, and other people nearby breathe in the virus. In fact, people with flu can spread it to others up to about 6 feet away. The flu virus can also be spread to adults and children when a person wipes their eyes or puts their hands in their mouth or nose after touching a surface that has flu virus on it. Flu spreads quickly through communities as the virus passes from person to person. The flu season is unpredictable, but it often occurs from October to May and usually peaks in January or February. Yearly flu vaccination is recommended for everyone 6 months and older by the end of October if possible. Although vaccination later in the season can still be beneficial. It takes your body 2 weeks to build up immunity (protection) following vaccination, so it's best to get vaccinated before flu starts spreading in your community. The CDC estimates that each year in the U.S., flu results in 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000 to 52,000 deaths. In addition, more than 20,000 children under the age of 5 are hospitalized and approximately 100 children (often more) die as a result of the flu each year. Sadly, during the 2019-20 flu season, 199 [children died](https://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/PedFluDeath.html) due to flu, which was the highest number ever recorded - except for the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic. During the 2020-21 flu season, 1 child died as a result of flu. (The lower number of flu death is likely due to the prevention methods that were used by many people during the COVID pandemic.) Over 2,000 children in the U.S. have lost their lives to flu since 2004 (when reporting of child flu deaths first began). Flu usually comes on suddenly. People who have flu often feel some or all of these symptoms: View the [ emergency warning signs of flu in infants, children and adults.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/symptoms.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu%2Fconsumer%2Fsymptoms.htm) If you or a loved one are experiencing these warning signs, get medical care right away. Your healthcare provider may prescribe antiviral drugs that can be used to treat flu illness, but in order to be effective it's very important to take these medications within 48 hours of the onset of your flu symptoms. [Learn more](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/whatyoushould.htm) about antivirals and their benefits. You may be able to spread flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick. Serious complications of flu can result in hospitalization or death, even in healthy people. However, some groups of people are at even higher risk for complications: A yearly flu vaccine is the best line of defense against flu. The CDC recommends a yearly (seasonal) flu vaccine for everyone 6 months and older, preferably by the end of October although flu vaccination later in the season can still be beneficial. It usually takes about two weeks after getting vaccinated for your body to build up immunity, so it's important to get vaccinated before flu starts spreading in your community. Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk from flu and its serious complications. Every year, new flu vaccines are created to protect against the four flu viruses that research suggests will be most common during the upcoming flu season. All flu vaccines, regardless of how they are created, protect against the same four flu viruses. There are injectable flu vaccines (commonly known as flu shots) that are made using egg-based, cell-based, and recombinant technologies. There is also a nasal spray flu vaccine. To figure out which flu vaccine may be best for you and your family, it's important to talk to a trusted healthcare provider. Neither the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/flushot.htm) nor [AAP](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Prepare-Your-Family-for-Flu-Season.aspx) recommend one type of flu vaccine over another. [ Learn more](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaxsupply.htm) about the different flu vaccines available for the 2021-22 season. People with a history of egg allergies can receive a flu vaccine under the following conditions: [Learn more](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/egg-allergies.htm) about flu vaccines for people with egg allergies. Even though the effectiveness of the flu vaccine varies season to season and in different age groups, scientific studies show us that getting the flu vaccine can still give you and your family members important, lifesaving benefits. It can: Visit your healthcare provider or pharmacist to get flu vaccines for your family every flu season. The CDC recommends that all children (6 months of age and older) should get a flu vaccine every year. Getting sick with the flu can cause serious problems for a pregnant person and their baby. If you are pregnant during flu season, the CDC and [pregnancy experts agree](https://www.acog.org/programs/immunization-for-women/activities-initiatives/immunization-for-pregnant-women-a-call-to-action) that the best way to protect both yourself and your baby from the flu is to get vaccinated. Pregnant individuals who get a flu vaccine are also helping to protect their babies from serious flu illness for the first several months after birth. Since infants cannot be vaccinated against the flu until they are 6 months old, it is also important that everyone who will be around a newborn be vaccinated against the flu. Flu shots have been given to millions of pregnant people over many years. Flu vaccinations are monitored for safety through the U.S. vaccine safety systems including VAERS, VSD and CISA. Studies show that flu shots are SAFE during any trimester for both pregnant individuals and their babies. [Learn more](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/which-vaccines-does-my-family-need/pregnancy/before-becoming-pregnant/vaccines-during-pregnancy/) about flu vaccination during pregnancy. It is also safe for people to get the flu vaccine while breastfeeding. In fact, breastfeeding also helps to protect babies because breast milk passes your antibodies to your baby, and these antibodies help fight off infection. If you missed getting the flu shot while you were pregnant, it is important to get vaccinated before leaving the hospital. All adults should get a flu vaccine every year. Even healthy adults of all ages can become seriously ill from the flu. In fact, flu and pneumonia, a common complication of flu, are ranked as the [9th leading cause of death in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/leading-causes-of-death.htm) By vaccinating everyone in your family, every year, you can help protect yourself and your loved ones from becoming sick and dying from the flu. Flu also takes a toll on the U.S. economy, resulting in a [yearly economic burden of $83 billion and 17 million missed workdays every year](https://www.cdc.gov/workplacehealthpromotion/health-strategies/flu-pneumonia/index.html). Getting a flu vaccine can help keep you and your family healthy so that you don't miss work or school. Studies have shown that flu vaccination is very important for people with [ certain chronic conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/index.htm) as they are at higher risk of serious flu illness, flu-related complications, hospitalization and dying. Additionally, because immune defenses weaken as we get older, people 65 years and older also need to make sure they get a flu vaccine every year. The CDC estimates that between 70-90% of flu-related deaths and between 50-70% of flu-related hospitalizations occur in people 65 years and older. Flu vaccination has been [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28525597) to reduce flu illness and serious flu-related complications, including hospitalization and death, in older people. Although the CDC doesn't recommend one flu vaccine over another, [there are flu vaccines (high dose and adjuvanted) that were designed specifically for people 65 years of age and older](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/65over.htm#anchor_1554994347538). Talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist to confirm which flu vaccine is right for you. In 2019, 1,282 cases of measles in 31 states were reported to the CDC. This is the greatest number of cases in the U.S. since 1992 when 963 cases were reported for the entire year. Of those who got measles in 2019, 128 were hospitalized and 61 reported having complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis. 2019 outbreaks in the U.S. were due to: As of December 15, 2022, 106 measles cases have been reported to CDC in five jurisdictions. Visit the [CDC website ](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html)for the latest number of cases and more information. Some people think of measles as just a rash and fever that clears up in a few days, but the fact is that measles can cause serious health complications, especially in: The disease kills hundreds of thousands of children each year around the world, most under the age of 5. There is no way to tell in advance how severe your child's symptoms will be. Measles spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. A person with measles can be contagious 4 days BEFORE their rash develops (as well as 4 days after). Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, up to 9 of 10 people around them will also become infected if they are not protected. Measles signs and symptoms appear 7 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Signs and symptoms of measles typically include: Download [this handout](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/downloads/measles-infographic.pdf) from CDC, AAP and AAFP that lists the symptoms of measles. If you suspect you or one of your family members has been exposed to measles, do not go to your doctor or healthcare provider. Instead, call them and explain the situation. Measles is highly contagious, and you could infect others in the waiting room and/or while traveling to and from the doctor's office, if you have been exposed to the disease. Your healthcare provider will be able to tell you the next steps to take to protect yourself, your family and your community. For the best protection against measles, your children need to receive the two recommended doses of the MMR vaccine. One dose of MMR vaccine is about 93% effective at preventing measles, and two doses are about 97% effective. The first dose should be given between 12 and 15 months and the second dose should be given between 4 and 6 years of age. Children can receive the second dose earlier, as long as it is at least 28 days after the first dose. [According to CDC,](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/index.html) if there are many measles cases occurring among infants younger than 12 months old in your community, your local immunization program and/or healthcare provider may recommend MMR vaccination of infants as young as 6 months old, as a way to control the outbreak. Please note that children vaccinated before their first birthday still need two more doses of MMR vaccine (one dose at 12 -15 months of age and a second dose at least 28 days later). MMR vaccine is given later than some other childhood vaccines because antibodies transferred from mom to baby can provide some protection from disease and make the MMR vaccine less effective until about 1 year of age. If you are traveling internationally with children, please see the CDC's recommendations below. According to the CDC, if you were born after 1957, you need at least 1 dose of measles vaccine vaccine, UNLESS a laboratory confirmed that you had past measles infection or are immune to measles. Certain adults may need 2 doses of MMR vaccine, including: If you're not sure whether you are up to date on measles vaccination, talk with your healthcare provider. According to the CDC, if you know that you got the \"killed\" version of the measles vaccine (an earlier formulation of measles vaccine that is no longer used) in the 1960s, you should talk to your doctor about getting revaccinated with the current, live MMR vaccine. Not many people fall into this group; the \"killed\" version of the vaccine was given to less than 1 million people between 1963 and 1968. Also, most people don't know if they got the killed vaccine during this time. If you're unsure whether you fall into this group, you could ask your doctor to test your blood to determine whether you're immune. Or you can just get a dose of MMR vaccine. There is no harm in getting another dose of MMR vaccine, even if you are already immune to measles (or mumps or rubella). If you're unsure whether you're immune to measles, you should first try to find [your vaccination records](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/vaccination-records.html) or documentation of measles immunity. If you do not have written documentation of measles immunity, you should get vaccinated with the MMR vaccine. Another option is to have a doctor test your blood to determine whether you're immune, but this option will take two doctor's visits. There is no harm in getting another dose of MMR vaccine, even if you are already immune to measles (or mumps or rubella). No. If you got two doses of measles/MMR vaccine as a child, according to the U.S. vaccination schedule, the CDC considers you to be protected for life against measles. Again, if you're not sure whether you are fully vaccinated, talk with your doctor. The CDC states that healthcare personnel should have documented [evidence of immunity](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/index.html#immunity), according to the [recommendations of the ACIP](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6007.pdf). Healthcare personnel without evidence of immunity should get 2 doses of MMR vaccine, separated by at least 28 days. People 6 months of age and older who will be traveling internationally should be protected against measles. Before any international travel, the [CDC recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travelers.html): To ensure that your entire family is up-to-date on their vaccines, check out the [CDC's recommended immunization schedules](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/index.html) and talk to your healthcare provider. Meningococcal disease is a bacterial illness that can become very serious, very quickly. It often strikes without warning - even in healthy people. The two most severe and common forms of meningococcal disease are meningitis and septicemia. Meningitis is an infection of the fluid and lining around the brain and spinal cord and can lead to brain damage, hearing loss, learning disabilities, and even death. Septicemia is a bloodstream infection, which can lead to loss of an arm or leg and even death. Even with treatment, about 1 out of 10 people with meningococcal disease will die, sometimes within 24 hours after showing symptoms. Of those who survive, about 1 to 2 will have permanent disabilities such as brain damage, hearing loss, loss of kidney function or loss of limbs. Approximately 600 -1,000 people get meningococcal disease in the U.S. each year. The bacteria that causes this infection can spread when people have close or lengthy contact with someone's saliva, such as through kissing; coughing or sneezing; sharing utensils and drinks; and living in close quarters. Children under 1 year old, teens and young adults are at increased risk for meningococcal disease. There are five major serogroups of meningococcal disease: A, C, W, Y and B. One-third of meningococcal disease cases in the U.S. are serogroup B. Serogroup B meningococcal disease is the most common cause of disease in adolescents and young adults, and has caused [several outbreaks on college campuses](http://shotofprevention.com/2014/03/17/meningitis-outbreaks-amidst-college-students) in recent years. [Learn more](http://www.nmaus.org/) about meningococcal disease and outbreaks. It's easy to mistake the early signs and symptoms of meningococcal disease for the flu. Signs and symptoms may develop over several hours or over one or two days, and may include: The symptoms of meningococcal disease are the same for all of the serogroups. There are two vaccines that protect against meningococcal disease: The CDC recommends that all adolescents receive two doses of the MenACWY vaccine. Your child needs the first dose at 11-12 years old, with a second \"booster\" dose at 16 years old. Less than one-third of children who received the first dose of MenACWY have received the second \"booster\" dose, so please talk to your healthcare provider to determine if your child is up-to-date. In addition, the CDC recommends MenACWY for children who are between 2 months and 10 years old, if they: The CDC also recommends MenB vaccine for children 10 years or older, if they: MenB vaccine may also be given to anyone 16-23 years old to provide short-term protection against most strains of serogroup B meningococcal disease. Meningococcal vaccines are recommended for certain groups of adults at increased risk for meningococcal disease. Adults should get MenACWY vaccine if they: Adults should get MenB vaccine if they: To ensure that your entire family is up-to-date on their vaccines including meningococcal, check out the [CDC's recommended immunization schedules](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html) and talk to your healthcare provider. Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus. It is spread from person to person through coughing and sneezing and through close contact (even regular conversation) with infected people. The primary, and best known, sign of mumps is swollen salivary glands that cause the cheeks to puff out. While usually a mild disease, mumps can also cause complications such as meningitis (swelling of the brain and spinal cord) and deafness. In addition, about one out of every four teenage or adult men who get mumps will develop a painful swelling of the testicles which can, although rarely, lead to sterility. [Outbreaks in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html) continue to put people at risk of mumps and its complications. Since 2016, there have been over 19,000 cases of mumps, which were mainly reported on college campuses where people live in close contact. View [Mumps Outbreak-Related Questions and Answers.](https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks/outbreak-patient-qa.html) Some children infected with the mumps virus have either no signs or symptoms or very mild ones. When signs and symptoms do develop, they usually appear about two to three weeks after exposure to the virus and may include: Vaccination provides the best protection against mumps. There are two mumps-containing vaccines available in the U.S. - the MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. and varicella (chickenpox). For the best protection against mumps, the CDC recommends that children get two doses of MMR vaccine: Children may also receive the MMRV vaccine. The CDC recommends that children get one dose of MMRV vaccine at 12 through 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age. Your child's healthcare provider can help you decide whether to use the MMRV or MMR vaccine. The CDC recommends that students at post-high school educational institutions who do not have [evidence of immunity](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/index.html#immunity) need two doses of MMR vaccine, separated by at least 28 days. The CDC recommends that adults who do not have [evidence of immunity](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/index.html#immunity) should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine. Mumps remains a common disease in many parts of the world. Anyone who is not protected against mumps is at risk of getting infected when they travel internationally. Before traveling internationally, the CDC recommends that people should be protected against mumps: To ensure that your entire family is up-to-date on their vaccines, check out the [CDC's recommended immunization schedules for children, adolescents and adults](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/index.html), and talk to your healthcare provider. Mpox (formerly monkeypox) is a rare disease caused by infection with the mpox virus. It is related to the viruses that cause smallpox and cowpox, but not related to chickenpox. Despite the name \"monkeypox\" the source of the disease is unknown. The first human case of mpox was recorded in 1970, and mpox has been reported in relatively low numbers on an ongoing basis since then in some countries. Mpox is milder than smallpox and is rarely fatal. Learn more about mpox [here](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/faq.html). As of Summer 2022, the CDC is tracking an outbreak of mpox that has spread across several countries that don't normally report mpox, including the United States. Find a map of the current outbreak [here](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/us-map.html). The current outbreak is mostly impacting people who have reported having close, sustained physical contact with other people who have mpox. While many of those affected in this outbreak are men who have sex with men, anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has mpox can get the illness. The symptoms of mpox infection include: The illness typically lasts 2-4 weeks. Sometimes, people get a rash first followed by other symptoms. Others only experience the rash. See photos of mpox and learn more about symptoms [here](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/symptoms.html). There are available vaccines to prevent mpox. In consultation with their healthcare provider, people at higher risk for infection may consider vaccination. The mpox vaccines can also prevent infection if given immediately after exposure to an infected person. Vaccines are being distributed by states to health clinics and vaccination centers, so consult your healthcare provider or contact your [state or local healthcare department](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/find-health-department/). People at higher risk include anyone who: Read more about [mpox vaccination and the available vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/considerations-for-monkeypox-vaccination.html). And how to [prevent the spread of mpox](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/prevention.html). Pneumococcal disease is caused by a bacteria called pneumococcus. Pneumococcal disease, which is spread by coughing and sneezing, is common in young children, but older adults are at greatest risk of serious illness and death. Types of pneumococcal disease include pneumonia (lung infection), meningitis, bloodstream infections (bacteremia and sepsis), middle ear infections and sinus infections. Pneumonia is the most common form of pneumococcal disease in adults. It is estimated that more than 150,000 hospitalizations from pneumococcal pneumonia occur annually among adults in the U.S. and about 5 - 7% of those who are hospitalized from it will die. Adults 65 years or older are at increased risk for pneumococcal disease. In addition, some adults 19 through 64 years old are also at increased risk, including those: According to the CDC, each year in the United States, pneumococcus causes thousands of cases of pneumonia and ear infections. Additionally, about 2,000 cases of serious pneumococcal disease occur each year in children under 5 in the U.S. These illnesses can lead to disabilities such as deafness, brain damage, or loss of arms or legs. About 1 in 12 children who get pneumococcal meningitis will die. About 1 in 5 children with bacteremia will die. Since there are more than 90 known types of pneumococcal bacteria that cause disease, a previous pneumococcal infection will not protect you from getting the disease again. Therefore, pneumococcal vaccines are still recommended for people who have had pneumococcal disease in the past. Symptoms depend on the type of pneumococcal disease, but generally include fever and/or chills. Additional symptoms may include: Pneumococcal vaccines are the best way to prevent pneumococcal disease in children, teens and adults. There are three types of pneumococcal vaccine available in the U.S. - pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV13, PCV15 and PCV20) and pneumococcal PPSV23). The CDC recommends pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV13) for all children younger than 2 years old. For the best protection children need to receive all four recommended doses of the PCV13 vaccine. Your child will need one dose at each of the following ages: The CDC also recommends that children 2 -18 years old with certain medical conditions get a dose of PCV13 and a dose of PPSV23. The CDC recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all adults 65 years or older and younger adults (19-64 years) with specific medical conditions. In January 2022, the CDC made new pneumococcal vaccine recommendations for adults based on two new, FDA-approved pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV15 and PCV20). Specifically, adults who have never received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine should receive PCV15 or PCV20 if they are: If PCV15 is used, it should be followed by a dose of PPSV23. Learn more about these new [CDC recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/pneumo.html) for PCV15 and PCV20. *It is also important to get a [flu shot](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/vaccines-diseases/current-flu-season/) every year because having the flu increases your chances of getting pneumococcal pneumonia. To ensure that your entire family is up-to-date on their vaccines, check out the [CDC's recommended immunization schedules](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/index.html) and talk to your healthcare provider. Polio is a potentially crippling and deadly disease caused by a virus that spreads from person to person. It can invade the brain and spinal cord resulting in paralysis. Before the polio vaccine was available, an average of 50,000 cases were reported in the United States each year. Polio was one of the most dreaded childhood diseases of the 20th century with annual epidemics, primarily during the summer months. This often left thousands of victims \u2014 mostly children \u2014 permanently in braces, crutches, wheelchairs or in iron lungs. Because polio can paralyze the diaphragm, in the 1940s and 1950s, entire wards of hospitals housed polio victims who were dependent on large iron lungs to breathe for them. Although the U.S. has been successful at eliminating polio it is still occurring in parts of the world and therefore we must continue to vaccinate to protect our children. Learn more about [Rotary's efforts](https://www.endpolio.org/) to eliminate rotary around the world. Polio can cause paralysis. Signs of paralytic polio may include: Polio does not always cause paralysis, and people with polio don't always show symptoms. If symptoms of nonparalytic polio appear, they may include: Since polio has no cure, polio vaccination is the best way to protect children and the only way to stop the disease from spreading. There are two types of vaccine that can prevent polio - inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and oral polio vaccine (OPV). Since 2000, only IPV has been used in the U.S.; however, OPV is still used throughout most of the world. For the most protection against polio, your children need to receive all of the recommended doses of the polio vaccine. The CDC recommends four doses of IPV for children at: To see if your children and the rest of your family are up-to-date on their vaccines, look at the [CDC's immunization schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/index.html) and talk to your healthcare provider. RSV is a common respiratory virus that usually spreads seasonally. It is most serious in infants, older adults, and those with compromised immune systems. Almost all children will get an RSV infection by the time they are 2 years old. It can be particularly severe in premature infants, infants younger than 6 months, and young children with pre-existing health conditions. However, approximately [75% of infants hospitalized for RSV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107566/) are not born prematurely and don't have underlying medical conditions. In the U.S., RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization in children younger than one year old. In older adults - especially those age 65 years and older - RSV causes upwards of [120,000 hospitalizations and 10,000 deaths](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/rsv/rsv-in-adults#:~:text=RSV%20is%20the%20most%20common,10%2C000%20dies%20from%20RSV%20infection.) every year in the U.S. Those at highest risk of severe outcomes related to RSV include older adults with chronic heart or lung disease, and/or weakened immune systems. Common symptoms of RSV include: If someone is sick and having difficulty breathing, seek medical attention right away. Additional warning signs include blue lips or face, irritability, decreased activity, decreased appetite, and apnea (temporary stopping of breathing). RSV can lead to bronchiolitis (inflammation in the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia (infection in the lung). As of summer 2023, there are new tools to prevent RSV. After review by independent experts at the FDA and CDC, immunizations are now available for some of the most high risk groups. Adults 60 and older can be vaccinated against RSV. [Learn more about the RSV vaccine for older adults](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/rsv.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20adults%2060%20years,same%20time%20as%20other%20vaccines.). Infants during their first RSV season and high-risk young children during their second RSV season can now receive a long-acting monoclonal antibody that provides immunity for up to a year. [Learn more about immunizing babies and young children against RSV](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/p-0803-new-tool-prevent-infant-hospitalization-.html). Rotavirus is a virus that causes diarrhea and vomiting in young children. It can lead to severe dehydration, which if not treated, can be deadly. Before the rotavirus recommendation in the United States in 2006, almost every child was infected with the virus by age 5, sending 200,000 children to the emergency room; causing 55,000 to 70,000 hospitalizations; and 20 to 60 deaths. Each year, rotavirus continues to cause an estimated 453,000 deaths among infants around the world each year. After a child has been infected with rotavirus, it takes about two days for symptoms to appear. Symptoms may include: In adults who are otherwise healthy, a rotavirus infection may cause only mild signs and symptoms \u2014 or none at all. For the best protection against rotavirus, children need to receive all recommended doses (2 or 3 doses depending on vaccine brand) of the rotavirus vaccine. Your child needs doses at: To see if your children are up-to-date on their vaccines, look at the [CDC's immunization schedule](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html) and talk to your healthcare provider. Rubella, also called German measles, is a contagious viral infection best known by its distinctive red rash. The virus can spread to others through coughing and sneezing. While the disease is usually mild in children and adults, rubella can be very dangerous for pregnant women and their babies. If a pregnant woman is infected with the disease it can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, and/or birth defects such as heart problems, hearing and vision loss, intellectual disabilities, and liver or spleen damage. This group of health problems is called congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). According to the CDC, before the rubella vaccine was introduced in 1969, widespread outbreaks usually occurred every 6 to 9 years in the U.S. Between 1962 and 1965, rubella infections during pregnancy were estimated to have caused 30,000 stillbirths and 20,000 children to be born impaired or disabled. In 2004, the CDC announced that both the congenital and acquired forms of rubella had been eliminated in the U.S. However, the U.S. continues to vaccinate to prevent the possibility of rubella being brought in from countries where it is still common. The symptoms of rubella are often so mild they're difficult to notice, especially in children. If symptoms do occur, they generally appear two to three weeks after exposure to the virus and last two to three days. Symptoms may include: For the best protection against rubella, children need to receive the two recommended doses of the MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, and rubella). Your child needs doses at: Children may also receive the MMRV vaccine, which includes protection against chickenpox (varicella). Talk to your child's healthcare provider to see which vaccine - MMR or MMRV - is best for them. Rubella is dangerous for a pregnant woman leading to miscarriage or having a baby born with birth defects. So, if you are thinking of becoming pregnant, please talk to your healthcare provider about getting vaccinated if you are not already immune. For more information, please visit the [Pregnancy](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/which-vaccines-does-my-family-need/pregnancy/before-becoming-pregnant/) section. To ensure that your entire family is up-to-date on their vaccines, check out the [CDC's recommended immunization schedules](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/index.html) and talk to your healthcare provider. Shingles (also known as herpes zoster) is a painful rash with blisters. The rash usually appears on one side of a person's face or body. According to the CDC, 1 out of every 3 people in the U.S. will develop shingles and there are about 1 million cases of the disease each year in the United States. Shingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus, which is the same virus that causes chickenpox. You can only get shingles if you had chickenpox. After you recover from chickenpox, the virus stays in your body and goes \"to sleep\" in the roots of the nerves. In some people, the virus stays that way, but for many others, the virus \"wakes up\" many years later and causes shingles. Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another, but the virus can spread from a person infected with shingles to cause chickenpox in someone who never had [ chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/vaccines-diseases/?acc=Chickenpox%20(Varicella)). The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear or once the blisters have crusted over. The risk of someone with shingles spreading the virus to others is low if the rash is covered. Even children can get shingles. Your risk of shingles increases as you get older and it is much more common in people 60 years of age and older. Shingles is also more common in people whose immune systems are weakened due to a disease such as cancer or HIV, or medications/therapies like steroids or chemotherapy. Symptoms for shingles usually start as pain, itching or tingling in the area where the rash will develop. This may happen anywhere from 1 to 5 days before the rash appears. Once the rash develops, it is most commonly a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body. In other cases, the rash appears on one side of the face. The rash will contain blisters filled with fluid that usually scab over in 7 to 10 days. The rash often clears up within 2 to 4 weeks. In rare cases (usually among people with weakened immune systems), the rash may be more widespread and look similar to a chickenpox rash. Visit the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/about/photos.html) to see photos of people infected with shingles. Other possible symptoms of shingles include fever, headache, chills and upset stomach. The risk of hospitalization and death from chickenpox is increased in adults. The most common complication of shingles is post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). People with PHN have severe pain in the areas where they had the shingles rash after (at least 90 days) the rash clears up. The pain from PHN usually goes away in a few weeks or months; however, for some people, the pain from PHN can last for years and may interfere with their everyday life. As people get older, they are more likely to develop PHN, and the pain is more likely to be severe. PHN rarely occurs in people under 40 years old. In addition to PHN, shingles may lead to serious complications involving the eye. Very rarely, shingles can lead to pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain inflammation or death. The shingles vaccine (also called the zoster vaccine and including brand names RZV, Shingrix) is the best way to help prevent shingles and its complications. The shingles vaccine reduces the risk of shingles and PHN by more than 90% in people 50 and older. The CDC recommends that healthy adults 50 years and older get vaccinated with 2 doses of the shingles vaccine to prevent shingles and its related health complications. In January 2022, the CDC started recommending two doses of the shingles vaccine for people 19 years and older who are immunocompromised, either due to disease or medication/therapy. [Learn more.](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7103a2.htm) Side Effects from the Shingles Vaccine Studies show that the shingles vaccine is safe. The vaccine helps your body create a strong defense against shingles. As a result, you may have some short-term side effects from getting the shots. For some people (about 1 in 6 people), the side effects may affect your ability to do normal daily activities for 2 to 3 days. Common Short-Term Side Effects: (You MAY get one or more of these side effects or you may not get any.) These side effects should go away on their own in about 2 to 3 days. Side effects are more common in younger people. Several antiviral medicines are available to treat shingles, and can help shorten the duration of the rash and reduce pain. To be most effective, people with shingles should start taking antiviral medicines as soon as possible after the rash appears. People who think they might have shingles should call their healthcare provider as soon as possible to discuss treatment options. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for PHN. Commonly known as lockjaw, tetanus is a severe disease that causes stiffness and spasms of the muscles. Up to 20% of reported tetanus cases end in death. Unlike other vaccine-preventable diseases, which are transferred from person to person, tetanus bacteria are found in places such as soil/dirt, dust, and manure. Therefore, the disease will never be eradicated. The bacteria enter the body through any break in the skin, such as a cut or a puncture wound. A person can also be infected after a burn or animal bite. There's no cure for tetanus. Treatment focuses on managing complications until the effects of the tetanus toxin resolve. Almost all cases of tetanus are in people who haven't been vaccinated, or those who completed their childhood series but did not receive a booster dose in the last 10 years. Fatality is highest in people who haven't been immunized. Common signs and symptoms of tetanus, in order of appearance, are: Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent tetanus. For the best protection, children need to receive all five recommended doses of the DTaP vaccine. DTaP protects against three diseases - diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough (also known as pertussis). Your child needs doses at: Babies and children under 6 years old who should not get whooping cough vaccines (for specific medical reasons) can [receive a DT vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/vaccination.html) for protection against diphtheria and tetanus. The Tdap vaccine is the booster shot that helps protect preteens and teens from the same three diseases that the DTaP vaccine protects young children from. All preteens are recommended to receive one dose of Tdap when they are 11 or 12 years old. Teens who did not get the Tdap vaccine at that age should get it as soon as possible. Tdap is especially important for anyone who is in close contact with a baby younger than 12 months of age. Vaccine protection for whooping cough (pertussis), tetanus, and diphtheria fades with time. Therefore, the CDC recommends a single dose of Tdap vaccine for all adults 19 years of age and older who have not previously received a Tdap vaccine. The CDC also recommends adults receive a tetanus and diphtheria booster (called Td) every 10 years. The easiest thing for adults to do is to get Tdap one time instead of their next regular Td booster. You can get the dose of Tdap earlier than the 10-year mark, so talk to your healthcare provider during your next appointment. Being up-to-date with one dose of Tdap is especially important for adults who are around babies. Women should get a dose of Tdap during the 3rd trimester of every pregnancy to protect themselves and their newborns against whooping cough. Infants are most at risk for severe, life-threatening complications from whooping cough.

Whooping cough (also known as pertussis) is a very contagious disease. People of all ages can get whooping cough, but the disease can be very dangerous for babies, as they are at particularly high risk of serious complications, hospitalization and death. In the first 6 months of life, babies are at high risk for complications from whooping cough, even if they are healthy. Whooping cough spreads easily through coughing or sneezing or by just sharing breathing space. Since the symptoms of whooping cough can vary, some people with whooping cough may just have a mild cough or what seems like a common cold, and they can end up spreading it to babies they are in close contact with. In fact, most unvaccinated children living with a family member with whooping cough will get the disease. Whooping cough is still common in the United States, and outbreaks still occur putting children at great risk. According to the CDC, there are about 15,000 to 40,000 cases of whooping cough and up to 20 deaths each year in the U.S. In many children, whooping cough is a severe hacking cough followed by a high-pitched intake of breath that sounds like a [\"whoop.\"](http://www.whoopingcough.net/cough-child-muchwhooping.wav) However, some babies with whooping cough don't cough at all. Instead they may have a hard time breathing, or even stop breathing for short periods. Symptoms usually take between 1 and 3 weeks to appear. They're usually mild at first and resemble those of a common cold. After a week or two, signs and symptoms worsen. Thick mucus accumulates inside the airways causing uncontrollable, severe coughing. Violent coughing fits may cause: Preteens, teens and adults with whooping cough may have coughing spells that last for weeks or months. However, the \"whoop\" sound may not be there and the illness is generally less severe than in young children, especially in those people who were previously vaccinated against whooping cough. In fact, some preteens/teens and adults who get pertussis may not even know they have the disease. Vaccination is the best way to protect people of all ages, especially infants and young children, from whooping cough. The pertussis vaccine is combined with vaccines that protect against diphtheria and tetanus. For babies and young children, this vaccine is called DTaP. For preteens, teens, adults and pregnant women, the vaccine is called Tdap. For the best protection against whooping cough, your child needs all 5 recommended doses of the DTaP vaccine. Your child should receive doses at: The Tdap vaccine is the \"booster\" shot that helps protect preteens and teens from tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (whooping cough). All preteens are recommended to receive one dose of Tdap when they are 11-12 years old. Teens who did not get the Tdap vaccine at that age should get it as soon as possible. Tdap is especially important for anyone who is in close contact with a baby younger than 12 months of age, since infants and young children are at higher risk for serious whooping cough complications. All adults (19 years and older) who have not yet received one dose of Tdap as a preteen, teen or adult, need to get a Tdap vaccine, which protects against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (whooping cough). This vaccine will not only protect you from these diseases, but will also help protect those around you from getting sick. This is especially important, if you are planning to be around any babies, who are at high risk of serious complications from whooping cough. So, if you don't remember getting a Tdap vaccine, you should ask your healthcare provider. After that, adults need a Td vaccine (tetanus and diphtheria only) booster shot every 10 years. All pregnant women should get a Tdap vaccine during their 3rd trimester to protect both themselves and their babies from whooping cough. The CDC recommends getting the Tdap shot between the 27th and 36th week of each pregnancy, preferably during the early part of this time period. This recommendation is supported by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American College of Nurse Midwives (ACNM), the American Association of Family Physicians (AAFP) and the American Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN). When a pregnant woman gets a whooping cough vaccine [during pregnancy,](https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/index.html) her body creates protective antibodies and passes some of them to her baby before birth. These antibodies will provide the baby with short-term, early protection against whooping cough and its serious complications. This is very important since infants are too young to be protected by their own whooping cough vaccination series. [Studies have shown](https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/research.html) that Tdap vaccination during pregnancy is safe and effective for pregnant women and their babies. Learn more about vaccines for pregnant women and how they help protect both mom and baby in our [Pregnancy section.](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/which-vaccines-does-my-family-need/pregnancy/) [According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/mom/get-vaccinated.html), when you get a Tdap vaccine during your pregnancy, you will have antibodies in your breast milk that you can share with your baby through breastfeeding. However, your baby will not get protective antibodies immediately if you wait to get the Tdap vaccine until after delivering your baby. This is because it takes about 2 weeks after getting vaccinated for your body to create antibodies. [Learn more](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/index.htm) about the benefits of breastfeeding.
