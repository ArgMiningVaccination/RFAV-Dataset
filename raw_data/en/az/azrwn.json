NatuRemedies distributes products manufactured by approved E.U. companies, mostly from Eastern Europe. The health systems of the Balkan countries are not as performing as NHS, so people there had to stay in contact with nature and to use what it has to treat common health problems. This way, traditional remedies remained important there. It is time for the English people to discover a part of this traditional medicine treasury in the UK, as an alternative or aid to modern chemical medicine. Naturemedies is a web portal for natural remedies and food supplements, with two principal directions: to promote less known but fully approved UK supplements imported from EU through its own shop and to offer a comparison feature for local UK products. OTC Products We sell products classified as GSL and OTC under the next provision of the government: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/medicines-reclassify-your-product General sale medicines People can buy general sale medicine packs from retail outlets such as corner shops and supermarkets. The medicines\u2014also called 'general sales list (GSL) medicines'\u2014are also available for self-selection in pharmacies. General sale medicines are taken for common, easily recognised ailments which usually last around 2-3 days. These medicines cause few troublesome side effects in normal use. To reduce the chances of harm from inappropriate use, many general sale medicines packs contain only a few doses and they often carry advice to get help from a health professional if the ailment does not improve or gets worse. A general sale medicine may be advised for treating a limited range of conditions whereas the same medicine can be used for a wider range of conditions when it is sold as a pharmacy medicine and an even wider range of conditions when supplied on prescription. Prescription-only medicines and pharmacy medicines can be used at higher doses and for a longer duration than general sale medicines. Also, medicines in general sale packs may be used for only certain groups of people; for example, they may not be advised for use by children or during pregnancy. Examples of general sale medicines include small packs of painkillers and of antihistamines for hay fever and other allergies. Over-the-counter medicines 'Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines' covers all general sale medicines and pharmacy medicines. The description conveniently distinguishes medicines that can be bought from those that must be prescribed. The term 'over the counter medicines' is informal and is not used in the UK medicines regulations. We advise our customers to take these products only after carefully reading the leaflets, and only with the recommendation of a GP. "}
