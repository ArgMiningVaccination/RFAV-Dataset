Located on a breathtaking campus in the Berkshires of western Massachusetts, Kripalu offers more than 700 programs a year that deliver life-changing, immersive experiences to nearly 40,000 guests. The campus is also home to the renowned Kripalu Schools of Y oga and Ayurveda, offering certification programs to yoga teachers and Ayurvedic practitioners. The largest yoga-based retreat center in North America, Kripalu is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational organization.800.741.7353 or kripalu.org | 3 doN't MISS...a letter fro M our Ceo As the trees and hills surrounding Lake Mahkeenac prepare for winter, a stillness and peace is settling on the Berkshires, as if all things are readying for a season of introspection and transformation. Winter is a natural time to retreat; to explore deeply, reconnect to our core being, and return to that sense of joy and love that connects us all. Kripalu is also in a state of renewal and transformation. If you have visited lately, you know that we have been working to improve all aspects of our retreat center, from facility upgrades to curriculum enhancements, in an effort to revitalize every facet of the retreat experience. Part of this renewal process is evident in this catalog, where you can now see a new look that expresses our fresh energy, excitement, and recommitment to Kripalu's core values. Symbols have always played an important role in transformative work, and our new logo and colors reflect a balance of old and new, celebrating our modern mission while honoring the ancient traditions that inspire and influence our work. In the color saffron, we honor the robes of the humble monks, nuns, and yogis who developed, practiced, and taught the art and science of yoga for thousands of years. While Kripalu serves today's practitioners seeking to live a more joyous and fulfilling life, saffron reminds us of the deep longing for spiritual freedom in everyone that is at the root of yoga and all transformative paths. The plum color represents our higher energy centers and the seat of inner wisdom that works together with the heart to deliver true enlightenment. Kripalu continues to offer our expert teachers and guides, but we also believe that the healing answers are already inside each of us. Our mission is to help you uncover and discover what is already true and within you. Finally, the earth hues remind all seekers to stay grounded and stable, balanced, and connected to the rhythms of nature. At Kripalu, our aim is to ensure that each guest is provided the tools needed to live a happy and skillful life in the real world, even after leaving the embrace of the retreat center. For every guest and student, we have recommitted to providing an exceptional and empowering experience full of healing, nurturing, and transformation. Whether you are exploring a workshop with one of our expert presenters, deepening your practice of yoga or Ayurveda, or simply coming for retreat, Kripalu is here in service to you with unparalleled opportunities for you to investigate the pathways of your own body, mind, heart, and spirit. We welcome you to Kripalu and to the complete wisdom and practice of yoga. We invite you to come explore the power of you.

Kripalu Yoga is as spiritually profound as it is deeply physical. We offer powerful in-depth prac - tices that emerge from our hatha yoga roots. What students discover is that Kripalu Yoga not only strengthens our bodies and minds but also offers rich tools to develop concentration, compassion, and the ability to sit with strong emotions using witness consciousness and Self-Observation Without Judgment. What's the intention behind enhancing the 500- Hour Kripalu Yoga Teacher Training curriculum? Since its inception, our 500-hour program has provided our students with outstanding tools to enhance their teaching and practice. The addition of fresh, inspired content reflects a new energy and authenticity. We've aligned our curriculum with the teachings of Swami Kripalu and Patanjali's eight-limbed path, and incorporated more Ayurveda. What are the modules? We're thrilled to launch the Kripalu Vinyasa mod- ule. This training offers an emphasis on compassion and sensitivity to enhance the rigors of the physi- cal practice, which cultivates a sense of softness, surrender, and inquiry. Another great addition is Integrating Ayurveda into Yoga Teaching. This module empowers Kripalu Yoga teachers to skill- fully weave Ayurveda into their classes. Pranayama and meditation, previously taught together, are now split into two different in-depth modules, each with a specific set of advanced asanas that complement and support these practices. We also continue to offer Kripalu Yoga for Special Populations, making the healing benefits of yoga accessible to a wider range of people.Micah Mortali, Director of the Kripalu Schools of Y oga and Ayurveda, discusses exciting new enhancements to the 500-Hour Kripalu Y oga T eacher T raining. the New 500-hour ModuleS tea ChINg praNa y aMa aNd advaNCed aS aNa Larissa Hall Carlson and Y oganand Michael Carroll Kripalu's unique teaching methodology is designed to awaken the life force and open the door to profound meditation.

Working at Kripalu has not only furthered my career goals\u2014it's allowed me to continue making healthy changes in my life. The Kripalu philosophy fits with my personal outlook on health and wellness: It's about finding your own path. We offer all different types of yoga and approaches to diet so that people can discover what's right for them. Working here encourages me to maintain a healthy lifestyle; I'm reminded every day, and reinspired by our guests. Y oga and nutrition have become ingrained in me, and I've continued my life education here: I'm currently enrolled in Kripalu's Certificate in Positive Psychology program. I work with our Program Development team to choose transformational programs for our guests, and with the Production team to create the nurturing space in which those programs take place. on a Friday afternoon, when our weekend guests are arriving, I walk around the building to make sure everything's ready to go and my staff has everything they need to serve our guests.

Being fully here, right now. In the body. In the breath. Not lean-ing forward into the next moment. Not reaching back into the previous moment. But allowing this moment to be okay exactly as it is. In the Buddhist tradition, this practice is often referred to as mindfulness, which is defined as \"the practice of paying attention, on purpose, to the experience of the present moment\u2014without judgment or reactivity.\" Mindfulness is bare attention to the present moment. Well, it turns out this isn't as easy as it sounds. We drive to Kripalu for the weekend, with the explicit inten- tion of quieting down, meditat - ing, letting the mind settle. No sooner have we sat down to meditate than we feel a vague hankering to get up and get a cup of tea, or check e-mail. We are a restless people. Being with the moment, exactly as it is, is not our specialty. So, what to do? I found out early on in my contemplative practice that it helps to have some small technique to help us to be fully present to now\u2014some simple practice to help us be with the flow of thoughts, feelings, and sensations that arise in each moment\u2014and, in fact, are the moment. When I first arrived at Kripalu, I was taught just such a straightforward technique. It is called BRFWA (pro - nounced \"bur-fwa\"). BRFWA is an acronym for \"breathe, relax, feel, watch, allow\"\u2014a simple technique for being present with our moment-to-moment experience. For 25 years, I have used this technique almost every day. I can't believe how powerful, useful, and practical it is. It's right there in my back pocket all the time. As we become more experienced with BRFWA (the five steps are detailed at right), we learn to trust that all we need to do is support the process through simple and con-sistent self-coaching\u2014and the process itself moves us to full integration. Breathe, relax, feel, watch, allow. Breathe, relax, feel, watch, allow. The next time you're confronted with a difficult emo - tional situation, try BRFWA. If you can, find a quiet place to sit\u2014a place where you feel safe and won't be disturbed. Then launch in, gently. Breathe. Relax. Feel. Watch. Allow. I'll bet that once you've tried it, you'll find yourself using it more and more. You'll become more and more accus-tomed to the feeling of coming home to yourself, and you'll find that being away from home for too long becomes an increasingly uncomfortable experience. BRFWA is a trust - worthy companion on the road of life, a way to return to our true home at any moment, no matter where we are. Stephen Cope, MSW , Scholar-in-Residence and Kripalu Ambassador, is the founder and former Director of the Kripalu Institute for Extraordinary Living and author of the best-selling books Yoga and the Quest for the True Self, The Wisdom of Yoga, and The Great Work of Your Life: A Guide for the Journey to Your True Calling.Remembering to breathe consciously in the midst of a difficult or challenging moment can shift everything. T ake full, deep breaths. If we become scared or anxious, or get caught in an obsessive thought loop, the breath will break the pattern. The breath integrates the emotional body and physical body\u2014the first step in \"coming home to ourselves\" in the present moment. Like the bumper sticker says: Just breathe! Kripalu Scholar-in-Residence Stephen Cope, best-selling author of Y oga and the Quest for the T rue Self, takes us step by step through the core Kripalu Y oga practice known as BRFWA\u2014a powerful tool for coming home to ourselves. STEP oNE: breathe Scan through the body to find muscles that feel tight and constricted, and then consciously encourage these areas to soften and let go. often the belly is the most effective place to begin. Deep, diaphragmatic breaths move us from the sympathetic (\"fight or flight\") system to the parasympathetic (\"rest and digest\") system. This phase of the technique helps to break up tightness and resistance in the body and mind. STEP TWo: relax Actively feeling means turning our attention minutely toward our moment-by-moment experience of the sensations, energy, and emotions in the body, without judging them. Where in the body is the feeling most intense? What is the texture of the sensation? This phase of the process helps us pinpoint the areas of our experience that have been split off, shut down, or concealed from our awareness. STEP THREE: feel \"The witness\" (what psychologists call \"the observing ego\") is the part of the self that stands at the center of the storms of experience without being blown away. We both participate and stand apart from our experience, acting as observer as well as coach. our attention is focused on \"How is it?\" rather than \"Why is it?\" or \"Do I like it it?\" It is the abiding voice that's constantly repeating, \"Breathe, relax, feel, watch, allow.\"STEP FouR: watCh In the final phase, we coach ourselves to allow the process to happen. When we don't try to control our experience, we're free to relax into the waves of sensation, feeling, and energy, just exactly as they are. We relinquish our resistance and allow ourselves to surrender, to let go of our tight hold on life and allow change to happen. We plunge into the river of life, and let it carry us exactly where it wants us to go.

When the days get shorter, my husband plugs in a special lamp that simu-lates sunlight. Prone to seasonal affective disorder (SAD), he finds that a half hour under the lamp, at sunrise and sunset, helps regulate his moods as daylight wanes. Even without a diagnosis of SAD, it's only natural that a dearth of sunlight combined with winter's chill can weigh heavily on us. But you don't have to buy a sunlamp to pull yourself out of a seasonal funk. We've asked a selection of teachers for practices that can bring light into your winter. Here are a few of their bright ideas. vISualIze the lIght wIthIN From Todd Norian, founder of Ashaya Y oga: Try this meditation to build heat. Visualize a candle flame in each of your chakras, starting at the base of your spine and mov - ing to the sacral region, navel, heart, throat, forehead, and crown of the head. Then visualize candles glowing in both palms and on the soles of both feet. Now imagine all the flames simultaneously aglow. warMINg breathworK From Erin Casperson, Academic Coordinator for the Kripalu School of Ayurveda: Practice Kapalabhati, or Skull-Polishing Breath, a series of short, sharp exhalations and passive inhalations done while pumping the belly. \"Kapalabhati is a warming breath that clears the cloudi-ness from the mind while stoking the internal digestive fire,\" Erin says. It's also good for clearing the sinuses! rItual S to hoNor the SeaSoN From Michelle Dalbec, Kripalu Y oga teacher and teacher trainer: Create a winter ritual that flows with and honors the change of rhythm in the season. \"Pause and marvel at how amazing winter sunsets are, or create a gratitude journal and find something you're grateful for each day that happens only in winter.\" fIre It up From Todd and Erin: Light a campfire outside, light your woodstove or fireplace, or warm up your kitchen and your belly by cooking cold-weather comfort foods. \"Contem-plate the magic and miracle of fire,\" says Todd. Erin sug - gests swapping salads for roasted vegetables, casseroles, soups, and hearty stews. daIl y warM-up From Sarajean Rudman, Kripalu Y oga teacher and former Kripalu School of Ayurveda Intern: Move your body to the point of breaking a sweat every day. \"This can be a vigorous yoga flow, or perhaps dancing, some kind of calisthenics or martial arts, or a jog if it isn't freezing out,\" she says. \"When we're closed inside all winter, it's easy to get stagnant. Invoking lightness in the body to ward off the heaviness of winter brings joy and energy into my day.\" breathe the aIr From Erin: \"Each morning, when the sun comes out, I make sure to go outside and breathe, even when it's freez-ing cold or cloudy.\" Exposure to the morning light keeps us aligned with our natural, diurnal rhythms, she says. Move INward From psychotherapist Miriam Greenspan, author of Healing Through the Dark Emotions: The Wisdom of Grief, Fear, and Despair: Welcome the introversion that this season naturally encourages. \" Just as the winter brings with it cold and frost, many people in this season find their hearts constricting, a kind of interior winter weather,\" Miriam says. \"While this can feel distressing, it's actually a signal to bring our attention inward.\" explore IlluMINatINg tradItIoNS From Father Thomas Ryan, author of 14 books on spiri-tual life: Delve into the original symbolism of seasonal traditions, such as the lighting of the Hanukkah menorah or the star atop the Christmas tree. \"The decorations featuring light that fill our homes and public places from late November to mid-January can serve as reminders of a guiding, strengthening Presence that seeks to lead us from darkness into light,\" he says. \"If people of every faith saw in all the seasonal lights on tables, trees, lampposts, and homes a reminder that we are loved with an infinite love, that would truly bring light into whatever areas of our lives are frozen and dark.\" Bess Hochstein, a freelance writer based in the Berkshires and Sonoma County, California, writes about yoga, travel, the arts, and culture.by Bess Hochstein the KrIpalu Shop oNlINe Browse books and CDs from our world-class presenters and faculty. shop.kripalu.org800.741.7353 or kripalu.org february | 73february 6-8 FRIDA Y -SuNDA KuNdalINI MaS terINg y our lIfe wIth pra CtICal eNlIghteNMeNt Guru Singh for all levels.

What struck me most was the way T al bridged \"Ivory T ower and Main Street,\" combining academic rigor with practical ways to adopt happiness-generating tools in my life and help others do the same. one night at 3:30 am, back home in Cleveland, the idea suddenly came to me to create a \"happiness incubator.\" The concept was simple: provide amazing experiences, rooted in science, that get people out of their comfort zones and connect them with each other\u2014 two avenues that are proven to push people's \"happiness buttons.\" That lightbulb moment led to the creation of an organization: Thrive (www.thrivecleveland.com). A lot has happened since then. We now have a 15-member creative team\u2014including architects, improv comediennes, Positive Psychologists, business consultants, artists, yoga instructors, sustainability experts\u2014who design and curate happiness experiences for the community. We've created a noontime dance rave, an afternoon of interactive happiness practices, a night of gnocchi-making celebrating traditions and family histories, and much more. Thrive has received national interest, and last year we gave a TEDx talk about our work. our next steps are to begin creating these experiences for workplaces, and hopefully bring Thrive satellites to other cities. I enrolled in the Certificate in Positive Psychology (CiPP) program with T al to go deeper into the theory, research, and practice of Positive Psychology, and the impact has been incredible. Beyond the varied curriculum, one constant has been my deep connection with other CiPP alumni; there's such an incredible support system that's created when people wholeheartedly experience something like this together. In a very real way, we're bonded for life. CiPP has affected my personal and professional life, strengthened my community, and given me friendships that I'll keep forever. \u2014 Scott S., Cleveland, ohio T al Ben-Shahar, PhD, co-founder and CL o of Wholebeing Institute, has lec- tured at Harvard university, where his course in Positive Psychology was the most popular at the school.

How do we find the path of soul amid life's pressures and grind? Creativity, courage, and conviction are the guides that lead us to our spiritual home, which Rilke calls \"the open.\" His poems bring a depth of aware-ness that sings beneath our busy activities and everyday concerns. For Rilke, this journey is an awakening of consciousness, flowing from the longing to see, hear, and know what is ultimately real and true.

Through basic and advanced meditation and visualization practices, lectures, and dialogue, you gain a greater understanding of death and rebirth and are introduced to the foundations and scope of unexcelled Y oga T antra practice. tuItIoN $265.

There are stories we polish into well-formed, amusing anecdotes, and others we bury deep until they rise up unexpect-edly and take us by surprise. When we attempt to write these stories, we face our own resistance. one of the most powerful ways to plumb the depths of our resistance and self-censorship is to come to know our own bodies and minds, where these stories live. Join Dani Shapiro, best-selling author of eight books, for an inspiring experience that will stay with you long after you return home.

I came to Kripalu from Canada 18 years ago to become a yoga teacher. From the beginning, I knew in my heart that Kripalu was my home, but little did I know that it would completely alter the course of my life. After four years teaching yoga in Canada, I came back to Kripalu as a volunteer. I continued to teach yoga and R&R Retreat workshops here after my volunteer year ended, and began designing and leading retreats and teacher trainings. I worked in Healing Arts for six years, and today I am a director of the 200-hour Kripalu Y oga T eacher T raining and a Healthy Living faculty member. Why do you practice and teach yoga? When I found Kripalu Y oga, I found not only my home but also myself. Y oga saved my life in many ways. It gave me a clear path to live a healthy, centered, and focused life, and this in turn helps all of who I am come to fruition. I teach yoga because it profoundly changed\u2014and continues to change\u2014my life, and I want to bring that to others. What inspires and motivates you? When my students share with me the transformations they've experienced, and how their lives have changed because of yoga and yoga nidra. How has Kripalu resonated with you? Kripalu has watered my good seeds, given me sunlight and air to grow and shine, pruned me where I needed pruning, and also let me expand and grow when I needed to do that. I cannot imagine how I would have lived my life without Kripalu. How do you like to spend your free time? In my free time, I seek balance through daily yoga and self-care practices. My greatest pleasure is nature\u2014simply being with the elements. I paddleboard, swim, ski, walk with the dogs, and cycle to take it all in.
