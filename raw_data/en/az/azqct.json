While this approach may work to treat the \"disease,\" it is often notsufficient to treat the \"patient.\" Optimal healing requires treatment of thesymptoms, the cause, and the complications in order to restore the patient to health.Accomplishing this goal is often beyond the reach of the single-agent approach, but can beachieved by using a balanced combination or 'formula' that maximizes the desiredtherapeutic effect and minimizes the side effects. In the past 20 years, western medicine has recognized the benefit of administeringdrugs in combination rather than singly. There are now numerous examples of such products: Antibiotics: Faced with increased bacterial resistance to and tolerance ofantibiotics, pharmaceutical companies have developed drug combinations to potentatetherapeutic effects. Bactrim is an antibiotic containing sulfamethoxazole andtrimethoprim. This combination is extremely effective: sulfamethoxazole kills bacteria,and trimethoprim inhibits the growth and multiplication of bacteria. The combination ofthese two agents enables the final product to achieve far more than what each is able toaccomplish individually. Pain Killers: Aspirin alone is an effective pain medication, but is notoriousfor causing stomach irritation. Therefore, to maximize positive effects and minimizeunwanted side effects, aspirin is commonly combined with antacids or covered with anenteric coating to protect the stomach. Hypertension therapies: Dyazide, a drug commonly prescribed to treathypertension, contains two diuretics that balance one another's side effects. Triamtereneeliminates water but retains excessive potassium in the body, while hydrochlorothiazideeliminates water and lowers potassium levels in the body. Neither ingredient is an idealdiuretic if used individually. However, when formulated together, excellent efficacy withfew side effects is achieved. While the fundamental concept of using synergism is the same whether applied in westernmedicine or in Traditional Chinese Medicine, the formulation of herbal products is oftenmore challenging and complex than that of current pharmaceutical products. In TraditionalChinese Medicine, many herbs are prepared with special and specific protocols to minimizeside effects, and multiple-herb formulas are combined carefully to maximize therapeuticeffects. For example, Radix Polygoni Multiflori (He Shou Wu) is an herb commonly used fortreatment of premature gray hair and hair loss. In its normal state, it contains emodinand sennoside, which are known to cause diarrhea. Therefore, Radix Polygoni Multiflori (HeShou Wu) must undergo a black bean curing process prior to consumption to avoid diarrhea. In addition to proper preparation, herbs are almost always prescribed in combinations,or 'formulas' according to Traditional Chinese Medicine. This goes beyond treating thedisease solely on the molecular level, advancing to treating the patient as a wholeperson. In most cases, it is unrealistic and impossible to assume that the illness iscaused specifically by one enzyme, one receptor, or one protein. Instead, an illness isoften caused by a number of factors, leading to multiple symptoms and complications.Therefore, a treatment protocol that emphasizes treating the cause, and the symptoms andthe complications, will often achieve wonderful results. Despite the current fad surrounding Radix Ginseng (Ren Shen), one of the oldest andmost commonly used herbs worldwide, many new advocates of this herb do not understand thatit is rarely recommended for use as a single agent. It is often combined with RhizomaAtractylodis Macrocephalae (Bai Zhu) to improve energy, with Arillus Longanae Euphoriae(Long Yan Rou) to improve memory, and with Radix Rehmanniae Glutinosae Conquitae (Shu DiHuang) to treat impotence. Use of Radix Ginseng (Ren Shen) by itself is associated with a higher incidence of sideeffects, all of which can be neutralized by the addition of other herbs. For example,bloating sensations may be relieved by combining Radix Ginseng (Ren Shen) with PericarpiumCitri Reticulatae (Chen Pi) or Fructus Amomi (Sha Ren). The increase in thirst and bodytemperature may be relieved with the addition of Radix Rehmanniae Glutinosae (Sheng DiHuang), and edema may Poriae Cocos (Fu Ling) or RhizomaAlismatis Orientalis (Ze Xie). Some herbs are essentially ineffective unless combined with others but gain uniquepotency when formulated, so long as the appropriate methodologies are performed. While some herbs may be used as individual entities, most of them require preciseformulation to achieve the desired effects. Traditional Chinese Medicine is an art ofmedicine perfected thorough thousands of years of practical, recorded experience. Thepractice of synergism through herbal formulations has been documented since the dawn ofherbal medicine, and the same principle is now gradually being utilized in thepharmaceutical industry. If you want your herbal products to have lasting success, make sure they are correctlyformulated with properly cured herbs in order to ensure its efficacy and eliminateunwanted side effects. Note: The art of formulation is both sophisticated and complex, requiring years ofeducation and experience. Inappropriate formulation may render the product ineffective,and perhaps cause adverse reactions. Expert Chinese herbalists must have an advanceddegree in Traditional Chinese Medicine, which requires a minimum of four years ofpost-graduate training in accredited universities and colleges.
