TCM treatments are highly customized based on the individual's constitution to emphasize individual body optimization, stimulate the body's natural healing abilities and promote physical and emotional well-being[1]. At EMW Physiotherapy & TCM, we strive to excel in providing treatment service which completes the healing process and rebalances our body naturally. Therefore, we introduce the use of essential oils into our modernized TCM treatments which include acupuncture, acupressure massage, indirect moxibustion and customized herbs to achieve a greater therapeutic benefit. What is aromatherapy? Aromatherapy is a gentle healing treatment that uses naturally concentrated plant extracts to promote health and well-being. These essences are carefully obtained through steam distillation, cold pressing or resin tapping from plants (leaves, flowers, fruit, bark, or tree roots). They have long been known for their therapeutic properties based on the aromatic chemical composition present in oils. Essential oils are molecularly small and can be absorbed effectively into the subcutaneous layer of the skin via topical application. There are studies that suggest the topical application of essential oils shows a positive effect in reducing pain and inflammation. When we consider the topical application of essential oils onto our skin, it is important that we adhere to the safe dilution ratio of essential oils with carrier oils as it is strongly advised never to apply essential oils directly to the skin. Carrier oils are non-volatile vegetable or nut oils used to dilute concentrated essential oils so they do not irritate the skin upon topical application. At EMW, we use high-quality pure essential oils (directly sourced from the USA) diluted with fractionated coconut oil in our TCM treatments to enhance overall therapeutic effects. Benefits of using essential oils with TCM treatment Aromatherapy has been used by many cultures over the centuries for medical and religious purposes. It was only in the 1910s when Ren\u00e9-Maurice Gattefoss\u00e9 discovered the therapeutic properties of pure lavender in treating burns and then published his discoveries and research in 1937, giving recognition to the term \"aromatherapy\". We explore using essential oils mainly for women's health (including fertility) and gut health clinically. Essential oil for fertility, we help to balance fertility hormones and regulate a smooth menstrual cycle. These are significant for women who optimise their health in preparation for their fertility journey. For women with the polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which is also a common cause of infertility, incorporating essential oils into TCM treatments works to restore hormonal balance, improve ovulation and regulate the menstrual cycle. In a 2016 study, it was revealed that PCOS women who had marjoram tea responded positively with improved insulin sensitivity and reduced adrenal androgens levels in the body[2]. Therefore, we select oils which harmonize hormones, reduce cortisol levels by activating your parasympathetic nervous system, calm emotions and provide pain relief. Essential oil for gut health, we help to optimize digestive functions for nutrient absorption and waste removal. Nutrient uptake is important as it is the source of Qi and blood in the body. In addition, the gastrointestinal system is an integral part of our immune system, which hosts more than 100,000 trillion microorganisms participating in digestion and the first line of defence to protect us against harmful pathogens. When we improve digestion and establish healthy microflora in our gut, we also build up our immune system to keep us healthy and prevent us from falling sick frequently. Therefore, we select oils that are carminative (to prevent the formation of gas in the gastrointestinal tract or relieve flatulence, antispasmodic (to induce relaxation on smooth muscle and reduce abdominal cramps), and anti-inflammatory to support digestion by improving the vagal tone and maintain a healthy gut flora[3]. 5 Essential oils for fertility and women's health: - Geranium (Pelargonium x asperum) - regulate estrogen production and reduces anxiety - Bergamot (Citrus bergamia) - reduce psychological stress responses and serum cortisol levels. - Marjoram (Origanum majorana) - restore hormonal balance, reduce menstrual cramps and calms the nervous system - Ylang Ylang (Cananga odorata var. genuina) - induce euphoric feelings for better mental health - Roman Chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile) - relieve menstrual pain and cramps. 5 Essential oils for gut health - Ginger (Zingiber officinale) - warming, relieve nausea and vomiting, and immunostimulant. - Clove (Syzygium aromaticum/Eugenia caryophyllata) - warming, carminative Basil (Ocimum basilicum ct. linalool) - carminative and antispasmodic (to relax smooth muscle) - Lemon (Citrus limon) - increase energy, improve mood and relieve nausea - Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) - central nervous system (CNS) sedative (to calm, soothe and relax tensed digestive system), antispasmodic and immunostimulant Some reminders when using aromatherapy for beginners - Dilution matters. Never apply concentrated essential oils to your skin directly. Dilute your essential oils with carrier oils at 1-2% dilution for common uses. - You can use essential oils through: - Inhalation through a water-based diffuser. Add 6-8drops of essential oils into a 200ml diffuser, and use it in an enclosed room for 20-30 minutes each time. - Topical application at 1-2% dilution. Please do not use it on inflamed or injured skin. 3. Consult a certified aromatherapist if you are pregnant or nursing or would like to explore using essential oils for young children. At EMW Physiotherapy & TCM, we are committed to using natural therapeutic high-grade essential oils for our treatments diluted with fractionated coconut oil at a 2% dilution.
