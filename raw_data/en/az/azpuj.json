Like many of our [articles](https://www.betteryou.ai/scientific-benefits-of-meditation/) we have written for BetterYou, we always talk about the importance of meditation and how it has a positive impact on your mental health. So, I decided to take a look since it was offering a year long membership for free! Also, I was trying to look for another app to offer other than Calm and Headspace for those who read our articles. It can be difficult to find authentic and easy to navigate apps that won't cost an arm and a leg to use. So, let's take a look at [Balance](https://www.balanceapp.com). Winner of Google's Best App of 2021 Award, this app seemed very promising. This is a personalized app that goes off of how you are feeling, if you're a student, and your experience. Not one person is the same, so I absolutely love that you can personalize everything. The Pros This app is so, so easy to use. The application interface of the app is simple yet effective in showing where everything is. You have daily meditations, an afternoon recharge, sleep meditations and so much more. It teaches you meditation skills and you're able to level up as you meditate more. It even has a meditation for eating. This is something that I personally need to use more often due to having two small children. This app can literally be for anyone, and I truly don't say that often. This is a great app to add to your mindfulness tool in your BetterYou app as well! You can also earn badges for completing plans and staying active! You can also enable your push notifications to remind you at a certain time every day to do your daily meditation. The Cons To be quite honest, there isn't much wrong with this app at all. The only thing is to maybe have it be a bit of a brighter app, but other than that I truly enjoyed this app and I will continue to use it in the future. This is a really great tool to get anyone started on their meditation journey. The only thing is, there's no meditations available for kids. Aside from the sleep for kids option. Other than that, this is great for all levels of meditators. I will also add there are only two kinds of voices to choose from. I don't want to assume their pronouns, they are feminine and masculine sounding! Want to Try the App? Here is a year free of Balance here: \"I've been using Balance to improve my sleep, stress, mood, and more. Want to try it, too? They're offering a free year to "}
