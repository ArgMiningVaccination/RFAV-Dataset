CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 3 Abstract In response to the House of Lords' inquiry into regenerative medicines, an expert group (RMEG) was convened to develop an action plan for the NHS. RMEG proposed that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commission a \"mock technology appraisal\" to assess whether changes to its methods and processes are needed. This report presents the findings of independent research commissioned to inform this appraisal and the deliberations of a panel c onvened by NICE to evaluate the mock appraisal. The specific objective of our research was to investigate the application of existing NICE appraisal methodology to regenerative medicines, identifying challenges and areas where adaptation may be appropriate . Our research included reviews to identify conceptual differences and the relevance of alternative decision frameworks, alongside the development of an exemplar case study of CAR T -cell therapy for treating acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. An assessment of previous evaluations of regenerative medicines by NICE and other bodies found that while previous assessments were associated with a number of evidential challenges, none were unique to regenerative medicines or beyond existing methods used to conceptuali se uncertainty of a decision. Regarding the clinical evidence for regenerative medicines, it is not universally the case that they are trialled using non -randomised study designs. However, there may be high variation in response across both individuals an d centres. Also regenerative medicines may be subject to continuing development, posing problems when evaluating long -term efficacy and safety. Where single -arm trials are used to assess efficacy the relative treatment effect generated is likely to be opti mistic, unless the historical control data are very certain. Pivotal trials may use surrogate endpoints, which, on average, overestimate treatment effects. Also, surrogate primary outcomes are likely to be associated with immature overall survival data. To reduce overall uncertainty, multivariate meta -analysis methods to analyse all available data should be considered. Incorporating indirectly relevant but more reliable (more mature) data into the analysis can also be considered. For the exemplar case of CA R T-cell therapy, Target Product Profiles (TPPs) were developed which considered the 'curative' and 'bridging to stem -cell transplantation' treatment approaches separately. Within each TPP, three 'hypothetical' evidence sets (minimum, intermediate and matu re) were generated to simulate the impact of alternative levels of precision and maturity in the clinical evidence. Subsequent assessments of cost -effectiveness were undertaken, employing the existing NICE reference case alongside additional analyses sugge sted within alternative frameworks. The CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 4 additional exploratory analyses were undertaken to demonstrate how assessments of cost - effectiveness and uncertainty could be impacted by alternative Managed Entry Agreements (MEAs), including price discounts, perfor mance related schemes and technology leasing. The Panel deliberated on the range of TPPs, evidence sets and MEAs presented, commenting on the recommendations they would be likely to make for each scenario. The Panel discussed a wide range of challenges as sociated with the exemplar and regenerative medicines more broadly, focussing on the need for a robust quantification of the level of uncertainty in the cost -effective estimates and the potential value of MEAs in limiting the exposure of the NHS to high up front costs and loss associated with a wrong decision.

An effec t may be classed as adverse if it causes functional or anatomical damage, causes irreversible change in the homeostasis of the organism, or increases the susceptibility of the organism to other chemical or biological stress. Antigen CD19 A protein present on B -cell leukaemias (as well as on healthy B cells ) Aplasia The failure of an organ or tissue to develop or to function normally Autologous Deriv ed from an individual's own cells Between -study variance Between -study variance is a measure of statistical h eterogeneity that depends on the scale of the outcome measured. It represents the variation in reported study effects over and above the variation expected given the within -study variation. Biologic therapies (biological) Medical preparations derived from living organisms. Includes anti -TNF drugs and other new drugs which target pathologically active T cells. CAR -T cell Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell Clinical trial phases Phase I studies Researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people for the first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects. Phase II studies The drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective and to further evaluate its safety. Phase III studies CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 18 The drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely. Phase IV studies Studies are done after the drug or treatment has been marketed to gather information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long -term use. Consolidation chemotherapy Chemotherapy gi ven once a remission is achieved, to sustain a remission. Cost-benefit analysis An economic analysis that converts the effects or consequences of interventions into the same monetary terms as the costs and compares them using a measure of net benefit or a cost -benefit ratio Cost-effectiveness analysis An economic analysis that expresses the effects or consequences of interventions on a single dimension. This would normally be expressed in 'natural' units (e.g. cases cured, life -years gained, additional strokes prevented). The difference between interventions in terms of costs and effects is typically expressed as an incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (e.g. the incremental cost per life -year gained). Cost-utility analysis The same as a cost -effectiv eness analysis but the effects or consequences of interventions are expressed in generic units of health gain, usually quality -adjusted life years (QALYs). Credible Interval In Bayesian statistics, a credible interval is a posterior probability interval es timation which incorporates problem -specific contextual information from the prior distribution. Credible intervals are used for the purposes similar to those of confidence intervals in frequentist statistics. Fixed -effect model A statistical model that s tipulates that the units under analysis (e.g. people in a trial or study in a meta - analysis) are the ones of interest, and thus constitute the entire population of units. Only within -study variation is taken to influence the uncertainty of results (as refl ected in the confidence interval) of a meta -analysis using a fixed effect model.

Haematologic cancers Cancer of blood cells which can be sub -divided into three main diseases: leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma. Heterogeneity In systematic reviews heterogeneity refers to variability or differences between studies in the estimates of effects. A distinction is sometimes made between \"statistical heterogeneity\" (differences in the reported effects), \"methodological heterogeneity\" (differences in study design) and \"clinical heterogeneity\" (differences between studies in key characteristics of the participants, interventions or outcome measures). I-squared (I2) I-squared (I2) is a measure of \"statistical heterogeneity\" (differences in the reported effects). It varies between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the differences in reported effects are entirely consistent with the within -study uncertainty, and 1 indicates that the differences in reported effects are entirely explained by st udy characteristics that vary across studies. Immune reconstitution A condition where the patient's immune system begins to recover after treatment Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome A condition where the patient's immune system begins to recover after treatment but then reacts later with an overwhelming inflammatory response Immunoconjugates Antibodies joined to a second molecule, usually a toxin, radioisotope or label for use in immunotherapy. . Immunotoxins A protein that consists of a targeting portion linked to a toxin which will bind to a cell and causes endocytosis allowing the toxin to kill the cell. Immunophenotype The protein type expressed by cells. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 20 Immunot herapy A treatment designed to boost the body's natural defences to fight cancer by utilising material either from the body or produced in vitro to improve, target, or restore immune system function. Intention -to-treat An intention -to-treat analysis is o ne in which all the participants in a trial are analysed according to the intervention to which they were allocated, whether they received it or not. Medical devices directive The Medical Device Directives is a directive relating to the safety and performance of medical devices which were harmonized in the EU in the 1990s. Monoclonal antibody An antibody produced in a laboratory from a single clone that recognizes only one antigen. Open -label study A type of study in which both participants and res earchers know which treatment is being administered. Orphan designation/status Based on the EMA criteria, a medicine can qualify for orphan status if; it is intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life -threatening or chron ically debilitating; the prevalence of the condition in the EU must not be more than 5 in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development; no satisfactory m ethod of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorised, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Pharmacodynamic effects The study of how a drug behaves i n the body. Pharmacokinetic effects The study of the effect the body has on a drug. Placebo An inactive substance or procedure administered to a patient, usually to compare its effects with those of a real drug or other intervention, but sometimes for t he psychological benefit to the patient through a belief that s/he is receiving treatment. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 21 Persistence In treatment intended for direct in vivo administration, persistence may describe how long the product is effective in treating a targeted disease. It may also be used to refer to the persistence of the product, e.g. gene expression or any permanent changes, within the patient as a result of treatment with the product. Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) An index of health gain where survival duration is weighted or adjusted by the patient's quality of life during the survival period. QALYs have the advantage of incorporating changes in both quantity (mortality) and quality (morbidity) of life. Quality of Life A concept incorporating all the factors that m ight impact on an individual's life, including factors such as the absence of disease or infirmity as well as other factors which might affect their physical, mental and social well -being. Random effects model A statistical model sometimes used in meta -analysis in which both within -study sampling error (variance) and between -studies variation are included in the assessment of the uncertainty (confidence interval) of the results of a meta -analysis. Randomised co ntrolled trial (RCT) An experiment in which investigators randomly allocate eligible people into intervention groups to receive or not to receive one or more interventions that are being compared. Refractory Disease which does not respond to attempted forms of treatment. Regenerative medicine A field of research and clinical applications dealing with the process of replacing or regenerating human cells, tissues or organs to restore or establish normal function Relative Risk (RR) (synonym: risk ratio) The ratio of risk in the intervention group to the risk in the control group. The risk (proportion, probability or rate) is the ratio of people with an event in a group to the total in the group. A relative risk of one indicates no difference between comp arison groups. For undesirable outcomes an RR that is less than one indicates that the intervention was effective in reducing the risk of that outcome.

Sensitivity analyses are used to assess how robust the results are to uncertain decisions or assumptions about th e data and the methods that were used. Time to relapse Length of first remission Weighted mean difference (in meta -analysis) A method of meta -analysis used to combine measures on continuous scales, where the mean, standard deviation and sample size in each group are known. The weight given to each study is determined by the precision of its estimate of effect and, is equal to the inverse of the variance. This method assumes that all of the trials have measured the outcome on the same scale. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 23 Plain English Summary Regenerative medicines replace or regenerate human cells, tissues or organs to restore or establish normal function. Potential breakthroughs in this area of clinical research are eagerly anticipated and expectations are often high due to the possibility of cures (or substantial improvements) for diseases which are currently deemed chronic or fatal. However, the assessment of the long term costs and benefits of such therapies is more difficult than for co nventional treatments. In response to a House of Lords' inquiry into regenerative medicines, an expert group (RMEG) was set up to develop an action plan for the NHS. RMEG proposed that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commission a \"mock technology appraisal\" to assess whether changes to its methods and processes are needed. This report presents the findings of independent research commissioned to inform this appraisal. We reviewed evaluations of regenerative medicines by NICE a nd other groups as well as conducting reviews of the existing literature concerned with the challenges of assessing the therapies. In addition an exemplar case study of CAR T -cells for acute leukaemia was constructed to inform the deliberations of an expe rt panel set up by NICE. Our research found that, while evidence about regenerative medicines is expected to be associated with much uncertainty in determining the long term costs and benefits to patients and the NHS, the existing methods available to esti mate the implications of this uncertainty are sufficient. Ways of sharing the risks between the NHS and the therapy manufacturers should be investigated further. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 24 1 Scientific Summary 1.1 Background Regenerative medicines replace or regenerate human cells, tissues or organs to restore or establish normal function. Potential breakthroughs in this area of clinical research are eagerly anticipated and expectations are often high due to the possibility of cures (or substantial improvements) for diseases which are currentl y deemed chronic or fatal . However, efficacy, safety and cost -effectiveness evaluations of regenerative medicines may be difficult compared with evaluations of conventional pharmaceutical treatments. This was highlighted by the Regenerative Medicine Expert Group (RMEG), which was tasked to develop an NHS regenerative medicine delivery readiness strategy and action plan. It reported that application of NICE appraisal methods, based on cost utility analysis, to products whose true value may not be known for many years, might be challenging. This is mainly because of the inherent uncertainty of estimating long -term benefit from evidence which may have been derived from small, short -term, non -randomised studies which may also have used surrogate primary outcomes (rather than real clinical outcomes). Such study methods are often an inevitable consequence of the seriously ill, very small populations with unmet medical needs which are often the initial target of new regenerative medicines. Important potential challenges to assessing cost- effectiveness may include claims of cure and lifetime benefit; longer -term safety issues caused by persistence and possible product changes withi n the body; organisational and scaling issues; and significant up -front costs. Investigation is therefore needed to determine whether the conceptual differences between regenerative medicines and other types of health technology require different approache s to the conduct and assessment of efficacy, safety and cost -effectiveness. 1.2 Objectives To test the application of NICE appraisal methodology to regenerative medicines, identifying challenges and any areas where methods research and/or adaptation of methodo logy is appropriate. To identify specific issues related to the appraisal of regenerative medicines using the current NICE appraisal process and decision framework. To develop a framework for those developing regenerative medicines to fac ilitate understanding of how NICE evaluates clinical and cost -effectiveness and to identify the most important evidence areas to develop before cost -effectiveness can be reasonably estimated.CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 25 1.3 Potential issues for the evaluation of clinical effectiveness Two different approaches were taken to identify and explore issues and challenges which may be associated with NICE evaluations of regenerative medicines: Perform a broad exploration of the applicability of NICE technology appraisal methods to regenerative medicines; Undertake an exemplar NICE appraisal of a hypothetical regenerative medicine product. Several reviews were undertaken to identify and discuss technology appraisal methodology issues which may be particularly relevant to regenerative medicines: a review of EMA, NICE and FDA assessments of regenerative medicines licensed in the EU; a review of the use of surrogate endpoints in clinical research; and a review of the biases likely to affect results of non -randomised studies (with a particular focus o n the challenges of using results from single -arm trials to estimate efficacy). These reviews were performed pragmatically, i.e. they were not intended to be systematic, since the aim was to identify key issues, rather than to identify all relevant studies and papers. Several broad issues which may affect uncertainty were apparent from these reviews: It is not universally the case that regenerative medicines are trialled using non -randomised study designs: submitted pivotal studies may well in fact be rand omised, notably when levels of unmet need are low and diseases/conditions are not rare; in such cases the maturity of data (which would be available at the time of a NICE appraisal) has been up to five years' duration. With single -arm trials a key conside ration when judging levels of uncertainty should be the likelihood of cure or improvement without experimental treatment. However, it may be very difficult to identify published prognostic studies which have suitable historical control data. Other strategi es for obtaining historical data may therefore be needed, such as seeking access to national patient databases. When single -arm trials or case series do form the basis of a regulatory submission, unless the historical control data are very certain, the rel ative treatment effect generated is likely to be optimistic. Where single -arm trial data are compared with historical data and appropriate methods to adjust for confounding are employed, the selection of the method used must be explicit and be based on sound reasoning; despite advances in statistical techniques , clear challenges remain in generating accurate unbiased estimates of effect from non -randomised data. Pivotal trials in regulatory submissions are likely to report primary endpoints which are surrog ates for real clinical endpoints. On average, trials using surrogates report larger treatment effects than trials using final patient -relevant outcomes. This has implications for effect estimate CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 26 uncertainty, especially when only surrogate endpoints are rep orted. The choice of surrogate outcomes must be researched, explicit and justified, preferably via a systematic review of the evidence for the validation of the surrogate -final outcome relationship. Nevertheless, to maximise the use of all available data, and to reduce overall uncertainty, multivariate meta -analysis methods to analyse data should also be considered - whatever the maturity of the evidence base. Related to the issue of surrogates as primary outcomes is that of duration of follow -up: use of intermediate shorter -term outcomes avoids the need for long follow -up. The consequence of this is that even where overall survival data are recorded, these data are immature at the point of regulatory approval. The high technology status of regenerative medi cines may imply greater potential for variation in response across both individuals and centres. This is likely to have implications in terms of the generalisability of efficacy and safety estimates obtained from small single -centre (probably expert centre ), single -arm studies . Single centre studies may produce larger effect estimates than multi -centre studies. In the absence of larger or more varied trials, this issue might only be addressed by access to individual patient data so that potential predictors of response or effect modifiers may be investigated. Although more mature evidence - such as confirmatory RCTs - may sometimes be viable in the specific population being evaluated, such evidence might also only be expected in larger, similar populations ( for example, B -ALL patients in first relapse). This raises the possibility of incorporating indirectly relevant but more reliable (and possibly more mature) data into the analysis, to reduce uncertainty. Most r egenerative medicines are , by their nature , innovative products which may be subject to continuing development, with new generations of product having improved efficacy. This may pose problems when evaluating long -term efficacy and safety; for example, to what extent can the long -term safety data from a first -generation product be used to inform long -term safety of a related newly -licensed second -generation product? This may mean that as well as bioavailability - type studies, key trials conducted earlier in the development process may have to be replicated or adjustments be made in the analyses of trial data to account for their indirectness. 1.4 Pote ntial issues for the evaluation of cost -effectiveness We undertook a pragmatic review of potential cost -effectiveness issues to identify possible conceptual differences between regenerative medicines and more conventional medicines to identify potential methodological challenges for cost -effectiveness assessments. NICE has previously evaluated two regenerative medicines within the existing TA process: autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) for the treatment of cartilage defects in the knee joints CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 27 and sipuleucel -T (Provenge\u00ae) for treating asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic hormone -relapsed prostate cancer. Several issues and common themes emerged from our review of these: While the innovative nature of both products was acknowledged, neith er committee considered there to be any evidence supporting a distinct benefit that would not be appropriately reflected in the reference case measure of QALYs; The high levels of uncertainty were highlighted a key issues in both appraisals leading to important concerns regarding the robustness of the cost -effectiveness results; The generalisability and transferability of evidence across different generations appears an important issue, particularly regarding longer -term outcomes which may not be sufficien tly mature for newer generations; Important uncertainties were also identified surrounding the costs that would be incurred by the NHS, due to limited experience with their use and also the complex pathway in which they were used. Many of the challenges id entified do not appear unique to these types of therapies and are also likely to be faced by manufacturers of more conventional pharmaceuticals, biologics and devices. However, it is clear that these challenges may be faced more routinely for regenerative medicines and cell therapies. Concerns surrounding the potential high -upfront costs of regenerative medicines and affordability to health care systems have also received particular attention in the literature, leading several authors to conclude that alter native financing approaches may also have to be considered. Many of the issues associated with regenerative medicines will inevitably impact on the level of uncertainty associated with the cost -effectiveness of the technology when introduced into clinical practice. Even where products have significant potential to confer important clinical advances over current therapies, this may not be known with a high level of certainty at the time a regenerative medicine is licensed. Inevitably a new technology's cost -effectiveness may be more difficult to determine in these circumstances and schemes that allow the development of further evidence or entail a risk -sharing component may be required. Managed entry agreements (MEAs) are an increasingly common policy respon se to dealing with uncertainty in the evidence base of new health technologies entering the market. How to determine when efficiency is sufficiently weak or uncertain, such that MEAs are appropriate policy responses remains a key methodological issue that has important implications both for policy CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 28 making and research investments made by the regenerative medicine industry. Several studies have concluded that reimbursement decisions and the possible use of MEA should be based not only on the expected value o f a technology but also the value of further research, the anticipated effect of coverage on further research, and the costs associated with reversing the decision (i.e. irrecoverable costs). Importantly, there already exists provision within NICE's method s guide to accommodate some of these considerations, although potential challenges may arise in ensuring these are consistently applied between committees and understood by manufacturers. NICE will also need to consider whether further amendments to their processes and methods are required. Broader consideration will also need to be given to approaches which may extend beyond NICE's existing remit e.g. alternative funding approaches. Consequently other bodies and manufacturers themselves may also have an important role in identifying more innovative approaches to seeking reimbursement which recognise the inherent uncertainties and lead to a more efficient sharing of associated risk. 1.5 Exemplar NICE appraisal of CAR T -cells for relapsed/refractory B -ALL For the exemplar appraisal, the chosen hypothetical product was CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T - cell therapy specific to the antigen CD19, for treating relapsed (two relapses or more) or refractory B - cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B -ALL). This combination was selected based on the existence of relatively mature data sets - in the context that none of the currently available CAR T -cell products are licensed. The exemplar began with a review of both the completed, and ongoing, trials of CAR T - cell therapies f or B-ALL. This was followed by a review of other treatments for relapsed/refractory B - ALL which have been licensed by the EMA or FDA. 1.5.1 Clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of CAR T -cells for relapsed/refractory B - ALL The available trial data for CA R T-cells is limited to small, single -arm studies. The therapies have the potential to offer patients a 'bridge' to a stem cell transplant or possibly a cure (without transplant), depending on the particular type of CAR T -cell therapy. However, potentially serious adverse effects are also possible. The relapsed/refractory B -ALL population is narrowly defined with extremely poor prognosis and limited alternative therapy options. The length of persistence of CAR T -cells within patients will have implications for both efficacy and safety; the ideal product would balance the trade - off between persistence being long -enough to eradicate malignant cells, and short enough to prevent B-cell aplasia being a problematic adverse effect. Length of persistence may therefo re dictate whether CAR T -cells will be administered with either curative intent, or as a bridge to a stem cell transplant. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 29 The target product profile (TPP) and hypothetical evidence sets Based on the available clinical evidence for CAR T -cell and licensed non-regenerative medicines for relapsed B -ALL, two target product profiles (TPPs) were developed to be considered as part of the exemplar appraisal: CAR T -cell therapy used as a \" bridge to HSCT \", where the primary goal of treatment is to induce short -term remission of disease in order to maximise the opportunity for successful HSCT; CAR T -cell therapy used with \" curative intent \", where the primary goal of CAR T -cell treatment is long -term remission/cure of disease (with or without HSCT). These two approach es to treatment with CAR T -cell therapy imply two potentially different contexts in which therapy may be appraised. Consequently, there are separate implications arising from the different applications that require their consideration as two distinct scen arios. To explore the impact of different levels of precision and maturity in the evidence base, three hypothetical data sets were constructed for each TPP: The minimum set (60 -80 patients, median follow -up approx. 10 months): the minimum data considered potentially sufficient for CAR T -cell therapy to be granted conditional regulatory approval; The intermediate set (60 -80 patients, maximum follow -up of 5 -years): a variant of the minimum set, where the efficacy and safety of CAR T -cell therapy has been ass essed over a longer follow - up period; The mature set (120 -140 patients, maximum follow -up of 5 -years): a variant of the intermediate set where the efficacy and safety of CAR T -cell therapy has been assessed in a larger clinical study but with a similar fo llow-up period as the intermediate set. In total, six evidence sets were developed spanning the separate TPPs (three sets for \"bridge to HSCT\" , and three sets for \"curative intent\" ). Each of the three evidence sets included hypothetical efficacy and safety data for CAR T -cell therapy and for a historical control. For consistency across TPPs and evidence sets, the same historical control and data was considered in all scenarios. 1.5.2 Development of exemplar cost -effectiveness model - summary of approach and key findings Two de novo decision models were developed to assess the cost -effectiveness of CAR T -cell therapy within the two separate TPPs (\" bridge to HSCT\" and \" curative intent\" ) across each of the separate evidence sets. Although, a number of common inputs a nd assumptions were employed across both CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 30 models, the two models had important structural differences which led to differences both in the underling modelling approach as well as in the use of external evidence. In the \"bridge to HSCT\" scenario, the primary health benefits of treatment with CAR -T cell therapy were assumed to be driven by an increase in the proportion of patients receiving HSCT and the subsequent success of HSCT itself (based on remission and MRD status). The introduction of an epidemiological \"link\" between a potential established surrogate outcome/process (i.e. MRD and HSCT status) and final health benefits (i.e. overall survival and QALYs) also enabled the use of external evidence to be utilised alongside the separate h ypothetical evidence sets generated. A landmark responder model was developed, incorporating evidence from the hypothetical evidence sets to inform short -term outcomes on remission, HSCT and MRD status and external evidence to estimate overall survival con ditional on these shorter -term outcomes. The key assumption employed within this scenario is that external evidence substantiating the relationship between MRD and HSCT status in studies in which CAR T -cells have not been used can be generalised to patien ts in whom CAR -T cells have been used. Importantly, results of our validation work appears to demonstrate that, with minor calibration and adjustment, the combination of trial reported evidence on short -term outcomes (remission, HSCT and MRD status) and ex ternal evidence appeared to closely match the overall survival estimates directly reported within the studies used to generate the evidence sets for CAR T -cell therapy and the comparator (clofarabine). In the \" curative intent \" model, a different assumptio n was employed; specifically that the CAR T -cell therapy itself potentially confers longer -term and potentially curative benefits without the need to bridge to HSCT. In this context, the case for use a structural link between final health benefits and a surrogate outcome or process such as HSCT appears more limited. Instead, a simple three state partitioned survival model was developed to model long -term outcomes via the direct extrapolation of overall survival data from the evidence sets. An important c onsideration within the \"curative intent\" model was whether the use of conventional parametric survival functions (e.g. exponential, Weibull, log -normal etc.) would adequately capture a less conventional hazard function that might be observed for a potenti ally curative treatment; and how this might be affected by different levels of precision and maturity of evidence. Consequently, our work considered the goodness of fit of conventional survival functions and more flexible \"spline - based\" survival models. A key finding was that the more flexible survival models appeared to more closely approximate the hazard function across each of the evidence sets. Although the use of these more flexible survival models are briefly discussed within existing NICE technical support documents, we are not aware of any examples of their use to date within the NICE TA process. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 31 Consequently, further research may be required to more formally consider the appropriateness of alternative survival modelling approaches to regenerative m edicines and cell -based therapies, including more flexible models and cure fraction models. The importance of the level of data maturity in deriving robust survival projections for the economic model was evident in our results from the \"curative intent\" model. Whilst the spline models appeared to generate a robust fit to the data over the first 3 months of the KM estimate used in the minimum dataset, the functions were not able to accurately predict the tail of distribution. Furthermore, considerable variat ion was evident in the predicted long -term survival of the modelled cohort employing different parametric functions. We concluded that it was unlikely that a single survival distribution could adequately characterise uncertainties over the longer -term extr apolation period in the minimum evidence set. To more formally account for the uncertainty surrounding choice of survival distribution, a model averaging approach was adopted. This technique involves the parameterisation of uncertainty surrounding the cho ice of distribution, combining results from a series of alternative survival functions as part of a weighted distribution. This approach samples both the parametric uncertainty associated within each distribution and the uncertainty (or weights) surroundin g the choice of preferred method. Through the probabilistic analysis, it is therefore possible to estimate the joint distribution of uncertainty around the parameter estimates and the choice of survival function. In contrast to the minimum set, the additi onal data maturity in the intermediate and mature evidence sets results in greater certainty over the long -term survival benefits of treatment. This leads to reduced variability in the potential trajectories for the survival benefits of treatment. In addit ion, with more mature evidence, the fitted survival models are better able to predict the tail of the KM. Therefore, unlike the \"bridge to HSCT\" model, additional evidence maturity in the \"curative intent\" model leads to different projections of survival b enefit, as well as impacting on the parametric uncertainty surrounding model extrapolations. Given the inevitable uncertainties which are likely to exist regarding the longer -term benefits of regenerative medicines and cell -based therapies, further method ological research could be usefully undertaken to help inform how these uncertainties might be appropriately quantified in a transparent manner to inform subsequent decisions. A key consideration here would be the extent to which potential weights can be d efined prior to the Committee's deliberations or should be more directly informed by them. Given the potential complexity in both undertaking these analyses and communicating the results, more efforts should be made to ensure models are developed to ensure that informal judgements can be more explicitly incorporated in a timely and transparent manner. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 32 Assumptions, strengths, limitations A key assumption employed within both models is that from year 5 onwards in the model, all patients who remained alive we re assumed to experience a similar mortality risk profile consistent with a long - term survivor of ALL. This assumption reduced some of the longer -term uncertainties that inevitably arise from the extrapolation of the data beyond the maximum reported follow -up across the evidence sets considered for CAR T -cell therapies. Additional follow -up data could be used to test the validity of such an approach any claims of longer -term benefits. Our searches to inform other model parameters identified further importa nt uncertainties. The existing HRQoL data in ALL was limited and several assumptions were required. Importantly, no existing CAR T -study had incorporated measures of HRQoL that could be considered directly in the model. In the absence of this data, assumpt ions were made based on external studies to account for the possible magnitude of HRQoL benefits of achieving remission, alongside any negative impacts due to the mode of therapy (i.e. HSCT, chemotherapy) and specific adverse events, specifically CRS and B-cell aplasia. Finally, our research also identified important uncertainties regarding key elements of the CAR T -cell process (e.g. leukapheresis, conditioning therapies, level of hospitalisation required for different aspects such as conditioning, subse quent administration and monitoring etc.) and associated costs. Additional evidence needs to be provided by manufacturers to enable these potential costs to the NHS to be calculated more accurately. The costs of HSCT and any additional costs that may aris e due to longer -term management of patients were also an important source of uncertainty. A variety of possible sources were identified in our review and important differences observed across these. Further studies would be useful to more formally cost the short and longer -term implications of HSCT in paediatric populations and to also determine the generalisability of studies reporting estimates from outside the UK. Although the existence of possible learning curves was identified as an important issue in the conceptual review, these were not directly considered within the exemplar. Some aspects of these may become more apparent as larger studies report, particularly involving centres with different levels of expertise. As experience with using CAR T -cell t herapies develops, this may have important implications for both the identification and management of potential adverse events, as well as provision of the therapy itself. An assumption is made in the exemplar model is that the different stages of the proc ess for CAR T -cells would require separate hospitalisation (i.e. for the initial conditioning therapy and later for the subsequent administration of the CAR T -cells and subsequent monitoring). However, aspects of the process may evolve over time such that subsequent CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 33 administration and monitoring may be undertaken in a less resource intensive setting. Although the existence of learning curves has received significant attention in the clinical literature, to date the implication for and application within cos t-effectiveness analysis remains limited and warrants further investigation. Finally, an important assumption made within the exemplar relates to the acquisition cost of CAR T - cell therapy itself. In the absence of a commercially available product and pub lished price, an assumption was made that the manufacturer would employ a value -based approach to their decision such that the resulting cost -effectiveness (ICER) estimate was close to NICE's cost -effectiveness threshold. In the context of the exemplar, th is was assumed to be based on the maximum range of the threshold considered by NICE assuming the existing \"End of Life\" criteria are met. Importantly, this price is not considered to be indicative of the final acquisition cost that might be set when commer cially available products are available. Neither are we presuming that NICE's current \"End of Life\" criteria would apply. Instead, the basis for setting the price on the basis of an existing cost - effectiveness threshold was to enable different interested p arties to better understand the potential impact of other uncertainties (e.g. precision and maturity of evidence) within NICE's current decision making process, identifying potential trade -offs that may exist and illustrating how these uncertainties might be more explicitly addressed within different MEAs (i.e. evidence generation and/or pricing schemes). Although it is clearly possible to examine a range of different possible prices for the CAR T-cell therapies within the exemplar, it was considered that this approach may result in the subsequent Panel decision process becoming unmanageable (i.e. multiple pricing scenarios) and would lessen the generalisability learning which the exemplar was developed to highlight. 1.5.3 Assessment of cost -effectiveness, unc ertainty and the value of alternative policy options - summary of approach and key findings The primary purpose of these assessments was to estimate the potential cost -effectiveness of CAR T - cell therapy within the separate scenarios considered and to high light key uncertainties surrounding these results. An important aspect of this work was also to consider how these estimates could be presented and communicated to the Panel to inform their deliberations. In doing this we considered analyses based on appro aches routinely requested within NICE's existing methods guide. We also undertook additional analyses that may provide useful additional insights to help inform subsequent committee deliberations and the potential nature of such analyses. The sequence of assessments presented started with a conventional assessment of cost -effectiveness at the patient level based on the minimum evidence set. Disaggregated estimates of the costs and outcomes were estimated, together with resulting cost -effectiveness estimate s based on the ICER. These results were also expressed using Net Health Effects (NHEs), representing the difference CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 34 between any health gained with the intervention and health foregone elsewhere in the health care system, expressed either in monetary and QA LY terms. The impact of uncertainties was explored using conventional one -way sensitivity analyses (i.e. varying individual parameters or specific assumptions) and probabilistic approaches (i.e. exploring the impact of joint uncertainty across all paramet ers). Conventional scatter -plots and acceptability curves were utilised to graphically show the impact of parameter uncertainties and other methodological uncertainties (e.g. the appropriate discount rate). The analyses also explored the potential impact i f the Panel were to consider the criteria met for applying the non -reference -case discount rate of 1.5% for costs and health effects. Impact on the NHS In addition to the analyses undertaken using the conventional reference case approaches, a series of more exploratory analyses were also undertaken. In particular, the per -patient assessments were subsequently scaled up to population assessments, requiring an estimate of the number of potentially eligible patients (assumed to be approximately 38 patients per annum) and an assessment of the \"technology time -horizon\" i.e. the period over which the therapy might be utilised within clinical practice (assumed to be 10 years in the exemplar). Although the presentation of population -level analyses are not formally requested within the existing NICE Methods Guide for reporting cost - effectiveness results, an assessment of population impact is required within Section 5.12 (Impact on the NHS). Hence, these exploratory analyses were considered to be consistent with the NICE Methods Guide's requirement to consider population impact and the specific requests within Section 6.4.1 (Research recommendations) for the committee to balance the potential NHEs of current and future NHS patients when considering making research rec ommendations. The results of the population based analyses were summarised in terms of incremental NHE (both in terms of QALYs and equivalent monetary value) together with an assessment of the probability that CAR T -cells were cost -effective. Alongside the se more conventional assessments, an assessment of the scale of the likely consequences of uncertainty was considered to be potentially informative to the Panel, particularly in deliberations related to possible research recommendations. An estimate of the consequences of existing decision uncertainty was subsequently derived, reflecting the potential magnitude of NHEs that could be gained if uncertainty surrounding this decision could be resolved immediately. Impact of alternative pricing scenarios Using t he different analyses, the impact of alternative pricing scenarios were also explored, including conventional PAS type schemes (i.e. equivalent to a fixed price reduction) as well as more CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 35 sophisticated schemes based on pay for performance and leasing appro aches. Similarly, the impact of the alternative evidence sets was explored to establish the implications of increased precision and maturity assumed in the intermediate and mature evidence sets. Quantifying potential uncertainties An important considerati on within this work is the extent to which current NICE methods and processes are likely to appropriately quantify the potential uncertainties surrounding regenerative medicines and cell -based therapies to ensure that appropriate policy decision are made r egarding adoption and spread of potentially promising technologies. Our findings show that the conventional assessments requested within the current TA process may not be sufficient. Estimates of the ICER and associated probability that CAR -T therapy is co st-effective at a specific threshold, were shown to be virtually identical in one of the TPPs despite being based on 3 different evidence sets with varying levels of precision and maturity. Similarly, across both TPPs, several of the alternative pricing schemes again reported similar estimates of the ICER and associated probabilities that CAR -T were cost-effective. Consequently, it is unclear how these differences would be reflected within the current deliberative process. Whilst it is acknowledged that dif ferent conclusions might be reached by the Panel based on informal judgements, the importance of ensuring transparency in subsequent decisions remains a key principle of the Institute and appears critical for manufacturers in developing appropriate R&D and pricing strategies. Presentation of the scale of consequences using population NHE appeared to provide a clearer distinction between the different evidence sets and an assessment of the impact of alternative pricing schemes. Consequently, their more rout ine application within the TA process for regenerative and cell-based therapies may be an important consideration for future processes. Furthermore, as demonstrated by the exemplar, comparisons of this nature could also provide a more transparent and expli cit basis for considering the value of direct price reductions that might be realised via a conventional PAS compared to the provision of additional evidence, in terms of reducing decision uncertainty and its consequences. Such information might provide an important basis for discussions between manufacturers, NICE and other relevant parties in terms of how the existing uncertainties that exist might be appropriately managed ensuring risks and benefits are more appropriately shared. 1.6 Issues arising from the NICE panel meeting A separate panel and meeting were convened by NICE to discuss the findings of the exemplar appraisal. The panel included clinical experts and current and past NICE committee members and was chaired by Professor Andrew Stevens (current c hair NICE TA committee). The objective of the panel meeting was to assess the clinical and cost -effectiveness evidence informing the separate TPPs and to CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 36 identify potential issues and challenges for the NICE TA appraisal process and methods. A summary of the clinical and cost -effectiveness evidence was presented to the panel, who were asked to deliberate on the range of scenarios and provide 'hypothetical' decisions and outline the main considerations for these. The key consideration relating to the clini cal effectiveness was how decisions can be made for technologies that look highly promising but for which the evidence base is highly uncertain, at a potentially high, but actually unknown, risk of bias, and extremely immature. As the context for appraisal s of regenerative medicines is likely to be in the context of conditional regulatory approval, the panel considered that is would be important to know what research had been mandated by the regulator, and hence what uncertainty could reasonably be expected to be resolved in the near future. There was concern regarding the difficulty of decommissioning services following (what later proved to be) incorrect recommendations. A key consideration regarding the cost -effectiveness results and implications for the 'hypothetical' decisions was whether the panel considered that existing criteria considered within the TA process in relation to End of Life (EoL) could be applied. The panel accepted that the exemplar met the requirements of the EoL criteria but conclude d that other considerations (e.g. innovation) would not be applied in addition. They further noted that the criteria may need to be reconsidered given the large extension of life expectancy possible with regenerative medicines. The panel raised issues regarding the possible nature and magnitude of any irrecoverable costs that might be incurred by the NHS and the implications for their decisions. The panel acknowledged that the different pricing schemes had important impacts both in terms of the ICER but also in terms of the allocation of any risk between the NHS and manufacturers. The concept of the 'leasing approach' was identified as a potentially important option . The panel discussed the additional evidence sets that had been g enerated for each TPP (Scenarios 3 and 4). The panel understood that the scale of consequences was reduced in the more mature evidence sets due to increased precision. The panel acknowledged the challenges and difficulties of generating mature evidence at the point a product is launched. In particular, the panel noted that a comparison of the magnitude of the incremental NHE and the consequences of decision uncertainty provided an important starting point for deliberations in considering the scale of the NH E that could be achieved by immediate approval and that which might be achieved by further research. Overall, t he panel noted that the exploratory approaches provided a clearer and potentially important distinction between the different evidence sets and t he impact of alternative pricing schemes. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 37 However, the panel expressed difficulty in reaching consensus decisions for the range of scenarios presented without a formal reference point to establish whether the consequences were sufficiently high to impact o n their decisions and/or potential research recommendations. 1.7 Summary conclusions Our research found that the clinical evidence about regenerative medicines is expected to be associated with much uncertainty. Existing methods are available to adjust for a nd minimise the risk of bias and uncertainty in data analyses. Whilst there will be a significant level of uncertainty in determining the long term costs and benefits to patients and the NHS, the existing methods available to estimate the implications of t his uncertainty are sufficient. The use of risk sharing agreements (Managed Entry Schemes) between the NHS and manufacturers of regenerative medicines should be investigated further. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 38 Introduction and aims 2 The term regenerative medicine refers to a fiel d of research and clinical applications dealing with the process of replacing or regenerating human cells, tissues or organs to restore or establish normal function.1 Regenerative medicine is not a new field of medicine , since it encompasses bone marrow or organ transplants. However, the development of newer types of regenerative medicine such as cell- based therapies (often using stem cells or progenitor cells to produce tissues), gene therapy, and tissue engineering has raised the possibility that diseases which are currently deemed chronic or fatal may be curable. Most regenerative medicines will be classed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as being 'advanced -therapy medicinal products' (ATMP s) which are essentially treatments based on engineered cells or tissues. Although regenerative medicines may offer great potential, the route to this new era of medicine might not be straightforward. Product development and production to commercially viabl e levels may hold many challenges. Furthermore, efficacy and safety evaluations of regenerative medicines may be difficult when compared with conventional pharmaceutical treatments. For example, while the adverse effects of pharmaceuticals are likely to im prove when they are discontinued, some regenerative medicines may cause prolonged toxicities, especial ly when cells persist lon g-term; such adverse effects might also not become evident for years. A House of Lords Science and Technology Committee inquiry i nto regenerative medicine was set up to pinpoint the UK's strengths in this area , to identify barriers to translation (applying findings from basic research to a clinical setting) and commercialisation (primarily delivering treatments in the healthcare mar ket), and to recommend solutions. The repor t - published in July 2013 - concluded that although the UK has a great potential resource in the NHS which could make it an attractive place for investment, it is currently underprepared to realise the full poten tial of regenerative medicine. One of the report's recommendations was that the Department of Health should establish a regenerative medicine expert working group to develop an NHS regenerative medicine delivery readiness strategy and action plan, and repo rt back to the Secretary of State for Health by December 2014.2 In response to this , the Regenerative Medicine Expert Group (RMEG) was convened and was given the remit to monitor progress on the Government's response to the House of Lords inquiry, and to develop, in partnership with other stakeholders, a strategy for regenerative medicine in the NHS and provide an action plan. One of the major discussion areas for RMEG was that, even where therapies have real potentia l, this may not be known with a high level of certainty at the time an ATMP first comes to market as the available evidence base is often limited. In its report3 the RMEG stated that, \"In order for NHS patients to benefit from regenerative medicines, robust and effective product evaluation has to be made to inform commissioning decisions. National Insti tute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance is essential in speeding up the adoption and spread of high value CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 39 regenerative medicines in healthcare. However, applying the Institute's appraisal methodology, based on cost utility analysis, to products whose true value may not be known for many years can be challenging, due to the inherent uncertainty of estimating long -term benefit from evidence derived from short -term studies.\" The assessment of the cost -effectiveness of regenerative medicines may rai se particular challenges compared to other types of technologies. Important challenges may include: the potential curative nature and claims of long -term/lifetime benefits; the potentially rapid changes that may arise in product characteristics over time; potential longer -term patient safety issues due to persistence; organisational and scaling issues, as well as the potentially significant up -front costs that may arise. Whether the conceptual differences between regenerative medicine s and other types of te chnologies (e.g. pharmaceuticals and medical devices) require a different approach to the conduct and assessment of cost -effectiv eness needs to be investigated. The RMEG Evaluation and Commissioning Subgroup proposed that NICE commission a \"mock technology appraisal\" on an exemplar regenerative medicine produc t and develop an outline plan for such a study. This proposal was reflected in the final report and recommendations of RMEG,3 which stated further, \"We encourage the Institute to consider the findings from these studies with a view to ass essing whether changes to its methods and processes are needed. Evaluation and commissioning, as with all steps of the product development pathway, need t o be supported by clear, up -to-date and accessible advice and guidance. \" Through RMEG subgroup discu ssions and further input from the Cell Therapy Catapult, it was concluded that undertaking a study invol ving a real commercial product wa s not feasible for a number of reasons: there would be significant commercial sensitivities; products undergoi ng regulatory review would be candidates for a real appraisal; and using a product at an earlier stage in clinical development is not helpful as the evidence base would be even less mature and, therefore, it would not have the attributes of an 'exemplar' p roduct. It was therefore proposed to undertake the evalu ation of a hypothetical product: CAR T -cell therapies (see section 4.1.1) . This decision was made on the basis that CAR T -cell therapies are quite a new product class - none are currently licensed - for which there is emerging evidence of clinical benefit. An evaluation of these therapies might also appropriately exemplify some of the main challenges faced by new regenerative medicines. The Cell Therapy Catapult has knowledge and experience with gene m odified T cells and therefore worked with others on the advisory group to develop the ba sis of the target product profile (TPP) .

The Committee for A dvanced Therapies (CAT) is the EMA committee responsible for assessing the quali ty, safety and efficacy of ATMPs (and for following scientific developments in the field ). The EMA and CAT have issued a range of documents providing guidance regarding the development of ATMPs ; one of these (issued in 2008, based on the requirements of an EU regulation) is a guideline for post -authorisation follow up entitled Guideline on safety and efficacy follow -up - risk management of advanced therapy medicinal products . Such rules were needed due to the \"novelty, complexity, and technical specificity\" of ATMPs.4 In this guideline the concerns about risks relate to: Living donors (where applicable) Quality characteristics (e.g. orig in and characteristics of cells, vectors; quality assurance issues) Storage and distribution of product (e.g. stability, preservation, thawing) Administration and re -administration procedures (e.g. immune reactions) Interaction of the product and the patie nt (e.g. immunogenicity, malignancy) Scaffolds, matrices and biomaterials (e.g. biodegradation) Product persistence (e.g. availability of rescue procedures or antidotes) Healthcare professionals, caregivers or other close contacts with the product Concerns about the efficacy of ATMPs relate mainly to the uncertainty about how effective they may be in \"real life\" settings in the long -term. They include: Possible temporal changes in the characteristics of the living material in ATMPs may affect efficacy Time requir ed for new tissue to be fully functional may be several years (use of surrogate endpoints needed for marketing authorisation, but confirmation with clinical endpoints needed in post-authorisation phase) Some ATMPs may be a once in a life time treatmen t: long -term follow up needed to demonstrate sustainability of efficacy Efficacy may be highly dependent on the quality of the administration procedure (e.g. patient conditioning, surgery). This may differ between clinical trial and normal healthcare settings CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 42 Cell therapy products with a limited life -time may require an efficacy follow -up system that monitors the dynamics of efficacy (will help determine need and timing of reapplication) The issues highlighted in the guideline for the design of the studies needed to monitor long -term safety and efficacy included careful consideration of: Sample size (high potential for drop -outs over many years of follow up) Dynamics of the disease and effects of the product (different approaches needed for detecting early v ersus late complications) The use of usual clinical practice for follow -up whenever possible to limit addition al procedures and interventions Appropriate duration of follow up of living donors (where applicable) Feasibility of follow up of close contacts a nd offspring (where applicable) Both the safety and efficacy follow up systems are defined as any systematic collection and collation of data that is designed in a way that enables learning about safet y and/or efficacy of an ATMP. This may include passive or active surveillance, observational st udies, or clinical trials. The guideline stresses that both the efficacy and the safety follow -up systems are not a substitute for the need for adequate data to be available at the time of authorisation to enable pro per benefit -risk evaluation.4 3.2 Overview of wider regulatory evidence requirement issues and the evolving pathways for approval The ethics, feasibility and reliability of small randomised controlled trials Although the randomised controlled trial is the expected level of evidence needed for regulatory assessments, it is recognised that for some indications such expectations are unrealistic. Conducting RCTs in populations with severe or advanced disease may be problematic for a variety of reasons. Such populations may be very small and, consequently, recruitment into an adequately sized trial would require a large number of centres and take a very long time, and great expense. Also, when no alternative treatment s exist, patients with life -threatening disease or severe morbidity typically need, and desire, accelerated access to innovative new therapies. P atients with more severe or advanced disease may be more willing to accept the risks of an experimental therapy . In such situations randomisation to a control treatment may be ethically problematic (due to absence of clinical equipoise). A HTA review of ethical issues in the design and conduct of RCTs described numerous situations where alternative non -randomised d esigns are morally or practicably preferable. These included: where large differences between treatments are expected; when a disease, if left untreated, is lethal and for which there is no known effective treatment (i.e. unmet need) ; and when a disease is rare and CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 43 recruitment is slow.5 Additionally, when trial populations are small, it may be difficult to differentiate a true treatme nt effect from a chance effect. I mportant chance imbalances in relevant prognostic factors between groups at baseline are mor e likely in small trials . The HTA review highlighted the problem of underpowered RCTs which were described as 'necessarily unethical' as they were unlikely to produce clear -cut answers. This argument was supported by 15 articles which stipulated the statis tical necessity for random errors in measured effects of treatments to be small in comparison with the size of the therapeutic effect sought. Other articles in the review discussed the ethics of stopping RCTs early when there is some evidence of efficacy and the subsequent problems this may cause : reduced statistical precision, clinicians not being persuaded by results, and secondary trial aims being compromised being some of the key problems . A related HTA review discussed further the ethical issues whic h may arise when early -phase (e.g. single -arm) trials produce very encouraging results: it may be unethical to conduct a fu rther trial if the intervention is apparently effective in a small number of patients. In such a situation the argument for a trial r ests on demonstrating a grey area between a reasonable hope that the intervention is effective in a few patients and a rational and justified belief that it is effective for the studied patient population more generally (i.e. the evidence to date has enoug h external validity).6 Possible alternatives to the randomised controlled trial More recently, a framework for using unfamiliar trial designs when rare disease s are studied has outlined several possible alternative approaches.7 The framework aims to facilitate research when populations are small. Two of the 'adaptive' desi gns outlined may be particularly relevant for regenerative medicines , where treatment intentions may be curative. The first is responsive -adaptive randomisation, which maximises allocation to the most effective treatment and minimises the required sample s ize. Outcomes for previous participants affect the subsequent treatment allocation probabilities. This 'play the winner' rule has the potential to reduce the number of patients who are allocated to less effective treatment and can therefore reduce the ethi cal concerns associated with randomisation. However, this design is limited to studies which assess rapidly available outcomes (as results from previous patients are needed to influence future allocations). Modified designs have also been outlined to count er the criticism that comparisons may be obtained in which only one patient has received conventional treatment. The second adaptive design which may also be useful for studying regenerative medicines is the internal pilot design; this design eliminates th e loss of scarce eligible participants because of participation in a prior pilot study. Once the pilot phase is finished a sample size is recalculated with the study continuing until this number is recruited; patients from the pilot phase are included in t he final analysis. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 44 An EMA reflection paper on methodological issues associated with adaptive designs suggested that such designs 'would be best utilised as a tool for planning clinical trials in areas where it is necessary to cope with difficult experimen tal situations'. Cited examples of such situations included 'small populations or orphan diseases with constraints to the maximum amount of evidence that can be provided' and where there is 'ethical constraints to experimentation'.8 However, the FDA raise d two principal issues with adaptive design methods more broadly:9 whether the adaptation process has led to design, analysis, or cond uct flaws that have introduced bias that increases the chance of a false conclusion that the treatment is effective (a Type I error) whether the adaptation process has led to positive study results that are difficult to interpret irrespective of having con trol of Type I error This draft FDA guidance document also noted that for some of the more recently developed adaptive methods (including adaptive randomisation methods), the magnitude of the risk of bias and the size of the potential bias, and how to elim inate these effects, are not yet well understood. Although adaptive designs may be useful in some situations it is still likely that single -arm trials will form the basis of many submissions fo r the regulatory approval of regenerative medicines (due to th e nature of the target populations) . Nevertheless, a study which reviewed 31 oncology drugs or biologics approved by the FDA (between 1973 and 2006) without a randomised trial that incorporated a comparator treatment, supportive care, or placebo arm, concl uded that such drugs have a reassuring record of long -term safety and efficacy despite the fact that n early all the evidence studies were single -arm phase II trials. The median number of patients studied per approval was 79 (range 40 to 413); response rate was the primary endpoint for most drugs, and the median objective response rate was 33%. At the time of publication (2009) all but one of the drugs were still approved; marketing authorisation for gefitinib was rescinded after an RCT showed no survival im provement. Nineteen drugs have additional uses, with formal FDA approvals obtained f or 11.10 Evolving regulatory pathways Since the late 1980s and early 1990s, regulators and HTA bodies/payers around the world have produced new approache s to provide patients with timely access to new medicines.11 These new regulatory pathways can also improve competitiveness; shortened product development times prior to licensing can be very beneficial and more appealing to emerging small and medium sized enterprises. An overview of the relevant EMA regulatory accelerated access pathways is presented in Table 1. The main mechanism for accelerated access of these pathways is the reduced development time.

Adaptive licensing 2014 pilot Medicines to treat an unmet medical need for a serious condition , especially where no alternative therapies exist. Open to interventions in the early stages of development (during or prior to phase II). Multi -stakeholder participation desirable . Enhanced monitoring of drug safety and drug utili sation controls required after initial authoris ation. Adapted from Baird et al 201411 The EMA's most recent development in this area is the adaptive licensing pilo t programme which was launched in 2014. The programme utilises the regulatory processes within the existing EU legal framework and is defined as being a prospectively planned adaptive approach to bringing drugs to market. It is more of a staggered iterativ e system than previous approval pathways. Such a 'life -cycle approach' to acquiring and (re)assessing evidence will consider the basis of decision making in the following stages of a product's life cycle: development, licensing, reimbursement, monitoring/p ost- license evidence and drug utilisation.11 Importantly, the approach encompasses both the authorised indication and the potential further therapeutic uses of the medicine. The EMA changed the name of the pilot project from 'adaptive licensing ' to 'adaptive pathways ' to better reflect the idea of a life - span approach. The pilot project aims to examine whether this kind of approach to medicine development and authorisation will offer advantages in terms of achieving the best balance between the need for timely patient access with the importance of providing adequate, evolving information on benefits and risks. In so doing it is expected to develop t hinking in the following areas:12 CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 46 To encourage developers of medicines to consider all regulatory tools and flexibilities within the existing EU legal framework when planning the life -cycle of the medicine d evelopment. To explore the extent to which regulatory demands for generation of evidence around efficacy and safety are compatible with demands around evidence generation from other stakeholders (e.g. HTA bodies, payers, patient organisations). To invest igate in a timely manner the hurdles that exist in realising the most efficient medicine development pathways, including the role and limitations of real -world data. Ideas for refining and improving this life-span approach are developing at pace. For example, with MAPPs (Medicines Adaptive Pathways to Patients ) the development plan across targe t populations and indications will be agreed up-front with the EMA, which distinguishes the MAPPs process from the conventional indi cation expansion approach. The MAPPs plan may include a ran ge of studies, such as RCTs , single -arm studies, pragmatic trials and other forms of real world study.13 A newly formed public -private project called ADAPT SMART ( Accelerated Development of Appropriate Patient Therapies: a Sustainable, Multi -stakeholder Approach from Resea rch to Treatment -outcomes ), which is funded by the EU Innovative Medicines Initiative, aims to facilitate and accelerate the availability of MAPPs.14 NICE is one of the 32 international partners which together represent regulators, patients, academia, and industry. The challenge for ADAPT SMART is to d evelop a MAPPs model that aligns the needs of all stakeholders, including patients, member state payers, regulators, medical practitioners and industry. A major task will be the identification of opportunities and obstacles, and to provide a framework for MAPPs that will overcome the latter and seize the forme r. ADAPT SMART will address the challenges to the broad implementation of MAPPs by exploring new concepts to align the various stakeholders and create a consensus on what evidence will be required, how multiple sources of available data can be best used to facilitate MAPPs , and which scientific challenges related to MAPPs need to be addressed.14 In the UK there is another initiative which may facilitate the pathway to market: the MHRA operates an early access to medicines scheme (EAMS) which was lau nched in April 2014. This voluntary scheme (which does not replace the normal licensing procedures) is aimed at unlicensed or off -label treatments deemed by the MHRA to be 'promising innovative medicines' (PIMs) for treating life - threatening or seriously d ebilitating conditions for which there is unmet need. Once a PIM designation is obtained (stage 1 of the process) , the MHRA can then provide benefit and risk information (stage 2 - scientific opinion) to doctors who may wish to prescribe the unlicensed medicine under their own responsibility . However, it appears somewhat unclear how the EAMS assessment output may impact on ongoing or forthcoming EMA assessment of the same therapy (e.g. in terms of spee ding up processes, or reducing repetition of information). Further uncertainty around EAMS exists regar ding CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 47 how therapies with this regulatory status can be funded. As EAMS is not accompanied by any funding arrangements, meeting the costs of the therapy is currently the responsib ility of the manufacturer ; this can act as a barrier to adoption, especially for high cost therapies produced by small enterprises. Regenerative medicines in the new regulatory environment The experience gleaned from the EMA adapt ive licensing pilot so far appears to be quite limited with respect to regenerative medicines : as of May 2015 one of only three candidate ATMPs had been selected for a 'stage II' proposal.15 By far the most accommodating regulatory environment for developing regenerative medicines is currently Japan, where, un der the new 2014 legislation regenerative medicines can receive accelerated conditional approval after a single clinical study, provided the trial demonstrated the therapy to be safe, with evidence of a probable therapeutic benefit. This approach aims to dramatically accelerate patient access and meaningfully shorten clinical development times, thus promoting investment (since faster, less expensive development, coupled with acce lerated commercialisation, would shift the risk -reward ratio favourably from an investment perspective).16 However, there is concern that this a pproach may leave Japan with regenerative medic ines which are unrecognised by other countries due to efficacy concerns: the lack of an explicit plan for determining efficacy during the conditional approval period points to a strong underlying assumption that regenerative medicines will ultimately prove efficacious; experience from other areas of clinical research suggest that such optimism may be misplaced.17 The initial demonstration of safety based only on phase I trial data is an additional ma jor concern. The concern raised about the limited evidence which will likely be presented when a product is submitted for regulatory approval is by no means limited to the Japanese regenerative medicine experience. Since many regenerativ e medicines will be developed with the initial aim of treating small patient populations where there is unmet need, it is likely that they will be evaluated via a regulatory pathway which offers patients accelerated access to the new treatment. A consequen ce of this is that many of the studies submitted will be early phase, small single -arm trials. Nevertheless, the Japanese regulations excepted, the newer regulatory pathways being developed across the world do not focus specifically on facilitating the lic ensing of regenerative medicines. The newer pathways are primarily aimed at addressing unmet need in serious conditions where no alternatives exist, regardless of the type of technology. However, much of the focus and expectation for success in this area s eems to have been directed at regenerative medicines, possibly because they may evolve over time and may therefore, ultimately, not be restricted and limited by having single modes of action. The submission of evidence which is based on single -arm studies appears to be less to do with regenerative medicines being a 'special case' category of intervention s, but rather a consequence of the seriously ill, very CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 48 small populations with unmet medical needs which are often the initial target of new regenerative medicines.CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 49 Technology appraisal methodology issues which may be particular ly 4 relevant to regenerative medicines 4.1 Clinical efficacy and safety issues arising from EMA, NICE and FDA assessments of licensed regenerative medicines 4.1.1 Methods From the regenerative medicine literature and experts in the field we sought to identify regenerative medicines which have been granted marketing authorisation in the EU. In addition to EMA assessment documents, we also sought any NICE or FDA documents. We extracted key details from these reports, with a primary focus on identifying issues which might be unique, or particular, to regenerative medicines. 4.1.2 Results We identified six regenerative medicines which are (or have been) licensed in were identified - all were autologous. Summary details are presented in Table 2; more compreh ensive details can be found in Appendix 1 , Table 43. ChondroCelect and MACI are both therapies for treating knee cartilage defects. ChondroCelect was the first ATMP to receive marketing authorisation, in 2009. The marketing authorisation for MACI was suspended in September 2014 as an authorised manufactur ing site no longer existed . Holoclar is a therapy used for treating corneal lesions resulting from burns to the eye. In 2014 it became the first stem cell -based ATMP to gain regulatory approval (conditional marketing authorisation was granted) . Provenge is an active cellular asympt omatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic hormone -relapsed prostate cancer where chemotherapy is not yet indicated ; this therapy purportedly helps the immune system to selectively attack cancer cells (rather than directly attacking tumour cells, as happen s with CAR T -cell therapies) . EMA marketing authorisation was granted in June 2013 but withdrawn in May 2015 at the request of the manufacturer , for commercial reasons . Glybera is used to treat familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency (a rare genetic disorde r) with associated pancreatitis. Its mechanism of action is viral vector delivery of a therapeutic gene to muscle cells. In 2012 it became the first gene therapy to be approved in Europe or the USA. The R eCell spray on skin system is a regenerative medicin e device; it harvests a small amount of a patient's skin cells which are then processed to produce a mixed cell population for immediate delivery onto burn wound surfaces. ReCell can be given rapidly as there is no need for proliferation of the harvested skin cells. A CE mark was granted in 2005 (under medical devices Directive 93/42/EEC ). CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 50 Study designs Randomised trial evidence formed the basis of the regulatory submissions for four of the se six regenerative medicines. This would be expected since , for the four therapies in question (ChondroCelect, MACI, ReCell and Provenge) , the disorders being treated were not rare and alternative therapies existed. However, both the EPAR and NICE ERG reports commented on the lack of blinding and the use of cross -over which allowed placebo patients to receive active treatment following disease progression , making interpretation of the post -progression overall survival results difficult . Nevertheless there were no design issues for the other three therapies (ChondroCelect, MACI and ReCell ) demonstrating that AT MP/regenerative medicine status in itself may not necessarily be a barrier to submitting randomised trial evidence (as discussed at the end of Section 2) . Holoclar and Glybera were not studied in RCT s. B- both had orphan designations and had indications where there is unmet medical need; randomised trial s were therefore not viable. A single group study design was therefore deemed acceptable in both EMA assessments. However, whereas for Holoclar the CAT accepted that the condition (eye burns) would not improve spontaneously (making it more plausible that observed benefits were due to treatment) , for Glybera there were concerns that the reduction of pancreatitis events may possibly be due to temporal rari ty and inherent variability of events over time (i.e. the result ing apparent benefit may have been due to chance). Perhaps it is for this reason that these two therapies took very different routes to approval. While conditional marketing authorisation was achieved for Holoclar without any prior negative CHMP decisions, Glybera had a much more difficult route to acquiring marketing authorisation . Negative CAT and CHMP opinions on Glybera were issued in June 2011. Following a request for re -examination , the CAT recommended the granting of marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances in October 2011, but the CHMP did not recommend approval. Glybera was finally granted approval in July 2012 with a more restricted licen ce (the approval being for patien ts with lipoprotein lipase deficiency and severe or multiple pancreatitis attacks). It appears that EMA concerns about the efficacy of Glybera still remain , prompting German y's G-BA (which makes reimbursement decisions) to suspend its assessment of Glybera .18 The issue this comparison of Glybera with Holoclar raises - the likelihood of cure or improvement without experimental treatment - could be an important consideration for both the design and interpretation of future regenerative medicine trials. It is for condition s where spontaneous cure or improvement is unlikely that so much is expected of regenerative medicines; the extent of the problems perceived to result from single -arm trial evidence may well depend on the 'game changing' possibilities of the therapy being assessed.

For ChondroCelect, MACI, Holoclar and ReCell the aim is for therapeutic cel ls to become integrated in recipients for as long as possible and to ultimately produce new cells. Long -term data are needed for evaluations of true therapeutic success in this respect and adverse effects associated with longer -term persistence seem unlike ly. Unknown long -term durability was highlighted in the ChondroCelect and MACI EPARs. Although the negative persistence effects of Glybera were thought to be minimal (the risk of cancer by integration of viral vector DNA was thought to be low) the EMA's co nclusions on efficacy noted that the proposed single treatment was insufficient to provide a durable and measurable effect on triglycerides, suggesting the therapy did not persist in recipients for long enough. Little information could be found on the impl ications of the long -term persistence of Provenge within patients. However, prior to infusion into patients, Provenge is associated with a very short shelf life. An overview of t he manufacturing and scale -up issues w hich may be encountered with regenerative medicines can be found in this report's discussion . The only other adverse events which were noteworthy in terms of in forming evaluations of future regenerative medicine studies were immune reactions. For patients receiving Glybera the use of immunosuppression did not result in a reduction of unwanted immunogenicity. Acute infusion reactions were identified as a risk in patients who had received Provenge and the risk of autoimmune reactions in non -prostatic tissues could not be ruled out. Use of surrogate outcome s Both surrogate and real clinical outcomes were evaluated for five of the six regenerative medicines ; the ReCell studies did not need to use surrogates, with all outcomes having clear clinical importance. The use of surrogate outco mes was most problematic in the assessment of Provenge as the overall survival results were not supported by the progression -free survival nor the time to progression results. Many members of the CHMP felt strongly that - in light of these seemingly contra dictory results - the efficacy evidence should be convincing and ideally corroborated by other secondary endpoints, which was not the case. The NICE ERG report also highlighted the lack of consistency between the surrogate outcomes and overall survival. Su rrogate outcomes are discussed more broadly in Section 4.3. Evolving therapies A key difference between regenerative medicines and conventional medicines is the likelihood that specific treatments may change o r evolve over time. The only example of this is sue in the reports identified in this section relates to the cartilage cell (chondrocytes) treatments for cartilage defects of CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 54 the knee (MACI and ChondroCelect). When both were assessed by NICE they were third generation products. The ERG report noted the \"general problem when long -term results are needed but the technology continues to evolve\". The implication being that by the time long -term trials results become available, the therapy may well have been superseded by a (apparently superior) next - generati on treatment. The extent of this evolution is described in Table 3. Table 3 The evolution of a utologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) therapies First generation ACI-P.

Reproduced from the NICE ERG assessment report \"Autologous chondrocyte implantation for repairing symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the knee \" 4.1.3 Summary The key issues arising from the reports of lic ensed regenerative medicines , i.e. the issues which may be beneficial to con sider when appraising future regenerative medicines , were: The importance of considering the likelihood of cure or improvement without experimental treatment when evaluating the r esults of single -arm studies The positive and negative implications of long -term persistence of therapies within patients The use of reliable surrogate outcomes (i.e. the need for validation of the relationship between surrogates and real clinical outcomes) The problems of long -term evaluations when therapies evolve over time None of the six regenerative medicines approved for use in the EU to date were allogeneic therapies 4.2 Study biases: a n overview of their importance and methods to quantify and adjust for their impact Regenerative medical technologies will often seek (and receive) EMA/FDA approval with limited or no data from randomised experiments . In such cases e stimates of effectiveness will be based upon observational data and single arm experimental studies. Recent examples include Holoclar, which CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 55 received EMA authorisation based on retrospective case series (combined n= 148), and Gly bera which was licensed based on single -arm studies (combined n=27). The focus of this s ection is therefore on making comparisons using historical controls and non - randomised evidence more generally, as this is likely to represent the typical way in which single arm studi es will be used in any future regenerative medicine submissions where ev idence from randomised trials is unavailable. This section will provide an overview of the reliability of using observational data and data from single -arm trials, and current methods used to minimise potential confounding bias. Most manufacturer submissions to NICE are likely to be based on efficacy evidence from randomised trials; this overview is therefore important as it may highlight areas where NICE might consider methods development research is needed to enhance the Technology Appraisal Programme. Specifically this section seeks to address the following three questions. To what extent do estimates of effectiveness obtained from non -randomised studies (NRS) agree with those obtained from randomised trials , i.e. the quantification of bias; What techniques are available to adjust for confounding bias in NRS and how relia ble are they ? What are the specific challenges of using single -arm studies to estimate treatment effectiveness . 4.2.1 Methods Pragmatic surveys of the literature were carried out to address the se research questions . One review addressed the reliability of obtaining treatment effectiveness estimates in comparative NRS. Two further separate reviews were carried out with respect to the second research question: one focusing on methods to adjust for bias in the evidence synthesis process ; and a second on method s of analysing individual patient data from NRS. A final review explored the literature relating specifically to single -arm studies, the second For each review a number of key articles were identified using unstructured searches of Medline and studie s know n to the team. Based on these key studies snowballing techniques were then applied in which citatio n searches were carried out and references checked for relevant studies. Citations and reference s of any additional studies identified were then also c hecked until no further relevant studies were identified. Records identified in both the searches of Medline and citation searches were screened by a single reviewer and full texts of those deemed potentially relevant obtained and also screened by a singl e reviewer. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 56 4.2.2 Results 4.2.2.1 Quantification of bias in observational studies A total of 14 studies were identified as relevant t o the first research question ( Quantification of bias in observational studies ).19-32 All 14 studies relevant to the q uantification of bias in observational studies sought to quantify the extent of bias in NRS by comparing the results of randomised controlled trials with NRS. In seven of the studies22-24, 26, 27, 30data were sourced from published meta included both RCTs and NRSs. Algra et al .,19 et al21 Lonjon et al31 and Sacks et al.28 took a different appro ach and searched for NRSs that compared treatment effects and then carried out a further search to locate relevant RCTs. Beynon et al.,20 took a similar sampling approach, randomly selecting RCTs from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials database, and then conducti ng searches for NRSs that had addressed the same topic. The method of analysis in the majority of studies involved pooling the evidence from randomised and non-randomised sources separately. The resulting summary effects from the randomised and non - random ised evidence were then compared. Despite these similarities in approach a considerable range of methods were used to compare summary estimates of effect, with multiple outcome measures often being employed. Common outcomes included: Assessment of directi on of effect; Subjective assessment of overlap of confidence intervals and proximity of summary estimates; Tests of statistical difference in summary estimates of effect obtained from randomised and non - randomised evidence; The calculation of ratios of odds or risk ratios. The lack of a common method of comparison is problematic as it presents a significant barrier to making comparisons across studies and indicates a lack of consensus around how to measure the degree of conc ordance between results obtained from randomised and non -randomised studies. Furthermore, the employment of multiple methods of comparison in many studies can be considered a potential source of bias, as no attempt was made to adjust comparisons for multip le testing. Of the 14 included studies, seven19, 24, 26, 27, 29 -31concluded that there were no systematic differences in either the size or direction of effect estimates obtained from NRSs compared with those from RCTs. Five studies 20, 21, 23, 28, 32 concluded that effect estimates obtained from NRSs were systematically larger than those obtained from RCTs. This included the largest study by Ioannidis et al.,23 that contained RCTs and NRSs from 45 topic areas. The authors of the other two studies 22, 25 felt unable to CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 57 draw any meaningful conclusions about the comparability of estimates obtained from RCTs and NRSs. Study design and study quality were investigated in a number of the studies and was discussed in nearly all of the studies included in this review . Study design was identified as a likely factor in determining the reliability of estimates of clinical effectiveness obtained from non -randomised studies . A number of the studies did not consider (i.e. they excluded) NRSs which used historical controls (Concato et al.,26 Lonjon et al.31Concato26 justified th is exclusion based on previous evidence presented in Sacks et al28which reported that 79% of interventions tested were considered effective in trials with historical controls, while only 20% were considered effective in RCTs. Further empirical evidence of the potential for bias in studies using historical controls is also presented in Ioannidis et al.,23} Algra et al.,29 and Golder et al.,30who all found that there were fewer discrepancies between the results of RCTs and NRSs when studies with historical controls were excluded. Ioannidis et al. also found that results from prospective NRSs conta ined fewer discrepancies with effect estimates from randomised studies than did retrospective studies, either with current or historical controls. Investigations into broader measures of quality have also revealed similar results. MacLehose et al.24 classified NRSs as either high or low quality and observed that comparisons between randomised evidence and high -quality NRSs tended to show much smaller discrepa ncies randomised studies and low -quality NRSs . 4.2.2.2 Adjustment for bias in NRS A total of 28 studies were identified as relevant t o the first research question on the techniques available to adjust for confounding bias in NRS ; details of those reviews are presented in Appendix 2). A key factor in the reliability of estimates of effectiveness based on observational data is the statistical analysis used; a large number of studies have sought to develop and evaluate methods for adjusting and eliminating bias resulting from confounding. A summary of the studies which have looked at methods of adjust ment for confounding bias in NRS and how reliable they are is presented in Appendix 3. Overall, it is unclear which methods are most appropriate in certain circumstances and further research is needed. Furthermore, a djusting for bias when comparing single arm trials to historical controls requires individual patient data (IPD) ; this can be difficult to access though approaches for recreating IPD data have been developed such as the algorithm by Guyot et al.43 Consequently results generated from NRS will be subject to an unknown degree of uncertainty, even after adjustment for confounding. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 58 4.2.2.3 Challenges of using single -arm trials to estimate effectiveness A total of 10 articl es were identified as relevant to the issue of using single -arm trials to estimate effectiveness. One of these was a a recent review paper, Paulus et al. 2014,33 that discusses both the opportunities and challenges in using studies without a control group . Single -arm designs have the advantage of requiring fewer patients, all of whom receive the experimental treatment, thereby reducing the cost of trials in terms of patients, funding, and effort. This section discusses the issues of making comparisons using single arm studies and how c omparable results from single arm studies and comparative randomised studies. Making comparisons using single arm studies Without a direct, concurrent comparator in single group studies, both explicit and implicit comparisons are frequently made Paulus et al. 201 4.33 Implicit comparisons are made when the expected outcomes in the absence of the intervention of interest are believed to be well known, and the expected effect size from the intervention is large. Explicit comparisons are made when the investigators compare the single group of subjects before and after an intervention, or when the investigators choose to incorporate a historical comparator in the analysis (e.g., historical data from the research institution or from an external cohort or existing database). Each of these alternat ive study designs has particular challenges and advantages. The particular challenges are discusse d below and summari sed in Table 4. Table 4 Summary of challenges to interpretation of single group study designs Study design Challenge Implicit comparison Disease evolution may be variable and unpredictable Before and after comparison Changes in factors other than the intervention of interest across the periods compared are common Disease status fluctuates over time and natural recovery may occur Subject selection may be related to disease severity and prognosis Comparison to historical control Changes in factors other than the int ervention of interest across the periods compared are common Information may be unavailable or not reported on the variability of effect estimates in historical control groups Inadequate reporting of data sources for historical response rates may occur Adapted from Paulus et al. 201433 Implicit comparisons Implicit comparison is acceptable when t he natural history of the disease is known with (near) certainty , the s tudy participants are representative of the broader patient population in terms of disease severity and prognosis (in the a bsence of treatment) , and the outcomes in untreated patients are well known , with a large observed effect in the study group .33 Examples can be seen in the recent CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 59 technology appraisals of new drugs for hepatitis C by NICE, where because of the objective outcome and large treatment benefit, regulatory approval had been granted based on short -term single arm trials. However, even for diseases with an apparently uniform prognosis, there may be subtle yet clinically relevant differences between patients who are enrolled in the single -arm trial and those who do not qualify , and also between those in the trial and the historical control . Careful review of the study population and eligibility criteria is needed to make an assessment concerning external validity.33 When considering clinical effectiveness based on single -arm trials the comparison is often mad e implicitly: a survey found that roughly half of Phase II studies did not cite the source of their historical response rates .34 This is never sufficient for the purposes of a cost -effectiveness analysis, where it is essential to have some reasonable estimate of the treatment's effectiveness relative to a control . This requirement has the implication that such implicit comparisons are likely to be rarely of relevance to submission to NICE which will by necessity always contain an economic component . Before and after designs Studies which use b efore and after designs (sometimes referred to as pre -post designs) asses s the difference in response before and after the administration of an intervention in a single group of patients. Patients therefore serve as their own controls. For before and after designs to provide unbiased estimates of effectiveness it is necessary to eliminate all alternative explanations for observed treatment effects. It is therefore necessary to eliminate the possibility of improvement due to adjunctive therapies adm inistered concurrently, or carryover effects from therapies administered before the intervention of interest should be considered. Furthermore, natural recovery presents another potential explanation for an observed before -after improvement in a health out come in a single group comparison. Drawing valid and meaningful inferences about treatment effect using single group observational studies is therefore problematic when evaluating conditions that are fluctuating or intermittent and limits their applicabili ty. Further to the above, before and after designs can be subject to the effects of regression to the mean which can simulate improvements in disease outcomes, but result from the elective sampling of patients at a peak severity in the natural history of disease that have a tendency to return to average severity levels over time regardless of interventions administered .35 Before and after designs are therefore most appropriate for chronic conditions where disease status is stable over time or where natural history of the disease is certain such that any variation in disea se status/progression is likely to due to the intervention. Before and after designs consequently are most commonly used for the evaluation of surgical interventions and other irreversible interventions. Before and after studies can also be useful when a disease is rare (as fewer patients need be recruited) or where there are ethical issues mean regarding using a control CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 60 group would be inappropriate such as in end of life care and childhood diseases. In these cases, however, the weaknesses highlight above are likely to remain, but can be mitigated by the inability to carry out comparative studies. Historical controls Comparative estimates of effectiveness can be generated from single arm studies by comparing results with data obtained from the study with h istorical data from the research institution or from an external cohort or existing database not drawn from the same institution or population. The interpretation of single group studies with historical controls is however complicated by specific challenge s to the validity historical comparisons resulting from differences between patients selected as historical controls and those recruited to the single arm studies . Differences between the patient populations of a single treated group versus historical cont rols can arise for a variety of reasons including differences among accrual sites or over time in patient characteristics (e.g., age, performance status, or other prognostic factors). For example, more recently diagnosed patients may have milder manifestations of a condition due to improved (and therefore commonly increased) diagnostic sensitivity. Treatment effects may also be attributable to secular trends in clinical care (e.g., changes in diagnostic methods, classification criteria, or outcome ascertainment). There are many additional reasons why patients in a single -arm Phase II study may not be comparable to those in some hypothetical historical group.36 Phase II trials involving new agents are typically undertaken in large academic medical cent res, where the patient population may vary in many ways from those in a subsequent phase III trial ( e.g. they may be more mobile, more heavily pre-treated , have better socio -economic status, or better supportive care). For new agents there is a natural enthusiasm amongst the investigators for the new agent and a desire for it to \"look good\". This enthusiasm may manifest itself in various ways, such as setting the historical response rate at a low value34or only enrolling patients who look in some sense 'promising'. These aspects cause problems in an uncontrolled phase II study, but not in a randomized Phase II study. On the other hand, if historical data are available from previous randomized phase III trials in such a case the historical estimate of the response rate for the standard treatment may be more accurate than the estimate obtained from the control arm of a randomized phase II trial, which is based on a smaller sample size .36 To address the problem of reliable historical benchmarks for single -arm phase II trials, efforts have been made to amass historical databases and derive historical control data for future trials in specific disease sites. Examples inclu de stage IV melanoma advanced pancreatic cancer37 and advanced non - small cell lung cancer.38 The availability of t his kind of data is extremely important for the better CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 61 evaluations and an alysis of data f rom single -arm trials, and is essential to generate the estimates of relative effectiveness needed in economic models for the assessment of cost-effectiveness. Comparability of results from single arm studies and randomised designs There is a growing body of literature on whether Phase II trials should be single -arm or randomised (which is now the more common approach), with the focus on which design is most efficiently associated with success in Phase III randomised control trials; particularly in the context of cancer drug development . From one perspective this appears to not be directly relevant to the issue o f the product development of reg enerative medicines , where the issue is not which design best helps companies decide which drugs to take on to a Phase III trial, but rather how companies and regulators can manage development where the long established expectations for pivotal evidence ar e unlikely to be met. This body of literature, however, includes a number of studies that have sought to evaluate the reliability of estimates of effectiveness from single arm studies and their relative performance to randomised trials. A simulation stud y39 investigated the difference between randomised phase II trials and single -arm phase II trials under realistic parameters (alpha=beta=0.01, historical control success rate =20%, target success rate =40%). The study found that both designs produced similar results when there was no variation in historical contro l success rate but that even a modest variation in historical control success inflated the false -positive rate in single -arm trials. Furthermore, increasing the size of the single -arm trial inflated the false positive rate. Another simulation study40 aimed to quantify the impact of a policy of all single -arm phase II trials versus randomised phase II trials on the number of phase III trials conducted using ac tive agents. The parameters modelled in this study included between -institution variability in the standard -care response rate, in the treatment effect, and in the estimate of historical control rate; the presence of historical bias (over or under estimati on of the response rate in the historical controls due changing care), and the proportion of phase II trials conducted using active agents. The study found that single -arm trials resulted in a higher percentage of Phase III when there was a minimal standar d care (i.e. high unmet need), or when there was positive historical bias. Randomised phase II trials performed better in the presence of negative historical bias, high variability and were more consistent across variation in historical bias. These results reflect those of Tang.39 Similar findings were reported wh en a Bayesian approach was used to compare single -arm and randomized studies, based on a binary response variable, in terms of their abilities of reaching the correct decision about the new treatment .41 The study found that the accuracy of the estimate of the success rate for the standard agent, obta ined from historical data, plays a crucial role: when the response rate for the standard agent is correctly estimated, the single -arm studies are CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 62 preferred. As the magnitude of the misspecification increases or as the total number of patients accrued get l arger, two -arm studies tend to be preferred. A very recent publication investigated the superiority of randomised phase II trials over single -arm phase II trials to predict success at Phase III for oncology drugs.42 In this study, published phase III trials testing systemic cancer therapy were identified through a Medline search. Statistical analysis was performed using the Generalized Estimating Equation method correlating phase II features with phase III outcome. The results found that of 189 eligible phase III trials the primary outcome was positive in 79 (41.8%) (success) and these were supported by 336 phase II trials, including 66 randomised phase II trials; positive phase II outcome, r andomised or not, correlated with positive phase III outcome (p = 0.03). Randomised phase II trials were not superior to single -arm phase II trials at predicting phase III study success. The authors concluded that given the added resources required to cond uct randomised phase II trials, further research into phase II trial design is required . In summary these studies confirm that results from single -arm trials can only be considered as reliable indicators of treatment benefit when the disease natural histor y is very well known, the patient population is homogenous, and the control (standard care) treatment has little impact on outcomes. It is interesting that increasing the size of single -arm trials is not helpful. 4.2.2.4 Effect estimates from s ingle - versus mult i-centre trials Single -centre trials may produce significantly larger effect estimates than multi -centre trials. Although no publications were found examining this effect in non -randomised studies , there ar e relevant publications for RCTs. O ver-estimation of treatment effect in single -centre RCTs has been discussed and quantified in critica l care medicine;44, 45 a relativ e overestimation of 36% was found in a study which compared 41 single -centre studies (median n=40) with 41 multi -centre studies (median n=223).44 Trial- or review -specif ic examples of this effect have also been reported in neonatology .46 Possible reasons for the larger effects may be that single -centre studies: are more prone to bias than multi -centre studies44 recruit fewer pati ents than multi -centre studies - smaller studies tend to report larger effects may have treatment effect magnitude s which are affect ed by the high levels of centre expertise may recruit populations which are unduly homogenous CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 63 These factors may limit the reliability or the external validity (generalisability) of single -arm trial results . 4.2.3 Relevance to future regenerative medicine submissions While RCTs continue to be the dominant method for evaluating treatment effectiveness, a large number of studies have been conducted devoted to establishing the relatability of evidence from NRS. This sizable literature demonstrates both the value and chal lenges of using observational data. While the evidence is mixed regarding the reliability of observational data for evaluating treatment effectiveness, the existing studies do seem to indicate that in some cases at least co nfounding is a potential issue an d will impact on treatment effectiveness estimates. Further, the current evidence suggests that retrospective studies and in particular historical control studies are more likely to result in biased estimates of effect. As observed in Section 4.1.2, many recent regenerative medicine submissions have been based upon data from single arm studies, which have been compared to historical controls. The findings of this review therefore suggest that a degree of caution is necessary in interpreting estimates from t hese comparisons, as bias in estimates of effectiveness from historical comparisons will add additional uncertainty not accounted for in the confidence/credible intervals presented. A key factor in the reliability of estimates of effectiveness based on obs ervational data is the statistical analysis used and a large number of studies have similarly sought to develop and evaluate methods for adjusting and eliminating bias resulting from confounding. Despite this, it is unclear which methods are most appropria te in certain circumstances and further research is needed. Consequently results generated from NRS will be subject to an unknown degree of uncertainty, even after adjustment for confounding. Single -arm trials are only reliable indicators of treatment bene fit when the natural history is very well known, the patient population homogenous and the control treatment has little impact on outcomes. It is interesting that increasing the size of single -arm trials is not always helpful. If regenerative medicines continue to be targeted at tightly defined conditions, with a narrow population to minimise heterogeneity, where otherwise patients have little or no chance of recovery/improvement, the use of NRS and in particular single -arm studies may be adequate. To comp lement the data from such trials robust accurate evidence of the outcomes achieved with standard care must be provided. Where appropriate methods to adjust for confounding should be employed, the selection of the method so used must be explicit and based o n sound reasoning. Confidence in estimates of effect may also increase by utilising multiple methods of adjustment, though care should be taken to ensure that methods are appropriate to the decision problem in hand. However, many regenerative medicines may require highly skilled and specialised facilities for optimum delivery. Consequently, the evidence on their efficacy and safety may be derived from only CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 64 small, single -centre studies which (more often than not) might over-estimate effect estimates or which might lack the external validity needed to support more widespread uptake of the intervention. In terms of NICE methods and processes, methods research may be considered to inform guidance both for manufacturers (e.g. minimum reporting requirements on analysis methods for comparing single -arm trial data with historical control data) and for ERGs (e.g. checklists for appraising how historical control data were identified and analysed by manufacturers). 4.3 Review of the use of surrogate endpoints as prim ary outcome measures in definitive effectiveness trials of new therapeutic agents 4.3.1 Introduction As discussed in Section 4 .1 it can be anticipated that almost all of the pivotal trials of regenerative medicines submitted for assessment for marketing authori sation will utilise a surrogate or intermediate outcome (or endpoint) . A surrogate may be either a laboratory or physiological measure of the patients' experience which could be used to predict or provide an early measure of therapeutic effect . This sectio n presents an overview of surrogate outcome measures and their use in clinical research and highlights issues pertinent to the development and appraisal of regenerative medicines. 4.3.2 Method s In order to describe the use of surrogate endpoints as the primary o utcome measure in trials of new therapeutic agents a review of the most relevant and up to date literature was performed. The review was not systematic , but more designed as a pragmatic rapid review to assimilate current information and opinion on the use and suitability of surrogates in therapeutic trials. The review began with a search of key guidelines on the use of surrogate endpoints produced by the FDA, NICE DSU (University of Sheffield), EUnetHTA and survey results produced by the NIHR HTA Programme of HTA reports on the cost -effective use of surrogate outcomes . Citation and reference search es followed which produced a library of relevant peer reviewed publications and statistical reports on evidence for the use of surrogate endpoints in medicine. All relevant studies identified are presented in Appendix 4, Table 46. 4.3.3 Definition and e xamples of surrogate outcomes Ideally, it is expected that the relative effectiv eness of drugs and treatments be based on final clinical endpoint s.47 That is an outcome that the patient, the clinician and other stakeholders hope to avoid such as morbidity, impaired quality of life and/or death48. Randomised controlled trials with large sample sizes and extended follow up periods are often required to capture the statistical significance of a treatment or intervention's impact on a patient relevant outcome.47 However, the req uirements of RCTs are often impractical when considered alongside pressures of time for product to go to market CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 65 and in particular the urgent need for new treatments for patients with chronic but life -threatening diseases. T he principal rationale for the us e of a surrogate outcome is a more rapid assimilation of data without the need for large and lengthy trials in patients where mortality is high or treatment options are few .49 For example, overall survival (OS) is considered the gold standard to measure benefit in many clinical trials as OS provides a precise, statistica lly and clinically meaningful endpoint. However mature OS data is difficult to achieve due to the length of time needed and the number of deaths required for appropriate statistical analyses. Furthermore, o verall survival as a measure of therapeutic succes s becomes less useful as the course and duration of diseases such as cancer move from being acute to more chronic; longitudinal effects of chronic disease such as comorbidities and additional ongoing treatment s add further limitations to OS and an outcome .50, 51 As a solution, there has recently been a steady move (by regulatory bodies ) away from OS as a clinical endpoint measure and towards more short -term surrogate measures . A generally accepted definition of a surrogate has followed that of Temple (1995):52 \"a biomarker or physical sign which can substitute for a clinically meaningful outcome measuring how a patient feels, functions and/or survives\". However, chronic disease programmes and patient reported outcomes have meant that a broader definiti on is now needed to better fit the HTA perspective53, 54. Although the term 'intermediate end point ' is sometimes used synonymousl y with surrogate endpoint,55 it is often used to refer to more patient -relevant outcomes than those typically thought of as surrogates. However for the purposes of this report the term surrogate outcome will be used in its broadest sense. Examples of approved drugs based on the use of validated surrogate endpoints include anti - hype rtensives' and bl ood pressure in stroke research; cholesterol lowering agents and serum cholesterol and treatments for glaucoma and intra -ocular pressure ;56 CD4 count for AIDs or death in HIV infection57; and bone d ensity for bone fracture in osteoporosis.49 However, occasionally such approvals have to be revised when long -term data become available. The drug gefitinib was approved in the US in 2003 for patients with non -small cell lung cancer based on tumour response rate, a surrogate endpoint. When, in 2005 , the results from late r studies showed no significant benefit on survival, the FDA withdrew approval for its use in new patients . So, although surrogate endpoints offer the potential of real benefit - in providing patients with faster access to treatments, and saving trialists time and resources - they may also have important drawbacks. Most notably (as the gefitinib example demonstrates) there may be uncertainty about the relationship between surrogate and real clinical endpoints; this may result in treatment efficacies being o ver-estimated. A meta - epidemiological study which compared 84 trials which used surrogate outcomes with 101 trials which CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 66 used patient -relevant outcomes showed that trials reporting surrogate endpoints had larger treatment effects : on average, trials using surrogate outcomes reported treatment effects that were 28% to 48% higher than those of trials using final patient relevant outcomes , and t his result was consistent across sensitivity and secondary analyses. The study characteristics of trials using surrog ate outcomes and those using patient relevant outcomes were well balanced, except for median sample size (371 v 741) and single centre status (23% v 9%). Their risk s of bias did not differ . This finding illustrates the importance of surrogate endpoints bei ng appropriately validated, and of quantifying the association of treatment effect between the surrogate and patient relevant final outcomes and its uncertainty.58 4.3.4 Validation Surrogate outcomes can be unreliable without sufficient validation, for example, two major antiarrhythmic drugs encanaide and fl ecanaide reduced arrhythmia but caused a more than threefold increase in overall mortality,59 and cardiac inotropes improve sh ort-term cardiac haemodynamic function but can increase mortality.60 Such examples may fuel uncertainty about the validity of surrogates. The results of a questionnaire study of 74 stakeholders in the drug development of cardio - renal disease indicated that although the use of surrogates is not o pposed, most are not considered valid. Out of the four surrogate outcomes suggested as an endpoint for trials - blood pressure, HbA1c, albuminuria or CRP - only blood pressure was considered moderately accurate. Questionnaire responders from industry value d the accuracy of surrogates consistently higher than academic and regulatory responders.61 4.3.4.1 General principles of validation For a surrogate to be a reliable outcome measure it is generally accepted that the measure must be on the 'causal pathway' from the intervention to the clinical outcome .49 The possible reasons for treatment or trial failure associated with surrogate endpoints have been discussed by Fleming62 and more recently by Taylor :49 The surrogate is not on the causal pathway of the disease process, Of several causal pathways of disease, the intervention affects only the pathway mediated by the surrogate. The surrogate is not in the pathway of the interventions effect or is insensitive to its effect. The intervention has mechanisms of action independent of the disease process (and so its effect will not be captured by a surrogate outcome) There are a numb er of guidelines proposed for assessing the validity of surrogate endpoints47, 49, 60, 62 and further work has also been published on scoring schemas for the value of surrogates .63 CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 67 As a result of a review Elston and Taylor48 recommend that before a surrogate outcome is accepted, a systematic review of the evidence for the validation of the surrogate/ final outcome relationship should be conducted. Furthermore, t he evidence on surrogate validation should be presented according to an explicit hierarchy , such as: Level 1: evidence demonstrating treatment effects on the surrogate correspond to effects on the patient -related outcome (from clinical trials) Level 2: evidence demonstrating a consistent association between surrogate outcome and final patient -related out come (from epidemi ological/observational studies) Level 3: evidence of biological plausibility of relationship between surrogate and final patient - related outcome (from pathophysiologic studies and/or underst anding of the disease process) Methods for the s tatistical validation of surrogates as outcome measures have also developed.59, 64, 65 4.3.4.2 Validation of specific surrogate outcomes Surrogate outcomes in oncology A recently published systematic review of trial -level meta -analyses of randomised trials quantifying the association between surrogate and final outcomes in cancer, included 36 studies.66 The review found that all validation studies used only a subset of available trials and that the evidence supporting the use of surrogate outcomes in cancer trials is limited. The results are summarised in Table 5. Table 5 Summary of results from systematic review of trial -level meta -analyses of randomised trials quantifying the association betwee n surrogate and final outcomes in cancer Surrogate and clinical outcome Number of studies Range of correlation coefficients Level of correlation (low, medium, or High) Pathologic complete response for Event free survival. 2 0.17 - 0.28 Low pCR for overall survival 2 0.30 - 0.49 Low Response rate for overall survival 11 0.32 - 0.68 Low- medium Locoregional control for overall survival 2 0.52 - 0.84 Medium - High Event free survival for overall survival 3 0.79 - 0.86 High Disease free survival for overall survival 7 0.62 - 0.98 High Progression free survival for overall survival 30 0.29 - 0.99 Low - High TTP for overall survival 3 0.54 - 0.69 Medium The results of the review indicate that little research effort has been invested in validati ng tumour response as a surrogate for clinical outcomes; the available evidence suggests that better tumour level surrogate outcomes are required. The clinical outcome surrogates (intermediate outcomes) for overall CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 68 survival, particularly PFS, have been bet ter studied and appear to perform better. However, the range of results for PFS indicates that the validation of a surrogate in one disease and setting cannot be assumed for other diseases and settings. Progression -free survival (PFS) or time to progressio n (TTP) The suitability of progression -free survival (PFS) or time to progression (TTP) as appropriate surrogate measures in advanced or metastatic cancer research has been reviewed.54 The review identified 19 papers covering eight different tumour types. Data sets included the relationship between the measures within aggregated trial data, and the effect on individuals withi n individual patient data (IPD). The studies employed a variety of different datasets and statistical techniques, but the lack of standardisation across the studies made it very difficult for the review to identify any consistent relationship between the s urrogate and overall outcome measure. In a recent review of current stat istical approaches to surrogate endpoint validation based on meta - analysis in various advanced -tumo ur settings , the suitability of PFS and assessed using thre e validation frameworks: Elston and Taylor's framework, the German Institute of Quality and Efficiency in Health Care's (IQWiG) framework and the Biomarker -Surrogacy Evaluation Schema (BSES3).67 Findings suggest that the strength of the association between the two surrogates and OS was generally low. The level of evidence (observation -level versus treatment -level) available varied considerably by cancer type and by evaluation tools , and was not always consistent even within one specific cancer type. This study emphasizes the challenges of surrogate -endpoint validation and the importance of building consensus on the de velopment of evaluation frameworks . A recently published study analysed the degree of difference in treatment effects between surrogate endpoints and OS in RCTs of pharmacologic therapies -effects meta -analyses were used to estimate pooled summary treatment effects. The ratio o f hazard ratios (HRs)/odds ratios (ORs) and difference in medians were used to quantify the degree of difference in treatment effects on the surrogate end points and OS. The study found a larger treatment effect for the surrogates than for OS. The authors suggested that p revious surrogacy relationships observed between PFS and TTP vs. OS in selected settings may not apply across other classes or lines of therapy .68 Minimal residual disease (MRD) MRD is a surrogate outcome that has been accepted by a regulatory agency , the FDA. With current intensive treatments, many acute leukaemia patients will enter a morp hologic complete remission (CR). This is typically defined as patients having fewer than 5% blasts (abnormal, immature cells) in the bone marrow. If no further therapy is given after entering CR most patients will relapse, CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 69 demonstrating th at microscopy -based evaluations are incapable of detecting all tumour cells. However, diagnostic techniques can now quantify and monitor minimal amounts of residual disease (MRD) - invisible to the trained eye - in patients in CR. The ability to quantitati vely measure the amount of MRD at various times after achieving CR can guide subsequent treatment.69Studies have shown that MRD before stem cell transplantation is a strong independent predictor of subsequent relapse in children with high risk, or very high risk, ALL .70, 71 Threshold levels for MRD may vary depending on the population being considered. For children receiving first line chemotherapy for ALL, leukaemia cell concentrations of 0.01% (1 in 10,000) have been described as optimal for identifying higher -risk patients for potential intervention.72 For children with ALL who have had a previous relapse the best MRD threshold for predicting diseas e free survival at 10 years has been reported as 0.001%.73 The FDA have concluded that the evidence base to indicate that early MRD status is the strongest predictor of long -term EFS in ALL is unequivocal. They added that the magnitude o f the importance of its critical role in risk stratification for treatment decisions has raised the consideration of its potential as a surrogate endpoint for clinical trials of investigational therapeutic interventions.74 However, results from the UKALL R3 trial , which compared different chemotherapy treatments for children in first relapse, showed that the longer term outcome of having MRD negative status in patients who have already had one relapse may well vary according to how the status was achieved.75 There is theref ore some uncertainty in how MRD negativity correlates to long -term outcomes in relapsed populations. 4.3.5 Current issues for HTA and cost effectiveness models Regulator y bodies find it acceptable for trials to be shorter and to have fewer participants and to use surrogate outcomes when populations are rare and there is a high unmet clinical need. However a commitment to ongoing research is mandatory to receive longer ter m approval; i f research is not continued or if continued but efforts to validate the surrogate fail the approval will be withdrawn .56 From a regulatory and HTA perspective the absence of data on clinical endpoints might be acceptable when a clinical endpoint is difficult or impossible to study. The EUnetHTA summarised their findings into eight recommendations for endpoints used in relative effectiveness assessment of pharmaceuticals .47 Efficac y assessments of pharmaceuticals should be based whenever possible on final patient - relevant clinical endpoints (e.g. morbidity, overall mortality) Biomarkers and intermediate endpoints will be considered as surrogate endpoints if they can reliably substit ute for a clinical endpoint and predict its clinical benefit CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 70 Surrogate endpoints should be adequately validated and must have been demonstrated based on biological plausibility and empirical evidence Validation of a surrogate is normally undertaken in a sp ecific population and for a specific drug intervention. Demonstration of surrogate validation both within and across drug classes should be thoroughly justified The availability of a sufficiently large safety database is particularly important and evidence on safety outcomes should always be reported The absence of data on clinical endpoints might be acceptable when a clinical endpoint is difficult or impossible to study (very rare or delayed) or target population is too small to obtain meaningful results o n relevant clinical endpoints even after very long follow -up (very slowly progressive and/or rare diseases). However, these exceptions need to be carefully argued and agreed in advance Re-assessment requirements for further data should be clearly defined w hen an assessment has been previously made based on surrogate endpoints for the first assessment Similarly, Elston and Taylor (2009)48 recommend an HTA or CEM based on a surrogate outcome should only be undertaken where it is not possible to base the assessment of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness on final patient -related outcomes (i.e., mortality, important clinical events, and health -related quality -of-life). In such cases a systematic review of the evidence for the validation of the surrogate/ final outcome re lationship should be performed and t he evidence on surrogate validation should be presented according to an explicit hierarchy . Given the difficulty in validating surrogate outcomes, which conflicts with a need to use such outcomes in clinical research Ci ani and T aylor53 comment on the need to recognise the need for pragmatic high level evidence, preferably from meta -analyses and regression modelling using both surrogate and final outcomes for HTA. The potential of this is demonstrated by a study conducted to illustrate the potential to reduce uncertainty around the clinical outcome by estimating it from a multivariate meta -analysis.76 Bayesian multivariate met a-analysis was used to synthesis e data on correlated outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis. Estimates of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) were mapped onto the health -related quality -of-life measure EuroQol five -dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire, and the effect was compared with mapping HAQ obtained from the univariate approach. The results s howed that use of multivariate meta -analysis can lead to reduced uncertainty around the effectiveness parameter. By allowing all the relevant data to be incorporated in estimating clinical effectiveness outcomes - including data from surrogate outcomes - multivariate meta -analysis can improve the estimation of health utilities through mapping methods . CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 71 In their review of HTA and CEM Taylor et al 200949 found that o nly one of the 4 reports undertook a systematic review to specifically seek the evidence base for the association between surrogate and final outcomes. Furthermore, this was the only report to provide level 1 surrogate -final outcome validation evidence (i.e. RCT data ) showing a strong association between the change in surrogate outcome (BPAR) and the change in final outcome (graft survival) at an individu al patient level . The outcome of the review was to make recommendations for the evaluation of surrogate endpoints in HTA ( these are listed in Appendix 4, Table 46). Elston and Taylor's HTA publication has been key to providing insight into the use of surrogates within the HTA and cost effectiveness models framework and presents the range of approaches, including hazard ratio calculation, transition probabilities withi n a model of natural history CEM and predictive risk equations, used by researchers to quantify the relationship between surrogate and clinical endpoints.48 In addition to calls for validation of commonly used surrogate outcomes there is a need for novel, more appropriate, more valid outcomes. An editorial in the Journal of Clinical Oncology77 commented on the large number of novel antitumor agents currently being tested in ever smaller groups of patients with increasingly specific tumour characteristics. Cancer types will continue to be divided up into many sub -entities that differ from each other in terms of genetic makeup, natural course, and sensitivity to systemic treatments. This, together with the l imited number of patients who are available for clinical studies, mean s that a new approach to oncology research is needed. The editorial called for more intensive efforts at the pre -clinical stage to better understand the mode of action of potential new agents, and for this information to be used to select more precisely the target population and appropriate and valid surrogate outcomes. By so doing it should be possible to achieve a higher success rate in phase III studies, with smaller numbers of patient s needed. 4.3.6 Summary Studies looking at surrogates for overall survival demonstrate how difficult it is to validat e even commonly used surrogates On average it seems that trials u sing surrogate outcomes report larger treatment effects (28% to 48%) than thos e of trials using final patient -relevant outcomes However, a desire to get regenerative medicines to market quickly means that manufacturer submissions are likely to be supported by short -term trials reporting primary outcomes which are surrogates Regulatory agencies may accept evidence based on surrogate outcomes, for example the FDA accepts that MRD is the strongest predictor of long term event -free survival in acute CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 72 lymphoblastic leukaemia, although there is considerable uncertainty about its value in relapsed populations The choice of surrogate outcomes must be researched, explicit and justified. Ideally a systematic review of the evidence for the validation of the surrogate/ final outcome relationship should be performed and the evidence on s urrogate validation should be presented according to an explicit hierarchy Analyses, at whatever stage of development and maturity of data, should include all available outcome data in order to minimise uncertainty. 4.4 Scoping exercise of potential cost -effectiveness issues The assessment of the cost -effectiveness of regenerative medicines and cell therapies may raise additional challenges compared to other types of technologies. A focused scoping review was undertaken to help to identify potential conceptual differences between regenerative medicines/cell therapy products and other more conventional technologies . The objective of the scoping review was to identify possible characteri stics which could make any assessment of cost -effectiveness, uncertainty and the value of further evidence different from other technologies. These characteristics also provided a basis for subsequent exploratory work to assess the appropriateness of existing decision framewor ks for health technologies. A related objective was to identify areas where additional methodological development may be required. The scoping review was based on completed and ongoing NICE Technology Appraisals (TAs) for regenerative medicines and broader literature which has attempted to identify potential ch allenges . 4.4.1 Previous regenerative me dicine evaluations evaluated within the NICE TA process Methods A review of prev ious NICE TAs of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products was conducted. The primary aim of the review was to identify any common them es and potential analytic challenges relating to the assessment of their cost -effectiveness. Results NICE has previously evaluated two regenerative medicines within the existing TA process : autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) for the treatment of ca rtilage defects in the knee joints78-80 and s ipuleucel -T for treating asymptomatic or metastatic prostate cancer .81 Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 73 ACI has now been appraised on 3 separate occasions by NICE: originally in 2000 (TA16),79 and as separate re -reviews in 2005 (TA89)80 and in 2015 as part of an ongoing review.78 The original guidance from TA16 has since been replaced by TA89 and documentation from the initial appraisal has been removed from NICE' s website. Hence, our review focused on the separate re -reviews. However, it was reported in the Final Appraisal Determination (FAD) for TA89 that w hen the original guida nce was produced in 2000, data from completed RCTs for ACI were not available. For the re-review in 2005 ,80 4 controlled trials were subsequently considered; 2 comparing ACI with microplasty (n=40 and n=100) an d 2 comparing ACI with microfracture (n=80 and n=66). Follow -up across the trials varied between 1 to 2 years. Three publications relating to a Swedish longer -term case series for ACI were also identified , describing outcomes for up to 11 years after surg ery. In reviewing the various document s for TA89 there appears to be no specific reference made to any distinct challenges of evaluating ACI based on its classification as a regenerative medicine or any specific discussion related to possible innovation . However, the lack of medium to long -term outcomes associated with A CI and their durability was highlighted as a key limitation in the FAD. The committee also noted concerns that the comparative trial evidence had a follo w up of only 1 to 2 years and longer-term case series data appeared to show simil ar benefits for most treatment modalities . While uncertainties surrounding long -term outcomes are clearly not u nique to regenerative medicines, the Assessment Group (AG) concluded in TA89 that there was insuf ficient evidence for ACI to produce a robust cost per QALY estimate for ACI . Instead the AG undertook \" illustrative modelling \" of the cost effectiveness of ACI in three \" increasingly speculative \" stages , incorporating alternative assumptions relating to the short term (2 -years), medium term (10 -years) and long term (up to 50 - years). The c onventional NICE reference case for cost -effectiveness was applied, although deterministic approaches (i.e. point estimates were assumed for input parameters) were applied . A discount rate of 1.5% for health benefits and 6% for costs were applied in line with the recommended rates at the time of the appraisal.82 The cost -effectiveness results were sensitive to the time horizon and the assumptions employed within these. In both the short -term and medium -term analyses, ACI was reported to be dominated by the current standard of care (microfracture/mosaicplasty). In the long -term analyses, the possible avoidance of knee replacements were taken into account and the ICER of ACI versus microfracture was reported to be between \u00a33,200 -\u00a33,650 per QALY. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 74 ACI was subsequently not recommended for routine use in TA189, being given an only in research (OIR ) recommendation. Hence the us e of ACI in the NHS was restricted to use wi thin \" studies that are designed to produce good -quality information about the results of the procedure. These results should include measuring any improvement in patients' quality of life, and the benefits and risks of ACI over a long period of time \". While the re -review78 is still ongoing, the initial appraisal consultation document (ACD) was iss ued in March 2015 and is now in the process of consultation. The rapid evolvement of ACI over time was highlighted in the ACD and the branded MACI product being appraised was now classif ied as a third - generation ACI. The AG undertook a 'review of reviews ' comparing the effectiveness of ACI (any generation) with microfracture. 12 systematic reviews were identified. Studies within the review were reported by the AG to be heterogenous with follow -up between 6.5 months to 7.5 years. The AG considered the results of the reviews to be inconclusive on the effectiveness of ACI compared with microfracture NICE received separate submissions for ChondroCelect (SOBi), MACI OsCell (Robert [RJAH] Orthopaedic Hospital). While both ChondroCelect and MACI had EMA approval, the submission by OsCell was based on a product provided via the Hospital Exemption License that allows provision for OsCell to supply chondrocytes for use in ACI under the professional responsibility of a medical practitioner. There was a marked difference in list prices (excluding VAT) between the products: \u00a318,301 for ChondroCelect; \u00a316,226 for MACI and \u00a34,135 for OsCell. However, costs were also noted to vary in different setting due to negotiated procurement discounts. The manufacturer submission supporting ChondroCelect provided evidence of clinical effectiveness from 4 new sources not considered in TA89 : a randomised c ontrolled trial (n=118) with up 5-years follow -up; a 'compassionate use' case series (n=370) ; an ongoing registry based cohort study (n=308) with up to 3 -years follow -up; and data from a Belgian reimbursement scheme (254 procedures undertaken over a 3 -year period). The submission supporting MACI described new clinical evi dence from 2 RCT s (n=144 and n=60 , both with up to 2 -years follow -up) and a subsequent ongoing extension study (up to 3 -years additional follow -up; with interim data for 1st year reported). CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 75 The OsCell submission reported interim ( up to 5-years follow -up) clinical effecti veness evidence from a UK RCT (ACTIVE trial: n=390 including first, second and third generation ACI) and a separate cohort study (n=366) with up to 3 -years follow -up. Separate cost -effectiveness analyses were presented by the manufacturers of ChondroCelec t, OsCell and the AG. A discount rate of 3.5% for both health benefits and costs were applied in line with the recommended rates at the time of the appraisal.83 The base -case ICERs for ACI compared w ith microfracture in the comp anies and Assessment Group models were approximately \u00a36,000 -\u00a37,000 and \u00a316,000 per QALY gained respectively. In the ACD, the Committee concluded that while there was more clinical -effectiveness data than at the time of the previous NIC E technology appraisal guidance, the evidence base for t he technology is still emerging and no comparative clinical effectiveness data had been reported beyond 5 years . Innovation was formally considered and the Committee agreed that ACI, albeit not new, i s technically innovative. However, they concluded that: \"in the context of a technology appraisal, innovation needs to be judged by the benefit for patients, and that with the current uncertainties in the clinical effectiveness, it was not possible to con clude that these technologies can be considered innovative \" (ACD: Section 5.2.1) .78 In relati on to the cost -effectiveness evidence, the Committee considered that OsCell had underestimated its cell costs, and that the true cost may approach that of MACI and ChondroCelect. The Committee concluded that, although the cost to the NHS of providing the c ells for ACI was somewhat uncertain, the cost estimate used within the AG and the Chondrocelect model were reasonable for the purposes of decision making . The Committee concluded that a lifetime horizon was preferable because it captured all of the costs and consequences of treatment, but the lack of long -term data with which to populate a model generated large uncertainties. The Committee concluded that there was no ICER available that included the assumptions they considered plausible. Further they were not persuaded that ACI was proven to be a cost -effecti ve treatment; neither did they consider that the available data robustly support ed that ACI was better than other treatments . The Committee therefore issued a provisional OIR recommendation because the clinical effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of ACI continues to remain uncertain. Hence, ACI was not recommended for routine use in the NHS unless it is part of existing or new clinical stu dies. It was stated that \"these CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 76 studies should generate robust ou tcome data and include both interventional and observational studies\". Sipuleucel -T (Provenge\u00ae) NICE issued guidance for sipuleucel -T (Provenge\u00ae) in February 2015.81 The appraisal was subsequently withdrawn in May 2015 following the withdrawal of the marketing authorisation for sipuleucel -T. However, prior to this NICE had conducted a full appraisal of the technology, rejecting it due t o the cost -effectiveness estimates exceeding the threshold considered to represent value for money to the NHS.83 Clinical effectiveness evidence was based on 3 phase III double -blind multicentre RCTs conducted in USA and Canad with endpoint for the pivotal ( IMPACT ) trial was overall survival with a median follow -up time of 34 months . The main secondary endpoint w as time to disease progression. The risk of death was reported to be statistically significantly lower in the sipuleucel -T group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.78, 95% CI 0.61 -0.98). The trial also demonstrated that patients randomised to sipuleucel -T survived for longer (median 25.8 months) than patients randomised to placebo (median 21.7 months), with a difference of 4.1 months. Subgroup analysis suggested important clinical differences based on baseline PSA concentration, with a difference of 13 months (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.85) in median survival for the quartile of patients with the lowest baseline PSA concentration compared to 2.8 months (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.29) for the quartile with the highest PSA concentration. The company suggested that sipuleucel -T has a delayed onset of action because it is an immunotherapy, so giving it early in the course of disease progression (as indicated by a low PSA) could provide patients with more time to benefit from sipuleucel -T. However, t he ERG cautioned that the subgroup of patients in the IMPACT trial with lowest quartile baseline PSA had been ide ntified in a post -hoc analysis, with no clin ical significance attached to the specific PSA concentration in this group . A conventional Markov (partitioned -survival) model was s ubmitted by the manufacturer to inform cost-effectiveness with a lifetime time horizon (10 -years). Parametric survival analyses were used to extrapolate the trial data to the lifetime horizon . Conventional rates of discount (3.5% costs and benefits) were a pplied. In the company's base -case analysis, the ICER -T compared with BSC was \u00a3124,875 per QALY gained. In the subgroup with the lowest quartile of baseline PSA concentrat ion, the ICER for sipuleucel -T compared with BSC was \u00a348,672 per QAL Y gained . The company also conducted CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 77 sensitivity analyses with an alternative comparator (abiraterone rather than BSC) and applied assumed discounts to the price of abiraterone of 30% or more; these analyses resulted in ICERs for sipuleucel - T compared wit h abiraterone of at least \u00a3511,663 per QALY gained. The ERG noted uncertainty surrounding the extrapolation of survival data and chose a n alternative survival distribution for overall survival in its exploratory analyses , alongside other proposed amendmen ts. In the ERG's base case, the ICER -T compared with BSC was \u00a3111,417 per QALY gained. The ERG's analysis for the low -PSA subgroup resulted in an ICER of \u00a361,381 per QALY gained for sipuleucel -T compared with BSC. In considering the cost da ta and assumptions within the manufacturer's submission, i t noted that the acquisition cost of sipuleucel -T included the costs of leukapheresis, patient tests associated with leukapheresis, transportation of white blood cells, and manufacture and t ransport ation of sipuleucel -T. However, given the complex administration of sipuleucel -T and the lack of experience in the UK of using the treatment, the Committee was unsure whether the NHS would incur additional costs of using sipuleucel -T that were not included in the economic model. The Committee also considered that there may be patient travel costs associated with sipuleucel -T treatment, due to its provision within specialist centres, which had not been included in the model. These issues were considered to add uncertainty to the estimates of cost -effectiveness. In considering the clinical relevance of the subgroups, the Committee heard that t he clinical experts were unable to identify a single PSA value that was currently used for guiding treatment decisions. The Committee considered that registry data could have been used to assess whether outcomes after treatment with sipuleucel -T in clinical practice were similar to those in the IMPACT trial for patients with low baseline PSA concentration , but th at they were not presented with this information by the manufacturer. T he company reported that such a registry had been established (PROCEED) but that data were considered too immature to inform overall survival. In relation to potential innovation, the Committee reported that it was aware that sipuleucel -T is an autologous cellular immunotherapy and is the first treatment for this indication that is not cytotoxic or based on hormone therapy. However, they concluded no evidence had been presented for \"demonstrable and distinctive benefits that had not been captured in the reference -case measure of QALYs \". The Committee concluded that there were areas of considerable uncertainty in the results generated by the model, and noted that all the ICERs estimated by the company and the ERG fell substantially above the range normally considered cost effective (\u00a320,000 to \u00a330,000 per QALY gained ).81 CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 78 Issues and common themes The existing NICE TAs raise a number of po tential issues and several common themes emerge. The innovative nature of ACI (most recent ACD only) and sipuleucel -T were acknowledged by both committees. However, these considerations appea r to relate more to an appreciation of the technical nature of the innovation as opposed to any specific a ttributes of the innovation which might lead to a distinct benefit that may not be appropriately reflected in the reference case measure of QALYs. Importantly, no evidence was presented in either appraisal which led the committee to consider that these specific attributes of innovation were relevant. The high levels of uncertainty surrounding cost -effectiven ess results were highlighted in both appraisals. In the most recent appraisal of ACI , this led the committee to conclude that there was no ICER available that included the assumptions they considered plausible , neither were they persuaded that ACI was ' proven' to be a cost -effective treatment . The committee appraising sipuleucel -T concluded that despite the considerable uncertainty in the results generated by the model, all the ICERs estimated by the company and the ERG appeared to be substantially above th e range normally considered cost effective . The difference in the committee's subsequent recommendations (i.e. OIR for ACI and reject for sipuleucel -T) suggests that the committees may have reached different conclusions on the potential for both products t o be cost -effective despite the inherent uncertainties. The rapidly changing nature of regenerative medicines and challenges raised by this is evident across the series of appraisals for ACI. Over the 15 year period that the separate appraisals have been undertaken, the initial first -generation ACI products (ACI -C) have been superseded by second and third -generation products. This has raised potential challenges in relation to quantifying the long -term uncertainties as newer generations emerge. That is, dur ing the time over which longer -term evidence has emerged newer generations of ACI have also arrived. The generalisability of the longer term evidence to the newer generations has raised additional issues and challenges. For example, the AG in the most rece nt ACI appraisal excluded longer term evidence available from the first generation of ACI on the basis that these products had now been superseded by newer generations. This approach effectively assumes that existing evidence cannot be generalised across different generations of products. If such a position were routinely taken, this may pose a potential challenge to manufacturers in terms of providing data which is considered sufficiently robust within a time frame that permits sufficient commercial retur n to warrant their R&D expenditure. The extent to which evidence can be generalised or transferred between generations remains an important consideration. Similar uncertainties arise for more conventional technologies in relation to the constant evolution of knowledge over time and subsequent challenges for HTA and cost -effectiveness assessments. The CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 79 challenge of determining when evi dence is sufficiently 'robust' within a t echnology's overall life cycle to undertake an HTA/cost -effectiveness assessment are summarised by what has been termed 'Buxton's law' (i.e. \" it is always too early until, unfortunately, it's suddenly too late \").84 These challenges have led to an increased appreciation of the importance of employing an iterative approach to cost -effectiveness assessments, such that as new evidence emerges, progressively more certain estimates are derived and earlier policy decisions can be subsequently reconsidered .85, 86 However, as highlighted by the ACI appraisal, more specific challenges may arise for appraising newer generations of products in relation to the extent to which evidence is considered generalisable or transferable across differ ent product generations. Furthermore, the potential high up -front costs and the scale of any irrecoverable costs, as discussed in more detail in later sections, may be important additional considerations within these iterative assessments. Additional u ncertainties were also identified across both appraisals in relation to the costs that would be incurred by the NHS. Within the ACI appraisal, uncertainties were identified surrounding the acquisition costs of the technologies themselves (i.e. due to local price negotiations and concerns regarding the proposed cost of the product provided under hospital exemption), as well as to the appropriate cost or tariff to apply to other elements of the overall procedure. The complexity of provision and lack of experienc e in the UK of using the product was also identified as an issue within the appraisal of sipuleucel -T. Uncertainties arising from this, alongside the proposed provision within specialist centres and possible impact on travel costs for patients, led the com mittee to conclude that additional uncertainties existed surrounding whether all relevant costs had been appropriately included within the model. Importantly, the RCTs which informed the basis of regulatory submissions for ChondroCelect, MACI and sipuleuc el-T were also central to the subsequent submissions to NICE and the economic models developed to support these. Follow -up ranged from between 2 to 5 years for ChondroCelect and MACI and additional evidence was also submitted from ongoing extension studies and other registries. In the case of sipuleucel -T, the pivotal (IMPACT) trial was powered on overall survival with a median follow -up time of 34 months . Consequently, neither appraisal provides an indication of any additional challenges which may be raised for regenerative medicines or cell -therapies which have received regulatory approval based on u ncontrolled studies or employin g surrogate outcomes. However, it seems reasonable to conclude that the uncertainties expressed in relation to cost - effectiveness within the existing appraisa ls are likely to be magnified in this eventuality. 4.4.2 Broader consideration of potential conceptual differences and possible methodological challenges for cost -effectiveness analyses CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 80 A separate review of known references and key citations of these was undertaken to identify other potential conceptual differences between regenerative medicine and cell -therapies and more conventional medicines to identify potential methodological challeng es for cost -effectiveness assessments. During the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) conference held in November 2014, a workshop was held to discuss potential HTA and reimbursement challenges for regenerative medicin es and curative treatments. As part of the workshop, Towse87 argued that many of the challenges for curative therapies appear similar to those for disease modifying therapies for chronic disease s, sharing several associated problems; most notably: (i) short term trials using surrogate outcomes that may not produce relevant clinical outcomes; (ii) outcomes that may not be sustained over time and (iii) safety problems which may emerge over time. In considering how th ese uncertainties might be formally incorporated within policy decisions regarding reimbursement, Towse87 acknowledged that value of information (VOI) approaches provide a potential analytic framework. This framew ork formally evaluates the potential trade -off between the net health benefits to current patients from early access to the technology and those to future patients from withholding acc ess to the technology until additional research has been conducted. The framework can then be used to help guide more appropriate policy choices between: (i) adopt and reimburse now , (ii) delay adoption/reimbursement and undertake further research (i.e. only in research) , (iii) adopt /reimburse now and undertake further researc h (akin to coverage with evidence development [CED] or approval with research [AWR] ).88 Towse also acknowledged the importance of risk sharing approaches and particularly how these could enhance the value of CED /AWR . As discussed in Section 4.1, assessments of the clinical effectiveness a nd cost -effectiveness of regenerative medicines and cell -based therapies, particularly earl y in their life -cycle, may be less extensive and lower in quantity than evidence for more conventional pharmaceuticals . Under these circumstances it may become even more critical to consider conditional reimbursement and possible risk sharing agreements between the manufa cturer and the payer . Towse87 concl uded that the main reimbursement challenges for regenerative medi cines relate more to their financing as opposed to the methodology of HTA and cost -effectiveness . In particular, concern was raised by Towse regarding whether health care systems could cope with the potential high upfront costs of a curative treatment that appeared cost -effective using conventional thresholds; thereby presenting a potential barrier to adoption. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 81 In the same workshop, Faulkner89 explored differences between regenerative medicines/cell therapies and conventional biologics. Specific reference was made to the more limited understanding by physicians and payers, leading to potentially great er requirements being made for longer -term data collection to more robustly demonstrate value. The multiple procedural steps required for some therapies were identified as another potential challenge, as these may be subjected to different regulatory and r eimbursement process. Similar concerns were raised by another speaker, Husereau90, highlighting that regenerative medicine s can be considered as both a biologic and a device/procedure, with many countries also having di fferent reimbursement procedures often based on cost minimisation for the funding of procedures due to fixed HRG pricing. In common with the arguments made by Towse, both Husereau and Faulkner also highlighted the challenge of applying a single financing approach for reimbursement. The potential to enable a disease cure or prolonged therapeutic effect was also identified as relevant characteristic by both Faulker and Husereau. However, Husereau identified a specific challenge surrounding the classification of a cure and its distinction from a prolonged therapeutic effect. To be considered curative , a therapy needed to demonstrate 'no chance of re -entering suboptimal health state from same disease' . In reality it seems unlikely tha t a new therapy can be def initively classified as curative prospectively since many of the required elements cannot be demonstrated until a full lifetime of a cohort of treated patient has passed. Husereau also raised the question regarding whether there is anything specific rega rding curative therapies relative to standard treatments that could be perceived as providing additional benefits to patients beyond the current QALY framework. This was further considered in a subsequent publication.91 Husereau reported that while there was limited direct empirical evidence to address this specific question, important insights could be generated from the large literature exploring valuation issues for treatment (which he noted was often labell ed as 'cure' within these studies) versus prevention. Husereau reported a potential disconnect between existing literature reporting individual and societal preferences. That is, when given a choice between prevention and treatment, individuals appear to s tate a preference for prevention. However, similar preferences are not apparent when (societal) willingness to pay is considered. This disconnect was attributed to separate psychological factors including time, certainty of individual decisions and the val uation of identifiable versus statistical lives. Husereau concluded that if a similar disconnect exists for curative therapies relative to standard treatments this could lead to considerable public debate and that further research was required. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 82 Importantl y, several of these issues and challenges highlighted in the workshop do not appear unique to regenerative medicines and cell -based therapies and similar challenges are often present when appraising more conventional biologics, companion diagnostics and de vices more generally. However, it appears reasonable to conclude that these issues will be more commonly faced within evaluations concerning regenerative medicines and cell therapies. Furthermore, since many regenerative medicines and cell therapies will be considered as both a biologic and a device/procedure , manufacturers may have to address the specific regulatory and reimbursement challenges faced by both pharmaceutical and device manufacturers internationally. Due to the personalised nature of regenerative medicines , the manufacturing and production process is typically more complex than that for traditional drug therapies. Current pharmaceutical manufacture is largely based around drugs being prepared, tested and manufactured in bulk at a cons istent quality in advance of need , using automated processes . In contrast, many regenerative medicines require significant personalisation at the point of need. The complexity of the process, and the high level of personalisation required, may result in s ignificantly higher marginal costs of production compared to conventional pharmaceuticals or biologics. Inevitably , these additional complexities are likely to lead to higher upfront costs to healthcare systems. This complexity and personalisation is likely to be coupled with a requirement for the provision of additional healthcare services within the overall process . The add itional demands raise issues around the impact on the wider healthcare setting, both at a marginal cost and wider infrastructure leve l. These demands may differ according to the extent of the services provided by the manufacturer and those requiring separate funding by the health care system. In the sipuleucel -T appraisal, the lack of experience in the UK of using the treatment raised additional uncertainties surrounding whether the NHS would incur additional costs that were not reflected in any of the scenarios evaluated, raising an additional source of uncertainty.81 Since provision of regenerative medicines and cell -based therapies often entails multiple procedural steps (e.g. cell extraction, processing and administration), and may be undertaken alongside additiona l procedures (e.g. leukapheresis in the case of sipuleucel -T and arthrotomy for ACI ), additional uncertainties are likely to be raised concerning the generalisability and transferability of evidence between different settings. That is, separating out the s pecific effect of the regenerative medicine or cell therapy from the effect of broader health provision, which itself may be subject to significant variation across different health care systems, represents an important challenge to HTA and cost - effectiven ess assessments. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 83 Many regenerative medicines and cell therapies also appear likely to share similar 'unique' characteristics which have been reported for medical devices.92 For example, particular parts of the procedural process may change significantly over time , experiencing incremental or step changes as new processes and infrastructure develops. Additionally, the requirement for highly specialised infrastructure and staff indicates the potential for a learning curve over time both for manufacturers and health care providers. While increased automation methods and the 'scaling out' of services may subsequently reduce the need for highly specialised staff (and lower the marginal costs of production), the infrastructure requirement s and implications for possible learning curve effects are likely to be an important consideration when assessing the cost -effectiveness of regenerative medicines and cell therapies. In addition to issues related to uncertainty, issues of irrecoverable costs may pose an additional challenge. Irrecoverable costs are tho se costs which once committed cannot be recouped if changes occur at a later time, mo st commonly thought of as investment costs associated with the capital expenditure on equipment, new facilities, or training and learning costs. These are likely to be mos t significant when the introduction of a new regenerative medicine or cell therapy imposes additional infrastructure requirements on the health system. Within economic evaluations, these costs are commonly annuitis ed and allocated as 'per -patient' costs by spreading the cost over the number of patients likely to be treated during the lifetime of the equipment. However, if reimbursement decisions about the technology change before the end of the lifetime of the equipment (e.g. approval is withdrawn) , then t hese costs may not be recovered and hence need to be explicitly considered . The risks of these more conventional types of irrecoverable costs to the health system may be more limited if the manufacturer provides the necessary infrastructure and associated training. However, irrecoverable costs also potentially exist at the patient level. Regenerative and cell therapies are developed, by design, to have a significant (if not permanent) period of effect, during which they may be neither removable nor reversi ble. The irreversibility of these therapies implies any uncertainty associated with the long term efficacy and adverse event profile has a greater potential significance than for treatments that can easily be reversed or switched. 4.4.2.1 Potential approaches to addressing HTA challenges Many of the issues associated with regenerative medicines will inevitably impact on the level of uncertainty associated with the cost -effectiveness of the technology when introduced into clinical practice. Even where products hav e significant potential to confer important clinical advances over current therapies, this may not be known with a high level of certainty at the time a regenerative medicine is licensed. Inevitably a new technology's cost -effectiveness may be more difficu lt to CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 84 determine in these circumstances and schemes that allow the development of further evidence or entail a risk -sharing component may be required. Managed entry agreements (M EAs) are an increasingly common policy response to dealing with uncertainty i n the evidence base of new health technologies entering the market. MEAs are also commonly referred to as performance -based risk sharing agreements (PBRSAs) and patient access schemes (PASs) . A taxonomy provided by Walker et al.93 makes an important distinction between MEAs based on reducti ons in the effective price (e.g. akin to majority of PAS schemes implemented currently alongside NICE guidance) and those associated with evidence generation (e.g. OIR, CED). Both approaches have the aim of reducing risk and decision uncertainty to the he alth care system, albeit via separate mechanisms. Walker et al concluded that reimbursement decisions and the possible use of MEA should be based not only on the expected value of a technology but also the value of further research, the anticipated effect of coverage on further research, and the costs associated with reversing the decision (i.e. irrecoverable costs) . Similar conclusions are reflected in NICE's current methods guide for technology: \"When the evidence of clinical effectiveness or impact of a technology on other health outcomes is either absent, weak or uncertain, the Appraisal Committee may recommend that the technology is used only in the context of research or while the technology is recommended as an option, research is also conducted. Bef ore issuing such recommendations the Committee will consider the following factors: the need for and potential value to the NHS of additional evidence that can inform the development of NICE guidance and clinical practice on the use of the technology the uncertainty in the analysis and what could be gained by reconsidering the decision in the light of research findings whether the research is feasible in circumstances when the Appraisal Committee recommends the intervention for NHS use outside the context of research irrecoverable costs incurred from introducing the technology the likely net benefits for all NHS patients of use only in a research setting during the time that the recommended research is being conducted. In considering these factors the Co mmittee will balance the potential net benefits to current NHS patients of a recommendation not restricted to research with the potential net benefits to both current and future NHS patients of being able to produce guidance and base clinical practice on a more secure evidence base \".83 CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 85 How to determine when efficiency is sufficiently weak or uncertain , such that MEAs a re appropriate policy responses remains a key methodological issue that has importa nt implications both for polic y making and research invest ments made by the regenerative medicine industry. A more formal framework been recently been proposed which has established the key principles of the assessments needed.88 There is also ongoing work being undertaken by NICE's Decision Support Unit (DSU) related to the methods for assessing MEAs within the TA programme. Concerns surrounding the potential high -upfront costs of regenerative medicines and affordability to health care systems have also received particular attentio n in the literature, leading several authors to conclude that alternativ e financing approaches may also have to be considered. For example, Towse87 outlined 3 alternative financing routes: (i) pay for performance; (ii) amortisation and (iii) innovative financing schemes. The p otential issues and challenges related to alternative financing approaches in the context of regenerative medicine and cell -based therapies are discussed in more detail below. Fixed price sch emes The simplest and most common approac h to reimbursement is the payment of a fixed price at the time of treatment, pot entially subject to discounts agreed via a PAS. This approach has the benefit of being relatively manageable and low cost to implement . Furthermore, subject to uncertainties concerning the eligible patient population size and subsequent uptake rates, the budget impact is also largely predictable. However, if the therapy is expensive and/or the patient population is large , the total budge t impact to the funder may raise issues concerning system ' affordability' (i.e. the ability to displace sufficient activities elsewhere in the health care system to provide the additional funds necessary to provide the new treatment). This may have implica tions for subsequent implementation. While 'affordability' is not explicitly considered by NICE, the Committee is requested to take \"account of how the incremental cost effectiveness of the technology being appraised relates to other interventions or techn ologies currently or potentially applied in the NHS\". When significant uncertainty exist surrounding future outcomes, a fixed price scheme exposes the funder to the risk of overpayment for outcomes which may not be realised . A fixed pricing mech anism may b e potentially optimal in situations in which : there is little uncertainty about the long term outcomes; there are high costs of patient follow up ; and/or the resulting budget impact is likely to represent a marginal change to overall NHS spend . Amortisation Amortisation has been raised as an alternative financing approach for curative treatments, particularly for chronic diseases.87, 94 Gottlieb and Carino94 identified that most health care finance system s are not currently structured to be able to pay to rapidly cure everyone of a chronic disease using a treatment CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 86 that may be pric ed much higher than the existing chronic therapies . Payment models were therefore advocated t hat could more easily spread the potentially high up front costs of a curative treatment and be more closely aligned to the time period over which health and econom ic benefits are realis ed. Such financing schemes are common for capital equipment payment for medical devices and other capital equipment. However, for a regenerative medicine or cell therapy, instead of spreading out payment over the lifetime of the cap ital equipment, amortisation would spread payment over the expected duration of benefits. Gottlieb and Carino94 highlighted several i ssues and challenges relating to operationa lising such as scheme. These included: the potential need for another financial intermediary to act as a third party to the transactions; the need to alter accounting standards ; and potential conflict with the manufacturer's desire to secure immediate revenue to maximise return on their investment. The magnitude of initial R&D costs versus the ongoin g marginal costs of production might also influence the interest rate the funder would have to offer to sufficiently incentive both existing and future manufacturer s. Pay for performance Although the use of an amortisation approach to financing might addre ss the constraints imposed within current financial structures, this approach does not reduce the risk to health care systems of uncertain future health benefits which may not be realised in routine clinical practice . In contrast, a pay for performance t ype mechanism ensures that total price paid is more directly related to the performance of the therapy in clinical practice . This mechanism requires agreement between the funder and manufacturer on the measure of performance (e.g. response, relapse or mortality) , the progra m of data collection and analyse s requi red to monitor performance and the payment mechanism itself (e.g. fixed price at time of treatment with rebate, retrospective reimbursement for treatment 'successes', or amortised payments direct ly linked to performance over time). As with amortisation , the potential to spread repayments over the long er-term reduces the short -term budget impact . This financing approach also potentially addresses the uncertainties surrounding the potential health benefits and the risk of overpayment (i.e. where the opportunity costs are subsequently revealed to be greater than the acquisition cost) by the funder. Inevitably , such a mechanism is likely to be both more complex and expensive to implement than a simpl e PAS or amortisation approach. However, there are examples of existing PAS schemes within the NICE TA programme which already incorporate performance assessments and discontinuation rules are commonly applied within NICE appraisals to 'optimise' cost -effectiveness and reduce decision uncertainty. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 87 A pay for performance mechanism is potentially optimal if there is large uncertainty about long term outcomes, a relatively low cost of patient follow up and monitoring of the outcome(s) of interest (relative to the level of uncertainty), and a large total budget impact that, as with amortisation, can be spread over time. The potential challenges concern how performance in clinical practice would be monitored and evaluated and whether a simple assessment of conti nued treatment 'success' is feasible or not . A recent paper by Edlin et al.,95 proposed a leasing approach for innovative technologies as an alternative payment strategy combining elements of amortisation with pay -for-performance approaches. The advantages of this approach is that it addresses both the funding constraints caused by existing finance structures whi lst also ensuring that the risks associated with uncertain future health benefits are more appropriately shared between the funder and the manufacturer. Edlin proposed that having established the price at which the technology is expected to be cost - effec tive, the 'lease' payment due for each period of health delivered could be established by calculating a stream of payments over the expected lifetime of the technology that has the same expected net present value as the agreed price . The subsequent leasing scheme would work by paying the manufacturer for each period of time that health is delivered at the individual patient level . That is, if the observed effectiveness in clinical practice was equal to the expected effectiveness, the manufacturer would rece ive the full value of the technology over the agreed period. However, if observed effectiveness was less than expected, payment would stop and the risk to the health system of over -payment would be limited. Furthermore, manufacturers would be rewarded for technologies which resulted in better health outcomes than expected by receiving additional payment over extended periods of time. Using trastuzumab (Herceptin) in early breast cancer as an exemplar , and linking the lease to relapse - free survival, Edlin d emonstrated that the scheme not only reduced the total budgetary impa ct but also resulted in a more appropriate share of risk between the manufac turer and the funder , while simultaneously reducing the value of further research . Edlin concluded that such a scheme could help promote the rapid adoption of innovative technologies into routine clinical practice. Innovative financing Several authors have argued for even more innovative approach es to pricing to be considered , seeking inspiration from the wider financial world. For example, i nnovative licencing and the issuing of bonds, by which third party payers cover the costs of treatment, benefiting from the respective interest rate paid by the healthcare funder.91 Such mechanisms have has some success in the provision of vaccination programs in developing nations (through the International Finance Facility for CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 88 Immunisation scheme), appealing to investors seeking ethical inve stments. An alternative mechanism, considerably closer to a pay for performance mechanisms is the Health Impact Fund, where manufacturers distribute innovations at cost but are rewarded with performance based bonuses. Possible implications for NICE meth ods and processes In considering the potential characteristics of regenerative medicines and cell -based therapies and associated challenges for HTA, NICE will need to consider whether changes to their current processes and methods are required or not. Impo rtantly, some of the potential challenges highlighted are already considered within the existing Methods Guide.83 For example, the Committee is already requested to recognise that the evidence base will necessarily be weaker for some technologies, such as those used to treat patients with very rare diseases. If considered appropriate, this could be extended to include regenerative and cell therapies. Similarly, although the magnitude of budget impact is stated not to determine th e Appraisal Committee's decision , the existing method guide indicates that the Committee may require more robust evidence on the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of technologies that are expected to have a large impact on NHS resources. However, a potential conflict may arise between the certainty required for interventions with large budget impact and subsequent deliberations regarding the acceptability of 'weaker' evidence. NICE's existing processes also make separate provision for specific disease a nd technology characteristics which may be relevant to many regenerative medicines and cell therapies. NICE's current end -of-life criteria (EoL) allows the Committee, when considering the overall he alth benefits, to explore a QALY weighting that is differe nt from that of the reference case , assuming all the stated criteria are met. The methods guide also states that this approach can also be used in other circumstances when instructed by the NICE board. Further research may be warranted to determine whether a similar weighting approach might be appropriate for regenerative medicines and cell therapies. However, there remains an issue regarding whether such a weight should be based on product specific characteristics or patient specific characteristics (i.e. not confined to product type). Within the provisions and regulations of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 relating to NICE, due regard is also required concerning \" the desirability of promoting innovation in providing health services or social care in En gland \" (Section 6.1.3 Methods Guide)83. This is currently incorporated within the Committee's deliberative process for situation s in which the most plau sible ICER exceeds \u00a320,000 per QALY gained. In this situation, t he innovativ e nature of the technology, specifically if adds \"demonstrable and distinctive benefits of a substantial nature which may not have been adequately captured in the reference case QALY measure \". Importantly, neither of the previous regenerative medicines app raised by NICE to date were considered to demonstrate such benefits.78, 81 CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 89 The NICE methods guide also permits separate provision to be made via the specific discount rate it applies. Within NICE reference case for cost -effectiveness analysis, the same annual discount rate is required to be used for both costs and benefits (currently 3.5%). However, the use of a non -referenc e- case discount is permitted using rates of 1.5% for both costs and health effects i n cases when treatment restores people who would otherwise die or have a very severely impaired life to full or near full health, and when this is sustained over a very long period (normally at least 30 years) . Hence, certain regenerative medicines and cell therapies may be considered to meet these criteria. However, uncertainties remain regarding how the likelihood of achi eving these long-term health be nefits will be considered by the Committee, particularly in the context of the uncertainties outlined in this section . Further more , the stipulation that the Committee will also need to be satisfied that the introduction of the technology does not commit the NHS to significant irrecoverable costs , raises additional issues about whether this criteria will be met. Issues of discounting have been widely considered in the economic literature in relation to preventative treatments and particularly vaccination programmes . The appropriateness of employing different discount rates and/or different rates over time is an area which requires further consideration, particularly for potentially curative regenerative medicines and cell base d therapies. Westra et al.96 explored the impact of employing alternative discount rate approaches for HPV vaccination based on different time varying methods: a stepwise approach (a constant rate is applied for a set period and lowered in subsequent periods), a hyperbolic approac h (the discount rate declines over time), and a time-shifted approach . A recent review by Jit et al.97, also noted that t he UK Treasury currently recommends stepwise discounting to all public sector bodies, but at a very slowly declining rate (3.5% for the first 30 years, declining to 3.0% from year 31 and with further declines from year 76) . While the use of discounting seeks to incorporate social preferences rather than alleviate uncertainty , further consideration could be given to their application to regenerative medicines and cell therapies. Another approach commonly employed to better characterise the uncertainties surrounding longer term benefits and to inform the Committee's deliberations relate to the time horizon of the analysis and the methods of extrapolation . Within NICE's current metho ds guide, alternative scenarios are requested to be routinely considered to compare the implications of different methods for extrapolation of the results.83 Several other c ountry -specific guidelines for cos t-effectiveness analy ses request presentation of alternative scenarios based on different time horizons and comparing within - trial results with extrapolated results. Alteration of the time horizon of the evaluation, away from the lifetime analysis recommended by NICE where appropriate , acts to reduce the uncertainty by excluding the impact of costs and CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 90 outcomes that occur in the long term, where uncertainty is likely to be greatest. Whilst such analyses are potentially informative in terms of understanding how influential pa rticular assumptions are over the period of ex trapolation, restricting the horizon risks omitting important costs and outcomes related to a particular technology and simply shifts the risk associated with particular uncertainties from the health system to the manufacturer. Similarly, s eparating the within -trial results from the extrapolated results (or considering alternative scenarios for extrapolation) has been argued to allow separation of the uncertainty due to downstream consequences separately from o ther sources of uncertainty. Mortimer98 suggested th at this approach could enable decision -makers to assign a weight to the results of the extrapolation to t ake account of various uncertainties . However, it was also acknowledged that such a comparison is not always explicitly made and that implicit comparisons were often problematic since the relationship between the within -trial and extrapolation period may not be predictable. Issues of predictability may be a particular challenge for regenerative medicines and cell therapies. Whil e it is commonly argued that a within -trial analysis is conservative with respect to cost -effectiveness estimates, the author identified situations where this may not be true e.g. long term adverse effects offsetting any initial gains or where increased su rvival is associated with additional costs related to the disease and/or other unrelated diseases. Mortimer also highlighted that the relativity in results between within -trial analysis and the results of extrapolation was made even more problematic when u ncertainty due to future technological change is introduced. Several key factors were highlighted as affecting the relativity of results between within -trial and extrapolated result including the timing of potential technological advance, the proportion of patients who could benefit when the new technology becomes available and the effectiveness of the new technology. Conclusions The review has identified a number of common themes and potential challenges in relation to HTA and assessments of cost -effective ness for regenerative medicines and cell therapies. Some of the challenges identified do not appear unique to these types of therapies and are also faced by manufacturers of more conventional pharmaceuticals, biologics and devices. However, it seems likely that these challenges may be faced more routinely for regenerative medicines and cell therapies. There already exists provision within NICE's methods guide to accommodate some of these aspects, although potential challenges may arise in ensuring these are consistently applied between committees and understood by manufacturers. NICE will also need to c onsider whether further amendments to their processes and methods are required. Broader consideration will also need to be given to approaches which may extend beyond NICE's existing remit e.g. alternative funding approaches. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 91 Consequently other bodies and manufacturers themselves may also have an important role in identifying more innovative approaches to seeking reimbursement which recognise the inherent uncertainties and lead to a more effici ent sharing of associated risk. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 92 Exem plar technology appraisal of a regenerative m edicine 5 5.1 Selection of exemplar Following Regenerative Medicine Expert Group (RMEG ) subgroup discussions and further input from the Cell Therapy Catapult, it was decided that undertaking a n exemplar appraisal invol ving a real commercial product wa s not feasible for a number of reasons: there would be significant commercial sensitivities; products undergo ing regulatory review would be candidates for a real appraisal; and using a product at an earlier stage in clinical development would not be helpful as the evidence base would be even less mature and, therefore, would not have the attribut es of an 'exemplar' product. It was therefore proposed to undertake the evaluation of a hypothetical product. As a result o f both RMEG subgroup discussion and technical meeting discussion, the type of regenerative medicine chosen as the hypothetical produc t was CAR (c himeric antigen receptor ) T-cell therapy specific to the antigen CD19. The chosen indication was relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This specific combination was selected based on the existence of relatively mature data sets - in the context that none of the currently available CAR T-cell products are licensed. 5.1.1 About CAR T -cell therapies CAR -T therapies have been under development for around 20 years. The specific CAR T -cell therapies considered in this appraisal consist of autologous (i.e. the treated individual's) T-cells which are genetically modified to redirect the target of the T -cell receptors. These receptors target specific proteins found on the surface of leukaemia cells , in this case the protein CD19 , which is prese nt on B - cell leukaemia s as well as on healthy B cells, but it is not found on hematopoietic stem cells (which are situated in the bone marrow) nor on other tissues.99 The activated T -cells can then attack and destroy the leukaemia B -cells. Persistence of a given CAR T -cell therapy within the body is linked to the properties of the T -cell from which the cells were derived as well as the immune environment into which they are infused. CAR T -cell therapies have already begun to evolve, with 2nd generation therapies currently being trialled in phase II studies. Research efforts at developing future generations are focused on add ressing the key challenges of T -cell target specificity, persistence and ability to exert the desired anti -tumour effects as well as identifying new target antigens.100 CAR T-cell therapies have recently emerged as regenerative medicines with promising potential to treat haematologic cancers. In July 2014 the FDA granted 'breakthrough therapy' status to the CAR T -cell therapy CTL019 (manufactured by Novartis) for the treatment of adult and paediatric relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.101 Although CAR T -cell therapies may offer relapsed or refractory B -ALL patients a 'bridge' to stem cell transplantation, or possibly even a cure for B -ALL, i t is likely that patients will need to be CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 93 monitored for some key adver se effects which are often reported. These include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and B -cell aplasia. Cytokine release syndrome occurs as a result of cytokines being released from the successfully -targeted cancer cells and can result in various symptoms s uch as fever, headache, nausea, and a rash. The severity of CRS appears proportional to the tumour burden. Although CRS is an adverse effect of CAR T -cell therapy, there may be a correlation between the development of CRS and response to therapy; patients who do not develop CRS may be less likely to benefit from CAR T -cells, while those who develop CRS often respond to the therapy. While there may be some correlation between developing CRS and efficacy, there does not appear to be a strong correlation betwe en the degree of CRS and response to therapy.102 An absence of B cells - referred to as B cell aplasia - is an expected adverse effect of successful CAR T-cell therapies which eliminate normal mature and precursor B cells. As long as CAR T -cells persist, B cell aplasia continues (which provides what appears to be a highly accurate pharmacodynamic marker of CAR function).102 B-cell aplasia is a manageable with intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) though this is an expensive treatment. Persistent B -cell aplasia could result in an increased risk of infection even with replacement therapy.103 5.1.2 Overview of disease B-cell a cute emia ( lymphocytic (lymphoblastic) leukaemia (ALL) . ALL is a cancer that starts from the immature lymphocytes in the bone marrow , invad ing the blood fairly quickly , and then can spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), and testicles (in males). The term \"acute\" means that the leukaemia can progress quickly, and if not treated, would probably be fatal within a few months. The American Cancer Socie ty's estimates for acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) in the United States for 2015 (including both children and adults) are that there are a bout 6,250 new cases of ALL (3,100 in males and 3,150 in females) and around 1,450 deaths from ALL (800 in males and 650 in females) .104 The risk for developing ALL is highest in children younger than 5 years of age. While m ost cases of ALL occur in children, most deaths from ALL (abo ut 4 out of 5) occur in adults.104 UK statistics present a similar picture. Statisti cs for the incidence of ALL in the UK (2009 -2011) are provided by Cancer Research UK, based on data sourced from Office of National statistics, ISD Scotland, Welsh cancer Intelligence an d Surveillence Unit and the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry (Figure 1).105 Across all ages in 2011 there were 654 new cases reported in the UK (males 3 77, females 2 77), with crude incidence rates of 1.2 for males and 0.9 for females (per 100,000). I ncidence is strongly related to age, but ALL is unusual as it does not follow the pattern of increasing incidence CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 94 with age seen for most cancers, instead the highest incidence rates are in children, teenagers and young adults. I n the UK between 2009 and 2011, an average of 65% of cases were diagnosed in people aged under 25, and only 6% were diagnosed in those aged 75 and over. Age-specific incidence rates are highest in infants aged 0 -4 and drop sharply through childhood, adoles cence and young adulthood, reaching their lowest point at age 35 -39, and increasing slightly thereafter. Incidence rates are similar between males and females in all age groups except age 15 -19, when age -specific rates are significantly higher in males (ma le:female ratio of around 22:10). Averaged across all patients aged <30years the mean number of cases of ALL per year is 462 . Figure 1 Average number of cases of ALL per year in UK and Ag e-Specific Incidence Rates ( 2009 -2011 ) There are subtypes of ALL based on the type of lymphocyte (B cell or T cell) and how mature these leukemia cells are.104B-cell ALL comprises about 80% to 85% of ALL cases . There are several subtypes of B -cell ALL: Early precursor B (early pre -B) ALL (also called pro-B ALL ); Common ALL ; Pre-B ALL ; and Mature B -cell ALL (also called Burkitt leukaemia ). This last type is rare, accounting for only about 2% to 3% of childhood ALL ; it is essentially the same as Burkitt lymphoma and is treated differently from mo st leukaemia s. T-cell ALL comprises a bout 15% to 20% of cases of ALL. This type of leukaemia affects males more than females and generally affects older children more than does B -cell ALL. It often causes an enlarged thymus (a small organ in front of the CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 95 windpipe), which can sometimes cause breathing problems. It may also spread to the cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord) early in the course of the disease. Based on an estimate of 8 2.5% of ALL being B -cell ALL, there will be 540 cases of B -cell ALL in the UK per year, of which 3 81 will be in those aged under 30 years. Approximately 20% of these will be refractory to treatment or relapse,106 giving an estimate for young people with relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL in the UK to be 76. 5.1.3 Overview of current practice Whilst the management of ALL in adults and children is similar, the prognosis is different, with that in adults (aged over 30 years) being much poorer than in the younger age group. Hence they are generally considered as two distinct clinical groups . With stepwise improvements of risk -adapted chemotherapy and supportive care over the past five decades, cu rrent overall cure rates of newly diagnosed ALL are approaching 90% in the developed world in children and around 50% in adults.107 Treatment involves induction with combination chemotherapy for the attainment of complete remission (CR) (both clinical and haematological) followed by post -remission maintenance therapy with or without HSCT (which enhances relapse prevention particularl y in patients younger than 35 years). However, due to the morbidity and mortality risks associated with transplant, HSCT is usually reserved for high -risk patients. US National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines (NCCN ) recommendations for first -line treatment are based on risk stratification and age, as follows :108 Philadelphia chromosome -positive (in followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) if an appropriate donor is available; if transplantation is not feasible, continue multi -agent chemotherapy and a TKI Ph+ ALL (Adults < (TKI); consider allogeneic SCT if an a ppropriate donor is available and the patient has good performance status and no or limited comorbidities; if transplantation is not feasible, continue multi -agent chemotherapy and a TKI Ph+ ALL (Adult 65 y or with substantial comorbidities): TKI and cor ticosteroids or TKI and chemotherapy (evaluate end -organ reserve, end -organ dysfunction, and performance status) Ph- ALL (AYA): P aediatric -style multi -agent chemotherapy (Adults < 65 y): Multi -agent chemotherapy Ph- ALL (Adults 65 or with substan tial comorbidities): Multi -agent chemotherapy or corticosteroids (evaluate end -organ reserve, end -organ dysfunction) CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 96 However little progress has been made in the treatment of relapsed ALL . Following initial induction and maintenance therapy most adults wil l relapse and long -term leukaemia -free survival is achieved in only 20 -30% and following relapse, response rates to further chemotherapy are low at around 20 - 30% and long -term OS rates of 3 -24% have been reported109 From a UK study of 608 adult patients , OS at 5 years in newly diagnosed patients was elapse.110 Relapse is less common in paediatric ALL but accounts for the highest proportion of cancer deaths in children. 111Studies of Nordic and Austrian data found that of children with ALL 25% had a first relapse, 8% ha d a second112, 113 and 2% a third relapse.113 Around 50% of relapsed ALL in children does not respond to salvage therapy and for these patients survival rates are below 10% .113 In children, age and white blood cell count at primary diagnosis of ALL are the most important prognost ic factors for relapse: age < 1 year or >10 years is associated with the worst prognosis. In addition, site of relapse and duration of first remission are the major criteria for the classification of patients after first relapse.111 Therapy after relapsed ALL comprises re -induction chemotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy and/ or HSCT. Time to relapse (length of first remission), site of relapse and ALL - immunophenotype are established factors that are pr ognostic at first relapse and can be used to determ ine further treatment.111 B-cell ALL has a better prognosis than T -cell. Various regimens have been investigated and re -induction remission rates of 71% to 95% have been reported; the higher rates are generally associated with later first relapse. Patients who are refractory to re -induction therapy or who have a further relapse have a poor prognosis, with survival rates below 10%.113 Failure to ac hieve complete remission ( CR) to late re -induction chemotherapy is associated with previous failures to achieve CR or short remission. The proportion of patients achieving CR has been shown to reduce with subsequent relapses: in a study of 225 patients wit h ALL (195 B -cell ALL) mean CR rates (SE) were 83% (4%) for early first marrow relapse, 93% (3%) for first marrow marrow relapse, and 27% (6%) third marrow relapse. Five 15% (7%) respectively.106 Although some therapies with curative intent are capable of inducing a second remission in patients refractory to previous therapy , these are often associated with high treatment -related morbidity, -mortality and minimal survival .114 Such patients are eligible for innovative therapies in Phase 1 or 2 trials. Therapies for relapsed B -ALL which have been licensed by the EMA o r FDA are discussed in section 5 .3. In particular clofarabine , a purine nucleo side anti -metabolite , (which affects DNA elongation, synthesis and repair) was granted EMA marketing authorisation in 2006 for use in children and young adults with a 2nd or greater relapse (or refractory patients) . The pivotal trial of clofarabine (n=61 w ith 2nd or greater relapse) reported an CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 97 overall remission rate of 20% (12/61 patients) with 16% (10/61) of patients going on to receive HSCT. Clofarabine had been studied only in single arm trials, m arketing authorisation was granted 'under exceptional circumstances'. As discussed in Section 4 .3, the use of complete remission as an outcome is not specific at predicting which patients might subsequently relapse. In recent years evaluation of response to therapy in B - ALL patients has become more precise wi th the development of methods to detect minimal residual disease (MRD). Although t he FDA have concluded that the evidence base to indicate that early MRD status is the strongest predictor of long term EFS in ALL is unequivocal, t here is some uncertainty in how MRD - correlates to long -term ou tcomes in relapsed populations. The use of MRD as a surrogate endpoint is discussed further in section 4 .3. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) Allogeneic HSCT is a potentially curative treatment option and a number of studies have demonstrated improved outcomes compared with chemotherapy. However there are difficulties in the interpretation of the findings of many such trials such as patient selection bias, specific nature of HSCT, source of donor cells, an d the adverse effects associated with various specific transplant therapies.111 The risks associated with transplant include graft rejection, delayed immune reconstitution, graft versus host disease, and vulnerabil ity to infections. In addition there is significant toxicity associated with the chemo -radiotherapy conditioning required before transplant.111 The adverse effects of HSCT are not limited to those occurring in the s hort-term. One study investigat ed long -term survival and late deaths among 1,458 ALL patients who were disease -free two years after allogeneic HSCT; the median follow up was around 80 months.115 Of the 167 deaths , new cance rs accounted for around 10% of the primary causes of death, while graft versus host disease accounted for 23%. One study examined MRD in 157 patients with ALL in morphologic remission undergoing allogeneic HSCT following a myeloablative conditioning regime n, (12 patients were post 2 or more relapses). The 3 -year OS for those who were MRD -negative pre -transplant was 68% compared to 40% in the MRD -positive group, while the probabilities of relapse were 16% vs 33% for the two groups respectively. Twenty -four of the 153 patients had T -ALL, and the trend towards increased relapse in those with MRD was similar to that seen with B -ALL (HR 7.07). Post -transplant among those with any sample positive for MRD, the risk of subsequent relapse was higher (HR 3.21) as was the risk for overall mortality (HR 2. 54).116 Similar findings were reported in a study that included a slightly larger sample of post -2nd or later relapse (n=18 ).70 Based on these and o ther studies there is the suggestion of benefits through MRD -directed therapies, though controlled trials are needed to define their value.69 CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 98 Immunotherapies are showing promise and being investigated. These therapies are targeted at specific surface antigens expressed on the target cells: naked and un -conjugated antibodies; immunoconjugates and immunotoxins; bi -specific T cell engaging (BiTE) th erapy (blinotumobab); and CAR T -cells. The latter two target CD19.109 5.1.4 Decision problem The key aspects of the decision problem to be addressed were identified and agreed at a meeting between the Academic Group and a sub -group of the project advisory group (topic experts ). These were ba sed on discussion of the phase I/II CAR T cell trials in B -ALL which had been identified by literature searches performed by Cell Therapy Catapult. The agreed components of the decision problem were : Intervention : CD19 CAR T -cell therapies Indication : Patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leuka emia (B -ALL) who have relapsed (with no further planned curative chemotherapy or haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)) or who are refractory to standard chemotherapy . As described in section 5 .1.3 the t reatment pathways and prognosis for patients under - and over - aged 30 years are very different. Consequently, the indication considered in this assessment has focussed on those aged under 30 years. Subgroups : Sources of heterogeneity such as relapsed/ref ractory status, previous HSCT, CAR design, dose, conditioning chemotherapy, tumour burden at the time of therapy, or age of the patients may be explored. Comparators : Best supportive care (e.g. salvage chemotherapy) Efficacy outcomes : Response criteria suc h as complete response/remission (CR), partial response/remission (PR), and minimal residual disease negative (MRD); overall survival (OS); progression and/or event -free survival; persistence of CAR T -cells; health -related quality of life; rates of HSCT Adverse event outcomes : Cytokine release aplasia, febrile neutropenia, neurologic effects . CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 99 5.2 Review of evidence of clinical effectiveness : CAR T -cell therapies 5.2.1 Methods Initially, studies of CD19 CAR T -cells in B -ALL were identified by staff at Cell Therapy Catapult (who comprise part of the project Advisory Group, being experts in cell -based regenerative medicines) . PubMed was searched using the search terms \"CD19\", \"chimeric antigen receptor\", \"CAR\", and \"CD19 CAR\" with a cut -off date of 21st October 2014. The clinicaltrials.gov trials registry, and relevant published reviews of CAR T -cell therapies were also searched. In order to identify any further relevant clinical trials we performed update searches in Medline and Embase to May 2015. One reviewer performed an initial screen of the abstracts; those deemed potentially relevant were then screened by a second reviewer. Google searches to identify further data on already identified trials were also undertaken. Our clinica l advisor was also contacted regarding any relevant 2015 conferences where new data may have been recently presented. To further inform the study design details of the hypothetical data sets, the clinical trials.gov trials registry was searched for ongoing trials that had commercial involvement: the focus was on trials designed with the likely aim of acquiring marketing authorisation. 5.2.2 Overview of studies Three published papers were identified from the Cell Therapy Catapult searches.117-119 No further studies with results were identified from the Medline and Embase update searches. Two conference abstracts120, 121 (relating to two of the published studies) and one conference video122 (relating to one of the published studies) with more up to date data were identified from the Google searches. Of the planned, or (other) ongoing CAR T -cell studies identified on clinicaltrials.go v, seven had commercial involvement: three were phase II trials, all with estimated enrolments of 67 patients; one was a phase I/II trial with an estimated enrolment of 80 patients and three were phase I trials ( Table 7). All were single -arm studies. Two of the phase II trials were multi -centre studies (i.e. they listed more than one centre for recruitment in the Contacts and Locations field) and three had a primary outcome which assessed response or remission; the time frames stated for these outcomes ranged from 9 weeks to one year. Only one trial reported the collection of longer -term survival data, with a stated time frame of 5 years for overall survival, event -free survival, and relapse -free survival. 5.2.3 Efficacy Results Details of the three trials are presented in Table 2. Two of the studies were phase I trials and one was categorised as a phase I/IIA trial (on clinicaltrials.gov); safety was the primary outcome in al l trials (one study also had maximum tolerated dose as a co -primary outcome). All trials had recruited fewer than 40 patients, though two were ongoing.118, 119 CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 100 As can be seen from Table 6, notable clinical heterogeneity was evident both within and across trials. One study wa s of children and adults and one studied children and young adults. The remaining study was only of adults119 and so ultimately was not of further use for the assessment . Most patients had had a prior relapse following remission; a small proportion of patients were refractory to previous treatments. In two studies the CAR T -cell treatments were mostly used to enable patients to receive HSCT (i.e. used as a bridging therapy).117, 119 The r emaining study appeared to recruit a more difficult to treat population, with most patients having two or more relapses and previous HSCT; here the treatment intention may possibly have been curative.118 CAR T cell design also varied, with either the CD28 or the 4 -1BB co -stimulatory domains being used; a difference which might explain the more prolonged persistence of circulating CAR T -cells seen in one of the studies.102 Persistence of CAR T- cell therapies in the body can result in benefit and risk , depending on the duration of persistence. Two s urrogate endpoints were reported in all 3 trials: complete remission (CR) and minimal residual disease (MRD). Rates of CR ranged from around 70% to 90%. As would be expected, the rates of achieving a status of MRD were lower, ranging from around 60% to 80% , although only one trial stated the MRD threshold used, which was 0.01% ( i.e. 1 cancer cell in 10,000 normal cells ).117 All 3 trials reported overall surv ival (OS) data. In one trial the p robability of OS at 9.7 months was 52 %.117 The other 2 trials reported probabilities of OS at 6 months which were 58 %121 and 78% respectively.118 5.2.4 Adverse effects The key adverse events noted in the trials were cytokine release synd rome , B-cell aplasia, febrile neutropenia, and various neurological effects. In 2 studies most patients had mild to moderate cytokine release syndrome ( CRS ) although a greater incidence of severe CRS was evident in the trial in adults.119 Affected patients were treated with steroids or tocilizumab. Two of the 3 studies reported incidence of B-cell aplasia. In one study prolonged B -cell aplasia did not occur117 and in the other B - cell aplasia occurred in all patients who had a response, and pe rsisted for up to one year after CAR T - cells were no longer detectable.118 Significant proportions of patients had febrile neutropenia or neurological adverse effects such as hallucinations or altered mental status (Table 6).CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 101 Table 6 Data available for the three published CAR T -cell trials in patients with B -ALL Study details Study (authors, year, product and sponsor) Lee et al 2014117 CD19 -CAR T cells , SAEs, Maximum tolerated dose SAEs SAEs Study design Phase I feasibility/dose escalation Phase I/IIA Phase I No. of centres 1 2 (1 adult, 1 children) 1 Planned duration of follow up 5 years (from ct.gov) Unclear (but appears to be 1 year for most outcomes) 2 years (from ct.gov) Sample size 21 30 30 39 16 33 (32 evaluable) Duration of follow up (so far) Median 10 months 6 months (median follow up 7 months) 6 months 6 months NR Median follow up 5.1 months Population Relapsed/refractory 14 relapsed, 7 refractory 27 relapsed, 3 refractory All 16 relapsed 14 pts had 3 prior lines of therapy No of prior relapses 1:6 pts; 2: 8 pts 1:5 pts; 2: 22 pts Appears to be 1 Age 14 children, 7 adults; range 5 to 27 yrs 25 children, median 11 yrs (range 5 to 22); 5 adults, median 47 yrs (range 26 to 60) All children or young adults, median age 10yrs (range 5 to 22) All children or young adults Adults; median 50 yrs (range 18 to >60) Median 54 yrs (range 22 to 74) No. of B -ALL patients 20/21* 29/30* 16/16 MRD threshold <0.01% by flow cytometry Unclear, but measured by flow cytometry Unclear, but measured by flow cytometry MRD - at baseline 0 5/25 children 5/25 2/15 Previous HSCT? 8 18/25 children 4/16 11 Intervention CAR T cell dose (per kg) Mostly 1 x106 (15/21) or 3 x106 (4/21) 1 to 10 x107, or 5 to 50 x108 (if over 50kg) 107 to 108 3 x106 1 to 3x106 Conditioning regimen Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide 15 pts had Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide Type of dosing regimen Single dose; 3 pts had 2nd infusion Given over 1-3 days Split dose ( days 1 and 2 ) Efficacy outcomes Complete 10/16 (63%) point unclear (median time to CR/CRi 29/32 (91%) CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 102 Study details Study (authors, year, product and sponsor) Lee et al 2014117 CD19 -CAR T cells , 70% (95% with B -ALL months: 76% (95% CI 61 to 94) 24.5 days) Partial response/remission Not reported Not reported Not reported MRD negative Day 28: 12/20 (60%, 95% CI 36.1 to 80.9) in 20 patients with B - ALL 22/30 ( at perhaps 1 month - time point unclear ) 23/30 (77%) 12/16 (75%) Time point unclear 23 of the 28 MRD evaluable pts (82%) Overall survival Probability at 9.7 months 51.6% (median 10 months) Probability at 6 months 78% (95% CI 65 to 95) Probability at 6 months: 78% (95% CI 63 to 95) NR CI: 36 to 74) Progression -free survival 78.8% in the 12 pts achieving MRD - status (beginning at 4.8 months) NR NR Event -free survival Not reported Probability at 6 months 67% (95% CI 51 to 88) Probability at 6 months: 63% (95% CI 47 to 84) Probability at 6 months: 70% NR Persistence of CAR T cells 18/21 had detectable CAR T cells with peak expansion occurring around day 14.

This is likely to be typical of regenerative medicines Therapy potentially offers a 'cure' Potentially serious adverse effects Limited data available (single -arm studies) Appropriate comparator and control data need to be identified /generated. 5.3 Review of licensed treatments for relapsed/refractory B -ALL A pragmatic review of the other treatments for relapsed/refractory B -ALL which have been licensed by the EMA or FDA was undertaken. This was done to further inform decisions to help construct the CAR T -cell therapy hypothetical data sets, and to help to put them in context. Three treatments were quickly identified from the B -ALL literature and EMA/FDA websites: Evoltra, Blincyto and Marqibo. This number of treatments was deemed sufficient for the purposes of this exercise. Evoltra (clofarabine) - known as Clolar in the U.S. - was granted EMA marketi ng authorisation under exceptional circumstances in 2006. It is a purine nucleoside anti -metabolite (which affects DNA Marqibo (vincristine sulph ate liposome injection ) were both licensed by th e FDA under the accelerated approval programme (in 2014 and 2012, respectively); in this programme, drugs fo r serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need may be approved based on a surrogate endpoint. Blincyto, which has also been granted 'breakthro ugh therapy' designation, is a monoclonal antibody designed to specifically attach to CD19 proteins on leukaemia cells. Marqibo is a targeted delivery of vinicristine which vinicristine in nanoparticle liposomes. Marqibo and Blin licensed for use in adults, and Evoltra (clofarabine) for use in children and young adults. All three treatments have orphan product designation, all claim to meet unmet medical need, and the submissions for all were primarily based on data from p hase II single -arm trials. However, whereas Marqibo and Evoltra are licensed for patients with a 2nd or greater relapse (or refractory patients), the approval for Blincyto is broader, covering patients with \"Philadelphia Chromosome negative relapsed or ref ractory B -precursor ALL\"; over half the patients in the pivotal Blincyto study had had only one relapse. A consequence of these different populations can be seen in the pivotal trial sample sizes, with smaller studies for Marqibo (n=65) and Evoltra (n=61) and a larger study for Blincyto (n=189). CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 107 Primary outcomes for all three trials were based on remission status (complete and/or overall remission). All studies also reported overall survival. For the 2nd or greater relapse populations, treatment with Evoltr a resulted in an overall remission rate of 20% (12/61 patients) with 16% (10/61) of patients going on to receive HSCT; treatment with Marqibo resulted in a complete remission rate of 15% (10/65 patients) - although the figure was 12% based on the FDA's ass essment - with 18% (12/65) receiving HSCT. However, most of these patients did not achieve complete remission with Marqibo. As would be expected, a higher rate of complete remission was seen in the Blincyto trial (42%), when compared with the Marqibo and E voltra trials, since most patients were at 1st relapse. Further results and other assessment details are presented i n Appendix 4. The EMA review of Evoltra stated that, given the efficacy seen early on in the clinical programme, studies using a placebo comparator were considered clinically unethical. Active comparator studies were also not deemed to be appropriate as there were no other recognise d therapeutic options available: \"The indication is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive data on clinical efficacy and safety.\" Marketing authorisation was therefore granted 'under exceptional circumstances'.123 The AWMSG (All Wales Medicines Strategy Group) recommended Evoltra only if the intended use was as a bridge to HSCT ( and that it should not be used with palliative intent).124 The FDA approval of Marqibo seemed less straightforward; committee members consistently stated that the proposed phase 3 trial was critical in assessing the benefit of Marqibo. Some members indicated that the trial should be completed before approval, w hile several indicated that accelerated approval may be appropriate, but with the expectation that this approval would be withdrawn if the phase 3 trial failed to confirm clinical benefit. The post -approval study was a multi -centre phase III randomised tri al comparing standard vinicristine with Marqibo in older adults with newly diagnosed untreated Philadelphia negative ALL; the proposed sample size was 348. For Blincyto, a confirmatory phase III RCT was required which will compare Blincyto with standard care chemotherapy in relapsed/refractory adults; this was ongoing at the time of submission to the FDA. A 2:1 randomisation ratio was used, with more patients receiving blinatumomab. Around 400 patients were expected to be enrolled and the primary endpoint i s overall survival. 5.3.1 Single a rm B -ALL trials: identifying appropriate control data As discussed in section 4 .2, although the results of single -arm trials can be compared with historical control data, the results of such comparisons can only be considered a s reliable indicators of treatment benefit when the disease natural history is very well known, the patient population is homogenous and the standard care treatment has little impact on outcome s. For the Evoltra, Blincyto and Marqibo different approaches w ere used to devise a control data set. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 108 For Blincyto a weighted analysis of patient -level data from 694 retrospective controls (1990 -2014) was performed.125 This study, which was of relapsed/refractory adult s treated with standard of care therapy, utilised databases in several EU countries and the US. The manufacturer of Bli ncyto (Amgen) also conducted a model -based meta -analysis of clinical study data to project the effect of Blincyto relative to existing th erapies. For their ongoing trial in children, Amgen cited both a key paper on prognostic factors in B -ALL ,106 and the complete remission rates seen with Clolar (clofarabine), stating that their primary efficacy endpoint would be met if the CR+CRh* ( CRh*= CR with incomplete haematological recover y) rate was at least 22.5% (suggesting efficacy similar to, or greater than that for clofarabine) .126 For the Marqibo FDA submission literature searches were performed to identify response rates in relevant patients. The study reporting the best historical comparison d ata still had some key differences with the Marqibo trial population, most notably in terms of line of treatment, eligibility for transplant, and site of adjudication.127 Comparisons were made with the closest matched subgroup of patients in the historical study: patients who received third -line single -agent treatment.128 Clofarabin e was assessed in 2006 so the aforementioned O'Brien study was not available. Instead data were obtained from German and Dutch cancer registries; simple comparisons of median survival results were presented to the EMA.123 5.3.2 Summary Studies which form the basis of regulatory submissions of treatments for patients with 2nd or greater r elapsed/refractory B -ALL will be small (around 65 patients), phase II, single -arm trials Primary endpoints will be surrogate endpoints such as complete remission Confirmatory randomised trials may be appropriate and viable in related larger populations, where other treatment options exist. For very small patient populations it is likely to be difficult to identify published prognostic studies which have suitable historical control data. Other strategies may therefore be needed , such as seeking access to national patient databases (in order to perform new studies)CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 109 The target product profile and hypothetical data sets 6 6.1 Summary of issues to consider to inform creation of the Target Product Profiles (TPP s) and hypothetical data sets The innovative nature of regenerative medicines, together with the indications that many of them will be expected to target initially (populations with high levels of unmet medical need), means there is a collective desire to expedite their approval and ap praisal. This ambition may run counter to the need for additional vigilance relating to robust evidence and long -term outcomes. Regulatory bodies must therefore endeavour to balance urgency of patient need with the requirement for robust evidence on effica cy and safety. This can be managed through a combination of regulatory approval based on limited - although promising - data, combined with post -approval requirements for continued data collection. From the perspective of NICE appraisals, this means that t he evidence base available at the time of product approval may be highly uncertain; the cost of this uncertainty has to be a key part of the decision making process. The reviews have identified several broad issues relevant to uncertainty around the clini cal evidence for the creation of the TPPs and hypothetical data sets for the exemplar: It is not universally the case that regenerative medicines (or ATMPs) will be tested using non - randomised study designs. Rather, submitted pivotal studies may well in fa ct be randomised, notably when levels of unmet need are low and diseases/conditions are not rare; in such cases the maturity of data (which would be available at the time of a NICE appraisal) has been up to five years duration. When single -arm trials, or case series, do form the basis of a regulatory submission, a key consideration when judging uncertainty should be the likelihood of cure or improvement without experimental treatment. However, it may be very difficult to identify published prognostic studies which have suitable historical control data. Other strategies for obtaining historical data may well be needed, such as seeking access to national patient databases. Where single -arm trial data are compared with historical da ta and appropriate methods to adjust for confounding are employed, the selection of the method used must be explicit and based on sound reasoning; despite advances in statistical techniques clear challenges remain in generating accurate unbiased estimates of effect from non -randomised data. Results from single -arm trials can only be considered as reliable indicators of treatment benefit when the disease natural history is very well known, the patient population is homogenous, and the control (standard care ) treatment has little impact on outcomes. Although more mature evidence, such as confirmatory RCTs, may sometimes be viable in the specific population, it might also only be expected in larger, similar populations (for example, B -CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 110 ALL patients in first relapse). This raises the possibility of incorporating indirectly relevant but more reliable (and possibly more mature) data into the analysis, to reduce uncertainty. The high technology status of regenerative medicines may imply greater potential for variati on in response across both individuals and centres. This is likely to have implications in terms of the generalisability of efficacy and safety estimates obtained from small single -centre (probably expert centre), single -arm studies; in the absence of larg er or more varied trials, this might only be addressed by access to individual patient data so that potential predictors of response or effect modifiers may be investigated. Another key issue is that pivotal trials in regulatory submissions are likely to r eport primary endpoints which are surrogates for real clinical endpoints. On average, trials using surrogates report larger treatment effects than trials using final patient -relevant outcomes. This has implications for effect estimate uncertainty, especial ly when only surrogate endpoints are reported; the choice of surrogate outcomes used should be researched, explicit and justified. Nevertheless, to maximise the use of all available data, and to reduce overall uncertainty, multivariate meta -analysis method s to analyse data should be considered - whatever the maturity of the evidence base. Related to the issue of surrogates as primary outcomes is that of duration of follow -up: use of intermediate shorter -term outcomes avoids the need for long follow -up. The consequence of this is that even where overall survival data are recorded, these data are immature at the point of regulatory approval. Regenerative medicines are by their nature innovative products and may be subject to continuing development, with new ge nerations having improved efficacy. This may pose problems when evaluating long -term efficacy and safety; for example, to what extent can the long -term safety data from a first -generation product be used to inform long -term safety of a related newly - licens ed second -generation product? This may mean that as well as bioavailability -type studies, key trials conducted earlier in the development process may have to be replicated or adjustments be made in the analyses of trial data to account for their indirectne ss. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 111 For the specific purpose of deciding what to include in the exemplar hypothetical data sets, the best information to begin with comes from the published and ongoing trials for CAR T -cells, together with the EMA/FDA licensed non -regenerative medicines for relapsed B -ALL. These indicate that a minimum data set would comprise of a small (around 65 patients), phase II, single -arm trial, with surrogate endpoints such as complete remission as the primary endpoints. Minimum residual disease (MRD), the surroga te endpoint which is the strongest predictor of long term event -free survival in ALL, is also likely to be reported, although there is considerable uncertainty about its value in relapsed populations. Historical control data must be identified which shoul d reflect the treatment B -ALL patients would receive in the absence of CAR T -cell therapies being available. This is necessary to utilise the hypothetical trial evidence within the economic analyses. A key challenge for constructing the historical control group will therefore be identifying the population included within the single -arm studies and selecting an appropriate control group: any selected control group is unlikely to exactly match the tiny population included in the single -arm studies so comparis ons will therefore be subject to confounding. To mitigate the effects of any such bias a second challenge will be to identify and apply the most appropriate methods to adjust for confounding. The small sample sizes available from the trials of CAR T -cell in relapsed/refractory B -cell ALL imply that estimates of effect are likely to be inexact and imprecise and this should be considered when creating the more mature data sets. More mature data sets would be expected to have larger (tending towards appropria tely powered) sample sizes to reduce the width of the confidence interval around any effect estimate. It should be noted that this would not influence the magnitude of any potential bias and may lead to increased confidence in an incorrect estimate of eff ect. Increasing the sample size may however, also allow for a wider range of statistical methods to mitigate the effects of confounding and therefore have an indirect effect on reducing any bias in the effect estimate. An RCT could be included in a more ma ture data set or the availability of data from an RCT in B - ALL patients in first relapse could be proposed. This latter possibility raises methodological questions of how the results of confirmatory RCTs in an indirect population might be used to re -evalua te the uncertainty of the direct evidence base. 6.2 Background to developing the TPP s and evidence sets Data from the 3 published trials for CAR T -cell therapies were discussed at a meeting of the Project Advisory Group on 24th June 2015. Based on these discus sions it was decided that for the purposes of CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 112 the exemplar , the population would comprise children and young adults who had experienced two or more relapses or were refractory to treatment (with older adults excluded) . It was further decided that the exem plar would explore both the therapeutic goals of the CAR T -cell therapy encompassing bridging and remission/curative intents. Two target product profiles (TPP) were subsequently developed to be consider ed as part of the exemplar appraisal: CAR T -cell therapy used as a \" bridge to HSCT \", where the primary goal of treatment is to induce short -term remission of disease in order to maximise the opportunity for successful HSCT, and CAR T -cell therapy used with \"curative intent \", where the primary goal of CAR T -cell treatment is long-term remission/cure of disease (with or without HSCT) These two approaches to treatment with CAR T -cell therapy imply two potentially different contexts in which therapy may be appraised. Consequently, there are sepa rate implications arising from the different applications that require their consideration as two distinct scenarios. In the \" bridge to HSCT \" scenario, the survival benefits of treatment are determined primarily by the subsequent receipt of HSCT and the a ssociated benefits which stem from this. As such, the health benefits of CAR T -cell therapy are closely linked to the HSCT status of the cohort in the immediate period following CAR T -cell therapy. From a regulatory and reimbursement standpoint, the prim ary determinant of treatment efficacy is likely to include short -term endpoints such as remission, and potentially MRD status. These data may also be supported by data on the outcomes of HSCT after CAR T -cell. Marketing approval may therefore be achieved t hrough demonstrating clinical benefit in terms of remission, potentially MRD status and subsequent rates of HSCT. In the \"curative intent\" scenario, the survival benefit of treatment is considered to be as a direct result of CAR T -cell therapy itself. In this context, there is no separate surrogate treatment or process (i.e. HSCT) which determines the long -term benefits of therapy. From a regulatory standpoint, the primary determinant of the efficacy of treatment in this scenario is likely to include long er-term clinical endpoints such as event -free survival ( EFS) and OS and increased levels of data maturity may be required. New technologies are submitted to licensing agencies to seek regulatory approval and are subject to NICE appraisal at various stages of development of the supporting evidence base. To explore the impact of different levels of precision and maturity in the evidence base, 3 hypothetical data sets were constructed for each TPP: CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 113 The minimum set : the minimum data considered potentially sufficient for CAR T -cell therapy to be granted conditional regulatory approval. The intermediate set : a variant of the minimum set , where the efficac y and safety of CAR T - cell therapy has been assessed over a long er follow -up period. The mature set : a variant of the intermediate set where the efficacy and safety of C AR T -cell therapy has been assessed in a larger c linical study but with a similar follow -up period as the intermediate set. In developing the TPPs, it was not our intention to directly compare the separate scenarios or to use these to infer differen ces between the alternative CAR T -cell therapies currently being developed. Neither were the different evidence sets intended to be prescriptive regarding th e sufficiency of evidence for the purposes of regulatory or reimbursement processes. Instead, the hypothetical TPPs were developed to provide an exploration of potential issues and challenges associated with varying levels of precision and maturity in the underlying evidence base and the potential impact that these might have on subsequent assessments of cost-effectiveness and associated decision uncertainty. In total, six evidence sets were developed spanning the separate TPPs (3 sets for \"bridge to HSCT\", and 3 sets for \"curative intent\"). Each of the 3 evidence sets includes hypothetical efficacy and safety data for CAR T -cell therapy and for a historical control. The efficacy and safety estimates in the \"bridge to HSCT \" and \"curative intent \" TPP s, were d erived from data from Lee et al117 and Maude et al118 respec tively, reflecting the clinical heterogeneity and the potentially different treatment intentions reported in Section 5.2. 6.3 Defining a historical control The lack of control data within existing CAR T -cell studies necessitates the selection of a historical control from existing published literature to inform the TPPs and economic model. As discussed in Section 4.2, the use of a historic al control introduces potential bias as observed or unobserved confounders other than the treatments may impact the outcomes of interest . As such a direct comparison of the CAR -T cell results and a historic control may be subject to bias . Observable sources of confounding can be potentially adjusted for in a number of ways depending on if the available d ata is being considered at a single study level or through the synthesis of evidence from a number of studies (as discussed in Appendix 2 ). A key source of potential observable confounding relates to differences in patient characteristics which are known to be related to subsequent prognosis. To identify prognostic factors which might provide a basis for adjust ing a historic control to account for potential prognostic imbalance, a search was conducted to identify previously published multivariate prognost ic models reported for patients with ALL . CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 114 The search identified 12 potentially relevant studies. However, five of these did not reported sufficient detail on the results to be considered further .113, 114, 127, 129, 130 A summary of the patient characteristics in the remaining 7 studies are reported in Appendix 7. None of the prognostic models specifically focussed on the population of interest. In addition , there appeared little consistency across the prognostic factors selected for inclusion in the multivariate analyses, with no single factor considered across all models and only few of which could be applied to the patient characteristics reported within existing CAR T -cell studies . Hence, while the formal adjustment for potential bias is desirable, the lack of access to individual patient data meant this was not considered feasible within the exemplar. A separate search was subsequently conducted to identify possible historical control studies that might be more generalisable to the population of interest (i.e. based on age and prior history of relapse) and which might minimise the potential for bias in the absence of a formal adjustment for confounding . This search iden tified two studies considered to be potentially generalisable to the population considered within the exemplar evaluation.114, 131 Jeha et al.131 reported on a phase II open label study of clofarabine in paediatric patients with refractory or relapsed ALL. Von Stackelberg et al114 conducted a retrospective analysis of outcomes in children and adolescents with ALL who had not responded to salvage therapy and evaluated the overall of survival of the patient population given different treatment modalities (curati ve, palliative and no therapy). For consistency across TPPs and evidence sets, the same historical control an d data was considered in both scenarios. Clofarabine and the study by Jeha et al were subsequently selected to act as the control treatment and source of historical control data, for the following reasons: Clofarabine is considered a standard of care chem otherapy for B -cell relapsed refractory ALL, alongside other chemotherapies such as fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony - stimulating factor, and idarubicin (FLAG -IDA). It is the only EMA licensed treatment available for ALL in paediatric patients wh o have relapsed or are refractory after receiving at least two prior regimens and where there is no other treatment option anticipated to result in a durable response . Although clofarabine has not been appraised by NICE for this indication, clofarabine is currently funded through the cancer drugs fund (CDF) . At the time of writing, clofarabine was the only treatment for relapsed and refractory B -cell ALL approved on the CDF. The phase II study population was also considered to be broadly consistent with pop ulations enrolled to Maude et al and Lee et al. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 115 6.4 Developing the evidence sets and target product profiles The first step in developing the hypothetical evidence was to define the sample size and maturity of evidence (i.e. follow -up) for the minimum, interm ediate and mature evidence sets. The second step involved generating the efficacy and safety data conditional on the sample and maturity levels specified for each of the evidence sets. This involved the synthesis of data reported in the existing CAR T -cell, historical control studies and simulation modelling. 6.5 Defining the sample size and maturity of evidence in the evidence sets studies Current evidence on the efficacy of CAR T -cell therapies is limited to early phase I/II studies with patient numbers reported between 16 and 30.117, 118, 132 It is anticipated that larger clinical studies will be needed to meet the minimum requirements for positive regulat ory approval. This evidence is expected to come from a series of phase II/III studies. Several previous pharmaceutical treatments for ALL have been granted regulatory approval based on efficacy and safety data from single arm phase II studies with sample s izes ranging from 61 to 189. This appears to be reflected in the design of planned and ongoing CAR T -cell studies in ALL. According to the ClinicalTrials.Gov trials registry , there are currently 3 registered phase II trials investigating the efficacy and s afety of CAR T -cell therapies . The planned sample size of these trials is 67 patients (see Table 7). There is also one phase I/II trial with an estimated enrolment o f 80 patients . The expected minimum data requirement for regulatory approval with CAR T -cell therapy was therefore set in the region of 60-80 patients. This sample size was used in both the minimum and intermediate evidence sets. The mature evidence set was assumed to be based on trial evidence derived from a larger sample of patients than the minimum and intermediate evidence sets. This evidence set was designed to reflect a scenario where the evidence base for CAR T -cell therapy could include data from a more conventional RCT (or alternativel y a larger uncontrolled study) with sufficient duration of follow -up to determine the longer -term efficacy for key clinical endpoints including OS. In practice, the sample size and maturity for such a study would be determined by a number of factors, including conventional statistical power calculations, likely accrual rates, the competitive landscape, and overall study costs. In the time available, it was not feasible to formally consider these elements in estimating the anticipated sample size for this study. Instead, the sample size was based on the planned enrolment size of an ongoing phase III trial of blinatumomab in adult ALL, identified from previous hand -searching of Clinical Trials.Gov. In this study, the planned enrolment was for 400 patients to be randomised to blinatumomab or standard of care at a ratio of 2:1. As such, of the total 400 randomised patients, 1 33 would be randomised to the control arm and 267 would be patients randomised to blinatumomab . For the mature set, the study sample size was therefore set in the region of 120-140 patients per treated group (240 -280 in total). CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 116 In using the specific sampl e size for the mature evidence set, we recognise that there are differences between the patients recruited into the blinatumomab trial and the specific population being considered here both in terms of the age and prior history of relapse. However, for the purposes of a hypothetical exemplar this was considered to provide a reasonable basis for investigating the potential impact of increased precision. The intermediate and mature evidence sets were also assumed to be based on trial evidence with longer ef ficacy follow -up than the minimum set. For the minimum set, trial follow -up was based on a similar duration reported within existing CAR T -cell studies, with a median follow -up of approximately 10 months. For the intermediate and mature sets, trial follow -up was based on the maximum planned study duration for all phase II CAR T -cell trials registered on the Clinical Trials.Gov registry. Across these studies, the longest planned follow -up period was 5 -years. A summary of the targeted sample size and levels of evidence maturity considered across each of the evidence sets is provided in Table 8. Table 8: Summary of the sample size and maturity of t rial evidence assumed in the 3 evidence sets Minimum Intermediate Mature Sample size 60-80 60-80 120-140 Study follow -up 10 months (median) 60 months (maximum) 60 months (maximum) 6.6 Estimating the efficacy of CAR T -cell and comparator treatments in the evidence sets For all dichotomous outcomes, including response, remission and use of HSCT, parameter estimates were extracted directly from the existing CAR -T cell and clofarabine publications. The effect of increased sample size on the variance parameter for each dichotomous outcome was modelled using a beta distribution. As these outcomes tend to be measured during the first few months of a study, it is expected that longer follow -up would not directly impact these parameter estimates. For the overall su rvival endpoint, parameter estimates were derived by digitising the Kaplan -Meier (KM) curves reported in the main study publications and using the algorithm by Guyot et al43 to impute the patient -level time to event, and event type (censored or event) data. These data were then analysed using conventional semi -parametric survival modelling techniques using the statistical programming platform R.133 This included assessments of landmark survival probabilities at 6 -, 12- and 60 -months, and derivation of t he hazard ratio for CAR T -cell versus standard of care therapies CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 117 and restricted mean survival times ( i/e/ in the event of non -proportional hazards , formally tested using the Schoenfeld residual test). Using the Maude and Lee studies, it was possible to generate samples of between 21 and 30 patients treated with CAR T -cell therap y. However, the expected minimum sample size for regulatory approval may be in the region of 60 -80 patients. Therefore, it was necessary to increase the size of the imputed data s ets from between 21 and 30 to between 60 and 80. This was achieved by replicating each of the imputed data sets until the total sample size was between 60 -80 patients for the minimum/intermediate evidence sets and 120 -140 for the mature evidence set. By cr eating the pooled sets in this way, the mean survival probabilities and KM plots for overall survival remained consistent across evidence sets, whereas the variance around those estimates were allowed to vary in line with the sample size. For the mature a nd intermediate data sets, it was also necessary to simulate an increase in the duration of study follow -up to account for a scenario where CAR T -cell studies had longer follow -up, up to a maximum of 5 -years. This adjustment was made by adding survival tim e to the imputed patient records that were censored after the last recorded event in each study. These patients were subsequently assumed to be re -censored at their new survival time. The same approach was applied in both the CAR T -cell and clofarabine arm s. By extending the study time of patients who were censored after the last recorded event, the following assumptions are made: Patients who were alive and censored at the end of the studies were likely to be 'cured ' of ALL, such that the patient would als o be alive and censored at the end of the longer follow -up period Patients who were censored prior to the last event were assumed to have been lost to follow - up, such that additional trial follow -up would not lead to further information on the timing of death (or re -censoring) in that individual patient. This approach ensured that the KM curves remained consistent across the evidence sets. The net result of this adjustment is that the more mature evidence sets contain more information on the long -term survival of those alive and censored at the end of the current studies. An illustration of this approach is provided in Figure 2. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 118 Figure 2: Illus tration of adjustment to data set to account for additional study maturity It is important to highlight that in practice, additional follow -up times in trials would likely result in changes to the KM curves and estimates of survival benefit. To predict t hese changes would require access to individual patient level data, so as to elicit the characteristics of patients who are censored at shorter follow -up and to then predict the unobserved event time for the censored patients, conditional on their characte ristics. With the imputed data, it is not possible to identify the characteristics of those who are censored, and there is insufficient data to develop a prediction equation for the unobserved event times. 6.7 Finalised TPPs 6.7.1 Bridge to HSCT TPPs Data on the ev idence sets assumed for the clinical efficacy of CAR T -cell therapy as a bridge to HSCT is reported in Table 9 (overall survival), and Table 10 (dichotomous endpoints, adverse events). The associated KM plots are reported in Figure 3. Minimum data set In terms of overall survival, CAR T -cell therapy was assumed to be associated with improved probabilities of survival at months 6 (66.8%) and 12 (51.8%) compared to standard of care therapy (32.0% at 6-months and 20.7% at 12 -months). Treatment with CAR T -cell therapy was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the time to death, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.33 (95% confidence interval: 0.205 - 0.539).

The median follow -up in the minimum set was 11.3 months . Intermediate data set Given the consistency in the assumptions and the KM data assumed across the evidence sets, similar expected results were observed in the intermediate set as reported in the minimum set. However, evidence was now also assumed to be reported on the survival benefits up to 5 -years, with 5 -year landmark survival probabilities of 51.8% and 20.7% for CAR T and standard of care therapy assumed respectively. Treatment with CAR T -cell therapy was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the time to death, with a HR of 0.31 (95% CI: 0.19 - 0.50). With increased data maturity compared to the minimum set, there was a greater trend towards non - proportional hazards. In the restricted mean survival time analysis, treatment CAR T -cell therapy was associat ed with a mean improvement in life expectancy of 22.06 months (95% CI: 12.87 - 31.25 months), versus standard of care therapy. The median follow -up in the intermediate data set was 53.6 months. Mature data set With increased precision and data maturity com pared to the minimum set, treatment with CAR T -cell therapy was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the time to death , with a hazard ratio of 0.31 (95% CI: 0.22 - 0.43). In the restricted mean survival time analysis, treatment CAR T - cell therapy was associated with a mean improved in life expectancy of 22.06 months (95% CI: 15.56- 28.17 months), versus standard of care therapy. The increased sample size is reflected in a more precise estimate of the mean life expectancy in this eviden ce set compared to the intermediate set, evidenced by the tighter confidence intervals reported. The median follow -up in the mature data set was 53.6 months. 6.7.2 Curative intent TPPs Data on the evidence sets assumed for the clinical efficacy of CAR T -cell the rapy as a curative treatment option is reported in Table 11 (overall survival), and Table 12 (dichotomous endpoints, adverse events). The associated KM plots are reported in Figure 3. Minimum da ta set CAR T -cell therapy was assumed to be associated with improved probabiliti es of survival at months 6 (78.5%) and 12 (72.5 %) compared to standard of care therapy (3 2.0% and 20.7% at 6 and 12-months). CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 120 Treatment with CAR T -cell therapy was associated wi th a statistically significant improvement in the time to death, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.20 (95% confidence interval: 0.11 - 0.37). In a restricted mean survival time analysis, treatment with CAR T -cell therapy was associated with a mean extension t o life expectancy of 10.47 months ( 95% CI : 7.59 - 13.34 months), versus standard of care therapy. The median follow -up in the minimum set was 11.3 months. Intermediate data set 5-year landmark survival probabilities of 72.5% and 20.7% for CAR T and standa rd of care therapy were assumed respectively. Treatment with CAR T -cell therapy was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the time to death, with a HR of 0.18 (95% CI: 0.10 - 0.33). In contrast to the 'bridge to HSCT' there was no app arent trend towards non -proportional hazards over time. In the restricted mean survival time analysis, CAR T -cell therapy was associated with a mean improvement in life expectancy of 32.94 months (95% CI : 24.38 - 41.43 months), versus standard of care ther apy. The median follow -up in the intermediate data set was 53.6 months. Mature data set Treatment with CAR T -cell therapy was associated with a statistically significant improvement and more precise estimate hazard ratio compared to the minimum and interme diate evidence sets; HR= 0.307 (95% CI: 0.12 - 0.27). In the restricted mean survival time analysis, treatment CAR T -cell therapy was associated with a similar mean to the intermediate set but with increased precision. The estimate of the improvement in life expectancy was 32.94 months (95% CI: 26.87 - 38.93 months), versus standard of care therapy. The median follow -up in the mature data set was 53.6 months.

To inform the conceptualisation and development of the economic model, a separate review of published studies evaluating the cost -effectiveness of other treatments for ALL was conducted. The primary aim of the review was to inform key structural assumptions and potential parameter sources required for the model. Hence, the review focussed on the main methodolog ical approaches taken in the studies identified, rather than the specific results reported. A two -part approach was taken , consisting of a systematic review and a more pragmatic search. Details of the search strategy employed to inform the systematic r eview are available in Appendix 5, Table 48. The pragmatic search searched for any public ly available reports considering the cost -effectiveness of any intervention in ALL using Google and Google Scholar, in addition , the relevant websites for NICE and the All Wales Medicine Strategy Group's (AWMSG) were searched to identify previ ous appraisals for ALL . 7.1.2 Results The systematic search identified 489 records , 11 of which were deemed potentially relevant after a review of their titles and abstracts. However, after obtaining the full articles, none of these studies were found to be full economic evaluations and hence were not subsequently considered within the model concep tualisation stage. The pragmatic search using Google and Google Scholar found two papers deemed relevant to the primary aim of the review.134, 135 Costa conducted a cost -effectiveness evaluation of unrelated stem cell transplantation for adul ts with acute leukemia (ALL and AML) structured around a 20 -year Markov model.134 The study concluded that the two forms of transplantation considered (cord blood and bone marro w/peripheral blood stem cells) were cost -effective when compared to no -transplantation. The study found that despite the high initial cost and short -term mortality associated with the transplantation procedures, the resulting life -year gains achieved by su rviving patients were significant. Lis135 considered the cost -effectiveness of clofarabine combined with chemotherapy in children and adolescents with ALL who have failed at least two previous therapies, compared to nelarabine and FLAG -IDA, though the use of a lifetime Markov model. After the initial treatments, a proportion of CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 131 patients were assumed to subsequently receive HSCT, this proportion var ied given response to initial treatment (complete, partial, complete without platelet recovery, or no response) and the treatment arm. A patient who survived for two years post -HSCT was assumed to be cured of ALL, no cure was possible without HSCT. The a uthors found clofarabine to be cost -effective when compared to both comparators. The result was driven by the success of a therapy in achieving a bridge to HSCT, and thus a potential cure. As clofarabine was associated with a greater proportion of patien ts experiencing an initial complete response, it had the greatest proportion of HSCTs and thus cured patients. The search of NICE and AWMSG appraisals found that the only appraisal by NICE in ALL (dasatinib, ID386)136 was discontinued in 2008 due to a low number of patients anticip ated to be treated. By contrast, t he AWMSG provides details of 5 separate appraisals in ALL, although 1 of these (imatinib, no.2014) did not receive a forma l submission by the manufacturer. Of the remaining AWMSG appraisals , only the final appraisal recommendations ( FARs) are made public ly available, limiting the detail available on the evaluative approaches. Only two of the appraisals (clofarabine and nela rabine) provided sufficient detail to review. Clofarabine124 was recommended by the AWMSG for children and adolescents with ALL who are relapsed or refractory after at least two prior regimens and where no other treatment is anticipated. Within the FAR , an important restriction was placed on the recommendation such that clofarabine shou ld only be given to patients in whom there is an intention to proceed to HSCT. This recommendation was based on the findings that clofarabine did not appear cost-effective for patients who did not subsequently receive HSCT . In the submission , clofar abine was compared to palliative care alone. Palliative care was assumed to be associated with very short median survival (9 to 10 weeks) based on historic control data . Although limited details of the modelling approach are reported, it is evident that the primary structural driver within the model is the bridging role of clofarabine to HSCT, with potentially significant gains life year assumed for patients who subsequently receive HSCT. The manufacturer assumed that the success of HSCT in achievi ng long term remission (and cure) was driven by the achievement of remission (complete, with platelet involvement or partial) at the ti me of transplantation. Hence, improved rates of remission achieved with clofarabine compared to palliative care directly equate to long term survival. The model submitted assumed that patients who received HSCT and survived for one year were cured, returning to the mortality risks and utilities of the general population. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 132 Nelarabine137 was recommended by the AWMSG for the treatment of T -ALL and T -LBL whose disease has not responded to, or has relapsed, foll owing treatment with at least two chemotherapy regimens. Best supportive care was used as the main comparato r and clofarabine was consi dered in a separate scenario based on indirect comparisons. In common with the restriction previously applied within th eir recommendations for clofarabine in ALL, the AWMSG also restricted treatment to patients where there is an intentio n to proceed to HSCT. This restriction was based on a similar finding that cost-effectiveness of nelarabine was closely related to the ass umed increase in the proportion of patients subsequently receiving HSCT (and their related long -term health gains) . The base -case analysis presented survival based on within -trial estimates with no extrapolation conducted. T his was considered to be an ext remely conservative estimate. Separate scenarios were presented considering the long -term survival of post - HSCT patients, and found to have a major impact on the result. The base -case ICER of \u00a3102,281 per QALY gained was subsequently reduced to \u00a351,169 i f post -HSCT survival was assumed to be 2 years and to \u00a325,523 if normal life expectancy was assumed in patients who survived more than one year (i.e. cure at one year). 7.1.2.1 Implications for model conceptualisation The systematic and pragmatic searches highlighted a number of potential im plications for our evaluation. Within existing studies , it is clear that the main benefit of existing treatments has been related to their ability to provide a 'bridge' to HSCT. The primary factor determining cost-effectiveness in the reviewed literature was the increased likelihood of receiving HSCT with a new treatment and the associated assumptions made regarding subsequent health gains associated with transplantation . Only limited survival gain was attributed to patients who did not subsequently receive HSCT , such that no treatment reviewed appeared cost -effective as a palliative option. The key structural assumptions employed within these studies are the potentially curati ve effect of HSCT and the short life expectan cy assumed for the comparator treatments (best supportive care/palliative treatment alone) derived from historic controls. The majority of studies assume d a 'cure point ' associat ed with HSCT, although the timing differenced across studies. The 'cure point ' was assumed to represent the time at which patients are assumed to no longer be at risk of disease relapse. The study by Costa134 assumed that 5 years post transplantation the patient will be free of any procedural mortality risk or any risk of disease recurrence. In Lis135 and nelarabine137 this cure point is assumed to be 2 years after HSCT, while the clofarabine submission124 assumes this at 1 year after HSCT . CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 133 The studies also differed in the assumptions made concerning subsequent survival after the 'cure point'. Costa acknowledged that long -term ALL survivors are likely to be subject to significant comorbidi ties over their remaining lifetime despite being leukaemia free.134 To account for the impact of comorbidities, an assumption was made that the long term survival of ALL patients would be 50% less than the general population. The autho rs acknowledge this was an arbitrary adjustment due to the lack of data on the long term morta lity rate in long -term survivors of ALL reported at the time. In contrast , both of the studies reported by Lis135 and the clof arabine submission124 effectively assume d no additional comorbidities (i.e. beyond those experienced by the general population) beyond the 'cure point'. Hence, patients were subsequently assumed to return to the age -adjusted mortality risk and utility of the general population. The AWMSG raised concerns that, not on ly was this as sumption insufficiently justified but that the model was very sensitive to changes in the long -term survival probability. In the absence of RCT data, each model incorporated historical control data as the basis to inform outcomes associated with the comp arator (best supportive care/palliative care and clofarabine within a scenario for the submission for nelarabine). However, insufficient limited details were reported regarding the source of the historic control data used , whether attempts were made to identify possible biases or to forma lly account for potential confounding. The existing cost -effectiveness literature is limited in ALL. No completed NICE appraisals of licensed treatments for ALL were identified . Furthermore, of the studies publ ished, none were reported in sufficient detail to provide a suitable basis for informing the exemplar application. In the absence of previous NICE appraisals or sufficient reporting within existing publications , the development of a de - novo model to inform the exemplar application was considered necessary . Full details of this are reported in the next section.CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 134 The exemplar economic model 8 8.1 Overview There are several distinct issues and challenges for the modelling of costs and outc omes that arise from the sep arate TPPs: In the \"bridge to HSCT\" TPP, the primary health benefits of treatment are gained by enabling more patients to successfully undergo HSCT; an established intervention that has known curative potential. For economic modelling purposes, it may therefore be desirable to introduce a structural link between HSCT and overall treatment benefit (i.e . survival) in the model. The introduction of a link between a potential established surrogate outcome or process and final health benefits also enable s the u se of evidence external to the CAR T -cell evidence sets (i.e. survival post -HSCT). This structural link may also provide decision makers with greater confidence surrounding the modelled health benefits of treatment on survival, given that model projections would depend largely on the established benefits of HSCT. In terms of decision uncertainty, this approach would also mean that the uncertainty surrounding the cost -effectiveness of CAR T -cell is partly determined by the maturity and sample size from the e vidence sets, and partly by the maturity, sample size, and acceptability of external evidence obtained from other sources. In the \"curative intent\" TPP, the case for introducing a structural link between final health benefits and a surrogate outcome or pr ocess such as HSCT is more limited than in the \"bridge to HSCT\" case, given that it is primarily CAR T -cell therapy itself that is expected to provide the curative benefits. In this context , it may be more appropriate to model long -term outcomes via the d irect extrapolation of event -free and overall survival data from the CAR T -cell trial evidence sets, as opposed to modelling long-term outcomes through a separate surrogate process . In this case, the decision uncertainty surrounding the cost -effectiveness of treatment would be solely determined by the maturity and sample size of data from the evidence sets. 8.1.1 Patient population In this evaluation, we evaluate the cost -effectiveness of CAR T -cell therapy in the treatment of children and young adults with two or more relapses or refractory ALL. The baseline demographic characteristics of this patient group is summarised in Table 14. Table 14: Baseline characteristics of patients Scenario Characteristic Parameter Source / application CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 135 Bridge to HSCT Mean baseline age 14.0 years Lee et al117 % Female 33% Curative intent Mean baseline age 14.0 years Maude et al118 % Female 40% 8.1.2 Comparator The comparator treatment to CAR T -cell therapy was defined as standard of care. In the base case, the standard of care treatment was assumed to be clofarabine (Evoltra\u00ae). The mean cost for a course of clofarabine treatment is approximately \u00a343,200 per patient. As part of a separate sensitivity analysis, the standard of care treatment was assumed to be FLAG -IDA. The mean cost for a course of FLAG -IDA treatment is approximately \u00a33,803 per patient. 8.2 Model development The approaches to modelling the cost -effectiveness of CAR T -cell therapy varied between the separate scenarios. Therefore, two de novo decision models were developed and used to assess the cost - effecti veness of CAR T -cell therapy across the two scenarios: 1) Bridge to HSCT model - based on a landmark responder mo del that comprises two related decision models; 1. a short -term decision -tree to predict the remission and transplant status of the population in the immediate period following CAR T -cell or comparator therapy, and 2. a series of partitioned survival (or area under the curve) models to predict the longer -term survival of patients conditional on remission and transplant status . 2) Curative intent model - based on a simple three state (alive and event -free, alive post -event, dead) partitioned survival model The two models share a number of common features, which are outlined in Table 15. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 136 Table 15: Key common features of de novo economic models Factor Chosen values Justification Time horizon Lifetime horizon ( up to a maximum age of 100 years ) Necessary to capture the potential life time impacts of short -term and potentially ongoing mortality benefit.

Perspective NHS/PSS In accordance with t he current NICE reference case Further detail s specific to each of the two model structures are reported in the following sections. 8.2.1 Bridge to HSCT scenario 8.2.1.1 Key structural assumptions The bridge to HSCT model consists of a decision tree model (day 0 to 56) and a series of partitioned survival model s (day 56 to lifetime) that when combined , provide an estimate of the lifetime costs and effectiveness of treatment in ALL . An illustration of the structure of the model is provided in Figure 4. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 137 Figure 4: Illustration of bridge to HSCT model No remission No HSCT -no remissionHSCT -no remission Death % alive A B C DA B CD D DHSCT -MRD (negative) HSCT -MRD (positive) HSCT -no remission No HSCT (Remission or no remission)Decision -tree (day 0 to day 56) Partitioned survival model (day 56 to lifetime) % alive % alive % alive CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 138 The short -term decision tree component of the model comprises three chance nodes that represent a series of clinically relevant event s that may occur during the first 56 days (two months) of treatment: Remission status at day 28 (remiss ion, no -remission or death) MRD status at day 28 (negative or positive) Transplantation status at day 56 (HSCT or no -HSCT) These events are considered to be prognostic of the duration and quality of life of patients with ALL, and were therefore included in the model to link short -term measures of trial efficacy to longer term health outcomes. The three nodes of the decision tree are sequenced in the order of remission, MRD status and transp lantation status . At the first chance node, the hypothetical cohort are distributed across three states; remission, no remission, or death. In the model, remission is defined using the criteria applied in the CAR T -cell a nd clofarabine clinical trials .117, 131 Complete remission is defined as less than 5% marrow blasts by flow cytometry , an absence of circulating blasts, and no extramedullary sites of disea se with absolute neutrophil count of 1000 per L or more and platelets counts of 100 000 per L or more. In accordance with both Lee et al and Jeha et al studies, remission status is determined at day 28 (month one) of the simulation. At the second chance node, patients with remission are re -assigned to one of two states; remission and MRD negative , or remission and MRD positive. MRD negative status is defined as less than 0 .01% marrow blasts . MRD positive status is determined by marrow blasts of between 0 .01% and 5% (at >5% patients are no longer in remission). At the third and final node (day 56) , all patients are assigned to states correspond ing to the use of HSCT (HSCT versus no HSCT) . The final determination of health status (remission - MRD - HSCT) was assumed to occur at day 56 (month two) of the simulation. This time period was chosen based on the mean time from CAR T therapy to HSCT, estimated from data reported in Lee et al (mean 5 4 days, 95% confidence interval: 45 -77 days). At the end of the decision tree phase, the cohort is assigned to six mutually exclusive states (presented in order of best prognosis): HSCT - Remission and MRD negative HSCT - Remission and MRD positive CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 139 HSCT - No remission No HSCT - Remission No HSCT - No remission Death After day 56, t he long -term survival of the cohort is modelled through a series of related partitioned survival model s (Figure 4) that are used to model the long -term outcomes of treatment (day 56 to lifetime). The model includes four distinct partitioned survival models that are used to evaluate survival in the following groups: HSCT - Remission and MRD neg ative HSCT - MRD positive no remission No HSCT HSCT recipients with MRD negative status prior to transplantation are assumed to have the best prognosis in terms of long -term survival. Increasing levels of marrow blasts is assumed to be associated with a lower probability of long -term survival, such that HSCT recipients with MRD positive status have (on average) a worse survival prognosis than MRD negative patients. HSCT recipients who failed to achieve remission prior to transplantation were assumed to have the poorest prognosis of all HSCT patients. For patients who did not receive HSCT, the probabilities of overall survival were significantly lower than for HSCT patients. I t was assumed that complete remission was not associated with improved probabilities of survival in non -HSCT patients. This assumption was made on the basis that in the bridging scenario it is through HSCT (and not remission in the absence of HSCT) that meaningful gains in survival can be achieved. The impact of this assumption on the results of the evaluation was tested in the one -way sensitivity analyses, where it was assumed that non-remission non-HSCT patients had an inferior survival prognosis to remission non-HSCT patients. At year 5 of the simulation, those w ho were alive were subsequently assumed to be long -term survivors of ALL. From this point forward, the cohort was considered to be effectively 'cured' of ALL, and experienced the mortality risk profile consistent with a long -term survivor of ALL. The morta lity risks after year 5 were therefore modelled based on general populati on age - and gender -adjusted all -cause risk of mortality adjusted for excess morbidity and mortality reported in cohorts of long -term survivors of ALL. The approach is more formally de scribed in Section 8.2. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 140 The model also included treatment -related adverse events. These include events such as The costs and consequences of these events were assumed to occur at the start of the evaluation. Since prolonged B -cell aplasia did not occur in the Lee study, the costs and consequences of this we re not included within the bridge to HSCT scenario. The key structural assumptions applied in the model are outlined in Table 16. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 141 Table 16: Summary of key modelling assumptions for Bridge to HSCT responder model Input Assumption Surrogate relationship between MRD status and HSCT A lower marrow blast status prior to transplantation (as captured through MRD status) is associated with a higher probability of experiencing a sustained remission and long - term survival benefits in ALL HSCT All HSCT events were assumed to occur at day 56 of the simulated time horizon. No further HSCT events were permitted after this point Survival during the first 5-years of the evaluation time horizon Survival post -HSCT was modelled based on constant transition probability. There is no difference in survival between remission non - HSCT and non -remission non -HSCT patients. Survival after the first 5 -years of the ev aluation time horizon All patients alive at 5-years post -HSCT are considered to be long-term survivors of the disease. Long -term survivors of ALL experience excess morbidity and mortality compared to the general population. Treatment / re -treatment In the base case, it was assumed each patient would receive a single full course of therapy. Re-treatment with CAR T or standard of care therapy was not permitted in the base case, but was considered in the sensitivity analysis. Treatment effect CAR T-cell therapy improves the probability of remission, the probability of MRD negative status, and the probability of successful HSCT compared to standard of care therapy The clinical parameter estimates used to inform the models, and TPPs can be generalis ed to the UK NHS Patient follow -up After HSCT, patients receive ongoing care and rehabilitation up to 2 -years post -HSCT Patients who do not receive HSCT are assumed to require hospitalisation prior to death Adverse events Treatment -related adverse event s were considered in the evaluation, and included events such as cytokine release syndrome, whose incidence is expected to increase with the use of CAR T -cell therapy.

CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 142 Clinical justification for structure of model The conceptual structure of the \"bridge to HSCT\" model is based on an assumed relationship between HSCT use and final clinical benefits , and the assumption that the effectiveness of HSCT is dependent on MRD stat us prior to transplantation. Allogeneic HSCT is a potentially curative treatment option in patients with ALL. However, the long -term benefits of HSCT are uncertain, with some patients experiencing long -term benefits, including the effective cure/suppression of ALL, and other patients experiencing relapse and/or mortality shortly after transpl antation. In this evaluation, survival benefits are established through remission and MRD status prior to HSCT. Several studies have investigated the relationship between remission/MRD status prior to HSCT, and the long-term outcomes of HSCT therapy.70, 71, 138 These studies have shown, to varying degrees, that MRD status prior to HSCT appears an important prognostic determinant long-term negative (<0.01% blasts) pati ents experiencing superior survival compared to MRD positive (>0.01% to 5% marrow blast) patients , including within studies of children with relapsed ALL . This relationship is shown graphically i n Figure 5. Figure 5: Post -HSCT survival probability based on level of MRD for patients with ALL (obtained from Leung et al) CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 143 In Figure 5, the survival probability 5 years after HSCT is plotted against pre-HSCT MRD level, expressed as a continuous measure and plotted on a logarithmic scale (base 10). The red dashed lines show t he relationship observed in patients treated pre -2002, and the blue solid line shows the relationship post-2002. The shaded regions represent the confidence limits for the relationship . In both pre and post - 2002 periods, there is a consistent association b etween MRD level and 5-year survival probability , such that increasing MRD level (% bone marrow blasts) was associated with decreasing probabilities of 5 -year survival. These data support the assumption of a continuous relationship between MRD level prior to HSCT , and 5 -year survival probability. For patients who d o not receive HSCT , the long -term outcomes of treatment are generally poor. In the study by Von Stackelberg et al,114 the median survival in refractory patients who failed to respond to induction therapy and went on to rece ive palliative care was 89 days ( 3.17 months ). In the model, it was assumed that all patients who did not receive HCST (including remission and non - remission patients), went on to receive palliative care, having exhausted all treatment strategies that may be curative. Remission status was not considered to be prognostic of survival in the non -HSCT population, such that non -HSCT patients who achieved remission were assumed to be at the same risk of mortality as non -HSCT patients who failed to achieve remission. However, as discussed later in the report, all pat ients with remission were assigned an improved health utility compared to those who failed to achieve remission. These benefits were, however, assumed to not extend to improved life expectancy. In previous economic evaluations in ALL ( reviewed in Section 7), it had been assumed that survivors of ALL experience the same mortality risk profile as the general population. This assumption implies that there is no excess m ortality or morbidity risk associated with their previous illness. This assumption is not supported by the published literature, which generally report excess mortality and morbidity amongst the long-term ALL survivor population, when compared to match -adjusted individua ls without ALL (i.e. siblings).139, 140 In the model, the risk of mortality assigned to survivors of ALL was set equal to the general population background all -cause mortality risk profile, with an adjustment for an increased mortality risk amongst survivors of ALL. The point at which patients were assumed to be long -term surviv ors of ALL (5 -years) was based on the definition used in a number of published studies reporting long -term survival data in ALL. None of these studies provide explicit rationale for selecting 5 -years as the cure point, and to our knowledge, there appears t o have been no published attempts to empirically justify the widespread use of the 5 -year cure CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 144 point. However, across a number of studies, the KM curves for post -HSCT survival appear to stabilise within the 5 -year time frame, such that the curve becomes fl at and the incidence of death reduces to near zero. 8.2.1.2 Efficacy parameter estimates In the decision -tree component of the model, the data for the remission, MRD, and HSCT status of the modelled cohort were derived from the separate evidence sets reported i n 6.7.1 . The key assumptions required to generate the estimates for the evidence sets are outlined in Table 17.

The model predicts that 48% of patients receiving the CAR T -cell therapy and 15% of patients receiving standard of care treatment will receive HSCT. All patients who underwent HSCT following CAR T -cell therapy were assu med to have a MRD negative status. In contrast, most patients who underwent HSCT after receiving clofarabine had not achieved remission (11.5%) prior to transplantation, with only a small proportion of patients receiving HSCT after complete remission (1.6 % MRD negative, 1.6% MRD positive). Figure 6: Proportion of patients occupying each state at the end of the decision tree model (day 56), by CAR T and comparator group With the structural link included within the model, it was necessary to use external data rather than the evidence sets themselves for the purposes of extrapolation and estimating life -time mortality. This was necessary as the existing survival data for CA R T-cell therapy were not reported conditional on remission, MRD or HSCT status. Hence, the parameter estimates for the partitioned survival analyses were sourced from two external studies; Leung et al71 for the pos t-HSCT survival probabilities, and Von Stackelberg et al114 for the non -HSCT surviva l probabilities.

Employing this assumption, as opposed to using the data reported in Leung et al for this population, provided a more consistent prediction of survival data from Lee et al, where it was reported that all 10 HSCT recipients with MRD negative status were leukaemia -free and alive at the end of study follow -up. Transplant recipients with remission and MRD positive status were assumed to have an inferior long -term survival prognosis compared to those who were MRD neg ative. Similarly, recipients w ho failed to respond to therapy were assumed to have an inferior long -term prognosis compared to those who responded (including MRD positive and negative ). Parameter estimates were obtained from Leung et al, and modelled assu ming an exponential distribution for time to death. The Leung et al data was used in the base case analysis, as this was the only study identified in the literature review that reported post -HSCT survival in patients who failed to achieve remission (marro w blasts >5.0%). The parameter estimate for no-remission HSCT patients forms an important part of predicting the long -term survival benefits of standard of care therapy, as approximately 11% of the standard of care population had HSCT despite having failed to achieve complete remission (versus 0% of the CAR T -cell trial population). For patients who do not receive HSCT (including remission and non -remissions patients), long -term survival was modelled using dat a from Von Stackelberg et al.114 A series of parametric survival functions were fitted to estimates of patient -level data generated from the published Kaplan -Meier curve. According to goodness of fit statistics, the best fitting distribution according to visual fit and goodness of fit statistic was the lognormal. However, when the function is applied in the model, the predicted overa ll survival for the total CAR T -cell and standard of care populations became visibly disjointed, with the risk of mortality in the decision tree phase being significantly greater than the risk being applied at the start of the partition survival phase. Con sequently, there was an uncharacteristic \"plateau\" in the modelled survival curve between days 56 (month 2) and 84 (month 3). This plateau effect was caused by an initially low probability of death that was being predicted from the Von Stackelberg et al da ta. Because of the implausible nature of the survival curve, an alternative survival distribution for Von Stackelberg et al was selected in the base case. To be consistent with the approach used in modelling post-HSCT survival (Leung et al71), the exponential distribution was chosen for the base case analysis. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 150 The mean time to death with the exponential function was 0.35 years, which is consistent with the mean time to death estimated using the lognormal (0.34 years). The validation of the responder model in predicting the outcomes of the Lee et al and Jeha et al studies was assessed by comparing the predicted survival probabilities from the model, vers us the KM data extracted from these studies. As shown in Figure 7, the final model appears to provide an accurat e prediction of reported survival for both CAR T -cell therapy and the comparator . Figure 7: Model prediction (lines) versus reported KM curves of overall survival The background all -cause mortality risks were obtained from the interim lifetables published by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS data report annual all -cause mortality rates by gender and by age (yearly increments from age 0 to 100 years). A gender -averaged mor tality risk was derived based on a cohort that was 33.3% female (7 of 21, Lee et al)117. An adjustment factor for excess mortality in ALL survivors was als o incorporated and modelled using data from MacArthur et al ,140 (SMR=9.1, 95% confidence interval = 7.8 -10.5). These data were combined using the following equat ion: 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91 0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24Cumulative survival, % Time horizon (months) Comparator KM CAR T KM Survival - CAR T Survival - ComparatorCRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 151 ()=1(((,)\u00d7()+(,)\u00d7())\u00d71 12\u00d7) Where TP(x) is the monthly transition probability for the cohort with average age x, MR(y, x) is the ONS all-cause mortality rate for gender y and avera ge age x, P(y) is the proportion of cohort with gender y, and SMR is the standardised mortality ratio for long -term ALL survivors versus the general population. The factor of 1/12 was included so as to convert the annualised mortality rates from the ONS to monthly rates, and probabilities, for use in the model. The mortality risk was assumed to remain constant within each year of the cohort's age. 8.2.2 Curative intent model 8.2.2.1 Structural assumptions A simple three -state partitioned survival model was developed t o assess the cost -effectiveness of CAR T - cell therapy used with curative intent. The three health states included in the model are \"alive and event free\", \"alive with relapsed disease\", and \"death\". An illustration of the structure of the model is provided in Figure 8. Figure 8: Illustration of partitioned survival model structure (left, illustration of state structure; right, illustration of partitioned survival) The health state of alive and event -free comprised of all patients who had either stable disease or had responded to therapy. The health state of alive with relapsed disease comprised patients who had either failed induction therapy , had relapsed after previously responding to treatment, or developed second malignancies. This definition is based on the criteria used in the UK ALL study .75 % alive OS EFS Time ->Alive and event -free Alive with relapsed diseaseDeathCRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 152 State occupanc y in the model was derived using the partitioned survival technique. This involves the direct extrapolation of EFS and OS curves, which are then used to estimate the proportion of patients occupying each of the three states, via the following equations: Alive and event free (t) = P (EFS,t) Alive with relapsed disease (t) = P (OS,t) - P(EFS,t) Death (t) = 1 - P (OS,t) Where P(event,t) is the cumulative survival probability for event at time t. Data on EFS were not available from either the CAR T -cell or clofarabine studies. In the absence of data, the EFS curve was derived from the available OS data, through assuming a proportional relationship between EFS and OS. This relationship is justified on the basis that EFS is highly correlated to OS, as it includes death prior to recurrence. In the short -term, it was assumed that the cumulative hazard function for EFS would be proportional to the cumulative hazard function for OS. This was modelled ba sed on data from the UK ALL study.75 The proportional relationship betwee n EFS and OS is not expected to continue indefinitely, given the potential for cure of disease, and the expectation that after a finite period of time all patients alive in the simulation would also be free of relapsed disease (EFS=OS). This is equivalent to saying that at some point in time, all patients who are alive are long -term survivors of ALL. Th erefore, in the model, the proportional relationship between EFS and OS was assumed to continue up to year 5 of the simulation (the assumed point of \"effective\" cure in ALL). After year 5, the cumulative survival probabilities for EFS were assumed to be fl at up to the point where EFS equals to OS. In all cases, EFS was always assumed to be less than or equal to OS to avoid a negative number of patients being assigned to the relapsed disease state. In common with the 'Bridge to HSCT' scenario, a t year 5 of the simulation, those who were alive in the 'curative intent' model were also subsequently assumed to be long -term survivors of ALL. From this point forward, the cohort was considered to be effectively 'cured' of ALL, and experienced the mortality risk pro file consistent with a long -term survivor of ALL. The mortality r isks after year 5 were also modelled based on general population age - and gender -adjusted all cause risks of mortality adjusted for excess morbidity and mortality reported in cohorts of long -term survivors of ALL . The model evaluation also included the costs and consequences of treatment -related adverse events, which included cytokine release syndrome and B -cell aplasia, whose occurrence is specifically associated CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 153 with CAR T -cell therapy. Other events captured in the with the exception of B -cell aplasia, were assumed to o ccur at the time of treatment initiation and to resolve within the first year of therapy. The cost consequences of these events were therefore captured at the start of the evaluation. The occurrence of B -cell aplasia in patients treated with CAR T -cells is an expected consequence of CAR T-cell therapy, and is linked to the proliferation of CAR T -cells and the associated durability of the clinical effect . Consequently, for some patients, treatment of B -cell aplasia is expected to persist beyond the first y ear of post -CAR T therapy. To capture this in the model, a series of survival models were fitted to data on the time to CDLT -19 positivity or relapse reported in Maude et al, and used to predict the proportion of patients requiring treatment for B -cell apl asia.

Survival after the first 5 -years All patients alive at 5-years are considered to be long-term survivors of the disease. Long -term survivors of ALL experience excess morbidity and mortality compared to the general population. Treatment / re -treatment In the base case, it was assumed that all patients received a single full course of therapy. Re-treatment with CAR T -cell therapy or standard of care therapy was not permitted in the base case, but was considered in the sensitivity analysis Treatment e ffect Treatment with CAR T -cell therapy is assumed to lead to an increase the number of patients achieving a sustained cure for ALL, and therefore extend the life expectancy of patients with ALL The clinical parameter estimates used to inform the models, and TPPs can be generalised to the UK NHS Adverse events Treatment -related adverse events were considered in the evaluation, and included cytokine release syndrome and B -cell aplasia. The costs and health consequences of all adverse events except B-Cell aplasia were accrued at the start of the evaluation. The costs of B -cell aplasia was modelled by estimating the probability of patients with B -cell aplasia over time, using data from Maude et al. Health -related quality of life Patients who are event -free are assigned a higher utility weight than patients who have relapsed disease. Transplantation is associated with a one -off adjustment to utilities. 8.2.2.2 Efficacy parameter estimates - Partitioned survival model (\"curative intent\") The primary data sources for overall survival in the \" curative intent \" model were the same imputed patient data used to derive the evidence sets reported in Section 6.7.2 . Each separate evidence set was then analysed using parametric survival modelling to inform the 5-year survival estimates and projections applied within the cost-effectiveness analyses. The p arametric analyses were undertaken using the FlexSurv package in the statistical programming platform R . A series of survival distributions were considered in the analysis, including the Exponential, Lognormal, Weibull, and Gompertz. Because of the potential curative nature of CAR T -cell therapy (and therefore the CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 155 potential for an unconventional hazard function), a series of flexible cubic spline models were also considered in the analysis. The cubic spline models were based on those developed by Royston and Parmar.141 Cubic spline models expressed on the proportional odds scale were used as they appeared to converge to an optimised solution more frequently than the proportional hazards or probit variants of the cubic spline model. A series of one -, two -, three -, and four -knot spline models were considered. The knots were evenly distributed across the time scale of the study, as per the default settings for the FlexSurv package in R. Separate curves were fitted to the hypoth etical CAR -T cell data and the comparator data to allow both the shape and scale of the distribution to vary between these. Alternative options include fitting proportional hazard models to a dataset containing both treatments and including a covariate in the regression for treatment assignment. This alternative approach was not considered here given that an earlier assessment of the validity of the proportional hazards assumption illustrated that this assumption may not consistently hold across all evidenc e sets. Within cost -effectiveness studies, it is common practice to use a single survival distribution in the base - case analysis. This is chosen based on goodness of fit statistics, the fit of each distribution to the Kaplan Meier curves, and the clinical plausibility of subsequent model projections over the full time horizon. However, it is unlikely that a single survival distribution can adequately characterise uncertainties over the longer -term extrapolation period. The robustness of the ICER estimates to alternative distributions can be considered within separate sensitivity analyses or scenarios. However, transparency concerns may exist regarding this approach if their weighting is not explicitly specified in subsequent policy decisions. To more forma lly account for the uncertainty surrounding choice of survival distribution, a model averaging approach was adopted using the methods outlined in Jackson et al.142 This technique involves the parameterisation of uncertainty surrounding the choice of distribution, through including all plausible survival functions as part of a weighted distribution, and sampling both the parametric uncertainty associated within each d istribution and the uncertainty (or weights) surrounding the choice of preferred method. Through the probabilistic analysis, it is therefore possible to estimate the joint distribution of uncertainty around the parameter estimates and the choice of surviva l function. Each model is assigned a weight that represents the adequacy of that distribution in predicting the lifetime survival of the modelled cohort, in comparison to all other distributions considered in the model. There are a number of measures of m odel adequacy that can be considered. Examples include statistical CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 156 adequacy measures such as the Akaike Information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) , and expert judgement. The weights considered in this evaluation were based on AIC scores. As outlined in Jackson et al, the AIC values reported from each survival distribution was converted to a probability weight ( ) using the following equations: =(0.5\u00d7) = The weighted distribution was then applied in the b ase case analysis. Different model weights and parameter estimates were considered across the three different data sets, as outlined in the following sections. Minimum data set A summary of the goodness of fit statistics for each distribution fitted to th e imputed survival data across each of the evidence sets is provided in Table 20. Table 20: Summary of goodness of fit statistics and weights for survival distributions (minimum set) Distribution CAR T - cell Standard of care AIC AIC based weight AIC AIC based weight 11.2% According to the AIC statistic, the distribution with the best goodness of fit to the CAR -T cell data was the spline model with a single knot (AIC=121.02), followed by the spline with two knots (AIC=122.97). The spline model with a single knot was assigned the highest single weight of 60.1%, and was followed by the two - (22.7%), three - (8.5%) and four (4.0%) -knot spline configurations respectively. A visual CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 157 comparison of the survival data based on the weighted distribution and several single distributions are reported in Figure 9. Figure 9: Plot comparing fit of weighted distribution and key single distributions to CAR -T data Because of the limited maturity in the minimum set, there was considerable variation in the predicted long-term survival of the modelled cohort , as shown by the spread of survival trajectories in Figure 9. Whilst the \"best -fitting\" spline models appeared to generate a robust fit to the data over the first 3 months of the study, the functions were not able to accurately predict the tail of distribution . In this case, the \"best fitting\" model underestimated the KM probabilities from month 18 of the simulated time horizon . The weak fit of the model to the tail of the KM is partly driven by the limited data available to support the continued flattening of the curve. As shown later in this section, with additional data maturity, the parametric models tend to provide a better prediction of the tail of the KM as there is more data to support the long -term flattening of the survival curve. In the standard of care group, the distribution with t he optimal predictive validity as judged via AIC, was also the spline model with a single knot (AIC=288.65). A weight of 44.6% was assigned to the spline model with a single knot, followed by weights of 18.5% for the spline model with two knots and 13.8% for the lognormal. A visual comparison of the survival data based on the weighted distribution and several single distributions are reported in Figure 10. 0.0%10.0%20.0%30.0%40.0%50.0%60.0%70.0%80.0%90.0%100.0% 0 12 24 36 48 60Cumulative survival probability Time (months) KM-data Exponential Log-normal Weighted Distribution Spline model with one-knotCRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 158 Figure 10: Plot show predictive fit of weighted distribution, spline model with one knot, lognormal, and exponential functions to Kaplan -Meier curves Intermediate and mature data sett A summary of the goodness of fit statistics and weig hts is reported for the intermediate and mature evidence sets in Table 21 and Table 22. 0.0%10.0%20.0%30.0%40.0%50.0%60.0%70.0%80.0%90.0%100.0% 0 12 24 36 48 60Cumulative survival probability Time (months) KM-data Exponential Log-normal Weighted Distribution Spline model with one-knotCRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 159 Table 21: Summary of goodness of fit statistics and AIC -based weights for survival distributions (intermediate set) Distribution CAR T - cell Standard of care AIC AIC based weight AIC AIC based weight Table 22: Summary of goodness of fit statistics and AIC -based weights for survival distributions ( mature set) Distribution CAR T- cell Standard of care AIC AIC based weight AIC AIC based weight four knots NA NA 585.32 47.6% The additional maturity of the data in these evidence sets and the superior AIC statistics associated with the flexible spline models, resulted in none of the standard distributions being assigned a weighted greater than 0.1 %. The different levels of precision resulted in small difference in the weights assigned to the spline mod els across the intermediate and mature evidence sets. Visual comparison s of the survival data based on the weighted distribution and several single distributions are reported in Figure 11. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 160 Figure 11: Plot show predictive fit of weighted distribution, spline model with one knot, lognormal, and exponential functions to Kaplan -Meier curves In comparing across evidence sets, the survival models fitted to the intermediate and mature evidence sets appear to have a shallower slope than those fitted to the minimum evidence set , resulting in a longer tail to the predicted survival curves . This is driven by the assumption that in the more mature evidence set s there is greater certainty over the \"curative\" benefit of treatment because of additional evidence on patient survival up to month 60 of the hypothetical evidence set (versus maximum survival of approximately 24 months in the minimum set) . This is broadly equivalent to saying that , in the intermediate and mature evidence sets, there is greater certainty over the flattening of the KM curve. When comparing across competing survival models , the inter mediate and mature evidence sets are also associated with a more consistent set of survival projections than in the minimum set . This leads to a narrower range of potential survival probabilities being predicted at later time points in both intermediate and mature sets . Therefore, unlike the bridge to HSCT model, additional evidence maturity in the curative model leads to a different projection of survival benefit , as well as impacting on the parametric uncertainty surrounding model extrapolations. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 161 There a re slight differences in the survival curves predicted from the intermediate and mature evidence sets because of differences in the weights applied to different functions. These differences cannot be clearly seen on the plots, as the difference in weights is marginal. The key difference between these evidence sets is the additional sample size assigned to the mature set, which primarily impacts the uncertainty/precisions surrounding survival estimates, which is not shown on these plots. Adverse events - B-cell aplasia A series of survival models were fitted to data on the time to CDLT -19 positivity or relapse reported in Maude et al, and used to predict the proportion of patients requiring treat ment for B -cell aplasia. The best fitting distribution was the Weibull distribution. The accuracy of the partitioned survival model in predicting the outcomes of the Maude et al118 and Jeha et al131 studies was assessed by comparing th e predicted survival probabilities from the model, versus the Kaplan -Meier data. As shown in Figure 12, the final model s appear to provide an accurate prediction of the extracted KM curve for overall survival in both studies.

Treatment acquisitions costs 2. Administration and monitoring costs 3. Adverse events 4. HSCT 5. Long term costs CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 163 8.3.1 Acquisition costs 8.3.1.1 CAR T -cell therapy The complex nature of regenerative medicines and the treatment pathway makes it necessary to disentangle the separate procedural elements of the CAR T -cell treatment process and to make assumptions concerning which elements would be included within the acquisition cost of the therapy itself and which might represent additional procedural costs which would need to be separately provided and funded by the NHS itself. Levine et al99 provides an overview of the CAR T -cell process , reproduced below in Figure 13. Figure 13: CAR T -cell therapy process The overview separates the processes of leukapheresis, conditioning chemotherapy and infusion (steps 1, 4 and 5 in the figure), from the transduction and expansion (steps 2 and 3). We assume the same split to represent those components of care which would be provided (and funded separately) by the NHS and those which would be undertaken by the manufacturer and included within the acquisition cost of CAR T - cell therapy. Hence, we assume the ac quisition cost of CAR T -cell therapy would not include the cost to the NHS of providing leukapheresis , conditioning chemotherapy or cell infusion, and that these are assumed to represent additional costs to the NHS. In the absence of licensed products bein g available, there are currently no commercially available estimates of the acquisition cost of CAR T-cell therapy . Informal sources have indicated future CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 164 acquisition costs may be in the region (US $) of $150,000 - $500,000.143 Within the exemplar , we have assumed that the manufacturer would employ a value -based approach to pricing, such that the acquisition cost would be set at a level such that the resulting cost -effectiveness (ICER) estimates would be close to NICE's current threshold range. In the context of the specific population considered, we have assumed that this would be in line with the \u00a350,000 per QALY estimate based on NICE's current approach to treatments at the end of life. We subsequently explore the impact of alternative prices and payment schemes using separate scenarios. Full details of the hypothetical prices assumed across the separate scenario are reported in Section 9. The acquisition cost of con ditioning therapy (\u00a33,803) is estimated from th e regimen used in the Lee study ,117 which represents fludarabine 25 mg/m\u00b2 per day on days -4, -3, and -2 and cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m\u00b2 per day on day -2. The acquisition cost associated with clofarabine is derived from the AWMSG r eport for clofarabine , which reported a cost of \u00a343,200 per patient treated, based on the average costs of the drug volumes use d in study CLO -212 (based on 1.8 cycles of treatment, a patient body surface area of 1.2m2 and the licensed dose of 52mg/m2/five-day treatment cycle). The acquisition costs of FLAG -IDA are considered as part of a separate sensitivity analysis and are estim ated by applying unit costs from the BNF to a dosing guide publishe d by the Royal Surrey NHS Trust .144 Assuming an average body surface area of 1.2m2 and an average of 1.76 cycle s of treatment145 gives the estimate of \u00a33,808 per patient. 8.3.1.2 Administration and monitoring costs In addition to the ac quisition costs, it is important to consider t he resource use and costs associated with administra tion and subsequent monitoring . All patients regardless of subsequent treatment are assumed to require an initial non -elective hospitalisation. For clofarabine and FLAG -IDA it is assumed that the costs o f this hospitalisation also include all costs associated with monitoring and administration of treatment. For CAR T -cell therapy , the same initial hospitalisa tion is assumed to occur for the administration of the conditioning therapy. However, due to the additional production period required to manufacture the CAR T -cells (in the region of 11 days currently) an additional, elective hospitalisation is also assumed during which CAR T -cells are subsequently admin istered and the patient monitored. The cost o f a single leukapheresis procedure is also applied to CAR T -cell patients. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 165 Table 23 reports these per patient costs, the sources and associated assumptions. 8.3.1.3 Adverse events The individual costing of each adverse event for the alternative treatments could entail double countin g, since some aspects of these may already be included in the hospitalisation costs used for the administration and monitor ing costs of each treatment. Therefore , an assumption is made that all grade 3 and 4 adverse events (except CRS and B -cell aplasia as discus sed below) require an extension of hospitalis ation by one day with a cost based on the excess bed day HRG cost as shown in Table 23. For CRS , a combination of the acquisition cost of cytokine inhibitor drugs and an admission to a paediatric intensive care unit are assumed for all cases of grade 4 or severe CRS. B-cell aplasia is assumed to be treated with a regimen of IVIG, given at a dose of 0.5g/kg every 4 weeks until the patient is no longer in need of treatment (i.e. CD19 positivity, relapse or death). We assumed the population treated to have an average weig ht of 49.5kg . Rounding down of each dose to the nearest vial (i.e. 20g vial per dose), the cost per vial is estimated as \u00a3850. In addition, a n administration cost of \u00a3225 per dose is assumed. 8.3.1.4 HSCT Three potential sources of cost estimates of HS CT were i dentified and considered : 1. NHS Reference Cost . This provides estimates of completed HRG activity and unit costs across six different paediatric allogeneic transplantation categories. While intuitively appealing due to the relevance to our population and U K context, concerns have been raised146 that these do not capture the full cost of HSCT , due to their focus on a single admission period. 2. The London Specialised Commissioning Group Report .147 This report estimated a national tariff for adult blood and bone marrow transplants based on the phases of transplantation from decision to transplant to 100 day post -transplantation follow -up care. However, no details are given as to how the estimate was derived. In addition, the estimate only considers an adult population. 3. UK Stem Cell Strategy Oversight Committee Report .146 This report used results from a Dutch study published in 2002, reporting the cost of allogeneic adult unrelated bone marrow transplantation. This estimate includes all initial costs of the transplantation as well as follow -up CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 166 costs for up to two years a fter the transplantation. The inclusion of the longer -term follow up costs addresses the primar y concern around existing Reference Costs. H owever, the re exists uncert ainty about the generalisability of the cost to the specific population considered here. To take account of the limitations around each of the three data sources , the model combines estimates from both the Reference Costs and the UK Stem Cell Strategy Over sight Committee Report. The London Specialist Commissioning Group Report was discounted due to a lack of details as to how the estimate was derived. The cost of HSCT is considered in two parts: the cost of the procedure and associated hospitalisation, a nd the cost of long term care. While all three sources provide an estimate of the cost of the procedure , both the London Specialist Commissioning and UK Stem Cell Committee focus on adult populations. Existing HRG costs report that a higher cost of the p rocedure for paediatric patients , with paediatric HRG costs between \u00a321,622 and \u00a374,434 more than the equivalent adult HRG costs across the four different forms of allogeneic transplantation reported.148 Therefore, the cost of the procedure has been estimated as the weighted average (by frequency of HRG) of all paediatric allogeneic tra nsplantations from the HRG costs to estimate the cost of initial transplantation. As previously noted , the HRG costs only include the costs accrued in the admission in whi ch the transplantation occurred. Hence, any longer-term costs will not be included. To estimate the long er-term costs , an estimate of post -transplantation costs from the UK Stem Cell Strategy Oversight Committee Report is used. No further adjustment is made to the estimate. The use of this estimate makes the same assumptions about the appropriateness of t he original source of the costs .149 The use of this estimate in our population additionally assumed that, unlike the cost of the procedure, long -term costs are independent of type of transplantation and age of patient at time of transplantation.

Google and Google Scholar were used to search for public ly available utility estimates, alongside a search of known economic evaluations and HTA appraisals in ALL. The search focussed on utility estimates of children with ALL, rega rdless of treatment provided. Two systematic reviews of utility studies in paediatric ALL were identified .150, 151 Van Listenburg et al.151 reviewed the measurement of health related quality of life (used syn onymously with utilities) in paediatric patients with ALL using the Health Utilities Index (HUI). The study identified 15 studies reporting utilities in this pop ulation using both HUI2 and HUI3 . The Van Listenburg review has several issues that limit its relevance to our model. Firstly, no attempt was made to meta -analyse the results , with the review only summarising the individual utility estimates from each study. In addition , the results were reported by phase of care, often focussing on specific tim e points in the treatment pathway rather than to specific health states re levant to our modelling. Given the time constraints in our work, a more detailed consideration of each study was not considered feasible . CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 169 Kelly et al.150 undertook a decision analysis of cranial radiation therapy for paediatric T -cell ALL patients , including a systematic revie w of utility studies to inform this. While the study focussed on T -cell ALL , the review of utilities did not stipulate type of ALL and h ence included all forms of ALL. The study used existing mapping functions to convert generic HRQoL measures (SF36 and CHRIs) to preference based utility estimates (HUI2 and EQ -5D). Of particular relevance to our model are the states of in the state of relapse and cured after relapse , with mean utility estimates reported of 0.75 (range 0.44 to 1) and 0.91 (0.87 to 0.95) respectively. Since the exemplar considers patients who have previously failed prior lines of therapy, the state for cured after relapse was considered to be more consistent with expected utility than the state for cured after initial tr eatment (mean utility 0.92 ; range 0.90 to 0.94). In addition, the pragmatic search also identified a number of published economic evaluations which had used utility estimates.124, 134, 135, 137 Of the three AWMSG Final Appraisal Recommendations ( FAR) related to ALL , one did not r eport any utility results from the manufacturer's submission (Dasatinib). The clofarabine FAR reported that all patients who survived post 1 yea r after HSCT were assumed to have the utility of the general population . All other states modelled were varied between 0.2 and 1 as scenario analyses to demonstrate the resul ts were not sensitive to the utility values of those who do not survive long -term. The nelarabine FAR137 reported that non -responders and untreated patients were assu med to have utility of 0.64. This value was referenced from Health Outcomes Data Repository (HODaR) data of patients with lymphoid leukaemia, and as such represents patients in secondary care. In addition , all patients who undergo successful transplantat ion were assumed to have a utility of 0.92 based on a study by Sung et al.152 The Sung study considers physician elicited estimates of utility for AML patients who have survived without recurrent disease post transplantation. Sung additionally presents an estimate of disutility (i.e. decrement associated with an event) associated with treatment with chemotherapy and transplantation, estimated as 0.42 (plausible range 0.16 to 0.83) and 0.57 (0.31 to 0.87), respectively. No estimate of the duration of these disutili ties are presented. Similar to Sung, the economic evaluation of clofarabine for paediatric ALL conducted by Lis et al135 conducted an elicitatio n exercise of physicians due to a lack of relevant utility estimates available at the time. Lis reported utility estimates for during treatment with palliative care (0.26) clofarabine without HSCT (0.34), clofarabine with HSCT but surviving less than 1 ye ar (0.48), as well as survival post HSCT for 1 year (0.80), 2 years (0.85) and beyond (0.88). CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 170 While these values appear generally consistent with the results reported within the systematic reviews, the magnitude of the treatment disutilities appear highe r. It is plausible that this discrepancy may be the result of the use of physician rather than patient utility elicitation. 8.3.2.2 Informing the model states All model utility inputs applied in the model are summarised in Table 24. Table 24: Model inputs - utilities Utility (95% CI) 'disutility of undergoing BMT' expert VAS elicitation Adverse events CRS 0 for one week Assume severity of ICU hospitalisation associated with utility of 0 Short -term utility Relapse 0.75 (0.44 -1) Kelly 2015 'in the state of relapse' mapped value from CHRIs to EQ5D Remission 0.91 (0.87 -0.95) Kelly 2015 'cured after relapse -all relapsed patients treated with CRT' mapped value from SF -36 to HUI2, need to assume no long terms disutility AEs from CRT Long -term utility Long term disutility Remission utility (0.91) with age adjusted decrement 8.3.2.3 Treatment disutilities Due to a lack of literature consider ing the short -term impact on health utility associated with both chemotherapy and HSCT , we based our estimates on the study by Sung .152 A decrement in utility of 0.57 for HSCT and 0.42 for all forms of chemotherapy is assumed. Both estimates are assumed to incorporate all short term adverse events associated with both treatments. However, Sung fails to report any estimate of duration associated with the estim ated disutilities for either treatment. Therefore we assume disutilities CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 171 apply for one year post treatment initiation. As the disutility estimate for all forms of chemotherapy is the same in both treatment arms , the impact will cancel out and is therefor e excluded from our model. 8.3.2.4 Adverse events As discussed in the previous section , all HSCT and chemotherapy adverse events are assumed to be incorporated in the treatment disutility estimates applied. The only additional adverse events to consider are those specifically associated with CAR T -cell therapy . As discussed in the cost sect ion, only CRS and B-cell aplasia are expected to be associated with potential additional burden not considered elsewhere in the model. The pragmatic literature review was unable to find any specific estimates of disutility or duration associated with eith er adverse event. For severe (grade 4) CRS it is assumed that, due to the severity of initial onset of the event and associated intensive care admiss ion, a utility of 0 is incurred for one week. For B -cell aplasia, while there is a large cost burden ass ociated with its management there is little evidence of any significant impact on patient utility. In existing CAR -T cell studies. B-cell aplasia appears to be either well managed or short lived, with no reported cases of associated intensive care hospita lisation. Therefore, no disutility is assumed for cases on B -cell aplasia. 8.3.2.5 Short -term health -related quality of life The model considers short -term response as either relapse or remission. The utility estimates to inform these estimates are derived from the Kelly et al.150 study, with a utility of 0.75 assigned to the relapse state and 0.91 to the remission state. 8.3.2.6 Long -term health -related quality of life Patients with the severe form of ALL conside red in the model are likely to experience long-term comorbidities associated with the disease and associated disutility. As such the utility score estimated for the state of remission is applied with an add itional age related decrement. 8.4 Conclusions Two de novo decision m odels were developed to assess the cost -effectiveness of CAR T -cell the rapy within the 2 separate TPPs (Bridge to HSCT and Curative intent) across each of the separate evidence sets. Although, a number of common inputs and assumptions were employed across both models, the 2 models had important structural differences which led to differences both in the underling model ling approach as well as in the use of external evidence. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 172 In the \"Bridge to HSCT\" scenario , the primary health b enefits of treatment with CA R-T cell therapy were assumed to be driven by an increase in the proportion of patients receiving HSCT and the subsequent success of HSCT itself (based on remission and MRD status) . The introduction of an epidemiological 'link' between a potential establis hed surrogate outcome and/or process (i.e. MRD and HSCT status) and final health benefits (i.e. OS and QALYs) also enable d the use of external evidence to be utilised alongside the separate hypothetical evidence sets generated. A landmark response model was developed utilising evidence from the hypothetical evidence sets to inform short -term ou tcomes on remission, HSCT and M RD status and external evidence to estimate overall survival conditional on these shorter -term outcomes. Hence, t he key assumption employed within this scenario is that external evidence substantiating the relationship between MRD and HSCT status in studies in which CAR T -cells have not been used can be generalised to patients in whom CAR -T cells have been used. Importantly , results of our validation work appears to demonstrate that, with minor ca libration and adjustment , the combination of trial reported evidence on short -term outcomes (remission, HSCT and MRD status) and external evidence on their relationship to OS appeared to closely match the OS estimates directly reported within the studies used to generate the evidence sets for CAR T -cell therapy and the comparator (clofarabine). In the \" Curative intent \" model , a different assumption was employed; specifically that the CAR T -cell therapy itself potentially confers longer -term and potentially curative benefits without the need to bridge to HSCT. In this context, the case for use a structural link between final health benefits and a surrogate outcome or process such as HSCT appears more limited . Instead, a simple three state partitioned survival model was developed to model long -term outcomes via the direct extrapolation of overall survival data from the evidence sets. An important consideration within this model was whether the use of conventional parametric survival functions (e.g. exponential, Weibull, log -normal etc) would adequately capture the potential for a less conventional hazard function that might be observed for a curative treatment ; and how this might be affected by dif ferent levels of precision and maturity of evidence. Consequently, our work considered the goodness of fit of conventional survival functions and more flexible survival models (e.g. spline -based models developed by Royston and Parmar141). A key finding was that the more flexible survival models appeared to more closely approximate the observed hazard function across each of the evidence sets . To our knowledge, although the use of these more flexible survival models are briefly discussed within existing NICE technical support documents (TSD14),153 we are not aware of any examples of their use to date by manufacturers or AGs within the NICE TA process. Consequently, further research may be required to more formally consider the appropriateness of CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 173 alternative survival modelling app roaches to regenerative medicines and cell -based therapies, including more flexible models and cure fraction models.154 The importance of the level of data maturity in deriv ing robust survival projections for the economic model was evident in our results. Whilst the \"best -fitting\" spline models appeared to generate a robust fit to the data over the first 3 months of the KM estimate used in the minimum dataset , the functions w ere not able to accurately predict the tail of distribution. Furth ermore, considerable variation was evident in the predicted long -term survival of the modelled cohort with a significant spread in the projected su rvival trajectories employing different par ametric functions. Consequently, we concluded that it was unlikely that a single survival distribution could adequately characterise uncertainties over the longer -term extrapolation period. Although t he robustness of the ICER estimates to alternative d istributions can be explored separate sensitivity analyses or scenarios, concerns may exist regarding the transparency of subsequent decisions if the weighting of these is not explicitly specified in subsequent policy decisions. To more formally account for th e uncertainty surrounding choice of survival distribution, a model averaging approach was adopted. This technique involves the parameterisation of uncertainty surrounding the choice of distribution, combining results from a series of alternative survival f unctions as part of a weighted distribution. This approach samples both the parametric uncertainty associated within each distribution and the uncertainty (or weights) surrounding the choice of preferred method. Through the probabilistic analysis, it is th erefore possible to estimate the joint distribution of uncertainty around the parameter estimates and the choice of survival function. In contrast to the minimum set, the additional data maturity in the intermediate and mature evidence sets results in gre ater certainty over the long -term survival benefits of treatment. This leads to reduced variability in the potential trajectories for the survival benefits of treatment. In addition, with more mature evidence, the fitted survival models are better able to predict the tail of the KM. Therefore, unlike the bridge to HSCT model, additional evidence maturity in the curative model leads to different projections of survival benefit, as well as impacting on the parametric uncertainty surrounding model extrapolatio ns. The weights in the exemplar model were based on standard measures of statistical fit. However, these weights could also be informed by clinical judgement and the committee's deliberations. Given the inevitable uncertainties which are likely to exist re garding the longer -term benefits of regenerative medicines and cell -based therapies and their implications for the robustness of subsequent cost-effectiveness estimates , further methodological research could be useful ly undertaken to help inform CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 174 how these uncertainties might be appropriately quantified in a transparent manner to inform subsequent decisions. A key consideration here would be the exten t to which these weights can be defined prior to the Committee's deliberations or should be more directly inf ormed by them. Given the potential complexity in both undertaking these analyses and communic ating the results, more efforts should be made to ensure models are developed to ensure that informal judgements can be more explicitly incorporated in a timely and transparent manner.155 A key assumption employed within both models is that from year 5 onwards in the model, all patients who remained alive were assumed to experience a similar mortality risk profile consistent with a long - term survivo r of ALL. Hence, t he mortality risks assumed in both models after year 5 were based on matched general population estimates of the all cause risk of mortality adjusted for excess morbidity and mortality reported in longer -term cohorts of long -term survivor s of ALL. Since data were not assumed to be available beyond 5 -years, it is not possible to determine the possible direction and/or magnitude of any possible bias that this approach might introduce. However, this period is consistently utilised within existing studies of ALL and appears clinically to represent an important time point for patients to reach without subsequent relapse. Hence, for the purposes of extrapolation and the exemplar, it was considered a reasonable basis for informing subsequent longe r-term extrapolations. This assumption also impacted on reducing some of the longer -term uncertainties that would inevitably arise from the extrapolation of the data beyond the maximum reported follow -up across the evidence sets considered for CAR T -cell therapies. Clearly if additional follow -up data were available then the validity of such an approach could be more formally considered and any claims of longer -term benefits could be more robustly substantiated. Our searches to inform other model parameter s identified other important uncertainties. The existing HRQoL data in ALL was limited and several assumptions were required. Importantly, no existing CAR T-study had incorporated measures of HRQoL that could be considered directly in the model. In the absence of this data, assumptions were made based on external studies to account for the possible magnitude of HRQoL benefits of achieving remission , alongside any negative impacts due to the model of therapy (i.e. HSCT, chemotherapy) and other specific adver se events. Our model focused specifically on the impact of CRS and B -cell aplasia. Importantly, no studies were identified on the potential HRQoL impact of these specific events which are likely to be associated with CAR -T therapy necessitating the use of potentially arbitrary assumption. Further research to generate more robust estimates of HRQoL appropriate for cost -effectiveness analysis are clearly required, together with more specific research which more formally demonstrates the impact of specific the rapeutic modalities (including CAR T -cells). CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 175 Finally, our research also identified important uncertainties regarding both the likely acquisition costs of CAR T -cells and other key elements of the process (e.g. leukapheresis , conditioning therapies, level o f hospitalisation required for different aspects such as conditioning, subsequent administration and monitoring etc). Furthermore, no account was taken of the potential costs incurred by patients and their families. Based on prior NICE TA appraisals, addit ional evi dence would need to be provided by manufacturers to more robustly determine the potential costs to the NHS in order to avoid similar uncertainties regarding the costing assumptions to be raised. An important uncertainty identified related to the c osts of HSCT and any additional costs that may arise due to longer -term management of patients. A variety of possible sources were identified in our review and important differences observed across these. Further studies would be useful to more formally co st the short and longer -term implications of HSCT in paediatric populations and to also determine the generalisability of studies reporting estimates from outside the UK. Although the existence of possible learning curves was identified as an important issue in the conceptual review, these were not directly considered within the exemplar. Some aspects of these may become more apparent as larger studies report, particularly involving centres with different levels of expertise. Hence, some aspects of learning may be reflected within the results from larger studies and/or specific factors may become more apparent in terms of how these might be incorporated within cost -effective ness assessments. For example, as experience with using CAR T -cell therapies develop, this may have important implications for both the identification and management of potential AEs, as well as provision of the therapy itself. An assumption is made in the exemplar model is that the different stages of the process for CAR T -cells would require separate hospitalisation (i.e. for the initial conditioning therapy and later for the subsequent administration of the CAR T -cells and subsequent monitoring). However , as experience and knowledge continues to develop, aspects of the process may evolve over time such that subsequent administration and monitoring may be undertaken in a less resource intensive setting. Although the existence of learning curves has receive d significant attention in the clinical literature, to date the implicat ion for and application within cost -effectiveness analy sis remains limited and warrants further investigation.92 Finally, an important assumption made within the exemplar relates to the acquisition cost of CAR T -cell thera py itself. In the absence of a commercially available product and published price, an assumption was made that the manufacturer would employ a value -based approach to their decision such that the resulting cost-effectiveness (ICER) estimate was close to NI CE's cost -effectiveness threshold. In the context of the CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 176 exemplar, this was assumed to be based on the maximum range of the threshold considered by NICE assuming the existing E nd of Life criteria are met. Importantly, this price is not considered to be indicative of the final acquisition cost that might be set when commercially available products are available. Neither are we making the presumption that NICE's current End of Life criterion would apply. Rather , the basis for setting the price on the basis of existing cost -effectiveness threshold was to enable different interested parties to better understand the potential impact of other uncertainties (e.g. precision and maturity of evidence) within NICE's current decision making process, identifying potentia l trade -offs that may exist and illustrating how these uncertainties might be more explicitly addressed within different MEAs (i.e. evidence generation and/or pricing schemes). Although it is clearly possible to examine a range of different possible price s for the CAR T -cell therapies within the exemplar, it was considered that this approach may result in the subsequent Panel decision process becoming unmanageable (i.e. multiple pricing scenarios) and would lessen the generalisability learning which the ex emplar was developed to highlight. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 177 Assessment of cost -effectiveness, uncertainty and the value of alternative 9 policy options 9.1 Overview The exemplar in Section 8 has been developed to highlight some of the specific challenges that may present themselves to manufacturer s and AGs in terms of developing and populating a cost -effectiveness model. Consideration is now given to how such estimates could be presented and co mmunicated to the Committee. In doing this we consider the analyses routinely requested within NICE's existing methods guide83 but also consider whether additional analyses may provide useful additional insights to help inform s ubsequent committee deliberations. Based on the scoping review reported in Section 4.4, we also consider analyses relating to some of the broader issues and approaches identified previously (e.g. alternative payment mechanisms) which, although potentially outside the existing r emit of NICE, may provide additional insights to other interested bodies and manufacturers. Importantly, the use of non -reference case approaches and additional analyses undertaken beyond those requested within NICE's existing process and methods guide are not intended to be prescriptive. Neither are they comprehensive given the multiplicity of issues and challenges raises. Instead these have been provided to help explore whether additional information and analyses may be helpful in informing the Committee' s deliberations and the nature of such analyses . Consideration will be subsequently given regarding whether particular analyses helped inform particular considerations within NICE's deliberations within the exemplar appraisal and to identify areas where further methodological and applied work may be required. 9.2 Acquisition costs of CAR T -cell therapies As noted in S ection 8.3.1.1 of the report, the acqu isition cost for CAR T -cell therapy in the exemplar was assumed to be based on a value -based approach from the manufacturer, such that this would be priced at a level such that the ICER for CAR -T cell therapy would be close to the upper limit of NICE's end of life threshold range (circa \u00a350,000 per QALY gained). Because of differences in the projected survival benefits of treatment across the separate TPPs, the subsequent cost of CAR T -therapy varied across these, with one -off acquisition costs of \u00a3356,1 00 assumed in the \"Bridge to HSCT\" scenario and \u00a3528, 600 in the \"curative intent\" scenario. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 178 A full summary of CAR T acquisition costs assumed across the separate pricing scenarios described in subsequent sections (one-off fixed cost, monthly leasing price, di scounted list price via PAS) is provided in Table 25.

Disaggregated costs and outcomes are presented i n Table 26. Table 26: Summary of costs and outcomes Outcome CAR T Standard of care Incremental Costs Course of treatment (including conditioning) \u00a3358, 057 \u00a343,200 \u00a3314, 1.36 7.46 Total of patients receiving HSCT (undiscounted) 48% 15% 33% The mean incremental costs of CAR T -cell therapy over a patient's lifetime was estimated to be \u00a3373 ,166 and resulted in an additional 7.46 QALYs. A summary of the incremental cost per QALY gained (\u00a349,995 ) over a lifetime horizon are reported in Table 27 which can be co mpared against the cost - effectiveness threshold. Equivalently this can be also expressed as the per -patient net -health effect (NHE); including benefits, harms and NHS/Personal Social Services costs. The NHE is the difference between any health gained with the intervention and health foregone elsewhere in the health care system and can be expressed in both monetary and QALY terms. With an ICER of approximately \u00a350,000 per QALY, the incremental NHE at a threshold of \u00a350,000 NHE is close to zero (i.e. 0.001 QA LYs or \u00a341 per patient) . CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 180 That is, the additional health gained with the intervention is almost exactly offset by health foregone elsew here. Table 27: Expected cost -effectiveness of CAR T therapy per patient treated (lifetime horizon ) Per patient -level Cost-effectiveness threshold of \u00a350,000 -0.16 (-\u00a37,960) - Given the uncertainties surrounding longer -term outcomes, i t may also be informative to consider how incremental NHEs accumulate over time or the 'investment profile' with CAR T -cell therapy , shown in Figure 14. The initial per -patient c ost for CAR T -cell patients is due to the additional acquisition and administration costs of the CAR T -cells and associated HSCT costs. These negative NHEs are gradually offset by positive NHEs in later periods due to the ongoing mortality benefits assumed from successfully bridging to HSCT . However it is only after 60 years that the initial losses are sufficiently compensated by later gains , that CAR T -cells appear to be clo se to break -even (i.e. NHE>=0). Figure 14: Investment profile per patient treated with NHE over a lifetime horizon 9.3.2 Population -level analyses - minimum evidence set NHEs can also be presented for a population of patients over tim e. Although the presentation of population NHE is not formally requested within th e existing NICE methods guide, population -based -8.00-7.00-6.00-5.00-4.00-3.00-2.00-1.000.001.00 0 120 240 360 480 600 720 840 960 1080Incremental net health effects Time (months)CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 181 analyses are requested to be submitted to assess population impacts within Section 5.12 (Impact on the NHS). In addition, Sect ion 6.4.1. states that i n situations in which the evidence of clinical effectiveness evidence is either \" absent, weak or uncertain \" the Committee is requested to \" balance the potential net benefits to current NHS patients of a recommendation not restricted to research with the potential net benefits to both current and future NHS patients of being able to produce guidance and base clinical practice on a more secure evidence base \". Analyses of population NHE may therefore provide additional information to help inform the Committee's deliberations regarding possible research recommendations (Section 6.4 of the current methods guide ). Population NHE requires information about the prevalence and future incide nce of the target population and a judgement about the time horizon over which the technology will be used in clinical practice. As outlined in Appendix 8, the expected incidence of eligible cases for the exemplar is estimated to be approximately 38 patien ts per annum. The technology time horizon is set to 10 -years in the base case. Table 28 reports population NHE for CAR -T therapy over the 10 -year technology time hor izon. Over this period, the use of CAR -T cell t herapy is estimated to generate an additional 2356 QALYs (discounted values) within the population considered compared to the current standard of care. However, since the additional lifetime costs of \u00a3117.7 8 million ( \u00a3141.7 5 million - \u00a323.97 million; discounted values) require other treatments to be displaced and health foregone by other patients in the NHS , overall the additional QALYs are exactly offset by health foregone elsewhere. Hence, the incremental pop ulation NHE at a \u00a350,000 per QALY threshold is 0.26 QALYs (\u00a312,813). Table 28: Expected cost -effectiveness of CAR T therapy at population level (including incident patients) Population -level Cost-effectiveness threshold of \u00a350,000 p er QALY gained ICER -\u00a32,512,303) A series of one -way sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess the sensitivity of model results to changes in assumptions. The results of this sensitivity analysis are presented in Table 29. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 182 Table 29: Results of one -way sensitivity analysis (population level) - Bridge to HSCT TPP Scenario Incremental cost Incremental QALY ICER Incremental NHE at willingness to pay (\u00a3) Base case \u00a3117,776,840 2355.79 \u00a349,995 0.26 (\u00a312,813) Repeat CAR T treatment of 0. 5% \u00a3193,649,693 2355.79 \u00a382,201 -1517.2 0 (-\u00a375,860,040) Repeat 0.1% \u00a3132,951,410 2355.79 \u00a356,436 -303.24 \u00a325,576 2251.16 -691.87 3350.89 \u00a335,148 995.35 (\u00a349,767,620) UK treasury recommended s tep discounting 3.5% up to year 30, 3 % thereafter (both costs and health effects) \u00a3117,776,840 2374.47 \u00a349,601 18.94 (\u00a3946,799) Standard \u00a3130,211,131 2355.79 \u00a355,273 -248.43 (-\u00a312,421,478) Hazard rate for death in non - remission no -HSCT patients increased from 0.2425 (mean time to death =0.34 years) to 0.6075 (mean time to death = 0.14 years) \u00a3117,775,723 2363.47 \u00a349,832 7.95 (\u00a3397,705) The results of the one -way sensitivity analyses indicate that the results of the evaluation are sensitive to assumptions on the potential for re -treatment of CAR T -cell and the assumed discounting rate for health effects in the model. The results of the evaluation are less sensitive to assumptions on the disco unting rate for costs , assumptions on the impact of remission status on survival in non -HSCT patients, and to reducing the cost of standard of care treatment to values consistent with treatment using FLAG -IDA (assuming similar efficacy to clofarabine ). If the committee were to consider the criteria met for applying the non-referenc e-case discount rate of 1.5% for both costs and health effects (i.e. when treatment restores people who would otherwise die or have a very severely impaired life to full or near full health, and when this is sus tained over a very long CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 183 period, normally at least 30 years) , then the ICER would reduce to \u00a335, 148 per QALY and CAR T -cell therapy would be associated with additional population NHE equivalent to 995 QALYs (\u00a349. 77 million) in co mparison to health foregone elsewhere . Employing the stepwise discounting recommended by the UK treasury to all public sector bodies, makes only a small difference to the ICER results with an ICER of \u00a349,60 1. The incremental population NHE increases to 18.94 QALYs (\u00a39 46,799). Although the results o f the evaluation appear sensitive to assumptions on the potential for re -treatment of CAR T -cell therapy, this was not considered to represent such a challenge in this TPP. CAR T -cells were assumed to be used as a one -off therapy to induce remission and to improve the likelihood and outcomes of HSCT. It was assumed that patients would not receive a r epeat treatment in the event of not achieving remission, nor would patients who were successfully treated with HSCT receive further treatments with CAR T -cell therapy. Probabilistic analysis The results of the probabilistic analysis therapy are shown in Table 30. Table 30: Results of base case probabilistic analysis, presented at population -level (Bridge to HSCT) Population -level Cost-effectiv eness (\u00a3) Incremental NHE, QALY (\u00a3) Probability cost - effective Consequences of decision uncertainty, QALY (\u00a3) CAR T increased to \u00a355,090 due to the model non -linearities.

The cost-effectiveness acceptability planes and curves a re presented in Figure 15 and Figure 16.

An assessment of the potential consequences of uncertainty is important because it indicates the scale of the population NHEs that could be gained if uncertainty surrounding this decision could be res olved WTP = \u00a350,000 \u00a30\u00a350,000\u00a3100,000\u00a3150,000\u00a3200,000\u00a3250,000\u00a3300,000\u00a3350,000\u00a3400,000\u00a3450,000\u00a3500,000\u00a3550,000\u00a3600,000\u00a3650,000 0 2 4 6 to pay thresholdCRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 185 immediately.88 This estimat e also represents an expected upper bound to the benefits of more research. This may help inform subsequent research recommendations. For example, i f the maximum potenti al benefits of further research are considered unlikely to sufficiently justify the res earch costs, then it may not be worthwhile to issue further research recommendations. These same consequences are referred to using the term Payer Uncertainty Burden (PUB) in the draft DSU report on Managed Access. Elsewhere in the literature, these have been defined as the Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) and the over all Expect ed Opportunity Loss . Within the DSU report this is further defined as value of the risk of making a particular decision due to uncertainty (expressed in either monetary or health units) ; combining two key concepts: first, the probability that the strategy with the highest expected NHE may not be the optimal strategy (i.e.1 -probability the intervention is cost - effective based on the probabilistic results) , and second, the consequences of a 'wrong' decision in terms of QALYs and NHS costs that could have been saved if the truly optimal strategy had been selected instea d. Assuming a 10 -year technology horizon, t he consequences of decision uncertainty in the minimum evidence set are estimated to be 56. 3 QALYs (\u00a32.83 million). Figure 17 shows how the scale of the consequences of decision uncertainty varies across different cost -effectiveness threshold s, reaching a peak at a \u00a355,000 threshold. Figure 17: Consequences of decision uncertainty - Bridge to HSCT information (population) Willingness to pay thresholdCRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 186 A summary of the population level incremental net health effects, net monetary benefits, probability of cost-effectiveness and consequences of decision uncertainty across a range of willingness to pay thresholds is presented in Table 31. Table 31: Consequences of decision uncertainty across different thresholds - Bridge to HSCT TPP (minimum evidence set) Cost-effectiveness thres hold Incremental NHE, QALY Incremental NMB, \u00a3 Probability cost - effective \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000 per QALY gained, the probability that CAR T -cell therapy is cost -effective versus standard of care is 0%. Consequently, because of the high certainty that CAR T -cell therapy is not cost -effective at conventional thresholds (i.e. assuming end of life criteria do not apply) there are no consequences of decision u ncertai nty. At a cost- effectiveness threshold of \u00a350,000 per QALY gained, the probability that CAR T -cell therapy is cost - effective versus standard of care is 26.1%. In this case, the expected population health consequence of decision uncertainty is 56.3 QALYs (10 -years ). The corresponding expected monetary cost of decision uncertainty is approximately \u00a32.8 million. At thresholds of \u00a375,000 and \u00a3100,000 per QALY gained the probability that CAR T is cost -effective increases to over 94%. Because there is now high certainty that CAR T is cost -effective at these thresholds, the corresponding consequences of decision uncertainty reduces to fewer than 10 QALYs (or less than \u00a31 million in monetary terms). Alternative pricing scenarios A series of alternative pri cing schemes have been generated to explore their potential impact on cost - effectiveness and decision uncertainty. The schemes considered include: A leasing scheme approach based on the approach outlined by Edlin et al.95 In this scenario, the technology is assumed to be leased from the company. The monthly 'lease' payment was established by calculating a stream o f payments over the expected survival duration of the patients that has the same expected net present value as the agreed price. Hence, payment was assumed to continue on a monthly basis while a patient remained alive. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 187 A pay for performance scheme in which payment is made retrospectively only for patients who achieve remission (CR) within a specified period (e.g. 28 days). Alternatively, an initial upfront payment could be made to all with a separate 'clawback' agreed for patients who do not achieve remissi on. A more conventional PAS scheme providing a fixed percentage discount (e.g. 10%). The probabilistic results based on alternative hypothetical pricing scenarios are shown in Table 32. The scatter plots showing each iteration of incremental costs and incremental effects considered in the PSA is provided in Figure 18. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 188 Table 32: Impact of different pricing schemes on the cost -effectiveness of CAR T therapy, and the associated consequences of decision uncertainty : Bridge to HSCT TPP (minimum evidence set) Pricing scenario Population -level Cost-effectiveness threshold of \u00a350,000 per QALY Consequences of decision uncertainty, QALY (\u00a35,266,662) Payment for remission patients only CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 189 Figure 18: Scatter plots of incremental costs and incremental effectiveness across the four pricing scenarios (upper left - base case, upper right - Leasing method, lower left - payment for remission only, lower right - fixed discounting ; Red Box = mean of PSA v alues ) CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 190 The impact of the different pricing schemes on the sampled outputs of the PSA is shown graphically in Figure 18. In the base case (fixed cost for CAR T), the cloud of simulated outcomes from the PSA is flat, such that there is considerable variability around the QALY gains of treatment, but little relative variability around the incremental costs. By introducing a leasing metho d, the costs of CAR T -cell therapy becomes more closely linked to the effectiveness of treatment, such that the cloud of simulated outcomes from the PSA is re-orientated around the willingness to pay threshold. With both the remission and discounted scheme s, the cost -effectiveness of treatment is improved, and the cloud of simulated outcomes is shifted downwards on the chart. A comparison plot of the consequences of decision uncertainty across the alternative pri cing scenarios for different cost -effectiveness thresholds is shown in Figure 19. Figure 19: Comparison plot of consequences of decision uncertainty acros s alternative pricing schemes : Bridge to HSCT TPP (minimum evidence set) CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 191 Under a fixed one -off acquisition cost approach, assumed in the main analyses , the NHS bears all the risks associated with uncertainty surrounding whether the expected benefits of therapy will be realised in routine clinical practice . Hence, the consequences of decision uncertainty to the NHS appear highest with this scheme (56.2 QALYs; \u00a32.81 million). The alternative schemes result in reductions in decision uncertainty and assoc iated consequences to the NHS. However, t he impact and mechanism in which this is achieved differs across the separate approaches. The leasing approach results in only a minor difference in the ICER. Similar levels of decision uncertaint y also remain (i.e . the probability that the intervention is cost -effective is similar to that under a fixed one -off acquisition cost approach ). However, the scale of the consequences of the uncertainty to the NHS is significantly reduced via this scheme. This scheme limits the risk to the NHS for over -paying for a technology which doesn't achieve the expected outcomes, significantly lowering the consequences of decision uncertainty to 22.5 QALYs (\u00a31.12 million). The use of a pay for performance scheme improves the expected cost -effectiveness and as a result reduces both the level of decision uncertainty and the scale of their consequences. Restricting payment to only patients who achieve remission, improves expect ed cost -effectiveness (\u00a336,430 per QALY), leading to a higher probability of being cost -effective (96.8%), thereby reducing the consequences of uncertainty t o 3.9 QALYs ( \u00a3195,000). The use of a more conventional PAS scheme, based on an assumed 10% reductio n in the acquisition cost, works in a similar manner by improving both expected cost - effectiveness (\u00a3 49,857 per QALY) and the likelihood a treatment is cost -effective ( 51.8% ), however, as the ICER now lies closer to the threshold in absolute ter ms the consequences are increased to 131.2 QALYs (\u00a36,558,209). The comparison plot more clearly shows the impact of the alternative pricing scheme. The alternative schemes aff ect both the shape of the distribution of the consequences across the separate cost - effectiveness threshold s as well as their position. Results of probabilistic analysis across evidence sets All the analyses reported previously have been based on the minim um evidence set. The impact of the alternative evidence sets on expected cost -effectiveness, the level of decision uncertainty and the scale of the consequences are reported in Table 33. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 192 As highlighted in Section 6, the use of a separate structura l/surrogate link within the 'bridge to HSCT' TPP was employed to allow the incorporation of external evidence on the relationship between remission MRD and HSCT status. A limitation of our analysis is that the same external evidence is then used across each of the separate evidence sets. This means that the additional follow -up assumed in both the intermediate and mature evidence sets are not adequately reflected in the results. Consequently, the ICER and associated decision uncertainty are identical across the minimum and intermediate datasets. Furthermore, t he differences in results based on these evidence s ets and the mature evidence set is driven entirely by the increased precision (i.e. due to higher patient numbers) in the short -term remission, MRD and HSCT rates, as opposed to the additional maturity of follow -up data which may be available. In practice, the additional follow -up reported in more mature follow -up could either replace the existing surrogate relationship employed here or be synthesised a nd combined with the external evidence. Hence, the value that the additional follow -up brings in terms of either confirming an assumed surrogate relationship, or increasing the precision around this relationship, are not adequately captured in these analys es.

Specifically in relation to how their deliberations might be affected in situations in which the same ICER and decision uncertainty were reported but under different circumstances i.e. situations in which the results are based entirely on external surrogate relationship s versus when these are based on actual observed data from a longer -term trial or follow -up. As expected, the health consequence of decision uncertainty in the mature evidence set (48.1 QALYs; \u00a32.41 million) is lower than that reported in the minimum set (56.2 QALYs; \u00a32.81 million), at a threshold of \u00a350,000 per QALY gained. These consequences are reduced by the increased precision associated with the larger sample in terms of the short term remission, MRD and HSCT rates.

Figure 21: Comparison plot of consequences of decision uncertainty Willingness to pay threshold Minimum / intermediate evidence set Mature evidence setCRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 196 Presentation of the scale of consequences using pop ulation NHE allows some important comparisons to be made across the separate pricing approaches and the difference evidence sets. More specifically these comparisons could provide a more explicit basis for considering the value of direct price reductions t hat might be realised via a conventional PAS (or less conventional schemes which work by indirectly lower the effective price) compared to the provision of additional evidence (both precision and maturity), in terms of reducing decision uncertainty and its consequences. In the 'Bridge to HSCT' TPP, significant reductions in the level and scale of the consequences of decision uncertainty (i.e. the risk faced by the NHS), appear to be achieved by more innovative pricing ap proaches such as pay for performance and leasing approaches than that which might be realised by the provision of further evidence. Such information might provide an important basis for discussions between manufacturers and NICE in terms of how the existi ng uncertainties that exist might be appropriately managed ensuring risks and benefits are more appropriately shared. 9.4 Curative intent TPP A similar sequence of assessments and analyses were conducted based on the curative intent TPP. In contrast to the 'Bridge to HSCT', differences in the results across the evidence sets are more evident since the results are directly informed by the data as sumed within these rather than employing evidence from external sources. 9.4.1 Per-patient analyses - minimum evidence set Again, the sequence of assessments starts with a conventional assessment of cost -effectiveness at the patient level based on the minimum evidence set. Disaggregated costs and outcomes are presented in Table 34. The mean incremental costs of CAR T -cell therapy over a n individual patient's lifetime was estimated to be \u00a3 503,256 and resulted in an additional 10.07 QALYs .

In common with the previous TPP, the acquisition cost was set such that the ICER (\u00a349,994) was close to the upper limit of NICE's end of life threshold range (circa \u00a350,000 per QALY gained). Table 35: Per patient expected cost -effectiveness : Curative intent TPP (minimum evidence set) Per patient -level Cost-effectiveness threshold of \u00a350,000 per QALY gained -0.49 (-\u00a324,570) - CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 198 The accumulation of NHEs over time or equivalently the 'investment profile' per patient is shown in Figure 22. Figure 22: Investment profile - Curative intent TPP At the start of the time horizon, the initial high costs of treatment are far in excess of the immediate health benefits of treatment, leading to a negative NHE. Over time, the initial negative NHEs are gradually offset by the accrual of the residual healt h benefits of treatment (i.e. of cure). In common with the 'Bridge to HSCT' TPP, it is only after approximately 60 years that the initial losses are sufficiently compensated by later gains that CAR T -cells appear to be close to break -even (i.e. NHE>=0). The shape of the investment profile differs slightly across the separate TPPs , the early kink that was shown in the previous TPP is not evident here . The lack of the kink is due to the small number of patients who are assumed to receive HSCT in the curative TPP. Hence, the resulting investment profile is smoother, although higher initial negative NHEs are reported due to the hi gher acquisition cost assumed within this TPP. 9.4.2 Population -level analyses - minimum evidence set The expected per patient effects of t reatment are also extended to a population level based on similar assumptions concerning the incidence (approx. 38 patients per annum) and technology time horizon (10 - years) . -12.00-10.00-8.00-6.00-4.00-2.000.002.00 0 120 240 360 480 600 720 840 960 1080Incremental Net helath effects (QALY)Time horizon (months) Net health effects of CAR TCRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 199 Table 36 reports population NHE for CAR -T cell therapy over the 10 -year technology time horizon. Over this period, the use of CAR -T cell therapy is estimated to result in an additional 3,177 QALYs (discounted values) within the population considere d compared to the current standard of care. However, since the additional lifetime costs of \u00a3158.8 4 million (discounted values) require other treatments to be displaced and health foregone by other patients, overall the additional QALYs are almost exactly offset by health foregone elsewhere. The resulting incremental population NHE is 0.39 QALYs expressed in health terms and \u00a319,269 in monetary terms. Table 36: Expected cost -effectiveness of CAR T therapy ( population level ): Curative intent TPP (minimum evidence set) Population -level Cost-effectiveness threshold of \u00a350,000 QALY gained A series of one -way sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the sensitivity of model results to changes in assumptions or model settings. The results of this sensitivity analysis are presented in Table 37.

The results of the evaluation are relatively insensitive to assumptions on the discounting rate for costs, the use of stepped discounting rate (versus constant discou nting rates), and to reducing the cost of standard of care treatment to values consistent with treatment using FLAG -IDA (keeping the same efficacy). If the committee were to consider the criteria met for applying the non-referenc e-case discount rate of 1.5% for both costs and health effects, then the ICER would reduce to \u00a335, 466 per QALY and CAR T - cell therapy would be associated with additional population NHE equivalent to 1302 QALYs (\u00a3 65.1 million) in comparison to health foregone elsewhere. Employing t he stepwise discounting recommended by the UK treasury, again makes only a small difference in the ICER results with an ICER of \u00a349 ,606. The incremental population NHE is 25 QALYs (\u00a31.26 million) in comparison to health foregone elsewhere. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 201 The sensitivity of the results to assumptions on the potential for re -treatment of CAR T -cell therapy was considered to represent a more important issue within this TPP. That is, the longer term survival benefits are directly linked to the curative potential of the CAR T -cells themselves rather than to an intermediate treatment such as HSCT. Consequently, the potential need to re -administer CAR T -cell therapy over a longer period represents an important additional source of uncertainty within this TPP , particularly for the minimum data set with relatively short follow -up. Probabilistic analysis The results of the probabilistic analysis therapy are shown in Table 38. The probabilistic ICER increased to \u00a350,906 due to the model non -linearities. Consequently, population NHE were now negative with an overall loss to the health system of 56 QALYs (\u00a3 2.8 milli on). At a \u00a350,000 cost -effectiveness threshold, the probability that CAR T -cell therapy was the most cost -effective option was 50.7%.

Figure 25 shows how the scale of the consequen ces of decision uncertainty varies across different cost -effectiveness threshold, reaching a peak at the \u00a350,000 threshold.

Consequently, there are no consequences of decision uncertainty at these threshold values. At a willingness to pay threshold of \u00a350,000 per QALY gained, the probability that CAR T -cell therapy is cost -effective versus standa rd of care is 50.7%. In this case, the expected population health consequence of decision uncertainty is 305 QALYs (10 -years). The corresponding expected monetary cost of decision uncertainty is approximately \u00a3 15.2 million. At thresholds of \u00a375,000 and \u00a310 0,000 per QALY gained the probability that CAR T -cell therapy is cost - effective increases to over 88%. Despite the re being high certainty that CAR T -cell therapy is cost - effective at these thresholds, the corresponding consequences of decision uncertainty remain relative ly high at 66 (\u00a34.9 million in monetary terms) QALYs, and 23 QALYs ( \u00a32.3 million ) respectively.

As before, t he alternative schemes result in reductions in dec ision uncertainty and associated consequences to the NHS. However, the impact and mechanism in which this is achieved differs across the separate approaches. The leasing approach results in only a minor difference in the ICER. Similar levels of decision uncertainty also remain (i.e. the probability that the intervention is cost -effective is similar to that under a fixed one -off acquisition cost approach). However, the scale of the consequences of the uncertainty to the NHS is significantly reduced via this scheme. This scheme limits the risk to the NHS for over -paying for a technology which doesn't achieve the expected outcomes, significantly lowering the consequences of decision uncertainty from over 300 QALYs in the base case to 65.6 QALYs (\u00a3 3.2 uncertainty Willingness to pay threshold Base case - no pricing scheme Leasing option Payment only for remission Fixed discount scheme 10%CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 208 Alternative evidence sets probabilistic analysis The results of the probabilistic analysis therapy are shown in Table 41. A comparison p lot of the consequences of decision uncertainty across the evidence sets is shown in Figure 28. As expected, the health consequence of decision uncertainty in the mature evidence set ( 14.1 QALYs; \u00a3707,000 ) is lower than that reported in the minimum set ( 304.6 QALYs; \u00a315.2 million), at a threshold of \u00a350,000 per QALY gained. These consequences are reduced by the increased certainty surrounding the trajectory of the parametric survival curves, and the effect of increased maturity on improving the cost - effectiveness of CAR T therapy. As is evident from Figure 28, the increased cert ainty over the longer - term survival benefits of treatment (and represented by the longer -follow up assumed in the intermediate and mature evidence sets), has a proportionately greater effect in reducing decision uncertainties within the minimum dataset tha n the increased precision of greater patient numbers (i.e. only reflected in the mature evidence set).

An important aspect of this work was also to consider how these estimates could be presented and communicated to the Committee to inform their deliberations. In doing this we presented analyses based on approaches routinely requested within NICE's existing methods guide . We also undertook addition al analyses may provide useful additional insights to help inform subsequent committee deliberations and the potential nature of such analyses . The sequence of assessments presented started with a conventional assessment of cost -effectiveness at the patient level based on the minimum evidence set. Disaggregated estimates of the costs and outcomes were estimated, together with resulting cost -effectiveness estimates based on the ICER. These results were also expressed using NHEs, representing the diffe rence between any health gained with the intervention and health foregone else where in the health care system, expressed either in monetary and QALY terms. The impact of uncertainties was explored using conventional one -way sensitivity analyses (i.e. varyi ng individual parameters or specific assumptions) and probabilistic approaches (i.e. exploring the impact of joint uncertainty across all parameters). Conventional scatter - plots and acceptability curves were utilised to graphically show the impact of param eter uncertainties and other more methodological uncertainties (e.g. the appropriate discount rate). The analyses also explored the potential impact if the committee were to consider the criteria met for applying the non - reference -case discount rate of 1.5 % for costs and health effects. In addition to the analyses undertaken using the conventional reference case approaches, a series of more exploratory analyses were also undertaken. In particular, the per -patient assessments were subsequently scaled up to p opulation assessments, requiring an estimate of the number of potentially eligible patients (assumed to be approximately 38 patients per annum) and an assessment of the 'technology time horizon' i.e. the period over which the therapy might be utilised with in clinical practice (assumed to be 10 years in the exemplar). Although the presentation of population -level analyses are not formally requested within the existing NICE methods guide for reporting cost - effectiveness results , an assessment of population impact is required within Section 5.12 (Impact on the NHS). Hence, these exploratory analyses were considered to be consistent with the requirement to consider population impact and the specific requests within Section 6.4.1 (Research recommendations) for the committee to balance the potential NHEs of current and future NHS patients when considering making research recommendations. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 212 The results of the population based analyses were summarised in terms of incremental NHE (both in terms of QALYs and equivalent monetary value) together with an assessment of the probability that CAR T -cells were cost -effective. Alongside these more conventional assessments, an assessment of the scale of the likely consequences was considered to be potentially informative to the c ommittee, particularly in deliberations related to possible research recommendations. An estimate of the consequences of existing decision uncertainty was subsequently derived reflecting the possible scale of NHEs that could be gained if uncertainty surrou nding this decision could be resolved Using the different analyses, the impact of alternative pricing scenarios were explored, including conventional PAS type schemes (i.e. equivalent to a fixed price reduction) as well as more sophisticated schemes based on pay for performance and leasing approaches. Similarly, t he impact of the alternative evidence sets was explored to establish the implications of increased precision and maturity assumed in the intermediate and mature evidence sets. An important conside ration within this work is the extent to which current NICE methods and processes are likely to appropriately quantify the potential uncertainties surrounding regenerative medicines and cell -based therapies to ensure that appropriate policy decision are ma de regarding adoption and spread of potentially promising technologies. Our findings show that the conventional assessments requested within the current TA process may not be sufficient. Estimates of the ICER and associated uncertainty (e.g. probability a technology is cost -effective) were shown to be similar in one of the TPPs despite being based on 3 different evidence sets with varying levels of precision and maturity. Consequently, it is unclear how these differences would be reflected within the curren t deliberative process. Whilst it is acknowledged that different conclusions might be reached based on informal judg ements , the importance of ensuring transparency in subsequent decisions remains a key principle of the Institute and appears critical for ma nufacturers in developing appropriate R&D and pricing strategies. Presentation of the scale of consequenc es using population NHE provided a clearer distinction between the different evidence sets and an assessment of the impact of alternative pricing schemes. Consequently, their more routine application within the TA process for regenerative and cell -based therapies may be an important consideration for the Institute. Furthermore, such comparisons could also provide a more transparent and explicit basis for considering the value of direct price reductions that might be realised via a conventional PAS (or less conventional schemes which work by indirectly lower the effective price) compared to the provision of additional evidence (both precision and maturity), in terms of reducing decision uncertainty and its consequences. Such information might provide an impor tant basis for discus sions between manufacturers, NICE and other relevant parties in CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 213 terms of how the existing uncertainties that exist might be appropriately managed ensuring risks and benefits are more appropriately shared.

The panel included clinical experts and current and past NICE committee members and was chaired by Professor Andrew Stevens (curren t chair NICE TA committee). A full list of panel members is provided in Appendix 9. The objective of the panel meeting was to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence informing the separate TPPs and to identify potential issues and challenges for the NICE TA appraisal process and methods . A summary of the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence was presented to the panel, together with an overview of key technical and pro cess issues for consideration. The panel was then presented with a series of separate decision scenarios reflecting: the 2 separate TPPs ('Bridge to HSCT' and 'Curative Intent'); the 3 evidence sets (minimum, intermediate and mature); and the impact of different pricing approaches based on the minimum evidence set. The p anel wa s requested to deliberate on the scenarios and to provide 'hypothetical' decisions and to outline the main considerations for these. The panel were requested to focus particularly on the role of uncertainty (clinical and cost -effectiveness) in order to: (i ) identify key areas of uncertainty; (ii) understand the nature of assessments/analyses that could help inform deliberations and (iii) explore the impact of different pricing approaches and different evidence sets. The main clinical and cost -effectiveness issues discussed by the panel are summarised below. This is followed by a summary of the panel discussions related to the separate scenarios. Clinical issues When asked for their thoughts , following a presentation of the clinical effectiveness and safety i ssues, the panel clinical experts commented that although the data for CAR T -cell therapies are limited, the results nevertheless appeared to be very encouraging when compared with the best available alternative (clofarabine). They added that manufacturers nevertheless need guidance on how to account for the uncertainty of trial results, given the availability of only short -term data and potential long-term effects. It is likely that future cell therapies will be aimed at larger populations (which ties in with the EMA's adaptive pathways approach - see Section 3). They also highlighted that clarity was needed around how data requirements might change according to the size of population. The clinical experts stated that knowledge is improving about which patients will have side effects from CAR T -cell therapies. Knowledge on predictors o f response (effect modifiers) was less developed, although the panel thought that the possibility of evidence review groups having access to individual patient data (IPD) during any assessment could be an important step to help identify possible effect mod ifiers and to assess the reliability of submitted evidence. For this assessment it was CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 215 suggested that there might be interest in whether relapsed patients responded better than refractory patients. The clinical experts were also asked about the potential v ariability in efficacy and safety profiles of these types of intervention due to manufacturing variability and heterogeneity in patient response. It was considered that any differences in efficacy and safety due to variability in the manufacturing process are likely to be largest early on, but will be optimised with time. Variability of efficacy and safety due to individual patient heterogeneity is however likely to remain. In response to a question from the panel about the success rates when manufacturing individual treatments, the clinicians said that although the success rates for 'expanding' CAR T -cells is high for B-ALL patients , it is difficult to tell which patients' (cells) can be successfully expanded (i.e. successful manufacture of the bespoke tre atment). They stated that patients may die before the cell therapies can be produced and administered. It was noted that it will therefore be very important that trials report data relating to the full 'intention -to-treat' (ITT) population, including those patients for whom CAR T -cell expansion was not successful. If any patients required re -treatment this should also be clearly reported. There were serious concerns from the panel regarding the level of uncertainty in the evidence base, in particular that i t was based on single -arm trials with possibly large unknown bias. There were concerns from the panel that certain efficacy estimates, particularly for the minimum data set, might be too optimistic and questions were asked whether any such biases could be quantified and adjusted for; it would be useful to see the impact of more pessimistic efficacy estimates on cost -effectiveness results. There were concerns around the long -term benefit of the therapy and whether the estimate of overall survival in the mini mum data set really could be carried into the mature data set. Another issue which was raised was the panel being provided with knowledge on what further research had been mandated by the EMA (e.g. for conditional approvals). Understanding this may be key to knowing how much present uncertainty, and at what cost, can be accepted. The difficulties of decommissioning services once treatments are approved were also raised as potential problems. Cost-effectiveness issues A key consideration regarding the cost -effectiveness results and implications for the 'hypothetical' decisions was whether the panel considered that existing criteria considered within the TA process in relation to End of Life (EoL) and 1.5% discounting (applied to costs and health outcomes) cou ld be applied. The panel accepted that , based on the patient numbers, current prognosis and the likely treatment benefit, CAR T -cell therapy for relapsed/refractory ALL would be likely to meet existing CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 216 criteria for EoL. However, the panel also noted that t he existing criteria might need to be reconsidered more generally for therapies with curative potential. It was argued by one panel member that the EoL criteria were developed to cover scenarios where people with conditions such as cancer with a short life expectancy, were given some extension, but whose life expectan cy was still short. It was suggested that different QALY weights might need to be considered over a longer period of projected survival benefits for therapies which have curative potential. The use of the 1.5% discounting was also discussed by the panel. While it was noted that the existing criteria had been developed in response to a similar decision context, the panel were also aware that the criteria had only been applied in 1 previous appra isal (the TA for which it was developed). The lack of precedent was noted and the panel concluded that its application could generate significa nt debate in future appraisals. Hence, no conc lusion was reached during the panel meeting about its application to CAR T -cell therapy. The use of stepped -discounting recommended by the Treasury discount was discussed by the panel but was considered to be more relevant for intervention s which might have important intra -generational impacts (e.g. immunisation) as opp osed to longer -term inter - generational effects. In addition to the concerns noted by the panel in relation to the possible bias and additional uncertainty arising from comparisons based on single -arm trials, the panel also raised questions regarding wheth er there were wider structural uncertainties relevant to regenerative medicines and cell-based therapies that were not fully captured within the analyses presented. The panel concluded that identifiable sources of potential bias and appropriately reflectin g structural sources of uncertainty would be an important consideration in future appraisals and manufacturers would need to clearly report how these had been addressed within their submission. The panel discussed the sequence of assessments presented in the cost -effectiveness section and the exploratory approaches to quantifying decision uncertainty based on an assessment o f the scale of the consequences associated with each decision, using population NHE. The panel agreed that these exploratory approache s provided a clearer and potentially important distinction between the different evidence sets and the impact of alternative pricing schemes. The panel also acknowledged that such assessments provided important information which could help inform their deliberations. However, the panel further noted that while such assessments were helpful and represented a useful starting point for deliberatio ns, they were not necessarily sufficient for informing their final decisions. In particular, the panel expressed difficulty in determining how to interpret the numbers presented without a formal reference point to establish whether the consequences were su fficiently high to impact on their decisions and/or potential research recommendations. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 217 The panel acknowledged that the estimates of the consequences represented a theoretical upper bound to the value of further research. However, the panel concluded that it would be important to further explore these consequences, both in terms of the underlying distribution (as opposed to the expected mean value of the consequences) as well as needing to decompose the overall estimate in relation to specific sources of u ncertainty. This latter aspect was considered particularly important in determining the extent to which particular sources of uncertainty could be resolved by additional research, the type of research which might be most appropriate and finally whether thi s research would be feasible following a positive approval. The panel were also aware of the relevance of existing published work88 and ong oing work by the NICE DSU that w ould be important to consider in any review of potential process or methods . Prior to a more detailed discussion of th e specific decision scenarios, the panel outlined a number of more general considerations related to the cost -effectiveness evidence and results: In discussing the appropriate cost -effectiveness threshold for the purpose of NICE decision making, the panel was clear that \u00a350,000 per QALY (assuming the EoL criteria applied) represented an absolute upper bound to the range that NICE would consider acceptable. The panel concluded that other considerations (e.g. innovation) would not be applied in conjunction wi th the higher threshold considered in an EoL appraisal. Furthermore, the panel also considered that the upper end of the range was unlikely to be considered appropriate in the presence of significant evidential uncertainties . The panel concluded that if the hypothetical price of CAR T -cell therapy had been set using the conventional cost -effectiveness threshold range (\u00a320,000 - \u00a330,000 per QALY) that this could have mitigated some of these uncer tainties, increasing the likelihood of a positive recomme ndation. The panel appreciated that there was a difference between the deterministic and probabilistic estimates of the ICER due to the non -linearity between the parameter inputs and the model outputs (i.e. mean costs, QALYs and ICER). The panel also noted that for some analyses, these differences resulted in ICER estimates which could have a material impact on their decisions (i.e. situations in which the deterministic and probabilistic estimates lay either side of the cost -effectiveness threshold). The pa nel concluded that the probabilistic estimates were the more appropriate basis for informing their decisions. The panel raised issues regarding the possible nature and magnitude of any irrecoverable costs that might be incurred by the NHS and the implicati ons for their decisions. The panel concluded that an 'exit strategy' for the NHS would be a key consideration for interventions CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 218 which appear highly promising but where significant uncertainties and irrecoverable costs may exist. The panel acknowledged th at the different pricing schemes had important impacts both in terms of the ICER but also in terms of the allocation of any risk between the NHS and manufacturers. The concept of the 'leasing approach' was identified as a potentially important option and t here was consensus amongst the panel that this warranted further explor ation by NICE and manufacturers (e.g. logistics, costs and overall feasibility). The panel recognised the various issues and challenges likely to be faced by the manufacturers of regene rative medicines and cell -based therapies. The panel also noted that many of the issues identified did not appear specific to these types of therapies and that many of the issues and implications identified were also apparent in appraisals of more conventi onal products. However, the panel acknowledged that that the challenges may be faced more routinely for regenerat ive medicines and cell -therapy manufacturers and that the resulting levels of uncertainty (and the potential scale of the consequences) may exc eed that for which existing committees might conclude could be appropriately dealt with by existing processes and the current methods guide. Panel discussion of scenarios Following a general discussion of clinical and cost -effectiveness issues, the pane l were presented with a series of 'decision scenarios' based on the results reported in Section 9. For each TPP, the scenarios started with the minimum evidence set and a fixed acquisition cost for CAR T -cell therapy (Scenario 1). Scenario 2 explored the i mpact of alternative pricing approaches based on the same minimum evidence set. Scenarios 3 and 4 were based on the results from the intermediate and mature evidence sets, assuming a fixed acquisition cost. For each scenario the panel were presented with a summary of the deterministic ICER and the probabilistic, population level results including an estimate of the ICER, incremental NHE (expressed in monetary and QALY terms), the probability cost -effective and an assessment of the scale of the consequence s of decision uncertainty (again expressed in monetary and QALY terms). A summary of the panel considerations is provided below. For Scenario 1, the panel understood that the deterministic estimate of the ICER for CAR T -cell therapy was close to the \u00a350,00 0 upper bound of the ICER range considered acceptable currently when the EoL criteria is met. However, the panel concluded that the probabilistic estimates of the ICER were more appropriate given the model non -linearity. Since the probabilistic ICER in the base-case of both TPPs exceeded the upper bound of the ICER range, the panel concluded that CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 219 CAR T -cell therapy would be unlikely to represent an efficient use of NHS resources in Scenario 1. Although other aspects of innovation were discussed, the panel c oncluded that while these were important considerations for CAR T -cell therapy, additional weight should not be incorporated over and above that which had already been permitted when applying the EoL criteria. For Scenario 2, the panel acknowledged the dif ferent impacts of the alternative pricing schemes on the ICER, the scale of the consequences of decision uncertainty as well as the apportionment of any risk between the NHS and a manufacturer. The panel noted that the lifetime leasing scheme resulted in a significant reduction in the scale of decision uncertainty compared to a fixed acquisition cost. The panel also acknowledged that the leasing scheme could also provide an important exit strategy for the NHS given the high uncertainties which were evident. There was consensus amongst panel members that innovative financing schemes could be an important consideration in future appraisals. The panel also noted that there were important differences in the scale of the consequences of decision uncertainty acros s the separate TPPs, with significantly higher consequences reported in the 'Curative Intent' TPP. The panel understood that the use of an external surrogate relationship between MRD, HSCT and remission status in the 'Bridge to HSCT' TPP had an important i mpact on reducing the scale of the decision consequences over the modelled time horizon. The panel found it difficult to determine the policy significance of the estimates reported for decision uncertainty without further analyses and an appropriate refer ence point. However, the panel also acknowledged in the 'Bridge to HSCT' TPP that the magnitude of the incremental NHE (i.e. the NHE that might be gained from immediate approval) significantly exceeded the scale of the consequences of decision uncertainty for the pricing schemes based on a pay for performance approach based on achieving remission. The panel understood that the higher incremental NHE reported in these scenarios (and reduction in the consequences of d ecision uncertainty) was driven by the lower ICER due to the direct or indirect impact on the acquisition cost of CAR T -cell therapy and that this had an important impact on the scale of the consequences of decision uncertainty . Faced with the high level s of uncertainty, the panel concluded that schemes which brought the ICER significantly lower than the upper bound of the EoL range and closer to the more conventional ICER range (\u00a320,000 -\u00a330,000 per QALY) would increase the likelihood of approval. The pa nel also a cknowledged that the reduction in the consequences of deci sion uncertainty in the leasing and the payment for remission schemes arose due to the risks being shared between the NHS and manufacturers. Although the ICER of the lifetime leasing metho d exceeded the upper bound of the EoL range, the panel concluded that they may have looked more favourably on a CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 220 combined scheme involving a fixed price discount and a leasing element in the 'Bridge to HSCT' TPP. However, in the absence of being provided wi th a formal assessment of this scheme, the panel felt it was not possible to make a clear recommendation. The panel were less clear on potential recommendations across the different pricing schemes for the 'Curative Intent' TPP. Although the panel acknow ledged that the consequences of decision uncertainty were reduced by each of the alternative pricing approaches, the panel remained concerned at the scale of the consequences which remained. Again, the panel concluded that they may have looked more favourably on a combined scheme involving a fixed price discount and a leasing element but noted that they had not been presented with results from such a scenario. The panel were also aware that different prices were assumed ac ross the separate TPPs refl ecting the different effectiveness estimates reported in the different studies used in each. The panel indicated that if the same price that was used in the 'Bridge to HSCT ' TPP had been applied to the 'Curative Intent' TPP, this would have potentially si gnificantly improved the ICER and lowered the consequences of decision uncertainty. Faced with higher consequences in the 'Curative Intent' TPP, the panel concluded that the combination of using the same price in the 'Bridge to HSCT' and a leasing scheme would potentially improve the ICER and lower the consequences of decision uncertainty to a level which could potentially be acceptable. Again, in the absence of being provided with a formal assessment of such a scheme, the panel felt it was not possible to make a clear recommendation. The panel discussed the additional evidence sets that had been generated for each TPP (Scenarios 3 and 4). The panel acknowledged that these estimates were generated using a series of assumptions and hence remained subject to various additional uncertainties. However, the panel understood the principles which were being considered and that there were important differences across the evidence sets for the separate TPPs. The panel understood that the difference across the TPPs wa s primarily due to the use of an external surrogate relationship being used in 'Bridge to HSCT' TPP. The panel acknowledged that greater uncertainty could arise in situations where a robust surrogate relationship had not been demonstrated and that ensuring evidence is sufficiently robust (i.e. in terms of precision and/or maturity) for decision making would be an important consideration. T he panel noted that the consequences of decision uncertainty in the intermediate evidence set for the 'Curative Intent' TPPs were significantly reduced compared to the minimum evidence set and were closer to the scale of those reported for the minimum evidence set for the 'Bridge to HSCT' T PP where a surrogate relationship had been assumed. The panel understood that the sc ale of consequences was further reduced in the mature evidence sets due to increased precision (compared to the intermediate data set) and maturity (compared to CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 221 the minimum evidence set) and that this was most evident in the 'Curative Intent' TPP because additional surrogate evidence had not been included. The panel acknowledged the challenges and difficulties of generating mature evidence at the point a product is launched. However, the panel considered that the principles outlined through the different assessments would be important in informing future deliberations. In particular, the panel noted that a comparison of the magnitude of the incremental NHE and the consequences of decision uncertainty provided an important starting point for deliberations i n considering the scale of the NHE that could be achieved by immediate approval and that which might be achieved by further research. The panel noted that further assessments could be helpful to further inform: (i) whether a positive approval decision mig ht alter incentives to undertake the type of research necessary to resolve the main sources of uncertainty, and (ii) the full opportunity costs of approval and rejection decisions. The panel concluded that further information concerning the distribution of the consequences and further exploration of the main sources of these consequences would provide important additional information. Additional exploratory analyses undertaken after Panel discussion Following the panel meeting, a series of additional expl oratory analyses were undertaken to capture some of the specific requests and considerations that were identified during the panel discussions. These analyses are not intended to be comprehensive but rather to reflect on some of the main points raised and to consider any further implications. Information on the distribution of consequences is shown in Figure 30 based on the minimum evidence set of the Curative Intent TPP . The most common outcome (50.7%) is for CAR T -cell therapy to be cost -effective at a willingness to pay threshold of \u00a350,000. Consequently, there are no negative consequences to the NHS in these instances . However, in 49.3% of iterations (1 -proba bility of CAR T -cell therapy being cost -effective), the decision to recommend CAR T -cell therapy may be incorrect (at a willingness to pay t hreshold of \u00a350,000). The consequences of a making an incorrect decision is expressed in terms of the NHE's forgone. In this analysis, most of the negative consequences are less than 1 ,000 QALYs (probability of 36.4%). The probability that the negative consequences exceed 1 ,000 and 3 ,000 QALYs is 12.9%, and 0.1%, respectively. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 222 Figure 30: Distribution of the consequences of decision uncertainty The panel were also interested in exploring the impact of a number of alternative pricing schemes on the cost -effectiveness of CAR T -cell therapy and associated decision uncertainty. These schemes included the application of the 'B ridge to HSCT' fixed acquisition cost to the 'Curative Intent' TPP, as well as considering the impact of a lifetime leasing approach with or without a n additional 10% price discount . Applying both a lifetime leasing method and a 10% discount to the cost of CAR T -cells to the minimum evidence set analysis for the 'Curative Intent' TPP improved t he ICER (\u00a345,502 per QALY), resulting in a large decrease in the consequences of decision uncertainty and increase in the probability of cost -effectiveness, as shown in Table 42. Applying the 'Bridge to HSCT' fixed acquisition cost of CAR T -cell therapy (\u00a3356,100) to the minimum evidence set analysis for the 'Curative Intent' TPP significantly improved the cost - effectiveness of curative CAR T-cell therapy, resulting in an ICER of \u00a334,337 per QALY, as shown in Table 42. With improved cost -effectiveness, the expected consequences of decision uncertainty is also improved; decreasing from 304 QALYs (\u00a315m) in the base case to 73.1 QALYs (\u00a33.7m ). Applying a lifet ime leasing method resulted in further reductions to the consequences of decision uncertainty to 2.3 QALYs (\u00a30.11m). By applying a n additional 10% 600600 - 800800 - 10001000 - 28002800 - 30003000 - 3200Probability that decision is correct Expected consequences, QALY CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 223 and 'Bridge to HSCT' acquisition cost, it was possible to eliminate the potential consequences of decision uncertainty (at a willingness to pay threshold of \u00a350,000). These additional analyses further reinforce the importance of considering the implications both for t he ICER as well as the scale of the consequences of decision uncertainty. A key finding from these additional analyses is that the consequences of decision uncertainty related to the minimum evidence set can be significantly lowered by reductions in price or the application of alternative pricing schemes. Indeed the additional exploratory analysis reveal that the scale of the consequences might be reduced to a similar or even lower magnitude than that which could be resolved through the provision of furthe r evidence alone. Furthermore, by reducing the opportunity costs of early approval, increased flexibility in pricing and pricing approaches would allow more patients receive early access to potentially innovative regenerative medicines and cell -based thera pies.

Ideally, a systematic review sh ould be performed to evaluate the strength of the association between the surrogate and the patient -relevant outcome and the evidence on surrogate validation should be presented acc ording to an explicit hierarchy. Pivotal s tudy design and the use of histor ical control datasets For manufacturer submissions, consideration should be given to benefits of having recommendations and/or minimum reporting requirements on the methods used to obtain and analyse single -arm trial data when they are compared with histor ical control data. Where single -arm trial data form the main basis of an assessment, a clear rationale should be given for the type of comparisons made (implicit or explicit) and for the choice of the historical control data which were selected. For exampl e the gold standard for historical data might be matched data obtained from a patient database (rather than relying on published studies, which might not fit the trial population being studied well enough). Manufacturers should also consider the evidence o n the number of study sites when designing trials (multi -centre trials are likely to produce more reliable and generalizable results than single -centre trials). ERG's might benefit from using checklists to help when appraising how historical control data w ere identified and analysed by manufacturers. Efficacy estimates Submission of IPD might be beneficial for ERGs, especially where datasets are small. Use of multivariate meta -analysis can lead to reduced uncertainty around the effectiveness parameter. By allowing all the relevant data to be incorporated in estimating clinical effectiveness outcomes - including data from surrogate outcomes - multivariate meta -analysis can improve the estimation of health utilities through mapping methods. Manufacturers shoul d report the data for the full trial population. i.e. all eligible patients including patients who died before they could receive treatment and patients for which a bespoke (autologous) treatment could not be produced. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 226 The role of any f urther mandatory tr ial evidence Manufacturers should provide details of mandated further studies (e.g. those in relation to conditional approvals or approvals made via the EMA's adaptive pathways approach ). Future r eports from the ADAPT SMART project should provide details about how the use of development plan s across target populations being agreed up -front with EMA is working . Guidance may be needed regarding methodological approaches to utilising 'confirmatory' trial data in a related indication to update the decision NICE made for the origin al indication. Consideration is also needed regarding the precise role NICE will play in EMA adaptive pathways process es. For example, what will be the m echanisms by which the EMA update s NICE with new efficacy and saf ety data for conditionally -approved ATMPs (in a timely way), and how will NICE deal w ith the new data (process -wise)? Extrapolation approaches Given the inevitable uncertainties which are likely to exist regarding the longer -term benefits of regenerative medicines and cell -based therapies, further methodological research could be usefully undertaken to help inform how these uncertainties might be appropriately quantified in a transparent manner to inform cost-effectiveness analyses . Further research may be particularly helpful to determine the appropriateness of alternative survival modelling approaches to regenerative medicines and cell -based the rapies, including more flexible survival models and cure fraction models . The level of data maturity is an important factor in deriving robust survival pro jections that are required for cost -effectiveness assessments. When follow -up is immature, a single 'best -fitting' survival distribution may not adequately characterise uncertainties over the longer -term extrapolation period. Although the robustness of the ICER estimates to alternative distributions can be explored through separate sensitivity analyses or scenario s, the tran sparency of the process may be impacted if the weighting of these is not explicitly considered in subsequent policy decisions . The feasibility and appropriateness of model -averaging approaches may also need to be more formally considered. The advantage of these approaches is that the parametric uncertainty associated within each distribution and the uncertainty (or weights) surr ounding the choice of preferred method can be more explicitly characterised. However, given the potential complexity in both undertaking these analyses and communicating the results, efforts will need to be made to ensure models are developed to ensure tha t informal judgements can be explicitly incorporated in a timely and transparent manner. Irrecoverable costs and possible learning curve effects Given the complexity of the overall process of care that may be required for regenerative medicines and cell -based therapies, manufacturers will need to clearly report the resource and cost assumptions CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 227 of the different process to determine whether the full costs to the NHS have been included and any aspects where uncertainties may exist . Issues of irrecoverable co sts may need to be more formally considered, particularly if a new technology could impose additional infrastructure requirements on the health system. If reimbursement decisions about the technology change before the end of the lifetime of the equipment ( e.g. approval is withdrawn), then these costs may not be recovered and hence need to be explicitly considered. The existence and possible impact of learning curves may also be as an important issue for clinical and cost -effectiveness assessments. Althoug h the existence of learning curves has received attention in the clini cal literature, the relevance of recent work in this area in the context of assessing the cost - effectiveness of medical devices should be considered.92 Quantification of decision uncertainty Presentation of the scale of the consequences of decision uncertainty using population NHE may provide an important additional approach to quantifying decision uncertainty to the assessments already routinely specified with the exiting TA methods guide. The implications of existing research88and ongoing research by the DSU will also need to be considered by NICE to determine whether further changes to their processes or methods may be helpful for informing the nature of any additional assessments that may be required. Such assessments could provide a more tra nsparent and explicit b asis for discussions between manufacturers, NICE and other relevant stakeholders in terms of how the existing uncertainties that exist might be appropriately managed , ensuring risks and benefits are more appropriately shared. Broader consideration will also need to be given to approaches which may extend beyond NICE's existing remit e.g. alternative payment schemes . Consequently other bodies and manufacturers themselves may also have an important role in identifying more innova tive approaches to seeking reimbursement which recognise the inherent uncertainties and lead to a more efficient sharing of associated risk. Existing criteria NICE's existing processes also make separate provision for specific disease and technology charac teristics which may be relevant to many regenerative medicines and cell therapies. Although NICE' s current end of life criteria allows the Com mittee to explore a QALY weighting that is different from that of the reference case , the appropriateness of this criteria may need to be considered in relation to treatments which have curative potential . Further methodological research may also be important to determine whether an alternative weighting approach might be more appropriate for curative therapies . Exist ing research has identified a potential disconnect between individual and CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 228 societal preferences concerning valuation of treatment versus preventive interventions. Further research more specifically focused on the concept of cure may provide important additi onal insights. Although the NICE methods guide permits the use of a non -reference -case discount to be applied in specific contexts, it remains unclear whether regenerative med icines and cell therapies would meet the existing criteria (e.g. uncertainties ov er the projected benefits and/or potentially significant irrecoverable costs) . Consequently, NICE may need to provide additional guidance to ensure that manufacturers understand the likelihood of meeting these criteria.

The indication for which a licence was granted is more restricted: \"Glybera is indicated for adult patients diagnosed with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD) and suffering from at l east one pancreatitis episode despite dietary fat restriction. The diagnosis of LPLD has to be confirmed by genetic testing. The indication is restricted to patients with detectable levels of LPL protein.\" Orphan status ? Yes Is this a rare condition? The calculated prevalence of this condition was reported to be 0.02 per 10,000 . What is the natural history of the disease without this treatment/ with current treatment ? LPLD is a rare autosomal recessive inherited condition caused by homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for mutations in the LPL gene. The conditio n may only become evident after several episodes of pancreatitis in adolescence or adulthood. Laboratory investigation reveal s genuine lactescent plasma (lipemia) due to the increased CM concentrations. The symptom severity is proportional to the degre e of chylomicronemia and the most severe complication associated with LPLD is pancreatitis. Pancreatitis in an LPLD subject may le ad to admission to an intensive care unit. In severe cases, patients may eventually develop chronic pancreatitis, ultimately resul ting in endocrine and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Treatment of LPLD patients currently consists of severe reductions in dietary fat to less than 20% of caloric intake. Complia nce with this dietary regimen is very difficult, and even with good compl iance, the diet is often ineffective at reducing chylomicronemia and triglyceride levels. Currently no triglyceride -lowering drug is available. Enzyme replacement therapy is not expected to be effective, due to the short intravascular half -life of the LPL protein. Nature of the medicine How does it work? Glybera is a replication -deficient adeno -associated viral vector designed to deliver and express the human LPL gene variant LPLS447X. Transduction of part of the skeletal muscle mass is expected to restore a level of LPL activity which is sufficient to hydrol yse the triglyceride - rich lipoproteins, and influence lipid homoeostasis, and thus lead to clinical improvement or stabilisation. Is it claiming to meet an otherwise unmet need? Yes, the therapeutic aim of Glybera was to control symptoms of LPLD, and to preve nt complications in adult patients clinically diagnosed with LPLD. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 242 How is it given? A sterile solution for injection presented as single use vials. Each vial contains 3 x 1012 genomic copies alipogene in 1ml te based formulation buffer containing 5% sucrose. Glybera is to be administered once at multiple sites intramuscularly at a dose of 1 x 1012 gc per kg body weight. Note Glybera is intended as a single procedure but with multiple injections (up to 60 injec tion sites) administered under regional or spinal anaesthesia. All 27 patients reported adverse events related to the injecti on procedure. Are there any comparator treatments? Reducing chylomicronemia and triglyceride levels by reducing dietary fat to les s than 20% of caloric intake. Is there any mention of the intervention evolving over time? The applicant uses two different company codes to differentiate between the current production system, AMT -011, versus the previous production system, which is refe rred to as AMT -010. There were changes during the development phases but CHMP felt issues relating to these had been resolved and 'consistency of product quality throughout development has been shown.' Is there any mention of persistence of the treatment within the patient Negative persistence - It is considered that although recom binant adeno -associated virus ( rAAV ) has potential integration risk, the risk of a consequent cancer is minimal. In the context of treating patients with this disease, these data suggest an acceptable safety profile. Overall, the CAT and CHMP agreed that the data do not substantiate a conce rn for tumourigenicity. Positive persistence - The post treatment observation period was insufficient to conclude on a rate of change of pancreatitis event long term. The totality of evidence derived from all studies combined suggested AMT -011 may tempora rily reduce mean fasting TG levels but the proposed single treatment was insufficient to provide a durable and measurable effect. Trial Design Trial description Study number Dose (gc/kg) Number of patients Duration of monitoring Duration of follow -up Status PREPARATION - 01 None 18 13 - 78 weeks - Completed AMT -010-01 1 x 1011 3 x 1011 4 4 12 weeks 5 years Active phase completed, follow - up ongoing PREPARATION - 02 None 22 2 - 83 weeks - Completed AMT -011-01 3 x 1011 1 x 1012 6 8 12 weeks 5 years Active phase completed, follow - up ongoing AMT -011-02 1 x 1012 5 18 weeks (incl. 4 weeks run-in) 1 year Completed There were two observational preparation studies to collect baseline data (no treatment control). Glybera was studied in three uncontrolled, open -label interventional of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 243 a combined total n=27. Three different dose a safety and efficacy trial, initially planned as a controlled study it was subsequently amended to an uncontrolled st udy due to difficultie s in identifying patients with high baseline risk of pancreatitis. It should be noted that a different Glybera product was us ed in the AMT -010 and AMT -011 trials due to a change in the manufacturing process. The first cohort in the AMT -011 trials (n=2 subj ects) was administered 3 x 1011 gc/kg of AMT -011 to serve as a bridging arm to gauge similarity of the safety and efficacy of AMT -011 relative to AMT -010. CT-AMT bination A (3 mg/kg/day) and mycophenolate mofetil (2 g/day) which was given over 12 weeks. CT -AMT -011-02 had a modified regimen the same as CT-AMT -011-01 but also included a single bolus of methylprednisolone (single IV bolus 1mg/kg) half an hour before AMT -011 administration. Efficacy was assessed over 12 weeks, with long term follow up planned for 5 years. The analysis of pancreatitis events was attempted post -hoc by examining the number of events or admissions to ICU retrospectively as this was not a pre -specified analysis. Trial population (adults/children/all?); any further specifics of disease not covered in 'indication'? Preparation 01; 18 LPL -deficient patients 18 yrs with type I hyperchylomicronaemia, post -heparin LPL activity <25% of normal level, plasma concentrations of TG >95th percentile for age and gender. Seventeen subjects completed the study, 1 subject died of a cardiac arrest. AMT -010-01; 8/18 Patients from Preparation 01 cohort with confirmed homozygotic and compoun d heterozygotic LPL gene mutations. Preparation -02 ; 22 subjects with LPLD, lipoprotein lipase activity 20 % of normal, LPL mass > 5 % of normal and fasting plasma TG concentrations > 10 mmol/l. Twenty subjects completed the study, 2 subjects withdrew. AMT -011-01; 15/22 subjects from Preparation -02, 1 subject was withdrawn thus 14 subjects entered the study long term. Follow up extended up to 5 years. AMT -011-02; 5 pts enrolled to examine pp -CM metabolism, fasting TG, serum LPL activity, pancreatitis. 1 patient only provided data. Trial size/ Total trial population? Combined total n=27 Length of follow up? See table above Control/comparator used? The two obser vational studies (Preparation -01 and Preparation -02) that included patients receiving only diet reduction and no active treatment, acted as the control for the active treatment studies. NB some patients (not all) from Prep 1 and 2 went into the active tre atment studies. How is the control/comparator constructed? See previous section Outcomes Response outcome 1 Prep studies - Fasting plasma TG levels and disease complications in LPL deficient subjects on a low -fat diet. Active treatment studies - Across the three studies a measure of the reduction in fasting plasma triglyceride levels was a primary and secondary outcome: a reduction to < 10 mmol/l or to 40% of starting level. Decrease fasting plasma TG. Response outcome 2 Prep studies - To record the incidence of pancreatic events in the context of the safety evaluation. Active treatment studies - A reduction in frequency and/or severity of clinical signs and symptoms related to LPL deficiency (i.e. eruptive CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 244 xanthomas, lipaemia retinalis, pancreati tis, episodes of abdominal pain, plasma lactescence, lack of energy/fatigue and QoL and diabetes management). The incidence of pancreatitis was the most clinically meaningful endpoint. Response outcome 3 Other measures of the effect of active treatment, e.g. clearance of chylomicrons and other determinants of the biological activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPLS447X) transgene product. Adverse events Overall, Glybera was well tolerated by all patients during initial 12 week observational period and during long-term phase of observation (up to 3 years with AMT -010 01 ). All reactions were self -limiting and mild in nature. There were no obvious serious adverse events seemingly related to Glybera. Surrogate or intermediate clinical outcome? Yes/No Yes. The eff ect on lipid profiles, such as a reduction in fasting triglycerides to <10 mmol/l, a >40% reduction in fasting triglycerides are surrogate markers of lipoprotein lipase activity related clinical benefit. A reduction in post -prandial chylomicronemia has bee n proposed as an alternative surrogate marker and subject to clinical validation a reduction in post -prandial CM could be accepted as a surrogate marker for efficacy. Real clinical outcome? Yes/No Yes (a reduction of pancreatitis events was suggested usi ng retrospective data) Summary of efficacy evidence Overall evidence base provided AMT -011-02; is the only study yielding data allowing the possibility to make a link between surrogate and clinical endpoints (pp -CM metabolism, fasting TG, serum LPL activity, pancreatitis). Only one patient out of 5 responded to the treatment. The presented dataset in relation to the restricted indication includes 12 out of 27 patients treated with Glybera, aged 40 -70 years of age and diagnosed with LPLD condition rel atively late in life. The reduction in post -prandial chylomicronemia as an alternative surrogate marker for efficacy, although not at present validated, was considered biologically plausible and acceptable. The data on pancreatitis remain very limited and in a very small number of patients (12 patients) with limitations acknowledged in the statistical analysis. In summary, the evidence generated by the reduction of pancreatitis events and severity of attacks, although hampered by stat istical limitations and by fluctuations in the occurrence of pancreatitis, suggested that Glybera leads to a clinically relevant reduction of pancr eatitis risk at least in some patients. This is also supported by the reduction in hospital admissions and ICU stay. Of particular note is the fact that while about half of 17 patients required an ICU stay due to pancreatitis before treatment, no ICU stay was recorded in the same patients after tr eatment, as compared to non -treated patients. Estimate of effect HrQoL? The reduction i n SF36 scores (those from both the physical functioning and mental domains) in 3 out of 5 patients from CT -AMT -011-02 study at week 14 following treatment was of major concern. The applicant explained the QoL reduction by adverse events and immunosuppressi on. However the data on Quality of Life from later time -points (up to week 52) and from all other studies conducted with Glybera are not available. Other issues Any issues of scale -up for the product? 1. During the development of the AMT -011 process a number of changes have been made during scale up. 2. A two -tiered system has been established for commercial DS production based on a Master and Working Cell Bank (MCB, WCB) and Master and Working Viral Seed Stock (MSV, WSV). Is further evidence requested fo r approval? 1. The MAH shall set up a long term surveillance programme/ disease register before launch of the product in each country to col lect information on the epidemiology of the disease and the demographics, safety, and the effectiveness outcomes of pat ients treated with Glybera. The patients enrolled in clinical should be followed up in the LPLD registry. 2. Assessment of postprandial chylomicron metabolism in at least 12 patients before and 12 months after treatment with Glybera to be chosen in addition to the patients included in study AMT.011.02; and eight healthy subjects in the second cohort. Assessment of immu ne response at baseline, 6 months and 12 months in at least 12 newly treated patients. T he study should start by July 2013 and should enrol at least 4 patients per year. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 245 3. Re-evaluation of immune responses from all patients enrolled in study CT -AMT -011-01 by using a validated assay method should also be provided. 4. To improve the virus safety pro file of the product 5. To complete the validation of the residual infectious baculovirus assay Notes Given the rarity of LPLD (prevalence in the EU: 2:1000000), the uncontrolled study design applied in all 3 clinical trials using subjects as their own control was accepted and in line with the scientific advice given. Development of studies was hampered by difficulties in recruitment of sufficient numbers of patients. The SAG considered that it is not possible to exclude completely the hypothesis that the reduction in the incidence of pancreatitis in some patients is due to the inherent temporal rarity of pancreatitis events. Issues inherent to retrospective data assessment in c omparison to prospective data were highlighted by the CAT. Across the three active treatment trials the primary and secondary outcomes were not the same CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 246 MACI - matrix applied characterised autologous cultured chondrocyte implant EMA Assessment 2013 (CHMP and CAT), NICE MTA 2014 EMA m arketing authorisation in April 2013 which was subsequently suspended in September 2014 (an authorised manufacturing site no longer existed) Nature of the Disease Indication MACI is to be used in skeletally mature patients for the repair of symptomatic cartilage defects of the knee (grade III and IV of the arthroscopic staging of osteochondral lesions as described by the Modified Outerbridge Scale). Orphan status No Is this a rare condition? No. Cartilage injuries were observed 5 -11% of diagnostic knee arthroscopies in predominantly young adult populations with knee pain. What is the natural history of the disease without this treatment/ with current treatment Cartilage defects of the knee occur along a spectrum of disease and severity. Larger, more chronic lesions are often symptomatic, may contribute to joint misalignment and can cause disabling symptoms such as pain, catching, locking, and swelling. Focal chondr al lesions that are left untreated may progress to debilitating joint pain, dysfunction and degenerative art hritis. Nature of the medicine How does it work? It is the first advanced -therapy medicine to be combined with a medical device, in this case where the cells are embedded in a biodegradable matrix. It attempts to generate hyaline or hyaline -like cartilag e. ACI requires two surgical procedures, first to harvest autologous chondrocytes, which are then grown extra -corporeally, and then to transplant the cultivated cells back into the lesions. The benefit of ACI over other restoration techniques is that large r lesions can be treated. Is it claiming to meet an otherwise unmet need? No, other treatment options (such as microfracture) exist and clinical practice varies. How is it given? Autologous chondrocytes are seeded onto a collagen membrane of porcine origin, which is secured into the lesion with fibrin glue. At implantation, the membrane is trimmed to the correct size and shape, and implanted cell -side down into the base of the defect; the implant is secured in place using fibrin sealant. The recommend ed dose of MACI implant is 500,000 to 1 million cells per cm2 of defect. The dose is the same for all patients, regardless of age. Are there any comparator treatments? Repair techniques such as microfracture aim at marrow stimulation and induce the format ion of fibrocartilage repair tissue to treat patients with focal chondral defects in the knee. These techniques penetrate the subchondral bone and cause release of marrow components into the defect site. The reparative response produced from these procedur es is one that may generate primarily fibro -cartilage. Single -stage restoration techniques such as osteochondral autograft, mosaicplasty, and osteochondral allograft attempt to replace th e cartilage defect with host or donor articular cartilage. Is there any mention of the intervention evolving over time? Yes - MACI is a third generation ACI product. ERG report (for NICE): \"There is a general problem when long -term results are needed but the technology continues to evolve.\" CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 247 Is there any mention of persistence of the treatment within the patient In concept, the MACI implant would contribute to the repair of articular cartilage defects through proliferation of seeded ch ondrocytes, resulting in synthesis of hyaline -like repair tissue. Trial Design Trial description The clinical data consist of the pivotal trial \"SUMMIT\" (MACI00206) supported by several clinical studies reported from the literature. The Academia studies were small -scale, non -randomised prospective studies SUMMIT - Superiority of MACI Versus Microfracture Treatment Trial Multi -centre, randomised, open -label parallel -group trial. The aim of this trial was to demonstrate the superiority of MACI implant versus arthroscopic microfracture for the treatment of s ymptomatic articular cartilage defects of the femoral condyle, including the trochlea. Trial population (adults/children/all?); any further specifics of disease not covered in 'indication'? MACI00206 Male and female patients between the ages of 18 and 55 years (inclusive), with at least 1 symptomatic outerbridge grade III or IV focal cartilage defect on the femoral condyle (MFC), lateral femoral condyle (LFC) and/or trochlea size equal to or greater th an 3.0 cm2 irrespective of location. Trial size/ Total trial population? 144 patients 72 patients MACI/ 72 patients microfracture Length of follow up? 2 year follow up data already collected from the MACI00206 s tudy (5 year follow up planned) Control/comparator used? Microfracture treatment How is the control/comparator constructed? s Response outcome 1 Co-primary endpoint of KOOS (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) for Pain and Function (sports and recreational activi ties). Response outcome 2 Secondary endpoints Histology of cartilage forming (Histological evaluation of structural repair of evaluable biopsies harvested from the core of the index lesion during arthroscopy). Response outcome 3 MRI of cartilage - MRI assessments of structural repair parameters. Adverse events Most AEs were thought to be surgery related, rather than product related. Surrogate or intermediate clinical outcome? Yes - Structural and functional repair of cartilage defects as measured by MRI or histology scoring Real clinical outcome? Yes - Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Summary of evidence Overall evidence base provided A clinically and statistically significant difference in the improvement from baseline to Week 104 was seen for the co -primary endpoint of CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 248 KOOS (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) for Pain and Function in patients treated with MACI over the comp arator (p=0.001). Significantly more patients treated with MACI (87.50%) met the responder analysis criteria than patients treated with microfr acture (68.06%), which is considered clinically relevant. The primary efficacy endpoint was corroborated by sev eral other patient reported outcome measures and a responder analysis of the primary efficacy measures demonstrated superior clinical efficacy for patients treated with MACI compared to microfracture. Estimate of HrQoL? Knee -related quality of life is one of the 5 key dimensions of KOOS, although the NICE report highlighted the 'lack of good qualit y of life data'. Other issues Any issues of scale -up for the product? The manufacture of the product is patient -specific (autologous). Production will be centralised at one site. Is further evidence requested for EMA/FDA approval? 1. As part of the ongoing monitoring of MACI, the Agency requested the 5 -year follow -up data from the main clinical study, which will provide information on the sustainability of the cartilage repair and maintenance of effect of MACI compared to microfracture over time, as well as the long -term safety of the medicine. 2. Periodic safety updates report for this product within 6 months following authorisation and a risk management plan. 3. Education pack for surgeons Any additional information provided? 1. The applican t sought advice from the EMA/CHMP regarding the design of the trial. 2. MACI has now been recommended for licensing as the first advanced -therapy medicine to be combined with a medical device. 3. Surgical skill was identified as being an important issue; MACI will likely only be available from a few specialised centres. The marketing authorisation for MACI was suspended in September 2014 as an authorised manufacturing site no longer existed (t he developer closed the site). CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 249 ChondroCelect - Characterised viable autologous cartilage cells expanded ex vivo expressing specific marker proteins EMA Assessment 2009, NICE MTA 2014 EMA marketing authorisation Nature of the Disease Indication The indication for ChondroCelect is repair of single symptomatic cartilaginous defects of the femoral condyle of the knee (International Cartilage Repair Society grade III or IV) in adults. Orphan status No Is this a rare condition? No What is the natural history of the disease without th is treatment/ with current treatment ? The healing capacity of articular cartilage is poor and damaged articular cartilage is thought to be a precursor to the devel opment of osteoarthritis. Damaged articular cartilage can result in pain, loss of joint funct ion and disability. An early intervention on symptomatic cartilage lesions may prevent or delay irreversible changes in the joint surface. Currently, there is no uniform approach to managing significant knee cartilage defects. Nature of the medicine How does it work? ChondroCelect is a suspension of approximately 10,000 autologous cartilage cells per microlitre of medium for autologous use. The cells have been obtained by ex vivo expansion of chondrocytes isolated from a biopsy of the articular cartilage from the patient's knee. The active substance is a centrifuged pellet of 4 to 12 million cells that were expanded ex vivo, harvested and washed. The expansion process is designed to preserve the integrity and function of the cells and particularly to main tain the cells' ability to produce hyaline cartilage. Is it claiming to meet an otherwise unmet need? No. Other treatment options exist, and clinical practice varies. How is it given? In the first step a cartilage biopsy is obtained arthroscopically from healthy articular cartilage from a lesser weight bearing area of the patient's knee, approximately 4 weeks prior to implantation. Chondrocytes are isolated from the biopsy by enzymatic digestion, expanded in vitro , characterised and delivered as a suspens ion of 1 x 104 cells/l for implantation in the same patient. During the second step of the procedure the expanded chondrocyte suspension is implanted during open -knee surgery. Are there any comparator treatments? Repair techniques such as microfracture a im at marrow stimulation and induce the formation of fibrocartilage repair tissue to treat patients with focal chondral defects in the knee. These techniques penetrate the subchondral bone and cause release of marrow components into the defect site. The re parative response produced from these procedures is one that may generate primarily fibro -cartilage. Single -stage restoration techniques such as osteochondral autograft, mosaicplasty, and osteochondral allograft attempt to replace th e cartilage defect with host or donor articular cartilage. Is there any mention of the intervention evolving over time? Yes - ChondroCelect is a third generation ACI (autologous chondrocyte implantation) product. Is there any mention of persistence of the treatment within the patient Implanted cells become a structural part of newly formed cartilage. Trial Design Trial description Study TIG/ACT/01/2000 is a phase III, multicentre, randomized, controlled trial to compare ChondroCelect to microfracture in the repair of symptomatic single cartilaginous lesions of the femoral condyles of the knee. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 250 Supportive study: Prospective, long -term follow -up study of patients in the Belgian Armed Forces treated with ChondroCelect (TIG/ACT/02) Trial population (adults/children/all?); any further specifics of disease not covered in 'indication'? TIG/ACT/01/2000 Patients aged between 18 and 50 years , who had a single symptomatic cartilage lesion between 1 -5cm2 of the femoral condyles met the inclusion criteria. TIG/ACT/02; This study is a prospective, non -comparative, open -label study of 2 to 5 years' duration in 20 patients with single and multiple symptomatic cartilage defects, in any location of the knee, who underwent CCI using ChondroCelect. Trial size/ Total trial microfracture TIG/ACT/02; Of all reported lesions, 80% were reported to be of ICRS Grade III or IV. Of 24 femoral lesions reported in 19 patients, 21 were treated with CCI. Length of follow up? TIG/ACT/01/2000 = 12 months extended to 36 months for AEs TIG/ACT/02 = 5 years Control/compa rator used? Microfracture is considered an effective standard treatment for smaller femoral cartilage lesions according to currently avai lable literature data, and is an acceptable control therapy. How is the control/comparator constructed? Source of comparative data? Confounding? RCT Outcome s Response outcome 1 Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Response outcome 2 Structural repair Adverse events The overall safety summary showed that the main difference in t reatment related adverse events compared to microfracture was related to the open knee surgery (arthr otomy) which caused an increase in joint swelling and possible joint effusion. Cartilage hypert rophy can be reduced by using a biomembrane to cover the les ion, and will therefore not pose a major safety concern in future applications of ChondroCelect. However, a higher number of patients in the microfracture arm have a treatment failure and require a subsequent surgical intervention. Th erefore the short and long term complication rate is not higher for ChondroCelect compared to microfracture. Surrogate or intermediate clinical outcome? Yes/No Yes, structural repair (histological analysis). Real clinical outcome? Yes/No Yes (KOOS) Summary of efficacy eviden ce Overall evidence base provided The mean change in overall KOOS from baseline to the average of 12 to 18 months was slightly higher for patients in the Chond roCelect group than for patients in the microfracture group. The results fulfil the predefined c riteria for non -inferiority and changes are clinically relevant. Results of the histological analysis of structural repair at 12 months favoured ChondroCelect and the difference was statisti cally significant for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. It was, however, acknowledged that this end point was not i n compliance with GCP as it was developed during the conduct of the study as the original a priori determined primary efficacy point was considered as invalid. Estimate/ measure of effect (e.g. HrQoL) Knee -related quality of life is one of the 5 key dimensions of KOOS, although the NICE report highlighted the 'lack of good qualit y of life data'.

CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 252 Holoclar (Ex vivo expanded autologous human corneal epithelial cells containing stem cells ) EMA Assessment 2014 (CHMP ,CAT, COMP) EMA c onditional marketing authorisation Nature of the Disease Indication Corneal lesions, with associated (limbal) stem cell deficiency, due to ocular burns. The clinical spectrum of limbal stem cell defici ency (LSCD) includes pain, photophobia, inflammation, corneal neovascularisation, and eventually, the reduction or complete loss of visual acuity. Orphan status Designated as an orphan medicinal product (2008) in the following indications: Corne al lesions, with associated (limbal) stem cell deficiency due to ocular burns. Is this a rare condition? The condition is considered to be rare with an estimated prevalence of 0.34 per 10,000 . What is the natural history of the disease without this treatment/ with current treatment If left untreated, the condition may progress to a stage whereby persistent epithelial defects present with an associated high risk for the development of bacterial keratitis, corneal perforation and blindness. Nature of the medicine How does it work? Holoclar is specifically 'Ex -vivo expanded autologous human corneal epithelial cells containing stem cells' and replaces damaged corneal epithelium cells and creates a reservoir of limbic stem cells (LSC) in LSC deficient areas of the cornea for continuous regen eration. Transparent circular sheet of living t issue containing autologous human corneal epithelial cells, limbal stem cells and derived transient amplifying cells. Is it claiming to meet an otherwise unmet need? Yes the product claims to respond to an unmet medical need by providing a new active subs tance to treat patients with irreversible and extensive damage as a result of an ocular burn. At the time of application, no medicinal products had been approved in the Eu ropean Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) for this indication and there was no gol d-standard in treatment. How is it given? Single topical placement without systemic effect Are there any comparator treatments? Limbal allografts which have associated risk of rejection and which require long -term systemic immunosuppression. Non-expanded limbal autografts from the healthy fellow eye which may lead to iatrogenic induction of LSCD in the donor eye Is there any mention of the intervention evolving over time?' No Is there any mention of persistence of the treatment within the pa tient (keyword search)? Negative effects of persistence - Possible risks include systemic distribution of cells derived from Holoclar that are tumour forming, accelerated immune response or transmission of adventitious agents. The cells are not expected to migrate beyond the ocular surface, or to produce systemic effects. Tumourigenicity was investigated in -vivo and results suggested a low risk. Positive effects of persistence - Some information on the potential for biodistribution was derived from a histor ical dataset. Data from a histological and morphological evaluation of corneal material collected from 26 patients who had undergone perforating kerato plasty post limbal stem cell transplantation with Holoclar.Available long -term follow up data up to 10 ye ars after ACLSCT, though limited, supported persistence of treatment success beyond 12 months. Additional long -term efficacy data will be collected in the margins of a post -authorisation safety study to confirm this outcome.

HLSTM01 1998 HLSTM02 1998 -2007 HLSTM04 2008 -2013 Trial population (adults/children/all?); any further specifics of disease not covered in 'indication'? Male or female with moderate/severe LSCD Median age 49, mostly adults Male or female Median age 43.5 , mostly adults 15 patients treated from 2008 (from additional centres not originally provided as a part of HLSTM01) Trial size/ Total trial population? 104 patients with moderate/severe LSCD 2 centres 29 patients with moderate/severe LSCD 7 centres 15 patients with moderate/severe LSCD 3 centres Length of follow up? 12months post intervention assessment, max 10 year follow up. 28% pts 1 -2 years, 22% pts 2 - 3 years, 12% pts for 5 years or more to a maximum of 10 years post transplantation. After year 5, only 5 patients had long term follow -up, of which 4 were reported as continued treatment success. Control/comparator used? (i .e. what were the results compared to for validation such as improvement compared to no treatment or historical trials using a different treatment) Patients acted as their own controls - outcomes were compared with baseline data. How is the control/compa rator constructed? Source of comparative data? Confounding? See above. The a ssumption that the condition would not heal was accepted - so any healing could be ascribed to Holoclar. Outcome Response outcome 1 Successful transplant at 12 months based on the co -presence of clinical signs (i) a superficial corneal neovascularisation classified as 'NONE' or 'MILD' and (ii) epithelial defects classified as 'NONE' or 'TRACE' Response outcome 2 Symptomatic relief (pain, burning, photophobia) Response outcome 3 Improvement in visual acuity or visual stabilisation at month 12 verses baseline Surrogate or intermediate clinical outcome? Yes - Corneal epithelial integrity and Absence of significant corneal neovascularisation Real clinical outcome? Yes - Improved Visual acuity Adverse events Eye-related disorders were the most commonly observed adverse events occurring in 57% of the safety population. Overall the rate of serious adverse events was low. Out of a total of 11 SAEs, three were judged as rel ated to administration of Holoclar . Summary of efficacy evidence Overall evidence base provided 1. Significant decrease (p<0.001) in ocular symptoms (reduction from 40 pts to 12pts with ocular symptoms) 2. No change in inflammation by the 12 month endpoint, 32 pre -surgical pts to 33 post -surgical pts. 3. Superficial corneal neovascularisation (CNV) evaluated before and after the transplantation, 73.1% of patients showed an impr ovement at 12 months post transpl antation, and a significant decrease in CNV from baseline to 12 months post -surgery (p<0.001) 4. 83.6% showed a reduced epithelial defect of none or trace. 5. An improvement in visual acuity was noted in 51 (49%) of patients. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 254 6. The majority of patients required on ly one transplant for a successful outcome 7. Persistent success of limbal cell transplantation after keratoplasty, 14 patients had one prior transplantation & 2 patients had 2 previous transplants. 8. 57 pts had keratoplasty subsequent to the Holoclar graft and success was achieved in 24 pts. 9. The results of impression cytology in a subset of patients in the pivotal studies, showed an increase of the percentage of ke ratinocytes and a decrease of the percentage of conjunctival cells after Holoclar treatment, thus providing evidence that Holoclar enables corneal type epithelialisation of the ocular surface and exerts a regenerative effect. Estimate of HrQoL Not assessed Other issues Any issues of scale -up for the product? Clinical success depends on factors unique to cell therapies, including manufacturing procedures, clinical and pharmacologic standardization of protocols, and regulation. Manufacture of the active substance is patient -specific and the manufacturing process is state -of-the-art and highly complex. As such the applicant implemented a training program for surgeons to ensure collection of seed material, and a struc tured approach to manufacturing comprising many monitored stages and sub -stage in -process controls (IPCs). The applicant was also required to provide further evidence on stability of the product (integrity and viability) and transport information. Is further evidence requested for EMA/FDA approval? A multinational, multicentre, prospective , open -label, uncontrolled interventional study to assess the efficacy and safety of autologous cultivated limbal stem cells grafting for restoration of corneal epithelium in patients with limbal stem cell deficiency due to ocular burns was required by December 2020. A major objection was raised with regard to the proliferation of irradiated cells and further validation was requested. Evide nce was provided in the form of a demonstration of several methods to show the irradiated cells do not proliferate. Paediatric application was deferred at time of submission pending further measures. Notes At the time of application more than 200 patients had already been treated with Holoclar in clinical practice since 1998, how ever many clinics declined the request to provide data. The assessors considered this may introduce bias but felt that the supporting literature and the similarity of the findings reported to those in the published articles provided some confidence in the numbers and therefore they were happ y to allow the data. Supportive data were also considered by the CAT from published articles and this appears to have a strong influence on the de cision making process, although only provided supportive information. As the condition was considered to have a low incidenc e the small sample size was considered to be acceptable. The CAT noted that at baseline the majority of patients already presented with no or only trace epithelial defects and as suc h already presented with a successful treatment outcome. However they cons idered that LSCD is a condition with impaired ability to maintain or restore an intact corneal epithelium so defects over the follow -up period were considered clinically relevant. The fact that the studies were uncontrolled and not randomised further added to the uncertainties of the validity of the dataset, but was considered inevitable due to the lack of a suitable comparator considering that there is neither an approved treatment for LS CD nor an ubiquitous accepted standard of care. Since this condition would not heal sp ontaneously, the single arm, un controlled design was considered acceptable by the CAT CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 255 Provenge (sipuleucel -T / Autologous peripheral blood mononuclear c ells activated with PAP -GM-CSF) EMA assessment 2013 (CAT and CHMP), NICE STA 2014, FDA assessment 2009 EMA marketing authorisation in June 2013 which was withdrawn in May 2015 at the request of the manufacturer for commercial reasons Nature of the Disease Indication Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic (non -visceral) hormone -relapsed prostate cancer in men for whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated. Orphan status ? No Is this a rare condition? Hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer affects around 5000 patients/year in the UK What is the natural history of the disease without this treatment/ with current treatment ? Asymptomatic patients have a median overall survival of 18 -24 months. Patients with symptomatic disease have a median OS of 9 -16 months. Nature of the medicine How does it work? Sipuleucel -T is an autologous active cellular immunotherapy product designed to stimulate an antigen (CD59) immune response to prostate cancer. Patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells are incubated with a recombinant fusion protein, the prostate protein prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP). Is it claiming to meet an otherwise unmet need? No How is it given? Following blood sampling leukapheresis is performed (day 1) after which Sipuleucel -T is manufactured at a central facility (days 2-3) and then infused into the patient (day 3 or 4). This process happens three times, at approximately two -week intervals. Are there any comparator treatments? Best supportive care (radiotherapy, bisphosphonates, steroid, analgesics, active surveillance) , abiraterone acetate Is there any mention of the intervention evolving over time? No Is there any mention of persistence of the treatment within the patient? No. The achievement and maintenance of the antigen response was assessed - maximum duration te sted was 26 weeks in one trial. There was no clear indication of whether or not persistence was required for benefit. No adverse effects related to persistence of anti gen response were mentioned.

As for IMPACT study As for IMPACT study How is the control/comparator constructed? Source of comparative data? Confounding? Following c onfirmation of disease progression, placebo patients could receive activated cells (i.e. very similar to Sipuleucel - T) derived from their cryopreserved cells. Open -label phase. As for IMPACT study As for IMPACT study Outcome s Response outcome 1 Overall survival Time to disease progression Time to disease progression Response outcome 2 Time to objective disease progression Overall survival Time to onset of disease -related pain Response outcome 3 Safety Time to objective disease progression Grade 3 AEs Surrogate or intermediate clinical outcome? Yes/No Time to progression. Antigen response was also measured. Note this did not correlate with OS results Real clinical outcome? Yes/No Overall survival Adverse events? Overall, the leukapheresis procedure and Provenge infusions were well tolerated. The main risks identified were acute infusion reactions, toxicities (e.g., citrate toxicity) associated with the leukapheresis procedure and infections (principally associated with c atheters). Treatment with Pro venge may lead to unwanted long term immunological effects in the body system. This potential risk is adequately addressed in the risk management plan. Additional data will become available to further characterise the long term safety profile of Provenge through registries . Summary of efficacy evidence Overall evidence base provided For the IMPACT trial: overall survival was significantly improved with Sipuleucel -T, HR 0.8 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.98, p=0.03) but there was no difference in time to objective dise ase progression HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.17, p=0.63). Two trials reported a significant advantage in OS favouring Sipuleucel -T, although no significant differences in time to disease progression was seen in any of the three trials. The RCTs had low risk o f bias, but only up to the point of disease progression, after which crossover from placebo to active was permitted. No analyses was performed to adjust for cross -over. Also the lack of significant effect on PfS may also have been due to a delay in effect. Estimate of HrQoL Not assessed Other issues Any issues of scale -up for the product? Yes, patient cells must be transferred from their local hospital to a central manufacturing facility, and then back again to the local hospital. The final product has a short shelf life. Is further evidence requested for approval? Periodic safety update reports Notes 13 members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMPs recommendation and the granting of a marketing authorisation. The objecti ons were based around whether the differences in OS resulted from a true and clinically relevant effect of Sipuleucel -T. The effect was neither supported by PFS nor time to progression results. Importantly, in case of disagreement between these outcomes the efficacy evidence sho uld be particularly convincing and ideally corroborated by other secondary endpoints, which was not the case . There was a lower proportion of patients treated with docetaxel in the placebo group and also delayed treatment with docetaxel in the placebo group (in the p ivotal trial) which CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 257 may have had an effect on OS. Confounding may also have been caused by the cr oss-over from placebo to an active treatment (Sipuleucel -T prepared from cryopreserved cells); as stated above, no analyses were performed to adjust for cross -over, and therefore the treatment effect may have been underestimated. 'Lack of consistency' b etween time to disease progression and overall survival, and possible confounding of the OS results by non -randomised post-progression, post -blinding treatment was also noted in the ERG report for NICE. A possible reason for the lack of association betwee n OS and time to progression was that current clinical metrics of progression assessed in bone are inadequate. Also, immune responses to may require time to develop and the lack of differences in progression could r esult from such a delayed anti -tumour res ponse. FDA analyses of docetaxel treatment following randomisation did not provide evidence that the survival difference between the two arms was attributable to the post -treatment of docetaxel. The FDA statistician based these analyses on the following a ssumption which was thought very likely to be true: more patients with good prognosis were in the placebo arm compared to the Sipuleucel -T arm in the subgroup receiving docetaxel. This implies that more patients with poor prognosis were in the placebo arm in the other subgroup in which patients did not receive docetaxel, since overall the two treatments were comparable. In May 2015 the EU marketing authorisation for Provenge was withdrawn at the request of the manufacturer (Dendreon) for comme rcial reasons . CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 258 ReCell Spray -on Skin system NICE Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme (MTEP) 2014 Authorisation granted in 2005 under medical devices Directiv e 93/42/EEC Nature of the Disease Indication Adults or children treated in b urns units or centres for: 1) partial thickness burns including scalds caused by hot water where mesh grafting is not required 2) large area burns; full thickness or deep partial thickness burns including where mesh grafting is required Orphan status No Is thi s a rare condition? No What is the natural history of the disease without this treatment/ with current treatment The treatment of burns can be considered in 2 phases: acute and reconstructive. The acute phase is the initial management of the injury with t he intention that burn wound healing will occur with minimal scarring and physical limitation. The reconstructive phase aims to improve th e functional or visual impact of scarring, usually by surgical means, and may be done months or years after the initia l injury. Full -thickness burns more than 1 cm in diameter need skin grafts because the regenerative components of the skin have been lost. Healing can occur only from the edges of the wound; without a graft the skin contracts, leading to a poor cosmetic ou tcome and reduced mobility. Deep dermal burns are unlikely to heal within 3 weeks and will therefore often need grafting. Nature of the medicine How does it work? ReCell is a stand -alone autologous cell harvesting device that enables a thin split-thickness skin biopsy to be processed to produce a mixed cell population for immediate delivery onto a prepared wound surface. Is it claiming to meet an otherwise unmet need? No How is it given? The ReCell device allows a small, thin split thicknes s shave biopsy to be physically and enzymatically broken down, yielding a viable suspension of mixed keratinocytes, fibroblasts and melanocytes that can be immediately sprayed or dripped on to the de -epithelialised area. The process is rapid - around 30 mi nutes - and does not require specialist skills or facilities to carry out. A cell suspension derived from a 1 sq uare cm biopsy is sufficient to treat an area of around 80 sq cm, making it particularly valuable for patients with limited available healthy do nor sites. Are there any comparator treatments? a) Partial thickness burns: Biosynthetic dressings, or Standard dressings b) Large area burns: Skin mesh graft alone, or Skin mesh graft plus biosynthetic dressing Is there any mention of the intervention evolving over time? No Is there any mention of persistence of the treatment within the patient? No Trial Design Trial description Eleven studies were included in the submission to NICE: 3 RCTs and 8 observational studies . Two of the RCTs were pilot studies with very small samples (13 and 14 each). All but one of the observational studies were also small (range 5 to 40 patients) case series. The two main studies are summarised below. Gravante et al 2 007 Park et al 2013 Single -centre RCT Retrospective cohort study (3 groups) Trial population (adults/children/all?); any further specifics of disease not covered in 'indication'? Adults with deep partial thickness burns (<320 cm2) Burns treated with skin grafting or replacement All ages CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 259 Trial size/ Total trial population? 82 767 Length of follow up? 6 months RCT: ReCell Spray -On Skin system plus standard skin graft, and standard skin graft alone How is the control/comparator constructed? RCT Both the intervention and the two comparators used historical data. Multiple regression was used although gender and type of burn agent were not included in the model input variables. Burn depth is greater in patients treated with standard skin graft than in patients treated with ReCell alone, although burn depth was controlled for in the multiple regression. Outcome s Response outcome 1 Time to complete epithelialisation Wound infection Response outcome 2 Aesthetic and functional quality of the scar Graft loss Response outcome 3 Wound infections Response outcome 4 Post-operative pain Surrogate or intermediate clinical outcome? Yes/No No No Real clinical outcome? Yes/No Yes Yes Adverse events None reported None reported Summary of efficacy evidence Overall evidence base provided The one RCT found ReCell and SSG to be comparable in terms of wound healing time and long -term aesthetics, but Recell was significantly less painful and the mean size of donor site was significantly smaller. These results were reflected in the one large cohort study, which a lso found no difference in terms of wound infection. The remaining evidence was supportive, indicating a range of patients who can be treated with ReCell. EAC concluded that ReCell may be a clinically suitable alternative to the use of split thickness skin grafts in mid -deep partial thickness burns. There was no clinical evidence examining the use of ReCell in partial thickness burns which are considered not to require skin grafting. There was also no evidence that demonstrated improved outcomes for the use of ReCell plus split thickness skin graft compared with split thickness skin graft alone. Estimate of effect HrQoL Not reported Other issues Any issues of scale -up for the product? No Is further evidence requested for approval? NICE concluded that, \"The ReCell Spray -On Skin system shows potential to improve healing in acute burns. However, there is insufficient evidence on its use in clinical practice, particularly in relation to which patients might benefit most from its use, to support the case for its routine ado ption in the NHS.\" NICE recommended research to address uncertainties about the claimed patient and system benefits of the ReCell Spray -On Skin system. Clinical outcomes should include time to 95% healing, length of hospital stay, cosmetic appearance of the scar and function of the bur ned area, compared with standard care. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 260 Notes Note within the NICE assessment The claimed benefits of ReCell in the cas e for adoption presented by the sponsor were: A reduction in the size and depth of the skin graft donor site. Shorter healing time, fewer complications and reduced morbidity at the donor site. Shorter healing time at the recipient site, leading to: improved aesthetic results for burn wound s, with a reduced likelihood of scarring reduced likelihood of later readmission to hospi tal for corrective surgery as a resul t of improved aesthetic results Repopulation of melan ocytes to reduce hypopigmentation and improve skin colour match in healed wounds. Reduced frequency of dressing changes to weekly rather than daily, allowing for a shorter stay in hospital and outpatient man agement. Reduced need for dressing changes under anaesthetic. A reduction in the need for externa l technical laboratory support. This long list of potential benefits was not supported by robust evidence. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 261 13.2 Appendix 2 : Adjustment for bias in non -randomised studies Adjustment for bias in NRS Methods developed to adjust effect estimates obtained from NRS for potential biases have taken two broad approaches: to adjust either at the study level, or as part of the process of evidence synthesis. These are discussed separately below. Adjusting for bias in the evidence synthesis process The review of the literature on methods to adjust for bias in the evidence synthesis process identifie d 10 relevant studies.156-165 These articles included two comprehensive reviews 156, 157and also individual articles all of which were identified in the review articles. Many of these techniques described in Verde et al.156 and Doi et al.157 however have limited applicability to regenerative medicine (i.e. where only limited evidence from a small number of studies is available), as they require significant numbers of studies or/ data from RCTs to be applied. A small number of these techniques can, however, be applied where only a single or small number of studies are available. These methods are outlined below. Adjusting using external data Welton et al. (2009)162 present a Bayesian hierarchical model to model bias in RCTs that are at high risk of bias. The authors developed a mixed effects model where treatment effects are considered as fixed and bias eff ect as random. Estimates of bias in any given meta -analysis are given as a function of prior d istribution, which is estimated from published meta -analysis of RCTs , and data from the current -analysis. Where a meta -analysis contains no information abou t the size and magnitude of the bias i.e. where there are only high risk studies the estimate of bias is based on the prior distribution alone. This method allows treatment effect estimates to include information from the high risk studies, accounting for the uncertainty in the magnitude of the bias in any particular meta - analysis. This technique was designed with adjustment of RCTs in mind but is extendable to the adjustment of NRS where by RCTs represent the low risk studies and NRS represent the high ris k studies. An appropriate library of meta -analyses combin ing data from RCTs and NRS would, however, be necessary to apply this technique. Elicitation Turner et al.165 recognizing the practical limitations of basing adjustment on external empirical data, propose an alternative approach in which the direction and magnitude of biases are elicited by reviewers. This method can deal with multiple sources and types of bias including both internal validity bias an d external validity bias. In brief, Turner et al.165 propose that authors design an CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 262 idealized study aimed at answering the specific question in mind. This study may not be plausible to carry out and is simply a tool for exploring bias in the completed studies. To identify the potential biases, the completed studies are compared to the idealized study considering a number of potential sources of bias. For each form of bias identified, assessors then elicit the likely magnitude and varianc e of the bias. These estimates of the magnitude and variance of the potential biases can then be used to adjust treatment effect estimates accounting for both the magnitude and uncertainty of any potential bias identified. External empirical evidence of bi as can be included in the analysis rather than relying on eliciting values, but it is assumed that this data will be largely unavailable. Adjusting for bias at the study level There are a number of established statistical methods for analysing NRS that attempt to minimise the potential bias from confounding. Each of these methods is briefly described below followed by a brief review of the literature discussing the efficacy of these methods. Regression analysis Confounding bias occurs in the context of est imating clinical effectiveness when individual patient characteristics such as age, sex and disease duration that influence efficacy outcomes are also correlated with treatment received. Regression analysis seeks to directly adjust for these potential confounding variables by building a statistical model166 of the form: Outcome variable = f (control variables + treatment decision) Regression models therefore allow the estimation of the treatment effect conditional upo n these confounding variables. There are many types of regression model. The choice of any particular model depends on the characteristics of the outcome variable (i.e. continuous or categorical) and on the way it is mathematically related to the explanato ry variables. Typically for dichotomous outcomes, a logistic regression model is used. For continuous outcomes a linear regression model is used, and a proportional hazards regression (Cox regression) model is used for time -to-event data. Theoretically r egression models can be used to entirely el iminate bias due to confounding as long as the appropriate parameters are included with a regression equation. However, in reality confounding factors will either be unobserved , preventing their inclusion in the r egression model , or a lack of understanding of the disease process will mean that we do not know to include them in the regression model. Where such unobserved confounders are not included in the regression model confounding bias can persist. Regression t echniques can be used in conjunction with other methods of adjusting of confounding including propensity scoring and instrumental variables.166 Regression models also CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 263 require a minimum number of participants per addit ional explanatory variable, with useful rule of thumb of at least 10 observations per explanatory variable.167 This requirement may limit their application in to regenerative medicine where effectiveness estimates can be based on relatively small studies. Stratification Stratification involves the division of participants into subgroups with respect to categorical (or categorized quantitative) prognostic factors, for example classifying age into decades, or weight into quartiles. The intervention effect is then estimated in each stratum and a pooled estimate is calculated across strata. This procedure can be interpreted as a meta -analysis at the level of an individual study. Major limitations are that it is feasible and meaningful only when effects are consistent across strata, and that it can usually be employed only for few variables, as strata increase exponentially in keeping with the number of stratification factors.166 As such, stratification is method can only minimise rather than completely r emove the bias resulting from confounding. Matching Matching involves selecting participants with similar values for important prognostic factors to make the control and treatment groups more similar and that any differences between the treatment and control group cannot be as a result of differences in the matched variables. Matching can be carried out both prospectively or retrospectively. Matching prospectively can, however, cause significant recruitment problems. Matching retrospectively can also cause problems as it is not always possible to match individuals In large studies it is often easier to use an unmatched control group and use regression analysis to adjust for what we would have matched on.168 Matching can however, be useful in small studies where there are insufficient participants to adjust f or multiple variables at once.168 As such matching may be potentially useful techniques for controlling for confounding when using historical controls with the small single a rm studies that have typif ied regenerative medicine clinical evidence. While matching can be used to reduce confounding bias it is unlikely to completely account for all difference due to unobserved confounding. Instrumental variables analysis Instrumental variables techniques att empt to approximate the experimental approach by using an instrument variable or variables. A parameter is considered a valid instrument if it meets the following two conditions: I. The instrument must be correlated with receiving of treatment (or exposure); CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 264 II. The instrumental variable must be independent (uncorrelated) with unobserved confounders . Where a valid instrument exists the instrumental variables approach leads to unbiased estimates equivalent to those from a randomised study. Indeed, randomisation can be thought of as the perfect instrumental variable as it is by definition perfectly associated with treatment allocation and independent of unobserved heterogeneity. The problem with the instrumental variables approach, however, is that identification of a valid instrument is often difficult. Furthermore, while the first requirement of valid instrument is easily tested, the second requirement is essential ly untestable and therefore we can never be certain that a n instrument is valid. The application of an instrumental variables approach also leads to significant reduction in the power to detect a difference, particularly where the instrument al variable is poorly correlated with treatment allocation. This latter issue may be particular problematic in regener ative medicine where studies are often small with low power to detect differences between alternative treatments. Propensity Scoring Propensity scoring rather than being a single method is a suit e of methods that consider confounding bias as a form of selection bias where treatment allocation is acknowledged to be non -random and that treatment selection is often influenced by a patient 's characteristics.169 All propensity scoring methods seek to model this process of treatment selection and estimate the propensity to receive treatment based on baseline patient characteristics. Conditional on the prope nsity score the distribution of base line characteristics will be similar in both the treatment and control groups. Therefore in patients with similar propensity scores patient characteristics will be the same independent of whether treatment was received. The propensity is typically estimated using a logistic regression model, though other methods have been applied. The estimated propensity score can be used to remove the effects of confounding in four different ways.169 These are described very briefly below: Matching - The propensity score is used to match participants in the treatment and control groups who have similar values of the propensity score. Stratification - Subjects are ranked on the propensity score and stratified into groups, typically quintiles . Stratum -specific mean differences are the n calculated and these differences are effectively meta -analysed to estimate an overall difference in means. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 265 Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) - This involves using the propensity score as weight such that an individual participant 's weight is equal to the inverse of the probability of receiving the treatment. Covariate - The propensity score is added as covariate within a regression equation. The propensity score can be added either with or withou t additional explanatory variables. A number of studies have sought to compare propensity scoring methods to ascertain which is the most effective at removing confounding bias169-173 These studies have shown matching and IPTW to be more effective than stratification or covariate adjustment170-173 The principal advantage of propensity scoring over other adjustment methods such as regression analysis is that it can be used even with small sample sizes and therefore may me particularly relevant to regenerative medicine . Propensity scoring also has a number of disadvantage s . Firstly, propensity scoring only controls for differences in observed variables, and does nothing to remove bias resulting unobserved character istics . Secondly, including variables that affect whether a treatment is received but not the outcome of interest increase s the variance of the estimated treatment effect without a concomitant reduction in bias. This is problematic as sometimes it can be d ifficult to establish w hich variables will only impact on which treatment is received. 169 Effectiv eness of adjustment methods Our review identified a total of nine studies: eight studies174-181 compar ed the results of regression analysis, instrumental variables and propensity scoring , and a further paper was identified th at discussed the relative merits of the alternative methods of adjustment .182 Two of these studies w ere systematic reviews: Shah et al.178 reviewed comparisons of P ropensity scoring versus regression methods . Shah et al.178and 181 reviewed comparisons of P ropensity scoring versus instrumental variable analyses. Propensity scoring versus regression methods Six studies174, 176 -180 compar ed the different adjustment methods compared propensity scoring with regression methods. The conclusions from these studies were inconsistent. Two studies178, 180concluded that estimates obtained from regression methods are similar to those obtained using propensity scoring. Two studies176, 179, however, also came to the opposite conclusion that estimates obtained from regression and propensity scoring diff er significantly. One simulation study 177comparing the two methods considered propensity scoring to be the superior method while another Cepeda et al174found that propensity scoring is superior when the number of events per confounder is low. The disparate results of these studies means conclusions regarding the relative performance is difficult to make, but the conclusion of Kurth et al.176 makes an important observation that potentially CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 266 explains these different results. Kurth et al.176 notes that each method of adjustment answers subtly different questions as they make different assumptions. This inevitabl y means that different methods of adjustment will yield different results. Kurth et al.176 advise that researchers need to consider caref ully the population for which an overall treatment estimate is most appropriate. Regression analysis versus instrumental variable analysis Only two studies compared regression analysis with instrumental variable methods.175, 179 Crosby et al.175 found that results from regression analysis and instrumental variable methods differed somewhat and suggested that instrumental variables are potentially superi or. Stukel et al.179compared all three methods of adjustment and concluded that instrumental variables may l ead to less biased estimates of treatment effects. Although the evidence on instrumental variables is limited it nevertheless suggests it may offer advantages over other methods and may produce the least biased estimates. Propensity scoring versus instru mental variable analyses A recently published systematic review found 55 comparisons (37 studies) of propensity scoring with instrumental variable analyses . 181 The review found there to b e a slight/fair agreement between the methods [Cohen's kappa coefficient = 0.21 (95% CI 0.00 -0.41). In 23 cases (42%) results were nonsignificnat using one method whilst being significant with the other; using instrumental variable methods results were non -significant in most cases (87%). The study authors recommended caution when interpreting the results of these analyses and that further research is needed to clarify the roles for these methods. In addition to the seven empirical studies identified a disc ussion paper by Biondi -Zoccai et al.182provides a useful overview of the alternative methods of adjustment and their relative methods. Biondi -Zoccai et al.,182concluded that there is no clearly superior method noting that \"both standard multivariable methods and propensity scores have key limitations, and none is able to take into account unknown confounders.\" Biondi -Zoccai et al.,182however, go on to su ggest that propensity scoring methods may have advantages over regression methods where the sample size is small and that while instrumental variables methods are not without their limitations, they are the only methods that allow for unobserved confoundin g to be adjusted for. Adjustment methods applied specifically to single -arm trials The objective of this analysis183 was to improve the methods to minimize bias in single -arm studies. Four bias factors were suppressed stepwise: attrition bias (by replacing missing values with the baseline value carried forward), bias from natural recovery (by sample restriction to patients with disease duration of 12 months), regression to the mean due to symptom driven self -selection (by CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 267 replacing baseline scores with scores three months before en rolment) and bias from adjunctive therapies (by sample restriction to patients not using adjunctive therapies). In the cohort analysed, these four bias factors could together explain a maximum of 37% of the 0 - to 6-month improvement of disease score. Howev er, this method has not been widely tested on other cohorts.CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 268 Table 44 Methods and results from studies comparing RCTs with NRSs Study name Sampling methods Selection criteria Number of studies included Outcomes Conclusions Abraham (2006)32 A case control and RCT of the effectiveness of laposcopic surgery were carried out and the results compared NA 1 RCT and 1 NRS.

PFS or TTP are sometimes regarded as valid surrogate outcomes when establishing the clinical benefit of a treatment in the absence of a mature dat aset, but an estimate of OS is still needed within the economic analysis. The relationship between surrogate and OS can be used to populate the economic model as an alternative to OS from trial data. Unfortunately when comparing studies the lack of standa rdised methodology or approach made it difficult to establish a relationship. Some correlation was found but the size of the effect and statistical significance varied considerably. These authors support Taylor and Elston49 in recommending that any cost -effectiveness analysis based on a surrogate relationship between PFS and OS should be supported with a transparent explanation of how the relationship is quantified in the model and should be accompanied by sensitivity analysis exploring the uncertainty associated with that relationship and a systematic re view of papers ex amining the relationship between PFS and OS in the relevant setting. This would allow decision makers to judge the appropriateness of the model in light of the evidence available in that specific disease area. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 276 Katz, R. (2004)56 In this article, the relevant FDA regulatory context is discussed, as well as the epistemological problems related to the interpretation of clinical trial s in which un -validated surrogate markers are used as primary outcomes. From a regulatory standpoint, the use of biomarkers and surrogates are supported when used in the appropriate context and the y can be shown to offer a clinical benefit to some of the p atients in an 'adequate and well -controlled trial'. In research where the treatment outcome is considered to be clinically important, and where they are few if any available alternative treatment options, accelerated approval on the basis of the drug prod uct having an effect on a surrogate endpoint may be granted by the FDA. The surrogate endpoint is expected to be based on research evidence including epidemiologic, therapeutic and pathophysiologic findings (other than survival or irreversible morbidity). Important points to note with regard to the regulation of surrogate use in research include; i. FDA regulation require the effect on the surrogate to be only \"reasonably likely\" to predict clinical benefit. ii. The regulation applies to use of an \"un -validated\" surrogate marker in definitive effectiveness trials (t o provide unequivocal evidence of a treatment's tangible benefit to the patient). iii. An un -validated surrogate is described as \"reasonably likely\" to provide a measure of clinical benefit in circumstances where evidence of a clinical effect is immature. iv. Only for proposed treatments for serious and life -threatening conditions that \"....provide meaningful therapeutic benefit......over existing treatments.....,\" v. Ongoing research must be continued after marketing. If r esearch is not continued or if continued but efforts to validate the surrogate fail the drug must be withdrawn. Fleming & DeMets (1996)62 The most commonly used guidance on the validity of surrogate end points. For the surrogate to be a reliable outcome measure it must be on the 'causal pathway' from the intervention to the clinical o utcome, this is the \"setting that provides the greatest potential f or the surrogate end point to be valid\". Reasons for failure when using surrogate outcomes include, i. The surrogate is not on the causal pathway of the disease process, ii. Of several causal pathways of disease, the intervention affects only the pathway mediate d by the surrogate. iii. The surrogate is not in the pathway of the interventions effect or is insensitive to its effect. iv. The intervention has mechanisms of action independent of the disease process Bucher et al (1999)60 How to use an article measuring the effect of an intervention on surrogate end points. The JAMA Evidence -Based Medicine Working Group thoughts on the validity of surrogate outcome measures. For a surrogate to be valid there must be no important effects of that intervention on the outcome of interest that are not m ediated through, or captured by, the surrogate. Reliance on a surrogate may be beneficial or harmful. Use of a surrogate may lead to the rapid and appropriate dissemination of new treatments, eg. The FDAs decision to grant approval on new antiretrovirus drugs for the trea tment of HIV have subsequently led to effective treatments identified from RCTs. However reliance on surrogate endpoints may lead to morbidity and mortality , e.g. cardiac inotropes may improve short term cardiac hemodynamic function in patients with heart failure but RCTs have found excess mortality with a number of them including flosequinan which had to be withdrawn. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 277 EUnetHTA (2013)47 Recommendations for endpoints used in relative effectiveness assessment (REA) of pharmaceuticals. The EUnetHTA summarised their findings into 8 recommendations for endpoints used in relative effectiveness as sessment of pharmaceuticals i. The REA of pharmaceuticals should be based whenever possible on final patient -relevant clinical endpoints (e.g. morbidity, overall mortality). ii. Biomarkers and intermediate endpoints will be considered as surrogate endpoints in R EA if they can reliably substitute for a clinical endpoint and predict its clinical benefit. iii. Surrogate endpoints should be adequately validated and must have been demonstrated based on biological plausibility and empirical evidence. iv. Validation of a surroga te is normally undertaken in a specific population and for a specific drug intervention. Demonstration of surrogate validation both within and across drug classes should be thoroughly justified v. The availability of a sufficiently large safety database is pa rticularly important and evidence on safety outcomes should always be reported. vi. The absence of data on clinical endpoints might be acceptable when a clinical endpoint is difficult or impossible to study (very rare or delayed) or target population is too s mall to obtain meaningful results on relevant clinical endpoints even after very long follow -up (very slowly progressive and/or rare diseases). However, these exceptions need to be carefully argued and agreed in advance. vii. Re-assessment requirements for furt her data should be clearly defined when a REA has been previously made based on surrogate endpoints for the first assessment. Further methodological research on the use of surrogate outcomes is needed to inform future approaches for the handling of surroga tes. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 278 Elston & Taylor (2009)48 Paper published prior to the following HTA Report. This paper presents the method used and the findings of the reports. This paper specifically discusses the role of surrogate outcomes in cost -effectiveness models and is often cited as a key paper. They included the following recommendations: RECOMMENDATION I Ideally, the assessment of clinical effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of a health technology should be based on final patient - related outcomes (i.e., mortality, i mportant clinical events, and health -related quality -of-life). To minimize the risk of bias, this evidence should be identified from a systematic review (and meta -analysis) of well -conducted randomized clinical trials. RECOMMENDATION II Where this is not possible and there is a requirement to use a surrogate outcome, the following should be undertaken: i. A review of the evidence for the validation of the surrogate/ final outcome relationship. To minimize the risk of bias, such a review should be systematic. ii. The evidence on surrogate validation should be presented according to an explicit hierarchy such as the following: Level 1 : evidence demonstrating treatment effects on the surrogate correspond to effects on the patient -related outcome (from clinical tri als); Level 2 : evidence demonstrating a consistent association between surrogate outcome and final patient -related outcome (from epidemiological/observational studies); Level 3 : evidence of biological plausibility of relationship between surrogate and final patient -related outcome (from pathophysiologic studies and/or understanding of the disease process). iii. Consideration for undertaking a CEM analysis based on a surrogate outcom e when there is Level 1 or 2 validation evidence. RECOMMENDATION III When a CEM analysis based on a surrogate outcome is undertaken: i. Provide a transparent explanation as to how the relationship of the surrogate and final outcome is quantified within the C EM. ii. Explicitly explore and discuss the uncertainty associated with use of the surrogate outcome iii. in the CEM, especially through sensitivity analysis. In accord with recent HTA methodological developments, such uncertainty may be quantified using probabilis tic sensitivity analysis. iv. Make specific research recommendations regarding the need for future research on the surrogate/final outcome relationship. In accord with recent HTA methodological developments, the impact of the surrogate outcome on decision unce rtainty may be quantified by a value of information analysis. v. Include the term \"surrogate outcome\" in the report executive summary/abstract to assist bibliographic identification.

This report focuses on the role of surrogate outcomes in cost -effectiveness models (CEMs) within UK HTA Programme reports. Reports were selected on the basis that they addressed a treatment eff ectiveness/efficacy question, that they included a CEM and that the CEM was primarily based on a surrogate outcome. Reports published in the UK HTA Programme monograph series in 2005 and 2006 formed the sampling frame for this study. Only one of the report s undertook a systematic review to specifically seek the evidence base for the association between surrogate and final outcomes. Furthermore, this was the only report to pro vide level 1 surrogate -final outcome validation evidence, i.e. RCT data showing a s trong association between the change in surrogate outcome (BPAR) and the change in final outcome (graft survival) at an individual patient level. The outcome of the study was to make recommendations for the evaluation of surrogate endpoints in HTA. A key o utput from this work was the design of a schema used to evaluate the cost effectiveness ratio of a surrogate accessed via a meta -analysis HTA.

Herson (1989)184 An introduction to a series of papers which were presented at a meeting in 1989 to address the interest and controversy on surrogate endpoints \"Long completion times are not only a component of overall cost, but also frequently result in the intervention under investigation being rendered obsolete by the time the trial terminates........The use of surrogate endpoints constitutes an effort to control t he cost and completion time for clinical trials.\" Ellenberg & Hamilton (1989)185 A review of surrogate endpoints in clinical trials with a special focus on cancer \"A surrogate endpoint is usually proposed on the basis of a biologic rationale\" \"In cancer studies with survival time as the primary endpoint, surrogate endpoints frequently employed are tumour response, t ime to progression, or time to reappearance of disease\" Prentice (1989)186 Discusses the definition and operational criteria for using surrogate endpoints in clinical trials comparing two or more treatments or interventio ns.

In this study the authors examine the relationship between PFS and OS in a set of historical trials in clinical opthalmology. The retrospective trial data found 1,760 patients (57%) had progressed or died at 6 months, and 1,622 (52%) had died at 12 months . The rank correlation coefficient between PFS and OS was equal to 0.82 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.83). The correlation coefficient between treatment effects on PFS and on OS ranged from 0.99 (95% CI, 0.94 to 1.04) when all trials were considered to 0.74 (9 5% CI, 0.44 to 1.04) after exclusion of one highly influential trial which exhibited extreme treatment benefits187. The authors present data which suggests additional measures are required to validate a and propose two such measures: the first relates the effec t of treatment on the true endpoint to that on the surrogate at the population level; the sec ond quantifies the association between the true and the surrogate endpoints after taking treatment into account at the individual level. Holloway & Dick (2002)188 The authors hypothesize that lingering therapeutic uncertainty exists because many of the clinical trial end points have been surrogate outcome measures rather than end points with clear and convincing value to patients Consequences of using surrogate outcomes that have not been validated inclu de ambiguous evidence and wasted resources as well as patient harm and missed opportunities. Lessere et al (2007)63 Review of the literature on biomarkers and surrogates to develop a hierarchical schema that systematic ally evaluates and ranks the surrogacy status of biomarkers and surrogates; and to obtain feedback from stakeholders. A new quantitative surrogate validation level of evidence schema (was designed) that evaluates biomarkers along 4 domains: Target, Study D esign, Statistical Strength, and Penalties. Scores derived from 3 domains the Target that the marker is being substituted for, the Design of the (best) evidence, and the Statistical strength are additive. Penalties are then applied if there is serious coun terevidence. Most stakeholders agreed that this operationalization of the National Institutes of Health definitions of biomarker, surrogate endpoint, and clinical endpoint was useful. Freedman et al (1992)189 In this paper the authors expand on the work of Prentice, with respect to the criterion for validation of intermediate variables or surrogate endpoints, by describing and discussing the statistical implementation of this criterion and by using the example of serum cholesterol as an intermediate endpoint for coronary heart disease (CHD). The authors state a major obstacle in the study of the aetiology of c hronic diseases and the development of effective prevention is the long latent period between the initiation of the disease and its diagnosis. Intermediate endpoints or surrogate endpoints are of interest in the study of several diseases as they can usuall y be observed prior to the clinical appearance of disease. In this paper an attempt is made to clarify the criteria that may be used to validate an intermediate endpoint. The authors found the original general criterion was difficult to test in practice an d as such found the validation analysis would require some aspect of statistical modelling. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 281 Zee & Xie (2015)190 In studies with surrogate outcomes available for all subjects and true outcomes available for only a subsample, survival analysis methods are needed that incorporate both endpoints in or der to assess treatment effects. Our proposed method allows for real -time validation of surrogate outcomes and flexible censoring mechanisms The proposed method is able to account for the uncertainty of surrogate outcomes using a validation subsample of tr ue outcomes in estimating a binary covariate effect. The proposed estimator can outperform standard semiparametric survival analysis methods and can therefore save on costs of a trial or improve power in detecting treatment effects. Wilson et al 50 Review paper Considers the issue of who defines what is a clinically meaningful outcome in cancer treatment; patients, clinicians or regul atory bodies. Also highlights the variation in opinion between these groups. De Gruttola et al (1997)191 In this study the authors consider why surrogate endpoints can be unreliabl e and illustrate the importance of variability in evaluating the reliability of surrogates, with specific focus on HIV/AIDs treatment. The variety of proposed metrics for evaluating the degree to which this criterion is met are subject to misinterpretatio n because of the multiplicity of mechanisms by which drugs operate. Without detailed understanding of these mechanisms, metrics of \"surrogacy\" are not directly interpretable. In order for a marker to be a valid surrogate by the 'Prentice' definition. It m ust capture all of a treatment's beneficial and harmful effects. Markers that truly capture all of a treatment's effects have never been found. While' 'partial surrogate markers\" that capture some of a treatment's effect may provide insight into biologic m echanisms, analyses of the degree of surrogacy must be regarded with caution. Fleming et al (1994)192 The applicability surrogate endpoint criteria, is discussed, with emphasis on cancer and AIDS research settings. Auxiliary endpoints are defined as response variables, or covariates, that can strengthen true endpoint analyses such response variables provide some additional information on true endpoint occurrence times for study subjects having censored values for such times. Circumstances in which surrogate endpoint operational criteria are kn own to be met, or can be argued on theoretical and empirical bases to be approximately met, are likely to occur very rarely. Many informative intermediate response variables may exist ev en though individually or collectively they may not satisfy surrogate endpoint criteria. However there is potential for data on pertinent intermediate endpoints to play an auxiliary role in strengthening true endpoint analyses. The two approaches to the use of au xiliary data, respectively, involve an augmented scores method and an augmented likelihood method. The gains will be particularly evident when sufficient follow -up occurs to observe both auxiliary and true endpoints in one set of study subjects, while another set of subjects exists in which the auxiliary endpoint is o bserved and the true endpoint is censored. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 282 Gotzsch et al (1996)55 Surrogate outcome measures may speed up clinical research if they can be measured earlier in a study than the primary outcome of interest. In this paper the authors review the justification for the use of surrogates and conclude that reliance on them may be harmful. Surrogate outcomes can be any measurable event or value related to the disease and true outcome of interest; for example, the y can be laboratory values, genetic tests, measures of morbidity, x -ray diagnoses, or absence from work. Surrogate in one trial may be the true outcome in another, depending on the purpose of the study. Example, Bone Mineral Content and Fractures. Loss of bone mineral content (BMC) is strongly associated with increased risk of fractures. Logically, one would expect that interventions increasing BMC would also be associated with decreased fracture rates. Fluoride intake is known to increase BMC , and many felt that long -term studies of its effect on fractures were not really n ecessary. However, such studies were performed, and although the short -term effect on BMC was confirmed, the incidence of fractures was larger in the fluoride group than in the placebo group. Apparently, the new bone was of poor quality. In contrast, intak e of the biphosphonate, etidronate, resulted in a slightly decreased fracture rate in addition to the expected positive effect on BMC. BMC is therefore unreliable as a surroga te. Fleming & De Mets (1996)162 This paper provided examples from several disease areas to illustrate how surrogate end points have been misleading about the actual effects that treatments have on the health of patients . In theory, for a surrogate end point to be an effective substitute for the clinical outcome, effects of the intervention on the surrogate must reliably predict the overall effect on the clinical outcome. In practice, this requirement frequently fails. Surroga te end points can be useful in phase 2 screening trials for identifying whether a new intervention is biologically active and for guiding d ecisions about whether the intervention is promising enough to justify a large definitive trial with clinically meani ngful outcomes. In definitive phase 3 trials, except for rare circumstances in which the validity of the surrogate end point has already been ri gorously established, the primary end point should be the true clinical outcome. Schievink et al (2014)61 Online questionnaire to inquire for conditions under which surrogate endpoints can be used, the validity of various cardio - renal biomarkers and new approaches for bio marker use. Questionnaire of various stakeholder groups (regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical industry, academia, relevant public sector organisations) and medical specialties (cardiology or nephrology vs. other). Out of four proposed surrogates (blood pre ssure (BP), HbA1c, albuminuria, CRP) for cardiovascular outcomes or end -stage renal disease, only use of BP for cardiovascular outcomes was deemed moderately accurate (mean: 3.6, SD: 1.1). Specialists in cardiology or nephrology tended to be more positive about the use of surrogate endpoints Lerche la Cour et al (2010)57 To assess if authors of randomised clinical trials convey the fact that they have used surrogate outcomes and discussed their validity. Of 626 published randomised clinical trials, 109 (17%) used a surrogate as a primary outcome. Of these trials, 62 (57%, 95% confidence interval 47% to 67%) clearly reported that the primary outcom e was a surrogate. Only 38 (35%, 26% to 45%) also discussed the validity of the surrogate. Given the shortcomings of surrogates it is surprising that they are used as primary outcomes in about one fifth of published randomised clinical trials. One reason m ay be the involvement of for profit organisations in many trials. These organisations have an interest in using surrogate outcomes, as it shortens the trial, makes it less costly, and speeds up the implementation of new interventions. 1 Repeated in table as paper covers many subjects CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 283 Bujkiewicz et al (2014)76 The aim of t his study was to illustrate the potential effect of reduced uncertainty around the clinical outcome on the utility when estimating it from a multivariate meta -analysis. In the areas of highest priority in health care, decisions are required to be made on a short time scale. Therefore, alternative clinical outcomes, including surrogate end points, are increasingly being considered for use in evidence synthesis as part of economic evaluation. Bayesian multivariate meta -analysis was used to synthesize data on correlated outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis. Estimates of Health Assessment Questionnaire were mapped onto the health -related quality -of-life measure EuroQol five -dimensional questionnaire, and the effect was compared with mapping the Health Assessment Que stionnaire obtained from the univariate approach. The use of multivariate meta -analysis can lead to reduced uncertainty around the effectiveness parameter. By allowing all the relevant data to be incorporated in estimating clinical effectiveness outcomes, multivariate meta -analysis can improve the estimation of health utilities through mapping methods. While reduced uncertainty may have an effect on decisions based on economic evaluation of new health technologies, the use of short -term surrogate end points can allow for early decisions. More research is needed to determine the circumstances under which uncertainty is reduced. Ciani et al (2015)68 This study aimed to to quantify and compare the treatment effects on three surrogate end points, progression -free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and tumor response rate (TR) vs. overall survival (OS) based on a meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of drug interventions in advanced colorectal cancer (aCRC). A systematic search was performed of RCTs of pharmacologic therapies in aCRC between 2003 and 2013, 101 RCTs were included. Univariate and multivariate random -effects meta -analyses were used to estimate pooled summary treatment effects. The ratio of hazard ratios (HRs)/odds ratios (ORs) and difference in medians were used to quantify the degree of difference in tr eatment effects on the surrogate end points and OS. The finding reported a larger treatment effect for the surrogates than for OS. Co mpared with OS, treatment effects were on average 13% higher when HRs were measured and 3% to 45% higher when ORs were considered; differences in median PFS/TTP were higher than on OS by an average of 0.5 month. None of the end points in this study were found to achieve the level of evidence (ie, mean R2 trialO0.60) that has been set to select high or excellent corr elation levels by c ommon surrogate evaluation tools. Previous surrogacy relationships observed between PFS and TTP vs. OS in selected settings may not apply across other classes or lines of therapy. Ciani et al (2013)58 The aim was similar to the above trial in that the group worked to quantify and compare the treatment effect and risk of bias of trials reporting biomarkers or intermediate outcomes (surrogate outcomes) versus trials using final patient relevant primary outcomes and a meta - epidemiological methodology. 84 trials using surrogate outcomes and 101 using patie nt relevant outcomes were considered for analyses. Their risk of bias did not differ. Primary analysis showed trials reporting surrogate endpoints to have larger treatment effects (odds ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.42 to 0.60) than trials reportin g patient relevant outcomes (0.76, 0.70 to 0.82), with an unadjusted ratio of odds ratios of 1.47 (1.07 to 2.01) and adjusted ratio of odds ratios of 1.46 (1.05 to 2.04). This result was consistent acros s sensitivity and secondary analyses. Trials reportin g surrogate primary outcomes are more likely to report larger treatment effects than trials reporting final patient relevant primary outcomes. This finding was not explained by differences in the risk of b ias or characteristics of the two groups of trials. CRD/CHE University of York Exploring the assessment and appraisal of regenerative medicines and cell therapy products Final report 11/03/2016 284 Ciani et al (2013)193 This case study aimed to illustrate the validation of CCyR and MMR as surrogate outcomes for overall survival in CML and how this evidence was used to inform National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's recommendation on the public funding of these first -line treatments for CML. This case study illustrates the consideration of surrogate outcome evidence in he alth technology assessment. Although it is often recommended that the acceptance of surrogate out comes be based on randomized controlled trial data demonstrating an association between the treatment effect on both the surrogate outcome and the final outco me, this case study shows that policymakers may be willing to accept a lower level of evidence (i.e., observational association). Ciani & Taylor (2013)53 Letter to the editor commenting on analytical approaches discussed by Hawkins et al (2012)194on the use of surrogates in health technology assessments (HTA) and cost -effectiveness models (CEM). Presents opinion on the thrtee main issues raised by Hawkins et al. on best practice for the use of surrogate outco mes in HTA and CEMs. i. The need for a new definition of surrogate outcome which not only fits the regulatory and licensing need but also the evaluation of treatment for HTA. ii. To recognise the need for pragmatic, high level evidence, preferably from meta -analy ses and regression modelling using both surrogate and final outcomes. iii. The need for systematic evidence which proves a link between the surrogate and final outcome measures allowing a calculation of 'incremental cost -effectiveness ratio' (ICER). Ciani et al (2014)67 The authors state it is essential that can didate surrogate endpoints be properly validated. However, believe there is no consensus on statistical methods for such validation and on how the evidence thus derived should be applied by policy makers. This study proposed a method for validation. A revi ew current statistical approaches to surrogate -endpoint validation based on meta -analysis in various advanced -tumor settings was performed. The authors assessed the suitability of two surrogates (progression -free survival [PFS] and time -to-progression three current validation frameworks: Elston and Taylor's framework, the German Institute of Quality and Efficiency in Health Care's (IQWiG) framework and the Biomarker -Surrogacy Evaluation Schema (BSES3). Findings suggest, the strength of the asso ciation between the two surrogates and OS was generally low. The level of evidence (observation -level versus treatment - level) available varied considerably by cancer type, by evaluation tools and was not always consistent even within one specif ic cancer ty pe. This study emphasizes the challenges of surrogate -endpoint validation and the importance of building consensus on the development of evaluation frameworks.

Prescribers were also encouraged to participate in a voluntary adverse event reporting system. In particular monitoring of SIRS was important. Any additional information provided? EMA review stated that given the efficacy seen early on in the clinical programme, studies using a placebo comparator were considered to be clinically unethical. Active comparator studies were not appropriate as there were no other recognised therapeutic options av ailable. \"The indication is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive data on clinical efficacy and safety.\" Marketing authorisation was therefore granted 'under exceptional circumstances'. AWMSG recommended use only if the intended use was as a bridge to HSCT (but should not be used with palliativ e intent).

Philadelphia chromosome -negative relapsed or refractory B -cell precursor ALL What is the natural history of the disease with current treatment Five-year disease -free survival rates in patients with second and third remission are reported to be 27% and 15% respectively. 2% of the children who do not achieve remission have refractory disease; this has a worse prognosis than relaps ed disease. How does it work? Blinatumomab is a monoclonal antibody (a type of protein) that has been designed to specifically recognise and attach to CD19 proteins and to :the 'T -cell-receptor/CD3 complex', which is responsible for the activation of some cells of the immune system (the body's natural defences) called T cells. By attaching to the cancer cells and the T -cell-receptor/CD3 complex blinatumomab is expected to stimulate the T cells to kill the cancer cells. Is it claiming to meet an otherwise unmet need? Clofarabine and marqibo already exist as current treatments although blinatumomab might be a significant alternative because it works in a different way to existing treatments How is it given? Intravenous infusion over 4 weeks, with 2 week int erval between each treatment cycle Are there any comparator treatments? Yes, clofarabine and marqibo have been granted accelerated approval by the FDA for a similar indication prior to blinatumomab Is there an issue of the intervention evolving over tim e?

Adjustment for patients who have relapsed (with no further planned curative chemotherapy or haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)) or who are refractory to standard chemotherapy The ONS publishes registrations of newly diagnosed cases of cancer , shown for ALL in England in Table 49.195 The age of the population of relevance is assumed to be from birth to 30 inclusive, consistent with the definition of children and young adults in Lee et al.,117 giving an annual incidence estimate of 460.
