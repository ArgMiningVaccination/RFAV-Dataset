Even amid the extraordinary challenges of the past year, our students have continued to excel, faculty have led the way in equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and alumni across the world are helping to treat patients and advocate for evidence-based practice. I am incredibly proud of how our school has persevered, and this issue of Johns Hopkins Nursing is just a glimpse into the exciting future ahead. In \"Promise Fulfilled: A New Pinkard (Page 6),\" you will get a glimpse inside the glass fa\u00e7ade of our newly renovated Pinkard Building and be dazzled by sun-flooded research, learning, study, and work areas designed to foster innovation and collaboration. In \"Diversity Is a Living Thing (Page 34),\" we showcase how inclusion and a culture of integration have become central to the mission of our school. From alumni like Athena Ford, addressing the gap in LGBTQI-specific nursing content, to Research Program Manager Sandra Panchalingam, whose volunteerism earned her the Martin Luther King Jr. Community Service Award, we embrace the uniqueness of every individual while realizing that it's our humanity that ties us all together in the nursing profession. Elsewhere, you will meet Sharon Trivino, new associate dean for Development and Alumni Relations (Page 48); read a letter about the year in COVID care from Johns Hopkins Hospital's Deborah Baker (Page 38), and learn about our master's programs' No. 1 U.S. News ranking for 2022 (Page 11). Our DNP is now No. 2 nationally. As many of you know, this will be the final issue I will get to introduce as dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing. I want to thank each and every one of you for supporting our school and allowing me the incredible honor of being part of this community. I am proud of all of you and our achievements. The future is bright, and you can be sure that Zoom will bring us all together again soon. Until then, be safe and well, and enjoy the new issue of Johns Hopkins Nursing .1 MAGAZINE.NURSING.JHU.EDU NEWS FROM JOHNS HOPKINS NURSING Patricia M.

There are 21 new meeting spaces to accommodate all brainstorming, planning, or celebration needs and desires. And the new Leona B. Carpenter Conference Center will allow for larger, more interdisciplinary events with colleagues locally and globally. (The original Carpenter Room will provide an extended space for meetings and events.) There are gorgeous and thoughtfully designed study and research suites dedicated to Dean Patricia Davidson and Dean Emerita Martha Hill; other spaces carry names of generous donors or those of other distinguished nurses past and present. The Office of the Dean and the new Evelyn Spiro Dean's Conference Room will provide space for leaders to engage and features a balcony overlooking East Baltimore perfect for special events. Taken together, it's breathtaking. But we knew all of this was coming. News that hasn't been shared in this space before: It's finished. (Sure, there are minor nips and tucks to be signed off on here and there, signage to install, and a gargantuan video wall to program with content by and about JHSON.) Students have returned and are working, studying, and chilling in a COVID- safe environment while most staff and faculty continue to commute virtually. To those faculty and staff, to JHSON alumni (many who studied to the hum and wail of construction), to online students and those whose meet-ups at JHSON are few and far between, to those generous donors who made the project possible, and to those local and global collaborators, welcome to the new Pinkard Building. These pages could not hold a complete overview, just another sampling. Perhaps that, too, is a good thing. The imagination reels at what awaits us all. We can't say we weren't warned: The virtual tours, teasing images, countless email updates, town halls, and dispatches from people on the ground have been as clear as the glass walls of the new Pinkard Building addition at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing (JHSON). This structure is going to blow minds wide open. That's a very good thing for the nation's No. 1 graduate school of nursing, of course. But it might take our eyes and our brains a moment to adjust. First, it's big, with an additional 66,000 square feet bringing the total school space to 167,000. There are spaces both intimate and roomy for every manner of study, collaboration, inspiration, and innovation as well as self-care and contemplation. The classrooms range from 40 seats up to 220, and there are 11 new ones\u2014all constructed for maximum flexibility to tailor the learning to the nursing cohort. The entire building is equipped with advanced classroom and conferencing Expansion speaks loudly to the bright future of research and learning at JHSONPROMISE FULFILLED: A NEW PINKARDADDED HIGHLIGHTS A sampling of what's new at the Pinkard Building: 66,000 additional square feet (brings total to 167,000) 11 new classrooms (from 40 seats up to 220) 21 new meeting spaces Leona B.

Interior and Courtyard photos by Will Kirk.9 MAGAZINE.NURSING.JHU.EDU NEWS FROM JOHNS HOPKINS NURSING 8 JOHNS HOPKINS NURSING SPRING 2021 NEWS FROM JOHNS HOPKINS NURSING Turning on the Waterworks Sabrina Scarborough was having a moment. The associate director of Campus Operations behind so many of the flesh-and-blood aspects of the Pinkard expansion could have been reflecting upon the years she's spent seeing the project through, or on the fact that she's leaving the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing (JHSON) once a few more \"punch-list\" items are completed. The drama, the drudgery! The heartache, the headache! Nope. \"The fountain!\" To JHSON long-timers, many of spring's most special memories are of times spent in the Courtyard. Sunlit studies, picnics, impromptu outdoor meetings, rights of passage, stress relief ... and to more than a few of us, simply a turn of the faucet that would animate the old water feature each year at winter's end. Now several springs later, the Courtyard and fountain have returned, a bit different but just as meaningful as the day they debuted as a gift from Bob and Townsend Kent, parents grateful for the care shown by nurses toward their child. And today, the fountain remains a symbol to our benefactors' deep belief in the mission of sending the brightest, most well-prepared nurses into the workforce\u2014or back into it, even stronger. To certain others, it's now a symbol of a job well done. Of a building expansion completed without interruption, through a deadly global pandemic, through a project-long, municipal wrestling match over broken steam pipes, through teeth-rattling jackhammers and mind-bending musical chairs\u2014 never missing a beat in the education of those who trust JHSON to help them become more than even they imagined. So sure, a few finishing details remain. But as for dotting the I-beams and crossing the thresholds, the fountain is as sure a sign as any that the Pinkard expansion is a success, thanks to the vision, faith, and doggedness of Dean Patricia M. Davidson, the generosity of so many donors, and the contributions of faculty, students, and staff who never accepted inconvenience as an excuse for anything less than excellence. Spring is here. The water is on. (Forgive Scarborough if she gets a bit misty.) Welcome to the Neighborhood Hub study spaces named for all the familiar places; classroom honors pioneer Gertrude Hodges In the planning stages of the new addition to the Pinkard Building, students voted on Baltimore neighborhood names for four study rooms within the new Hub area. They chose Fells Point, Canton, Patterson Park, and Hampden, where the majority of Johns Hopkins School of Nursing (JHSON) students tend to live. JHSON leadership added names for neighborhoods where students and faculty frequently work: Collington Square (Henderson- Hopkins), Morgan Park (House of Ruth), Old Town (Healthcare for the Homeless), and Broadway East (Wald Center). The collection of names is a true reflection of the JHSON community, its footprint, and its impact, according to Dean Patricia Davidson, PhD, MEd, RN, FAAN. In addition, with support of the SON Black Student Association, JHSON named a first-floor classroom in honor of Gertrude T . Hodges, the first African- American graduate (Class of 1959) of what was then known as the Johns Hopkins Hospital Training School for Nurses. A pioneering nurse leader, Hodges provided decades of health care, teaching, and mentoring as she inspired generations of Baltimore nurses, many of them from underprivileged communities. \"This recognition honors her relentless pursuit of excellence in health care education,\" says Davidson.

The school's Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program moved up one spot to No. 2. JHSON also received the highest peer ranking score ever earned by a school in the U.S. News & World Report rankings. \"Our students, faculty, staff, and alumni are phenomenal and they are the lifeblood that make a No. 1 ranking possible,\" says Dean Patricia Davidson, PhD, MEd, RN, FAAN. This past year, JHSON earned top honors across the globe. It was ranked No. 3 among nursing schools internationally by QS World University . Its online nursing master's degree in administration and leadership was ranked No. 2 by U.S. News & World Report . And most recently, JHSON was named No. 1 among schools of nursing for total funding received from the National Institutes of Health for 2020. In 2020, JHSON was recognized as a Best School for Men in Nursing and was a recipient of the Health Professions Higher Education Excellence in Diversity (HEED) Award from INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, JHSON students continued virtual education, clinical practice opportunities, and simulation experiences through virtual reality. The U.S. News & World Report rankings are determined by weighing factors including peer review, acceptance rate, student and faculty ratio, faculty practice, and research funding, among others. In specialty areas, the school ranks: No. 2 in Nurse Practitioner: Family - DNP No. 2 in Nurse Practitioner: Pediatric Acute Care - DNP (tied) No. 3 in Nurse Practitioner: Adult Gerontology Acute Care - DNP No. 3 in Nurse Practitioner: Pediatric Primary Care - DNP (tied) No. 3 in Nurse Practitioner: Adult Gerontology Primary Care - DNP The Johns Hopkins School of Nursing (JHSON) is No. 1 among schools of nursing for total funding received from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for fiscal year 2020. Its grants range in areas of research from health equity, resilience, and gender norms to aging, cardiovascular health, health of Indigenous people, HIV , trauma, violence, and more. \"This is fantastic news and indicative of the hard work and success of our faculty, staff, and students who strive for excellence every day,\" says Cheryl Dennison Himmelfarb, PhD, RN, vice dean for research and the Sarah E. Allison Endowed Professor.Research, discovery, and implementation are pillars of JHSON's mission to lead in nursing education and advocacy for health locally and globally. Through faculty efforts, doctoral and post-doctoral programs, and a number of other initiatives, the school prioritizes the rapid advancement of research and how the nursing perspective is crucial to the growing body of literature across all aspects of health care. JHSON is also home to numerous research centers including the Center for Cardiovascular and Chronic Care, the Center for Global Initiatives, the Center for Innovative Care in Aging, the Center for Community Innovation and Scholarship, the RESILIENCE Center, the PROMOTE Center, and the REACH Initiative. \"Especially throughout 2020, dedication to science and research have been top priorities in our school,\" says Patricia Davidson, PhD, MEd, RN, FAAN, dean of JHSON. \"We have seen just how critically important research is to developing fast and effective interventions, most recently in COVID-19, but certainly across all health conditions. I am proud of the amount of research undertaken by our faculty, staff, and students and the difference it will make in the world.\" JHSON No. 1 in NIH Funding No. 1 for 2022 JHSON leads U.S. News rankings for fourth straight year; earns highest-ever peer rankingAround the SON13 MAGAZINE.NURSING.JHU.EDU NEWS FROM JOHNS HOPKINS NURSING 12 NEWS FROM JOHNS HOPKINS NURSING Professor Jerilyn Allen, SCD, MS, RN, FAAN , is known throughout the international nursing and medical communities for her research on the prevention of cardiovascular disease as well as beneficial lifestyle modifications for persons with or at high risk for the disease. She is also a highly regarded mentor, guiding and developing faculty and students within the schools of Nursing, Medicine, and Public Health at Johns Hopkins and universities internationally. Professor Phyllis Sharps, PHD, MSN, RN, FAAN , has focused on the consequences of intimate partner violence on the physical and mental health of pregnant women and young children. Her groundbreaking DOVE (for Domestic Violence Enhanced Home Visitation) program keeps women safe simply by checking in\u2014letting them know they aren't alone. Through the House of Ruth Baltimore, she has worked to shield and offer a safer path forward to women and children fleeing violence. Professor Elizabeth Tanner, PHD, MS, RN, FAAN , has held joint appointments in the schools of Nursing and Medicine and served as core faculty in the Center for Innovative Care in Aging. She spent decades in community settings local and global improving care for aging or underserved older adults. She led curriculum development in JHSON's gerontology nursing program and created a Geriatric Interest Group to foster inter-professional collaboration among Nursing, Public Health, and Medicine students. Professor Kathleen White, PHD, MS, RN, FAAN , was part of the collaborative JHSON/Johns Hopkins Hospital team that developed the widely published, award-winning Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-based Practice Model and Guidelines . On the Maryland Health Quality and Cost Control Council, she helped make recommendations to state leaders on health care quality improvement and cost containment initiatives, facilitating collaborations in health care across the public and private sectors. Elsie M. Lawler Chair Professor Hae-Ra Han, PhD, MSN, RN, FAAN, becomes associate dean for community programs and initiatives and the Elsie M. Lawler Chair.

Coverdell Fellows Program at nursing. jhu.edu/ peacecorpsCheryl Finell came by a passion for community health organically. The MSN (Entry into Nursing) student and Gurtler Scholar had volunteered at farms in several states\u2014embracing natural healing\u2014 and also as a case worker in Massachusetts helping young parents earn a high school equivalency diploma (GED). Finell was doing and feeling great ... and lousy. \"You didn't see this [good health] in the people I was working with. You see common health issues among very young people. It upsets you ... it also makes you feel very lucky. And it sparked my interest in public health. \" Finell, privileged to have grown up in Manhattan and Westchester, NY, became even more determined to use that good luck to help lift less fortunate communities globally through public health, parent-child care, and an oversized dose of humility. Thus began a journey for Finell, who uses they/their pronouns. First, to India, where public health and governmental organizations offered valuable lessons in helping those most at risk. Sensing an opportunity to lead and make an even bigger difference, they joined the Peace Corps. (The Gurtler Scholarship is awarded annually to a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer in the Master's Program.) The Middle East beckoned as a first choice, but openings there were rare. Cameroon was available. So off Finell flew, spending two years near Hina (\"in the bush\"\u2014no electricity, spotty cell service\u2014at the far north of Cameroon). \"I was hoping for that extreme ... as far away from everything I knew, pushed that far outside my comfort zone. \" Finell set about getting to know the local people, understanding the need, earning trust, and listening. \"If people don't trust you, you can't do anything,\" Finell says. \"What I thought wasn't relevant. \" Each year, flood season cuts Hina off from the village Finell called home, 17 kilometers away. That community, which had always relied on Hina for health care, approached Finell about raising money to build its own health center. \"I was conflicted because I worried about the sustainability of building a health clinic. But I also felt my role was to facilitate projects according to what the community expressed it needed. So, after doing many other projects and building relationships that would help get the clinic integrated into the government health care system\u2014that's when I really dove in. \" It remains a proud accomplishment. Finell added a third Peace Corps year to do public health work in the capital, Yaounde, realizing over time that a nursing degree would mean being an even bigger help there, or anywhere. \"They said, 'OK, go get your nursing education and come back and work for us. '\" Finell loves the idea. But today, as the single parent of a healthy 6-year- old, Maya, the reality is a bit trickier, with worries such as malaria or other ills that might challenge a child's immune system. Meantime, the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing is happy to have Finell in the family, and help in the journey, wherever it goes. \"I see myself almost as a tool,\" explains Finell, a doula since 2016 who hopes to become a nurse-midwife and continue to practice globally. \"I want to leverage my privilege to be of the most service. \" \" If people don't trust you, you can't do anything... \"Gurtler Scholar uses own good fortune to change that of at-risk communitiesWE ARE ALL EAST BALTIMORE Privileged Information BY STEVE ST.

For the first Johns Hopkins master of nursing student ever to join the university's Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program, that meant squeezing the traditional four years' worth of ROTC into the five semesters of the MSN (Entry into Nursing) Program. No sweat. All it required: Start running and don't stop\u2014utilize early entrance, ROTC Basic Camp (a focused month of summer training in Fort Knox, KY), and various extra work to erase the two missed years and nurture Guest's voice as a \"strong yet empathetic\" commander of troops. Turn a night owl into a dawn worshiper, as in up at 5 a.m. for days that began at the School of Nursing and ended 15 hours later (and with a uniform change) in military history and leadership classes at the JHU Homewood Campus. \"That first semester was brutal! By 8 p.m., I was dead tired. \" (Still, mission accomplished.) At the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, Guest quickly earned her stripes as the glue between various organizations including the Black Student Nurses Association; as a mentor and an example to fellow students; and as the go-to in every situation\u2014from creating graphics for event fliers and launching her Fall 2019 cohort's Facebook page (now about 300 members strong) down to becoming a founder of the first nurse anesthesia interest group at the School of Nursing. \"I'm definitely an initiator,\" she explains. \"You know there's always someone in every group who thinks, 'Somebody else will do that. '\" Guess who: \"In every class, the teacher knows my hand will be up, asking questions that somebody else in the room might not be ready to ask, so we all learn together. \" This empathy is a key to both worlds Guest marches in. It allows her to lead troops because she's been in their boots and be a great teammate on any nursing team. And the extra leadership training through ROTC only adds to that built into any Johns Hopkins Nursing education. Guest has embraced the rigor of ROTC training as eagerly as that of her clinicals and nursing classes, acing all of it. (She credits an abbreviated, previous stint in medical school as a true boot camp in how to study.) And now she's ready to launch. Immediately following her graduation she will have met the final hurdle to earn her commission and will take the Oath of Office to be a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Nurse Corps (the first military officer in her family). Upon graduation and commission, Guest will take the N-CLEX and initiate her career with six months of training at a U.S. Army hospital in San Antonio, TX. As a reservist, Guest, who is from San Diego, CA, owes the Army one weekend a month (and two weeks each year for eight years, though she plans to extend that). Currently, Guest has embraced the rigor of ROTC training as eagerly as that of her clinicals and nursing classes, acing all of it.Master's Entry/ROTC path makes Tanzania Guest a first\u2014and she's only just begun to leadWE ARE ALL EAST BALTIMORE T ake-Charge Nurse BY STEVE ST.

Meanwhile, her JHSON synthesis practicum placement is at a trauma ICU at University of Maryland Medical Center. Oh, and she's got a job as a student nurse at another cardiac ICU. No matter the workload, Guest is thrilled to be doing hands-on nursing after COVID safety forced limited hours of actual practice. \"I'm gaining more confidence in myself and my nursing skills,\" she says. \"I feel so grateful ... and I'm ready. \" It wasn't the easy path, but Guest says she wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to other driven students who might otherwise struggle to make a nursing education work. And she has no plans to stop running, continuing on her path toward, she hopes, a doctor of nursing practice degree and a career as a certified registered nurse anesthetist. \"People say, 'Tanzania, you've been in school your whole life. Don't you want a break? Don't you want to start a family?'

And simply because you are a highly educated, English- speaking provider, it doesn't necessarily mean you are making any sense when you talk health care\u2014even to your English- speaking patients. Add unconscious bias, socioeconomic status, an almost unimaginably dense health care system. Throw in a language barrier, stigmas around narcotics use or jail time, and inequities/disparities that form these layers of separation from patients. To Professor Hae-Ra Han, PhD, MSN, RN, FAAN, who in July will become the Elsie M. Lawler Endowed Chair and assume the role of associate dean for community programs and initiatives at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing (JHSON), health literacy is not merely an essential avenue to improved health care for immigrant, impoverished, or otherwise at-risk populations. It is a two-way street. \"We think we are being precise in our explanations. \" But patients can nonetheless walk away dumbfounded. \"I have been struck by all of these not-so-optimal health interactions that are so common among minority patients, before you even bring in the language barrier. \" Han grew up in South Korea, which provides its citizens with access to nationalized health care. Later, while she earned a doctorate in the U.S., she was lucky enough not to need much medical care. So her \"A-ha!\" moment didn't come until she started a family here. \"I had my first close encounters with the U.S. health care system,\" she remembers. \"It is so confusing. All the separate appointments, keeping them straight. The bills just coming in from everywhere. ... It is very intimidating. \" And this for a freshly minted PhD, not someone with limited education or access. \"When the health care system presents itself as such an intimidating, ominous presence, you don't want to go see the doctor anymore. Of course, for people with chronic illness, this is not acceptable. \" This is where Han's fight begins, turning an impasse into a gateway: \"Health literacy and promotion are essential not just among patients but among health care providers as well. \" Her focus is steeled not by her own experiences alone but those of the communities she serves: chronic care for low-income patients and families living with diabetes, hypertension, and cancer, women living with HIV, and most recently, families struggling to recognize and treat early symptoms of dementia. \"It keeps me awake at night. 'What more can I do?'\" Her plan is to keep finding that out as Elsie M. Lawler Chair. \"First of all, I am proud for the personal recognition,\" Han says, \"and the money associated with that will allow for additional research activity. Dr. Phyllis Sharps [who retires this spring] has done so much work in the community. I am excited to take over the mission. \" She appreciates that she does not walk alone. \"I am so impressed with my amazing colleagues across the divisions of Johns Hopkins. ... I look forward to leveraging my position to promote further collaboration.

What was revealed: This was not simply a celebration of an eight-year term for Dean Patricia M. Davidson, PhD, MEd, RN, FAAN, coming to an end. That was just a masquerade. This was an outpouring of genuine thanks for a near- decade of friendship, leadership, and foresight; of action, not just words, to move the needle on diversity among the school's staff, faculty, student body, and curriculum; of faculty-student research collaboration and tireless mentoring and encouragement of researchers at all levels; of watching a new wing of the Pinkard Building rise in East Baltimore as a beacon to the community, to prospective students and faculty, and to any who seek to partner with the best minds that nursing has to offer; of common-sense leadership through a deadly pandemic.School of Nursing bids a spirited and fond farewell to a truly groundbreaking leader27 MAGAZINE.NURSING.JHU.EDU NEWS FROM JOHNS HOPKINS NURSING 26 NEWS FROM JOHNS HOPKINS NURSING JOHNS HOPKINS NURSING SPRING 2021Three CHEERSThe horns that blared that late-March day outside her Fells Point condominium were a noisy testament to Davidson taking her place among the great leaders in Johns Hopkins School of Nursing (JHSON) history even as she jets home to Australia and a new post as vice-chancellor at the University of Wollongong, her alma mater. Wollongong is also half a world closer to the new grandmother's growing family. \"I think for everybody, COVID has made people recognize the importance of family and friends, and it has been very hard when there has not been much global mobility,\" she told Australia's Illawarra Mercury . Davidson arrived in 2013 on the heels of the legendary Martha N. Hill, PhD, RN, FAAN, who had led the school to its first No. 1 U.S. News & World Report ranking and built the PhD program into a national model. Hill was a tough act to follow. What Davidson accomplished, while all but sealing the No. 1 ranking in concrete, was to literally and figuratively build on her predecessor's successes, and then forge her own identity, locally and globally. Now it is Davidson who leaves large shoes to fill. During her tenure, JHSON transitioned to an all-graduate nursing school, unveiling the MSN (Entry into Nursing) Program to chip away at a historic nursing shortage; a range of new graduate programs that have established notable collaborations across the university; exponential growth in numbers and quality of PhD and Doctor of Nursing Practice Programs; and that continued grasp on top national and international rankings while earning unprecedented levels of funding from the National Institutes of Health and other sources. \"For an Australian nurse who was a diploma nurse, from Wollongong Hospital, to end up being the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, it just goes to show anyone can do anything, if you try and you surround yourself with people who support and enable you,\" Davidson told the Australian Nursing & Midwifery Journal . In Baltimore, Davidson tried to do more than just anything. Everything is actually more her style. Davidson serves as secretary general of the Secretariat of the World Health Organizations Collaborating Centers for Nursing and Midwifery, counsel general of the International Council on Women's Health Issues, and a past board member of the Consortium of Universities for Global Health (CUGH), recently earning that organization's Distinguished Leadership Award (Read more on Page 32). She also serves on the Board of Health Care Services for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and is a member of Sigma Theta Tau International's Institute for Global Healthcare Leadership Advisory Board. Oh, and in 2016, Davidson was the first nurse to earn the Australian Museum Eureka Prize for Outstanding Mentorship of Young Researchers, one of Australia's most prestigious scientific awards. A tireless jet-setter (pre-COVID), Davidson has been a sought-after guest and speaker at international gatherings where she has spread the word not only on her specialties\u2014palliative care and cardiovascular health among women and vulnerable populations in particular\u2014but also the something special that she was developing in East Baltimore. Her evangelism (most recently via Zoom, of course) has set JHSON on a path to an ever greater global standing. In Australia, they are learning: \"Professor Davidson has been described by her Hopkins colleagues as being truly transformative in taking Hopkins \" I am so thankful for the trust placed in me to lead this exceptional school. \" 29 MAGAZINE.NURSING.JHU.EDU NEWS FROM JOHNS HOPKINS NURSING 28 JOHNS HOPKINS NURSING SPRING 2021 NEWS FROM JOHNS HOPKINS NURSINGNursing to a higher level,\" University of Wollongong Chancellor Jillian Broadbent said in announcing the hiring. \"She brings passion, energy, knowledge, and leadership together with strong financial disciplines.\" In Baltimore, we already know it. \"There isn't enough time to discuss the importance you have had across Johns Hopkins Nursing,\" said Deborah Baker, DNP , RN, NEA-BC, senior vice president for nursing for the Johns Hopkins Health System and vice president of nursing and patient care services for Johns Hopkins Hospital, at a farewell Zoom call in March. \"I will sorely miss Baltimore and my many friends and will always be a passionate advocate for the university and the values that guide our work,\" Davidson says. \"I am so thankful for the trust placed in me to lead this exceptional school.\" As for the students she has recruited to JHSON, or mentored once they've gotten here, Davidson puts the credit for their success back on them. \"The students are phenomenal,\" she says. \"If you come to Johns Hopkins, you come to do the work. Most importantly, you never do anything alone.\" Davidson will continue to serve through the spring as co-chair of the Johns Hopkins Roadmap 2020 Task Force, charged with examining and renewing the goals of the JHU Roadmap on Diversity and Inclusion and deepening efforts to advance equity and access. A main reason Wollongong selected her, in addition to higher education leadership experience and depth of knowledge in the health sciences, is her commitment to diversity and inclusion. \"Patricia Davidson has made an indelible impact on our school, local community, and the world,\" insists Professor Phyllis Sharps, PhD, MSN, RN, FAAN, associate dean for Community Programs and Initiatives. \"But perhaps one of her greatest accomplishments has been her ability to lead with humility and to make others feel welcomed and valued.\" Davidson, who earned a PhD in behavioral science from the University of Newcastle in Australia in addition to her Wollongong degrees, has co-authored more than 500 peer-reviewed journal articles and 29 book chapters. She is a member of Sigma Theta Tau International's Institute for Global Healthcare Leadership Advisory Board. Like those circling and honking in Fells Point, she understands the feelings of loss at JHSON. Yet after a year under COVID, Davidson understands what's far more important: moving forward. \"We all stand on the shoulders of giants. With each new dean, the school simply goes from strength to strength. The future for the school is bright.\" Patricia M.

The efforts have included first accepting that structural racism, LBGTQ insensitivity, and other social inequities exist and embracing the challenge of beginning to eradicate them. JHSON has sought to define diversity, encapsulating it where it lives and where it doesn't, not shrinking from responsibility for it, and bringing it into the open. With students it means casting a broader net, as with the Baltimore Talent Scholars program, which brings city high schoolers with an interest in health care into the MSN (Entry into Nursing) Program and nurturing them so that they succeed. It is being open to the need for more men in the nursing field. It is seeking out and embracing excellent students from various backgrounds regardless of socioeconomic status so that the Johns Hopkins Nurses sent into the workforce best represent the communities JHSON and they will serve. With faculty this means, among other genuine measures, bringing in more diverse teachers at all levels and then making the newcomers feel not just welcome but part of the decision-making team. JHSON faculty are not just a positive number on the diversity scale but essential to the JHSON mission. For curriculum, it means no sacred cows. (Below, read a bit more about efforts to remove ingrained racism from textbooks, from lectures, and all JHSON curricula.) It means bringing issues into the sunlight. In this spirit, JHSON has launched a web and social media campaign, #WeAreHopkinsNursing\u2014nursing.jhu.edu/ WeAreHopkinsNursing\u2014to showcase successes (three consecutive HEED Awards for Diversity in Education and counting, for instance) and examine openly where the school has faltered in the past and detail what JHSON is doing about it. JHSON will remain proud of its progress on diversity, equity, and inclusion while learning from and with other nursing schools (and from within its own ranks) and remaining open to the work, soul searching, and determination to witness\u2014and lead\u2014change.

For instance, nursing textbooks can present race as a biological risk factor in disease instead of recognizing racism, historical injustice, and social determinants of health as drivers of illness. Additionally, textbooks often depict pregnancy as an experience restricted to cisgender women. These descriptions result in a greater likelihood that our future patients will experience medical bias and mistreatment, which may lead to poor health outcomes. What's more, it invalidates and stigmatizes the lived experiences of students from underrepresented backgrounds. Excerpt from \"Heavy Reading,\" a Dialogues in Health Equity blog.

Nominate an outstanding Johns Hopkins Nurse by emailing DAISY AWARD@JHMI.EDU LETTER FROM DEBORAH BAKER 38 DAISY AWARDS 40 JHPIEGO'S PANDORA HARDTMAN 4236 NEWS FROM JOHNS HOPKINS NURSING MAGAZINE.NURSING.JHU.EDUNEWS FROM JOHNS HOPKINS NURSING JOHNS HOPKINS NURSING SPRING 2021It is hard to believe that we have been in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic for over a year. In some ways it feels like so much longer; in others like the time has gone by unbelievably fast. It seems an eternity since we last ate inside restaurants or hugged a friend outside of our \"bubble.\" Yet, the speed of change we have experienced as nurses and throughout the health care industry in the past year has been incredible. There are numerous examples of these points of pride in which nurses designed and have led novel approaches to care. Prior to the pandemic, I remember feeling so proud that the World Health Organization had designated 2020 as the International Year of the Nurse and Midwife and excited for the long-deserved recognition. Then, none of us could have imagined the spotlight that would be shone on our profession due to COVID-19. Nurses at Johns Hopkins and across the globe have played an indispensable role fighting for the health of their patients and to stay safe while battling this virus. And it is an honor that the International Year of the Nurse and Midwife has been extended through 2021. As nurses, we have been on the frontlines of this pandemic since Day One. Every nurse at Johns Hopkins has contributed to the complex and multidisciplinary efforts to implement a safe environment for COVID and non-COVID care. Nurses on COVID-designated units like Nelson 5 at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, an immediate care unit among the first at the hospital to care for COVID patients, had to quickly learn new skills, procedures, and workflows\u2014and directions: new walls to maintain negative pressure; the latest safety protocols; how to properly don and doff personal protective equipment (PPE). When ICU beds throughout the hospital started to fill up, these nurses rose up, partnering with nurses from other ICUs to care for these critically ill COVID patients and gradually being upskilled with the training and knowledge to care for ICU-level patients themselves. At Sibley Memorial Hospital, medical/surgical Unit 7B has been the hospital's COVID-designated unit. Recently, as the number of COVID patients at the hospital has dropped (fingers crossed), nurses on 7B have begun to care for COVID patients across all levels of care, not just the most critically ill. Elsewhere, nurses have taken on new roles, developed new processes, and done whatever was Hope Springs Eternalneeded to respond to the challenges we were facing. As COVID patients filled our hospital beds, nurses in the Johns Hopkins Children Center stepped up to care for adult patients. Johns Hopkins Hospital nurses led the creation of a \"prone team,\" relieving pressure on the lungs of COVID patients in crisis by placing them on their stomachs. When elective procedures were canceled out of an abundance of caution, operating room and other procedural area nurses were redeployed. Nurses served as safety officers, ensuring staff were wearing proper PPE to follow evolving safety protocols. Nurses designed and ran testing tents throughout the heat of the summer and chill of the winter. At Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, care teams repurposed its community \"Care-a-Van,\" a free, mobile medical unit, as a drive-through COVID-19 testing site, one of the area's first. As of February 2021, it had conducted more than 25,000 tests. Nurses helped set up mobile clinics to care for the most underserved and high-risk populations in senior housing facilities. And they were a part of \"Go Teams\" deployed to nursing homes, shelters, and other areas to COVID test vulnerable populations. Some spots they visited had positivity rates above 50 percent, yet they went willingly. These are just some examples of the countless ways nurses across the Johns Hopkins Health System have stepped up to confront a largely unknown adversary with bravery, strength, humility, and humanity. We have been the mothers, brothers, fathers, sisters, friends at the side of a patient's bed when their own loved ones could not be there. We have adapted and persevered, as that is what Johns Hopkins Nurses do. Now we are finally starting to see the light on the other side of a seemingly endless tunnel. It would have been nearly impossible to imagine, this time last year, that we would be deploying nurses to work in COVID-19 vaccination clinics and that many of us would ourselves be fully vaccinated. Recently, I spent a weekend with JHSON Dean Patricia Davidson and Kevin Sowers, president of the Johns Hopkins Health System, administering vaccinations at a clinic in Washington, DC for homebound patients. I can honestly say that it was the most meaningful thing I have done in the past year. So many Johns Hopkins Nurses can match that. As we enter spring, a time of renewal and growth, I am filled with a sense of hope for what our future holds. We have been tested and continue to rise to the challenges. While we are not at the finish line yet, it is visible in the distance. \"Caring for Ourselves and Each Other\" is the theme of our Nurses Week celebrations this year, a chance to recommit to our personal and communal health. I hope all nurses are able to take time to focus on their own health and resilience as we emerge from the difficulties of the past year. I am so grateful for every Johns Hopkins Nurse who, despite the fear, sacrifice, and loss experienced this year, never gave up on our patients or each other. Thank you for your strength, courage, and dedication. And thank you for being a Johns Hopkins Nurse.

His letter tells how Warczynski's persistence and determination to see him through were all the strength he needed to heal and get back to his life. \"Tam persevered with me\u2014through three major surgeries, with two major complications, nerves that made it impossible to sleep\u2014and she held my hand when my family was not close. Tam is one-of-a-kind.\" 2020 T eam Award | Nelson 5 The Johns Hopkins Hospital's first DAISY Team Award went to the staff of Nelson 5, one of the first units to care for COVID-19 patients when the epidemic reached East Baltimore back in March 2020, continuing to do so today. Deborah Baker said of the \"incredible\" Nelson 5 team: \"Every staff member on this unit has displayed incredible strength, dedication, and fortitude, and we are profoundly grateful for all you have done and continue to do to care for your patients and each other.\" Summer 2020 | Rachel Anderson A patient had received a life-changing diagnosis. As he lay in a hospital bed of the Neurosciences Critical Care Unit after surgery, without family near due to COVID-19 restrictions, he met Rachel Anderson. Sensing his distress, Anderson reassured him by sharing that she had been through the same procedure and that it would in fact get better. \"She had given me hope and inspiration when I felt so alone, broken, and in despair,\" the patient wrote in his DAISY nomination letter. \"I will never forget how she made me feel.\" Recognizing Johns Hopkins Hospital nurses for skilled, compassionate care that goes far beyond the call of dutyrepresent the organization on global health workforce issues, and address inequities in care. She's not in midwifery for the simple pleasure of holding newborns\u2014 she likes babies well enough, having helped to deliver thousands, and, with the assistance of a midwife, having had a son and a daughter. Rather, it's women, especially those from underserved populations, who motivate her. \"It's the totality of the entire reproductive life course of women that keeps me coming back,\" she says, \"from teaching an 11-year-old about her cycle and trying to pull away some of the mystique and the horror of menstrual bleeding, through supporting a menopausal woman with her changes. I try to help them to lean into their intuition, and not just for labor pain. I say: 'The same skills that you use to get through a birth are your life skills; it's no different.'\" Advocating for women also means fighting on behalf of her profession, which is largely female, and long has been mired in turf wars with those who seek to obstruct midwives from fully practicing and using their skills to the max. There's an urgent need, she says, for politically savvy midwives to confront stubborn professional roadblocks by moving into spaces that are outside the clinic and labor setting and occupying regulatory spaces where scopes of practice and legal rights are determined. \"My push,\" she says, \"is for qualified midwives to be more involved in program planning, design, and implementation.\" A fellow of the American College of Nurse-Midwives and representative of the North America/Caribbean region on the ICM board, Hardtman balances her time between sitting at the bedside with women, strategizing about how to move her profession forward, and speaking out about compensation, working conditions, and integration into the prevailing medicalized system. The ages-old profession of midwifery is changing, she says, and will continue to evolve as science marries the art of the practice. Still, at its core is a simple and pure act, Hardtman contends: \"Being present, being in that quiet space with women and families, being the keeper of secrets.\" Maryalice Yakutchik is the communications manager for Jhpiego.When Jhpiego's new chief nursing and midwifery officer reminisces about her earliest influences, a kindly, senior midwife comes to mind. Her name was Iris, says Pandora Hardtman, DNP , CNM, RN. She wore a blue uniform. Navy blue, Hardtman clarifies. Dark and stark. Not like the almost iridescent iris shade of dress (and matching lipstick) that Hardtman happens to be wearing during a Zoom meet-and-greet with new colleagues. And not like the shimmering turquoise of the sea that surrounds the pink sand island of Bermuda, where midwives like Iris were a mainstay in bustling health department offices, full of people seeking all manner of care. They also held sway at the local hospital where Hardtman volunteered as a young girl and first saw a baby being born. Midwifery appealed to her early on, Hardtman says. It offered the prospect of a professional title and decent living wage. And, more importantly, a promise to never be bored. \"I always thought of it as a fate worse than death,\" she says, \"to be stuck in one office, in one place, forever.\" In the past two decades, prior to joining Jhpiego, this Johns Hopkins School of Nursing alumna (RN to BSN '96) was a globetrotting midwife educator and consultant working in Bangladesh, Rwanda, Nigeria, Indonesia, Mongolia, and on the Turkish-Syrian border, where she met midwives whose perilous journeys from their war-torn country reduced her to tears. Far-flung conflict zones notwithstanding, the world is full of risky places to give birth. You can find them right here in the United States where, not incidentally, women of color fare worse than others. Hardtman, whose clinical midwifery practice is based at the Atlanta Medical Center, co-authored a recent piece with Franka Cad\u00e9e, president of the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM), that points out, \"During the Black Lives Matter movement, inside the confines of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we've been painfully reminded of the distressing maternal health outcomes for black American women highlighted in media reports, political speeches, and within the communities impacted by their real-life consequences.\" Hardtman had a job in Pakistan lined up when she applied to the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing (JHSON), which she considered \"a long shot that was way over my budget.\" When both an acceptance and scholarship money came through, she made her way from Bermuda to Baltimore. \"[JHSON] taught me to be an outlier and to speak out,\" she recalls. At Jhpiego, Hardtman will drive Jhpiego's strategic initiatives on building a confident, skilled clinical nursing and midwifery workforce worldwide, develop nursing and midwifery leaders globally, strengthen the respective professional associations, After decades of globetrotting, JHSON alumna Pandora Hardtman joins Jhpiego as nursing and midwifery officer Position of STRENGTH Opposite page: Pandora Hardtman cared for Syrian mothers and taught midwives on the Turkish border (2018).

But we have gotten used to\u2014and maybe even spoiled by\u2014such impact from our deans and faculty leaders. So as we bid Dean Davidson farewell, we should count our blessings and be ready to support the incoming fifth dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing. Our deans have been a big reason for the school's No. 1 ranking. But we as alumni are no less crucial to the present and the future of our alma mater. I think I speak for all of us when I say we are excited and eager to meet the next great leader of Johns Hopkins Nursing. Stay tuned. Just a year ago, the World Health Organization declared 2020 as the Year of the Nurse and Midwife, and right on the heels of that special recognition of nurses, the COVID pandemic was declared. And that pandemic revealed to everyone who did not already know it that nurses really are very special health professionals. Changes in hospitals to manage the number of highly infectious patients with critical illness was challenging for nurses and the entire health care system. Nurses faced stresses from work demands, personal fears of bringing the virus home to family members, children being home-schooled, and in some cases actual COVID-19 infection. Nurses have survived! Finally, vaccines are being administered and deaths are decreasing, though new infections remain a worry. It is important to celebrate being a nurse and all of your work during the pandemic. Nurses Week (May 6-12) should have special significance this year, so please accept the accolades that come your way and toast your survival of a unique year. #WeGotThis. The alumni association continued its student mentoring program this year, and expanded the mentorship program to students in the DNP Advanced Practice and DNP Executive programs. The mentorship program, hosted through OneHop, matched 25 students and alumni together. We are excited to learn about these experiences and have communications and check-ins planned for the pairs throughout the spring. Other opportunities for alumni to serve as mentors exist through OneHop. Consider signing up and being available for interactions with students at onehop.jhu.edu. Usually at this time of year, Alumni Weekend planning is in full swing. Discussions about when we can confidently plan an in-person event are occurring. Alumni Weekend will occur this fall, but it is highly likely that a virtual format will be chosen once again. Please stay tuned for more information about Alumni Weekend, and about how our 50-year reunion alumni will be recognized. Get Our E-Newsletters Stay in touch!

BALL, DRPH, MPH, RNALUMNI UPDATE 49 MAGAZINE.NURSING.JHU.EDU NEWS FROM JOHNS HOPKINS NURSING 48 NEWS FROM JOHNS HOPKINS NURSING From just outside her office, Sharon Trivino can look across a revitalized Courtyard at a gleaming new structure that has transformed the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing into an even more powerful magnet for new students and global research. In the reflection of its glass exterior she sees this, yes, but also new possibilities for bringing together all those who have called the East Baltimore campus home since many decades before ground was broken for the new space. The wing represents another pinnacle of success for the school, which finds itself in solid fiscal shape despite a pandemic that left East Baltimore\u2014and the Pinkard addition\u2014largely empty. As new associate dean for Development and Alumni Relations, Trivino can gaze out, acknowledge the sweet starting point she finds herself at, and then asks herself, OK, what is 'up' from here? \"There are so many reasons why the school is at the top of its game ... the incredible faculty, students, and staff, and bold vision and leadership from Dean Davidson. I am really humbled to join this school,\" explains Trivino.\"There is tremendous opportunity to continue growing philanthropic support and engagement, especially at a time when the nursing profession has gained such visibility and much-deserved appreciation throughout the pandemic. I am really excited to help connect alumni and friends with opportunities to support our mission in ways that are meaningful to them.\" It is a delicate dance, cultivating and celebrating the intense loyalty and friendship toward JHSON among its alumni while insuring the school's fiscal stability into the future\u2014by asking those same graduates to fund scholarships and otherwise financially support betterment of faculty, student recruitment, curriculum, opportunity, and then continue to house the student body in a learning center beyond compare. It is also, of course, rewarding as heck. And those friendships made last literally a lifetime. \"One of the greatest parts of my job is building relationships to the institution, and seeing donors recognize the impact that they can have through their engagement and philanthropy,\" according to Trivino. \"It is really incredible and inspiring to see highly engaged alumni connect back to the school to support future generations of nursing leaders following in their footsteps.\" \"We are incredibly excited to welcome Sharon Trivino to the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing,\" says Dean Patricia Davidson, PhD, MEd, RN, FAAN. \"At this critically important time in health care, her experience, drive, and creativity will help our school expand partnerships, locally and globally, and further our commitment to student and alumni success, nursing education, and the profession.\" Trivino most recently served as director of Development and Alumni Relations at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. During her five years at that school, she oversaw its direct fundraising efforts, collaborated with senior leadership, worked closely with its volunteer boards, contributed to diversity and inclusion efforts, and launched programs including regional clubs and affinity networks. She was also recipient of the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School Innovator Award for her outstanding work in leading a student engagement and philanthropy initiative. She earned a bachelor of arts degree from Princeton University and a master of business administration from Columbia Business School.
