Scientists around the world said while it was important to monitor BA.2.86, numbers are low and it was unlikely to cause a devastating wave of severe disease and death given immune defenses built up worldwide from vaccination and prior infection. - Switzerland will no longer issue or verify Covid-19 certificates from September, the government said on August 16. The system and its technical infrastructure will cease to operate at the end of August. This decision is linked to the expiration of the legal basis for the European Union's digital Covid certificate at the end of June and in view of the stable epidemiological situation, the authorities said. - The Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) said on April 3, 2023 that no Covid-19 vaccination is recommended for spring/summer 2023. \"Nearly everyone in Switzerland has been vaccinated and/or contracted and recovered from Covid-19. Their immune system has therefore been exposed to the coronavirus. In spring/summer 2023, the virus will likely circulate less,\" the FOPH wrote. - The number of new lab-confirmed Covid infections fell considerably after federal authorities stopped covering the costs of tests on January 1, 2023. The FOPH said it expected to see a \"corresponding reduction in the volumes of tests conducted and increases in the estimated numbers of unrecorded cases\". - Consequently, SWI has decided to no longer provide an update of weekly Covid infections or related graphics until further notice. For more information on the latest Covid statistics in Switzerland, [please consult the FOPH site \"COVID-19 Switzerland\"External link](https://www.covid19.admin.ch/en/overview) - Travellers from China entering Switzerland would not be required to undergo compulsory testing for Covid-19, the Swiss government said on January 11. The Omicron variants circulating in China represented \"only a small risk to the Swiss population and the Swiss health system\". - All remaining Covid prevention measures [were lifted](/eng/switzerland-to-drop-all-remaining-covid-restrictions/47476688)on April 1, 2022. Masks are no longer required on public transport, and there is no more five-day isolation requirement for positive cases. Health-related restrictions for incoming travellers were lifted in February. - More than 13,900 people have died in connection with Covid-19 in Switzerland, which has a population of 8.7 million. - Around 69% of the population has received two doses of vaccine. What's the virus situation? The number of newly reported coronavirus infections and hospital admissions started rising again in September 2022 before declining in December. Health officials said at the end of October they feared there were a high number of unreported cases. Omicron BA.5 remains the dominant variant. The number of new lab-confirmed cases fell considerably since the start of 2023 when federal authorities stopped covering the costs of tests. Since April 2022 [the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH)External link](https://www.covid19.admin.ch/en/overview) has been communicating Covid statistics only once a week. Delays in data transmission and retroactive corrections may explain some discrepancies in the figures. In summer 2022 the president of the Swiss Conference of Cantonal Health Directors, Lukas Engelberger, said he expected an increase in the number of cases with the arrival of the cold season. But he told [BlickExternal link](https://www.blick.ch/fr/news/suisse/le-ministre-balois-de-la-sante-lukas-engelberger-nous-devrons-sans-doute-reporter-des-masques-cet-hiver-id17829126.html) the pandemic situation would be better this year due to better preparation and stronger immunity in the community. Around 97% of the Swiss population (8.7 million) have developed antibodies against the virus via vaccination or infection. However, the long-term consequences of the pandemic continue to cause concern. Out of 100 Covid patients, 25 have not recovered six months later and three still suffer from serious persistent health problems. The main reported long Covid symptoms are fatigue, mental stress, shortness of breath, loss of taste and smell, concentration and memory problems as well as chest or other pains. Longer-term, the coronavirus will most likely not disappear, the government has said, but become endemic with seasonal waves likely in future. Latest health measures Since April 1, 2022, there have been no pandemic restrictions in Switzerland. On March 30, 2022, the government announced that the last remaining measures would be dropped, specifically the mask requirement in public transport and health facilities, and the mandatory five-day isolation requirement after a positive test. Since February 17, 2022, people no longer have to show a Covid certificate to enter bars, restaurants and other indoor venues such as sports facilities, theatres or concert halls. There is also no further restrictions on the size of private gatherings, while large events no longer have to apply for authorisation. Responsibility for containing the virus has been handed over to cantonal authorities, with a phase of heightened vigilance planned through winter 2022-2023. Vaccination and treatment The FOPH says that \"in principle, no Covid-19 vaccination is recommended for spring/summer 2023\", given that most people in the country have come into contact with the virus through vaccination or infection.. However, for autumn 2023, the recommendation \"will be evaluated again and adjusted accordingly\". Vaccination for high-risk people is also currently (April 2023) not recommended, but these people can do so following consultation with their doctor, the FOPH wrote. Around 69% of the population have been fully vaccinated (two doses). So far, four vaccines have been approved in Switzerland: Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, both of which have also been approved for use on children (age five and above) and teenagers; the single-dose Janssen vaccine produced by Johnson & Johnson; and the protein-based Nuvaxovid vaccine, approved in April 2022. Medical regulator Swissmedic is also examining the application for authorisation of a bivalent vaccine from Moderna, which aims to be more effective against the new Omicron variants as well as protecting against the original variants. Authorities ordered 36 million doses from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Curevac and Novavax for the population of 8.7 million. In August 2021, the government signed a deal with Pfizer/BioNTech to supply vaccines for the next two years. Since January 1, 2023, anyone who takes a Covid test must pay for it themselves. Health insurance will cover the test costs only in individual cases - namely if a positive test leads to medical treatment. Travel to and from Switzerland On May 2, 2022, Switzerland lifted all remaining Covid-related entry requirements for travellers entering the country, regardless of country of origin. Since February 17, health-related measures for people entering the country have also [been liftedExternal link](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-lifts-most-covid-19-restrictions/47352480?utm_campaign=teaser-in-channel&utm_medium=display&utm_content=o&utm_source=swissinfoch).
