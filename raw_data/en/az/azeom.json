And while experts love protein for its ability to keep you satiated, build muscle, and repair tissues, not all protein powders are created equal. (Looking at you, added sugars and hard-to-pronounce ingredients!) If you're trying to lose weight, it's especially helpful to know how to shop for the best powders and which ones to buy. Protein can aid weight loss by keeping us full and satisfied, according to [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-much-protein-to-eat-to-lose-weight/). \"This is because protein powder can be used to supplement protein intake throughout the day, which can help to curb appetite and promote controlled caloric intake,\" says MS, RD](https://omniic.com/staff_members/crystal-zabka-belsky/). also help you build and maintain [muscle mass](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a28133423/how-to-build-muscle-women/) when consumed in appropriate doses, Zabka-Belsky adds. \"Protein dosing promotes ideal lean muscle protein synthesis, which will ultimately result in the enhancement of metabolism.\" Shop the best protein powders for weight loss, below: Another pro of using protein powders: They can help boost your [amino acid](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a19962078/amino-acid-workout-boost/) levels, says dietitian [Laurie Schubert, PhD, RD](https://nutritionheartbeat.com/about-laurie). Your body can only produce 11 out of the 20 essential amino acids it needs, so the remaining nine must come from food. Insufficient amino acids from protein can slow down cell function, making weight loss more challenging, as these cells help regulate hunger signals in the brain. \"If you are trying to change your body composition, protein powder can be beneficial,\" adds Schubert. But protein powder alone won't kickstart the weight loss process. \"Weight loss is more about calorie balance than anything else,\" she notes. Ahead, check out 12 protein powders recommended by registered dieticians. 1. [Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Isolate](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002DYIZHQ) \"This protein powder is a mixture of whey protein and hydrolyzed isolate, which means it is not only quickly digested, but also contains a higher amount of protein per serving than regular whey protein,\" says dietitian [Jonathan Valdez, RDN](https://www.genki-nutrition.com/). \"This is great for [building lean muscle.](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a28133423/how-to-build-muscle-women/) He tells us that it is also low fat and only contains a gram of carbohydrates for anyone watching their carb intake. Rave Review: \"This protein powder is a game-changer for anyone looking to boost their fitness goals and build muscle. The flavor of this protein powder is absolutely delicious.

I'm 63 and due to age, hormones, and stress, my hair was falling out in gobs. I went from way too much hair to such thinning hair\u2014I was constantly touching it, trying to fluff it up and cover my ears. Finally, I went to the dermatologist and she suggested collagen powder. After two containers, she could see one to two inches of new hair growth!\" 3. [Orgain Grass-Fed Whey](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AAFZYQY) TBH, tasty protein powders are often hard to come by, but Orgain is a superior option according to dietitian [Lisa Moskovitz, RD](https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/lisa). Snag this one when you want protein powder that tastes great without any artificial ingredients or flavors. It's also free of any added sugars, so you can rest assured knowing there's no unwanted ingredients hiding in your powder. Rave Review: \"I use two scoops in a smoothie every morning. It tastes very clean and fresh, never upsets my stomach, and really sets me up for the day. I don't get hunger pangs and I feel I am doing something positive for my body. It is more expensive than other brands out there, but I tested a few and often found a chemical taste. Not with this one!\" 4. [Quest Multi-Purpose Mix](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L8W2VGZ) Adding powder to smoothies is nice and all, but this one can be baked into peanut butter bars or even tossed into a tomato sauce. \"One scoop has only 100 calories and no sugar since it's simply pure protein, which makes it a perfect addition to any recipe to increase its nutrient density,\" says dietitian [Kristin Kirkpatrick, MS, RDN](https://www.kristinkirkpatrick.com/). it with almond milk and sugar-free peanut butter. OMG. It literally tastes like you're drinking the milk of a Cinnamon Toast Crunch bowl of cereal! Although it can be expensive, Quest has given me so many things that I truly love and enjoy.

[Garden Of Life Raw Organic Meal](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007S6Y74O) \"This vegan protein powder is made from a blend of pea protein and brown rice protein,\" says Valdez. \"It also has a combination of whole grains, including millet, quinoa, amaranth, as well as seeds like chia, flax, and lentil.\" The diverse protein blend makes it super filling. Even though it's marketed as a meal replacement, remember that protein shakes should be more of a supplement to your meals, or eaten as a snack. Rave Review: \"I have tried Slimfast, Herbalife, and Shakeology, but this is the only one where I am actually full after. The other ones felt more like drinking a glass of milk. With this one, I am not hungry for hours afterwards. I blend mine with frozen berries and a little milk.\" 6.

The blend contains hydrolyzed [collagen](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a36903070/vegan-collagen/), so you'll be giving some extra support to your gut and skin, too. Reviewers also love that it's made with natural ingredients, but note that this protein is not suitable for vegetarians as it's made from chicken and beef. Rave Review: \"This is my first time using a bone broth powder. I struggle with MAJOR digestive issues. I tolerate this powder well. It blends great into my smoothies. On taste alone, this is delightful. I'm anxious to try it in baked goods. I do feel like it's quite pricey, but worth it if it does what it says and is sourced from good-quality ingredients.\" Instead of adding a spoonful of honey or cocoa powder to your [morning oatmeal](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a19945066/ruining-your-oatmeal/), [Leah Kaufman, RD](http://www.leahkaufman.com/), a nutritionist in New York City, suggests sprinkling a serving of this powder on top.

[Naked Egg Protein Powder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E4XSABY) \"Naked Nutrition uses clean ingredients and non-GMO eggs, and the only other ingredient besides egg white powder is sunflower lecithin,\" says Collingwood. \"It doesn't have any added sweeteners or colors, and it packs 25 grams of protein for 110 calories.\" If you want something simple with no frills or added ingredients, you'll love mixing this into your routine. People who don't have a sweet tooth especially love Naked Nutrition's powder. Rave Review: \"I lift weights and find it difficult to stuff in all the calories I need during the day to feed my muscles, so I toss the egg white powder in with my whey protein shake and double the protein in one shake. Eggs contain branch chain amino acids which are important for muscle-building, so this is quite helpful.\" 10. [Navitas Essential Superfood Blend](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071R5PV1Y) \"This is a great vegan blend that consists of pea, pumpkin seed, sunflower seeds, flax, and hemp,\" says dietitian [Lauren Antonucci, RDN](https://www.nutritionenergy.com/lauren-antonucci.html). She points out that the blend also has added greens for fiber, as well as [probiotics for gut health](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a19927568/foods-high-in-probiotics/).

Reviewers love that it doesn't have a grainy texture or funny aftertaste, like many other protein powders do. Rave Review: \"I work out five days a week and this stuff is easy on the stomach and tastes great. It helps me achieve my daily protein intake goals. I do one and a half scoops a day and do the subscription service to save money and avoid running out. Works great!\" 12. [NOW Sports Soy Protein Isolate](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001TRT1I) This unflavored soy protein powder offers 20 grams of protein, which is helpful for keeping you full, says dietitian [Starla Garcia, RD](https://thehealthyshine.com/). She recommends adding this to a smoothie with fruits and veggies to bump up the fiber count and extend how long you'll stay full. Since it's unflavored, it's an easy one to add to baked goods, too. If you're looking for a super low-cal option, this powder is the lowest on this list. Rave Review: \"I have IBS and so far, this is the only powder I have found that doesn't cause digestive issues for me. I add it to my smoothie with some fruit and the taste turns out great. I love the fact that it doesn't have additives and sugars.\" How Our Team Chose The Best Protein Powders For Weight Loss For the past few years, Women's Health editors, including associate e-commerce editor Lily Wohlner and editorial assistant Addison Aloian, researched the bestselling, most popular, and top-rated protein powders for weight loss. Our team consulted many nutritionists and trainers, and then evaluated thousands of customer reviews and ratings to narrow down the best protein powders for a range of dietary preferences. What is protein powder? \"Protein powder is an isolated version of protein intended to boost overall protein intake without having to consume the whole food source of the protein,\" says Zabka-Belsky. However, remember that it's a supplement, and shouldn't always be consumed in place of real, whole foods that also contain protein. When choosing a protein powder, some important concepts should be considered, explains Zabka-Belsky. First, she tells us to check if it comes from a complete protein source, such as meat, fish, dairy, or eggs. \"Common derivatives from these sources are casein and whey, both milk proteins,\" she says. She also recommends considering the leucine content, a crucial amino acid for muscle protein synthesis. \"Whey outperforms casein in this aspect, making it the preferred choice for boosting muscle growth,\" Zabka-Belsky explains. How does protein powder affect weight loss? \"The ingestion of protein supplements can be associated with weight loss in a variety of ways,\" says Zabka-Belsky. \"It can be used to reduce food cravings and grazing throughout the day and, when consumed in doses, it can promote consistent muscle protein synthesis, which enhances optimal muscle mass.\" What type of protein powder is best for weight loss? \"Whey is considered the fast-digesting protein intended for post-workout and daytime ingestion,\" says Zabka-Belsky. \"Casein, on the other hand, is recommended at the end of the day because it is slower digesting and promotes restful recovery overnight.\" How often should you have protein powder in a day? To get the most out of any protein powder, Schubert recommends only consuming one serving of it per day. The rest of your protein should come from [what you eat](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a19976015/high-protein-low-carbohydrate-foods/), which can provide additional nutrients you won't find anywhere else (even in the *best* powder). \"Drinking a protein shake after working out can help rebuild muscle while repairing connective tissue damage,\" Schubert adds. So, consider adding some of your favorite protein powder to your gym bag. Remember: Protein shakes shouldn't be used as a [meal replacement](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a32682832/best-meal-replacement-shakes/), says nutritionist [Megan Byrd, RD](https://theoregondietitian.com/about-me/). \"Protein powders don't have enough calories or nutrition to be actual meals,\" she adds. Instead, use them to make snacks like baked goods or smoothies more filling and adding to their nutritional value. What should you look for in a protein powder if you're trying to lose weight? First things first: Chosing a protein powder that is high in fiber, high in protein, and low in carbs, Byrd suggests. \"These types of protein powders will help keep you full longer, curb cravings, and help prevent sugar highs and crashes during the day,\" she explains. Opt for one that's unsweetened, because sneaky sugars can actually be sabotaging your weight loss efforts, Zeitlin adds. Here are some other things to keep in mind when making your pick: - Check the ingredients label. Make sure you look for something with at least 20 grams of protein, fewer than 10 grams of total carbohydrates, and at least three grams of fiber per scoop. You should also look for protein powders that are [naturally sweetened](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a36331560/healthy-sugar-substitutes/)using ingredients like monk fruit extract, stevia, and natural flavors. \"Avoid protein powders that use sucralose, sugar alcohols, aspartame, Splenda, and other artificial sweeteners,\" says Byrd. She also recommends avoiding milk powders, milk solids, and gluten since they are unnecessary fillers that can cause [bloating](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/g23692194/how-to-reduce-bloating/)and other GI issues. - Opt for a protein blend if you're going [plant-based](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a25804908/plant-based-diet/). Whey, casein, or egg-based proteins are complete proteins, meaning they have all nine essential amino acids that help your body better absorb and make the most of your protein source. If you want a plant-based protein, look for a blend (like pea and rice)\u2014these can also feature a complete amino acid profile. - Look for something with at least 100 to 150 calories per serving. This range is typically average for a protein powder, says Bryd. \"Anything lower, and I would question the ingredients and satiety. Anything higher and I would assume there are more fats and carbs than needed,\" explains Byrd. - Consider the flavor. If you're new to protein powder, start with classic flavors, like vanilla or [chocolate](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a34744166/spicy-chocolate-dipped-clementines-recipe/), says Byrd. And, if you don't enjoy them, you can use them up by mixing them into foods like pancakes, waffles, donuts, smoothies, and other baked goods. - Look for added benefits. \"It's always a bonus when protein powders have extra health benefits, such as added greens, prebiotics, probiotics, essential vitamins and minerals, and [electrolytes](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g29325002/best-electrolyte-drink/),\" Byrd points out.
