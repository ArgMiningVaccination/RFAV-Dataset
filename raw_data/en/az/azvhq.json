Both therapies work together simultaneously creating a synergistic effect resulting in much faster recovery time. Correction of one's structure often occurs more easily and with less discomfort. The positive results of chiropractic care lasts longer when muscle tension is released, which might otherwise pull one's structure back out of alignment. Therefore it is easy to see that chiropractic and massage therapy complement each other. The bottom line is that chiropractic and massage therapy are compatible forms of health care that share the goal of your total well-being, not simply an absence of illness. Both offer natural hands-on, drug-free techniques. They can be used as preventative as well as restorative therapies. When used in combination, they help you maintain your optimum health and enjoy life to the fullest! How Massage Therapy and Chiropractic Treatment Complement Each Other Since massage therapy is good for the nervous system it is usually done before chiropractic treatments are given. The adjustments are much more effective this way. Sometimes the body can be so stiff that it resists the adjustments. When it becomes relaxed through massage though, it allows the doctor of chiropractic to more easily realign various parts of it. Chiropractic treatment is useful for treating people that are under constant physical and/or mental stress. Massage therapy is part of this treatment because of its beneficial effects. A person can be healthy in every other way, but have physical pain caused by tightness and stress. Through massage and chiropractic techniques they can be helped. The massage when used with chiropractic treatments, is also good for physical injuries such as those that happen in car accidents. Also injuries can occur from sports, gardening, or a variety of other activities. The immune system is stimulated by massage and chiropractic treatments along with blood circulation. By doing massage you are using the body's natural energy to heal itself. Since the massage increases the blood flow it can also help relieve headaches. Many people suffer from these on a regular basis. The improved circulation helps to decrease the pain and stimulate nerve flow. You can see why the massage works so well with chiropractic treatments. You must be aware of the signs your body gives you for spinal stress, so that you can get to the chiropractor on time to get treatment. Your condition could worsen quickly otherwise. If you are experiencing pain on a day-to-day basis that is elevating to the point that you cannot tolerate it, it is time to seek out chiropractic treatment along with massage therapy. Spinal distress can bring on a tingling sensation in the legs, shoulder, and arms and sometimes even numbness. This is why it is important to address spinal problems immediately.
