The finding, published in [JAMA Pediatrics](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2784888?widget=personalizedcontent&previousarticle=2784889), joins a growing collection of studies examining the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on routine pediatric vaccine delivery. A [2021 survey](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/957023) from the Urban Institute that found that nearly one in five parents delayed or did not get care for their children in the past 12 months because of fear of exposure to the virus. \"We need to think about what additional interventions are needed to promote catch-up vaccination, especially for those at-risk populations that we saw were undervaccinated even prior to the pandemic,\" study author Malini B. DeSilva, MD, MPH, said in an interview. \"[That means] working creatively to ensure that all children would have the opportunity to receive these recommended vaccines.\" While examining data on pediatric vaccination of 1.4 million children between Jan. 5, 2020, and Oct. 3, 2020, across eight health systems in California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, Dr. DeSilva and colleagues saw vaccination administration rates return to near prepandemic levels after an initial decline, particularly after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines specified that in-person visits for children younger than 2 years should be prioritized. \"I think we've all been concerned and aware that people just weren't bringing their children to their pediatricians as frequently [caused by] the fear of being in medical settings during the heat of the pandemic,\" said James Schneider, MD, who was not involved with the study. \"So it's not surprising that we saw lower rates of overall vaccinations in all age groups.\" The current study found that lower vaccination rates persisted among most age groups from March to September 2020. However, during the period of expanded primary care, which took place between May and October 2020, vaccination administration rates in infants younger than 2 years old and children aged 4-6 years approached or were equal to 2019 rates. However, these rebounds were not enough to make up for the missed vaccines. Still, only 74% of infants reaching 7 months old in September 2020 were caught up on their vaccinations, compared with 81% of infants turning the same age in 2019. Researchers also found that, compared with 61% of infants reaching 18 months in September 2019, only 57% of 18-month-olds were up to date with vaccinations in September 2020. However, the proportion of 6-, 13-, and 18-year-olds up to date on vaccinations were about the same in 2020 and 2019. Racial disparities also persisted during this time, with Black children having the lowest proportion of up-to-date vaccinations for most ages from January to September 2020. Although these disparities were evident prior to the pandemic, these differences became more pronounced for the 18-month-old age group, where just 41% of Black infants were up to date in vaccinations, compared with 76% of Asian infants, 54% of Hispanics infants, and 56% of White infants. Dr. Schneider believes Dr. DeSilva's study is a \"robust\" one and paints an accurate picture of the pandemic's effect on pediatric vaccinations, despite examining data from just eight health systems. \"I think it's a fairly reasonable representation of what we already have been recognizing during the pandemic,\" he explained. \"Which is that people are really reluctant to go to their physicians' offices for routine care because of the fear of getting sick. I think the study emphasized the importance of catching these children up to keep them safe in the future.\" The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends a childhood immunization schedule that protects children against 14 infectious diseases before their second birthday. Since the on-time administration of these vaccines is essential for preventing communicable diseases, many pediatric offices are trying to ensure a safe environment for patients and families, said Dr. Schneider, chief of pediatric critical care at Cohen Children's Medical Center, New York. There's also some concern that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy my spillover into routine childhood vaccinations, especially for families who were already hesitant toward the routine well-established vaccine schedule for children. The CDC and AAP recommend that children continue to receive recommended vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic. To boost the number of children caught up on vaccinations, health system and community-level interventions are needed, especially in underserved communities, the researchers wrote. Additionally, enforcing mandates that require vaccination prior to school entry could also increase vaccine administration across populations and reduce disparities. The study emphasizes the \"immediate and lagging\" disruptions in the delivery of pediatric health care caused by the pandemic, which will likely have long-term consequences for pediatric health, Brian P. Jenssen, MD, MSHP, who was not involved in the study, wrote in a [solicited commentary](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2784889). However, interventions tailored to specific age groups could help remedy this. These include increasing the frequency of well-child care during the next year of life for infants younger than 24 months and prioritizing visits with 13-year-old adolescents who are behind on vaccinations. \"Although there is no evidence base for this approach, such a change could create not only catch-up opportunities for vaccination for children delayed at age 7 and 18 months, but also provide opportunities to attend to developmental concerns and social needs that have emerged during COVID-19,\" wrote Dr. Jenssen, a researcher and primary care pediatrician at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Other practices such as reaching out to patients and families directly via text message, email, or phone to \"notify them of needed vaccinations,\" vaccine mandates, and having pediatric health systems partner with alternative settings to promote vaccination could also get kids back on track, health wise. Furthermore, financial incentives from insurers or primary care practices also may help. \"The COVID-19 pandemic's lost care may have long-term consequences unless pediatric health care systems and child health advocates are proactive in engaging families to take advantage of every opportunity to catch up,\" Dr. Jenssen wrote.
