Among notable home remedy ingredients, black seed (nigella sativa) oil\u2014a therapeutic agent with strong medicinal properties\u2014has been used for centuries. In fact, research suggests the use of natural remedies from seeds, barks, fruits and other plant parts dates as far back as humans themselves. To date, black seed oil has many practical health and beauty applications. Here's what you need to know. What Is Black Seed Oil? Black seed oil is extracted from the seeds of the annual flowering plant Nigella sativa, also referred to as black seed or black cumin, says Loretta Pratt, M.D., a dual board-certified internal medicine physician and dermatologist at Advanced Dermatology PC in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. Native to Southern Europe, North Africa and Southwest Asia, black seed oil is used to treat a wide range of illnesses, including cardiovascular disorders, diabetes and cancers, among others, due to one of its main components, thymoquinone. Black seed oil is most commonly used in food, typically as a spice or preservative. It can also be taken orally in powder or oil form, or applied to the skin as a lotion or gel. What Are the Benefits of Black Seed Oil? Black seed oil has a range of health benefits, such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral and antimicrobial effects, rendering it useful for multiple medical conditions, according to Erum N. Ilyas, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology in Pennsylvania. Thymoquinone, the most abundant component in black seed oil, is responsible for most of these benefits, says Dr. Pratt. According to research, the compound has antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and liver- and kidney-protective properties that enhance the process of healing in a range of conditions, including [acne](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/acne/) and systemic illnesses like diabetes [[1]](#footnote_1). Skin conditions Due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects, black seed oil may help reduce symptoms of dermatological conditions like [psoriasis](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/psoriasis/), [eczema](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/eczema/), vitiligo and acne, says M.D., a board-certified dermatologist at La Jolla Dermatology and Laser Surgery Center in California. Eczema is an inflammatory skin condition that causes dry and itchy skin, scaly patches, blisters and, in severe cases, can make skin prone to infections. One study comparing the application of black seed oil versus topical steroid medication and over-the-counter (OTC) cream on hand eczema shows that black seed oil may be as effective as a steroid cream at treating and reducing the severity of eczema [[2]](#footnote_2). Psoriasis is a condition that causes the formation of itchy and/or sore patches of red skin with silver scales. A study of adults with moderate to severe psoriasis treated with a plant-based topical combination, in which black cumin is a main component, shows promising results. However further research is needed [[3]](#footnote_3). Vitiligo\u2014a chronic, autoimmune disorder characterized by pigment loss in patches of skin\u2014may also benefit from treatment with black seed oil, says Melanie Speed, a registered nurse and founder of Flawless MedSpa in Las Vegas, Nevada. A small study of 33 people with vitiligo finds that, when treated with a topical cream containing black seed oil, statistically significant repigmentation was detected in the hands, face and genital regions of participants [[4]](#footnote_4). Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory-skin disorder caused by clogged hair follicles that form lesions. Research suggests that the anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties of black seed oil may provide acne-reducing benefits. In fact, one study shows that 58% of survey participants who applied a lotion containing 10% black seed oil over a period of two months saw positive responses to treatment, including a reduction in breakouts. What's more, participants note no side effects when using the lotion containing black seed oil [[5]](#footnote_5). Wound healing Thymoquinone can promote wound healing due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, says Speed. Black seed oil can also stimulate the production of collagen, speeding up the skin's healing process, she adds. However, more research is needed as data on black seed oil's wound-healing properties is largely limited to animal studies. Hair health Black seed oil may help reduce scalp conditions like a dry, flaky scalp (seborrheic dermatitis or breakouts that may occur near hair follicles) given its anti-inflammatory benefits, says Dr. Shirazi. There are also some claims it helps with hair loss, though research is lacking. Diabetes Black seed oil appears to have hypoglycemic properties in patients with diabetes, meaning it may be effective in lowering blood sugar, according to a study published in the Indian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology [[6]](#footnote_6). \"Black seed oil has been observed to significantly reduce both fasting blood sugar levels and A1c levels (estimated glucose average),\" says Casey Kelley, M.D., an infectious disease expert and founder and medical director of Case Integrative Health in Chicago. Weight loss Black seed oil has an appetite suppressant effect that may aid in weight loss, says Dr. Ilyas. A randomized, double-blind trial of obese women who followed a low calorie diet found that the integration of black seed oil improved body composition, such as body mass index, and decreased appetites in participants, though more research is needed [[7]](#footnote_7). Cancer The thymoquinone in black seed oil makes it potent against disease, says Dr. Kelley. While there's not an abundant amount of peer reviewed research on black seed oil and its anti-cancer properties, some researchers believe that the phytochemical\u2014a biologically active compound produced by plants\u2014stunts certain cancer cell growth and, in some cases like melanoma, aids in killing the cancerous cells. Gastrointestinal Disorders Black seed oil naturally helps relieve bodily discomfort related to gas, including bloating and discomfort from indigestion, says Dr. Kelley. Research shows that black seed oil can aid in combating H. pylori bacteria, which, if left untreated, can lead to stomach ulcers, inflammation of the digestive tract and in rare cases, stomach cancer. Asthma Black seed oil may help reduce airway inflammation in [asthma](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/asthma/) patients due to its relaxant effect on smooth muscle. One study published in the Iranian Journal of Basic Medical Sciences notes that asthma patients treated with capsules containing 500 milligrams of black seed oil twice a day over a period of four weeks experienced improved pulmonary function and asthma control [[8]](#footnote_8). Hypertension Lowering blood pressure may be another benefit of black seed oil, according to one study published in Phytotherapy research: PTR. Researchers found that individuals given 2.5 milliliters of black seed oil twice daily experienced significant drops in blood pressure without any adverse effects [[9]](#footnote_9). Infertility According to Dr. Kelley, there is some evidence that black seed oil may help treat infertility in men. For example, a randomized, controlled trial published in Phytomedicine: International Journal of Phytotherapy and Phytopharmacology found that infertile men who took 2.5 milliliters of black seed oil twice a day for a period of two months experienced significant increases in sperm count, motility (ability to move) and morphology (shape) and semen volume [[10]](#footnote_10). Cholesterol Maintaining healthy cholesterol levels may be another benefit of black seed oil, as one study, observes those who consumed 2 teaspoons of black seed oil after breakfast for six weeks saw significantly reduced LDL (low-density lipoproteins), also known as bad cholesterol [[11]](#footnote_11). Side Effects of Black Seed Oil In general, black seed oil is well tolerated with few side effects, but there are a few risks, such as skin inflammation, says Dr. Kelley. \"Additionally, black seed oil has the potential to slow blood clotting and increase your bleeding risk. For this reason, anyone with a bleeding disorder or who takes medication that affects blood clotting (such as Heparin or Warfarin) should avoid black seed oil,\" she adds. Black seed oil may also cause allergic rashes, an upset stomach, vomiting or constipation in some users, according to the National Library of Medicine. Additionally, people who are pregnant or breastfeeding should speak with their health care provider before using black seed oil. If considering black seed oil for a child, speak with your child's health care provider to determine the proper dose, as the amount is typically based on a child's weight. Speak to your health care provider before adding black seed oil to your wellness routine to determine if it's a safe and effective option for you. What to Consider When Buying Black Seed Oil Black seed oil can be purchased at most health food stores, but as with any supplement or natural remedy, always check the ingredient list and research the manufacturer, especially if purchasing a product online, says Dr. Kelley, who suggests looking for formulations that are 100% USDA-certified organic.
