JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 2 | P a g e Record of Changes Date of original version: October 16, 2020 Date Reviewed Change Number Date of Change Description of Change Name of Author 12/15/2020 1 12/15/20 Updated in advance of Phase 1A start NJDOH NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 3 | P a g e Executive Summary December 2020 COVID -19's devastating impacts motivate New Jersey to build a robust COVID -19 vaccination program. In January 2020, the State of New Jersey started actively tracking the outbreak of a novel coronavirus. Since the COVID -19 public health emergency was declared through Executive Order No. 103 on March 9, 2020, New Jersey has mobilized a statewide, data -driven COVID -19 response that include s healthcare capacity expansion, focus on vulnerable populations, sc aling of testing, contact tracing and exposure notification mobilization, resource provision, and resiliency planning. The State informs COVID -19 efforts through transparent information to the public and through funding and technical guidance to local par tners. New Jersey began COVID -19 vaccination planning in the context of considerable unknowns regarding vaccine safety, efficacy, availability and timelines, federal distribution logistics, supplies and funding resources, public demand, likelihood of co mmunity protection through vaccination, and other factors. New Jersey submitted a Draft Interim COVID -19 Vaccination Plan to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for feedback on October 16, 2020, but New Jersey will adapt its phased approa ch as unknowns are resolved. Strategic Aims Provide equitable access to all who live, work, and/or are educated in New Jersey Achieve community protection, assuming vaccine effectiveness, availability, and uptake Build sustainable trust in COVID -19 and other vaccines Equitable Access (Sections 1 and 5) The COVID -19 public health crisis has widened and deepened the demographic of those who are vulnerable. Centering health equity in planning and delivery is fundamental to empowering all New Jerseyans and to eliminating disparities in vaccination and other public health outcomes. This includes: Involving diverse collaborators and perspectives in planning and delivery; Enabling data -informed consideration of risk, privilege , and vulnerability in prioritization and allocation; Partnering with trusted leaders for community education and confidence -building ; Providing vaccination in safe, familiar, and convenient locations with hours that accommodate working families; Offering materials and instructions in the most common languages spoke n in the state; Staffing points of dispensing sites (POD s) with patient navigators who are representative of the communities served; Using tradition al and nontraditional communications channels to alert those with limited access to information about when, where, and how to receive vaccination and to empower informed decisions about vaccine safety and efficacy ; Considering affordability options for un insured, underinsured, and other vulnerable groups; Removing regulatory and legal barriers that unduly constrain participation; and Reviewing disaggregated data and transpare ntly reporting to communicate process and progress. A successful COVID -19 vacci nation program will facilitate building a stronger, fairer, and healthier New Jersey. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 4 | P a g e Phase d Approach (Section s 3, 4, and 7) New Jersey is planning for three scenarios: initial significant vaccine scarcity (Phase 1), supply meeting demand (Phase 2), and slowing public demand (Phase 3). New Jersey is planning to scale all vaccine implementation elements with increasing vaccine a vailability. Across each Phase, N ew Jersey must earn the public's trust, communicate clearly and factually, and provide fair and equitable access. Capacities to be scaled include: Expanding outreach to all New Jerseyans and connecting with specific popu lations; Enrolling sufficient providers through concerted workforce recruitment and scopes of practice expansions; Ensuring technological and data infrastructure can meet increased usage and users; Deploying increasing capital, supplies, and human resource s; and Monitoring equitable results and readjusting strategies and tactics accordingly. In alignment with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's (NASEM) Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID -19 Vaccine , New Jersey is building upon existing systems across all levels of government to provide necessary resources to ensure equitable allocation, distribution, and administrat ion of COVID -19 vaccine s. However, federal funding to N ew Jersey to-date is not anticipated to be sufficient to meet the resource needs for this complex, large -scale vaccination program. Public Confidence (Section 12) Building public confidence in safe and effective COVID -19 vaccine(s) is a lso a complex challenge. New Jersey seeks : To bu ild trust across state, including among local public health, vaccine providers, and vaccines recipients ; To u nderstand how to ensure ease of access to the vaccine, and to information about the vaccine ; and To cultivate a network of diverse partners committed to safe, accessible COVID -19 vaccination . New Jersey aims to engender intergenerational trust in vaccination \u2014to protect against COVID -19 and other vaccine preventable diseases. New Jersey is raising awareness, providing education, and activating action by arming stakeholders , partners, and the public with accurate, up -to-date facts. Credible and consistent health communication messaging will be shared across multiple platforms to address concerns of specific audiences using timely and science -based public health and medical information from trusted sources. Messaging will be culturally appropriate and translated into multiple languages. State Leadership (Section 2) New Jersey has a whole -of-government commitment to the COVID -19 vaccine effort. Preliminary planning began in April 2020 upon receipt of the CDC's initial assumptions. To plan and deliver New Jersey's equitable COVID -19 vaccine program, the Vaccine Task Force (VTF) convened in July 2020 has teams focus ed on Logistics and POD (Point of Dispensing) Delivery; Federa l Interoperability, IT, and Data Flow; Specific Population Enabling Policy; Public Confidence; Strategic Communications; Analytics and Reporting; Management and Administration, including Consumer Affordability, Resourcing, and Funding; and Flu an d General immunization Acceleration. The VTF reports into New Jersey's Coronavirus Task Force, which was established by Executive Order No. 102 , comprises key Cabinet -level officials, rep orts to Governor Murphy, and continues to ensure that no constituency is unjustly left behind and that a health equity lens is applied. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 5 | P a g e Expert Guidance (Section 2) Throughout the COVID -19 crisis, state leaders have engaged subject matter experts and though t leaders to guide New Jersey through this extraordinary and challenging time. The New Jersey Department of Health COVID -19 Professional Advisory Committee (PAC) was convened in March 2020 to inform the Commissioner of Health. The PAC provide s guidance t o the Department to ensure that New Jersey 's response to COVID -19 is based on the latest scientific, medical, ethical , and public health evidence. The membership of the PAC and its subcommittees include New Jersey -specific expertise representing geographi c, demographic, and professional diversity . Since summer 2020 and as New Jersey progresses through COVID -19 vaccination rollout, the PAC may inform New Jersey's answers to such questions as: Have equity considerations been implemented at each stage of planning and delivery? Can the public have confidence that the available vaccine(s) is safe and effective? How will vaccine(s) be prioritized, or sub -prioritized given scarcity and operational constraints? How to ensure vaccine uptake is sufficient to facilitate , as possible , a return to pre -pandemic conditions? Subcommittees focus on health equity, community advocacy, and medical ethics and systems. PAC recommendations are informed by New Jersey -specific e pidemiologic al, occupational, geospatial, demographic data; federal guidance; public health expert data and literature ; and forthcoming Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations. The PAC previously informed allocation of critical care resources, remdesivir distribution, and targeted population -specific testing strategies during this public health emergency. Final recommendations will be socialized to ensure diverse perspectives and a broad cross -section of New Jerseyans are integ rated into planning. Critical Populations (Section s 3 and 4) New Jersey intends to follow the CDC Phased Approach framework . This i nclud es defining Phase 1 A as healthcare workers , which New Jersey estimates will require one million d oses of a two -dose COVID -19 vaccine to fully serve . Necessity of s ub-population prioritization is anticipated given expectation of scarce vaccine availability at the onset and potential for supply shortages throughout . Logistics issues may constrain deci sions and plans will evolve based on vaccine supply reliability and public demand. N ew Jersey 's Plan includes those who live, work, and/or are being educated in the state . Informed by limited federal and national guidance to - date, New Jersey's planning c onsiders factors including risk of acquiring infection, risk of severe morbidity and mortality, risk of negative societal impact, risk of transmitting disease to others, and social vulnerability. For example, New Jersey is recruiting long -term care facili ties to participate in a federally supported distribution process via pharmacies. Timely First -Dose Outreach and Second -Dose Reminders (Sections 1 , 10, and 13 ) To connect with New Jersey's diverse population, outreach will be made through healthcare pro vider partners; community -based, occupational or affiliation -based partners; and the media. Before arriving and on -site, consumers and vaccine administrators will have ready access to fact sheets, vaccine information statements, and other resources to mak e informed decisions. In addition to existing reminder/recall mechanisms in the New Jersey Immunization Information System (NJII S), additional options are being vetted to expand second -dose reminder capability. These include technological NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 6 | P a g e solutions, stra tegic scheduling, hard copy vaccine card distribution, on -site and off -site Consumer Navigators, directive on -site communication, targeted reminders to vaccine administrators and primary care providers, collaboration with identified primary care providers, and partnerships with employers or local entities to leverage existing notification channels. Efficient and Effective Local Delivery (Sections 2, 3, 5, 6, and 14) Success in planning and implementation of the COVID -19 vaccines initiative will rely on close interstate and intrastate coordination (regional, county, and local level). Scenario planning has informed the State's dynamic POD s network plan , which accounts for the number, setting type, nature (e.g., closed or open), throughput, and location of the POD s that will be required at different capacity scales . The State is adopting \"vaccine administration capacity,\" as defined by CDC, as the maximum achievable vac cination throughput regardless of public demand for vaccination . The State's planning assumption , therefore, is to vaccinate up to 70% of its current eligible population . This is in line with Healthy People 2030's national target for influenza vaccine uptake. The number of POD s will be informed by the amount of vaccine available, the frequency of restocking, and the cold chain (or ultra -cold chain) requirements of the vaccine(s) that are federally authorized or approved. Geospatial mapping and facility infrastructure will also inform when and where sites are established. During Phase 1, POD s will include acute care hospitals, Local Information Network Communications System (LINCS) agencies, Local Health Departments (LHDs) , retail pharmacies, Federally Qualified Health Centers ( FQHCs) , and other safe, familiar, and convenient locations . At scale, this will expand to static and mobile urgent care sites, large primary care clinics, and physician practices. Additionally, each county or LHD may have a large -scale site managed loca lly with some central support. The State has identified the types of licensed health professionals qualified to administer COVID -19 vaccines. This will be reevaluated and potentially expanded contingent on supply and demand needs for increased vaccine administration workforce. At leas t two representatives from each enrolled site will be trained on topics including ACIP recommendations; COVID -19 vaccine ordering, receiving, storage, and handling; inventory management; NJIIS use; NJIIS reports to review the vacci ne administration; management of vaccine wastage, spoilage, and temperature excursions; reporting adverse events to VAERS; and EUA facts sheets and/or vaccine information statements (VISs). Provider licenses will be validated by the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs and other state regulators. Coordinated Inventory Management (Section s 7, 8, 9, 11) NJIIS is the central registry, ordering, and reporting system. For ordering, o nce the federal government has indicated how much vaccine will be avail able to New Jersey and the state determines how to allocate statewide, site-level COVID -19 vaccine orders will be placed through NJIIS and transmitted via ExIS to VTrckS. The federal government, along with McKesson, will be responsible for the procurement and distribution of the vaccines to enrolled providers who ordered through VTrckS. The provider site toolkit will include the CDC Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit and the CDC checklist for satellite, temporary, or off -site vaccine clinics. This gu idance will describe roles and responsibilities for each site. Under the CDC Provider Agreement, each site will have a Primary and Back -up Coordinator. Large -scale sites NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 7 | P a g e will also have a required Safety and Quality Assurance Officer , responsible for rece iving vaccine shipments, monitoring storage unit temperatures, managing vaccine inventory , etc. Sites must account for each dose of COVID -19 vaccine that they receive. Sites will report all vaccine doses administered in New Jersey through direct entry, Excel spreadsheet submission, or HL7 connection to the NJIIS. Additional data may be collected through a New Jersey Vaccine Scheduling System (NJVSS ). New Jersey will participate in the IZ Gateway to ensure accounting for those vaccinated out of state. To adhere to the CDC reporting data and timeliness requirements, POD s must be adequate ly resourc ed. The statewide Vaccine Operations Center has been activated to operate in close partnership between the New Jersey Department of Health, New Jersey State Police, county and state offices of emergency management, the National Guard, the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, and local partners. This center will provide a single conduit for the flow of bidirectional information and in telligence related to the transport, delivery, and deployment of vaccines throughout the state. Statewide Program Monitoring (Sections 1, 9, and 15) New Jersey's health system resiliency is strengthened by investing in population health, promoting equity , and achieving better health outcomes for all New Jerseyans . The Institute of Medicine 's six dimensions of quality health care \u2014safe, effective, patient -centered, timely, effici ent, and equitable \u2014will be centered in COVID -19 vaccine planning, may be monitored quantitatively and/or qualitatively, and should be recalibrated as necessary during implementation. Quality improvement objectives include: Measurable increases in aggregate COVID -19 immunization uptake in comparison to other adult immunizations, and/or Measurable increases in aggregate COVID -19 immunization uptake in comparison to each prior phase of the COVID -19 rollout, and Sufficient immunization within critical populations to confer community protection. At least weekly, t he State will conduct check -in meetings with all local jurisdictions to monitor human and physical resources dedicated to the State's vaccination plan implementation. Preliminary reporting goals include: Tracking vaccination status of high priority groups, Support ing consumer navigation and second dose reminders, Support ing provider communications and training, Ensur ing effective distribution and use of vaccines, Monitor ing site operational efficiency and throughput, and Ensur ing effective consumer engagement. To bolster the overall pandemic response, the State will link vaccination coverage reporting to the broader set of pandemic response measures, including disease progress ion and surveillance, healthcare capacity, and public health interventions. New Jersey will receive a Tiberius Analytic Support subject matter expert to optimize N ew Jersey 's use of data monitoring available through federal systems. Mapping will provide visualization of vaccine coverage for the state by provider type, vaccine type, and population type. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 8 | P a g e Section 1: COVID -9 Vaccination Preparedness Planning A. Early COVID -19 Vaccination Program Planning Activities a. Lessons Learned: COVID -19 Pandemic Response and Resiliency In January 2020, the State of New Jersey started actively tracking the outbreak of a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China. On February 3, through Executive Order No. 102 , Governor Phil Murphy established the Coronavirus Task Force \u2014comprising key Cabinet -level officials and reporting to the Governor \u2014to coordinate all State efforts to appropriately prepare for and respond to the public health hazard posed by the virus. By then, the New Jersey Department of Health ( NJDOH ) had screened 350 passengers at Newark Liberty Airport who had traveled from China and may have required isolation for 14 days. New Jersey had its first confirmed case of the virus on March 4 and the first death occurred on March 10. Governor Murphy declared a State of Emergency and Public Health Emergency effective March 9 under Executive Order No. 103 and h as extended it every 30 days under subsequent executive actions. The New Jersey Department of Health is central to New Jersey's response and resiliency through the designation of the Commissioner of Health as the chair of the interagency Coronavirus Task Force established under Governor Phil Murphy's Executive Order 102. Since the COVID -19 public health emergency was declared through Executive Order 103 on March 9, 2020, NJDOH coordinated the State's pandemic response, including but not limited to the al location and distribution of critical supplies and personal protective equipment (including ventilators and therapeutic agents), health system capacity expansion, support for vulnerable populations (including those in congregate settings), the expansion of COVID -19 testing and contact tracing efforts, and provision of quarantine and isolation sites throughout the State. The Department collaborated with its local and state partners to provide guidance and direction on various areas of COVID -related response . A Command Center was established with daily briefings monitoring all data and surveillance information to guide a coordinated pandemic response. The Department guides and informs COVID -19 efforts through funding and technical guidance to local health departments and the provision of transparent guidance and information to stakeholders and the general public. NJDOH's Vaccine Preventable Disease Program (VPDP) began planning for a COVID -19 pandemic vaccination effort in April 2020, when VPDP received the April 22, 2020 letter from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) outlining initial planning assumptions. VPDP's planning included an assessment of existing programmatic resources, including the New Jersey Immunization Information System (N JIIS) and other systems for ordering and managing federally funded vaccines. In summer 2020, this effort was broadened and formalized as detailed in Section 2. New Jersey is motivated to build a robust COVID -19 vaccination program due to the COVID -19 pan demic's toll in: Lives - When the State of New Jersey started preparing internally in January, we knew that this virus could impact our state. Today, the enormity of its impact to New Jersey is truly unprecedented. The New York metro politan area emerged as a global epicenter of the pandemic NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 9 | P a g e and, at the time, the most severely impacted area in the United States. Every corner of our own state was similarly affected. As of October 16, 2020, t here have been over 200,00 0 cases and , sadly, we have lost over 14,000 New Jerseyans to this virus. Across the nation, nursing homes and Assisted Living facilities have been the most severely impacted entities of the pandemic. New Jersey likewise suffered from a disproportionate percentage o f approximately half of deaths among long -term care residents. Delays in care - The true toll of this virus may be never known. However, to date an estimated 50,000 admissions to the hospital have been attributed to this disease. Among those, some have suffered multi -systemic issues and prolonged recovery. Actions taken to mitigate the effects of COVID -19 included the closure of many businesses, including physician offices and routine care postponement and/or cancellatio n. This delayed residents from r eceiving care for the maintenance of their chronic conditions, many of which are linked to higher COVID -19 severit y. Mental health impact - The pandemic has had a significant effect on the mental health of many New Jerseyans. In particular, essential healthcare and other front line workers, the newly unemployed, those experiencing difficulties with shelter -in-place, those personally impacted by COVID -19 disease or d eaths from COVID -19, and, those with pre-existing mental health needs have increased mental health needs caused by the COVID -19 pandemic . Health disparities - Some communities in New Jersey have been impacted more disproportionatel y by the virus than others , including those residing in long term care and other congregate settings, communities of color, those residing in urban centers, health care and other frontline workers, and those with multiple comorbidities. The impact of the pandemic for many communities went beyond the immediate threat of contracting, spreading, and weathering the virus, and was compounded by the pervasive effects of social isolation and intersections with poverty, racism , and all forms of health and environ mental injustice. For populations that we serve, these disproportionate impacts have exposed the health inequities which will be addressed in all parts of our response and recovery efforts, particularly in our vaccination planning. The catastrophic and un precedented nature of this pandemic is particularly overwhelming for those who identify as at -risk, under -resourced, and underserved. Livelihoods - This pandemic has also unleashed an economic crisis only rivaled by two other times in our country's his tory - the Great Depression and the Civil War. COVID -19 has cost lives and livelihoods and devastated our nation's economy. While not a panacea, a safe and effective vaccine that is equitably and efficiently delivered with wide public acceptance will like ly improve our economy and improve the lives of New Jerseyans. Societal resiliency - COVID -19 has dramatically changed societal interactions, leading to a struggle to find a \"new normal\" through the balancing of social customs against continued efforts t o reduce the spread of the virus. While it is likely that a widely accepted and equitably delivered vaccine could reduce societal disruptions, it is necessary to remain vigilant by continuing evidence -based intervention activities, such as physical distan cing, masking, hand hygiene, and active testing and tracing programs. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 10 | P a g e Healthier New Jersey - A successful COVID -19 vaccination program will facilitate the building of a stronger, fairer and healthier New Jersey. One of the cornerstones of Governor Murph y's plan for the State's recovery is that public health yields economic health. In this process, we aim to engender intergenerational trust in vaccination \u2014including the COVID -19 vaccine and vaccines for other preventable diseases. More broadly, the respon se must expand to all New Jerseyan s fair and just opportunities to be as healthy as possible. As a result of the catastrophic nature of this public health crisis, the demographic of those who are vulnerable has widened and deepened. Centering health equity considerations in planning and delivery is fundamental to empowering all New Jerseyans and t o eliminating disparities in vaccination and other public health outcomes. New Jersey's COVID -19 response activities to date inform the planning and implementation of the COVID - 19 vaccine plan. This public health emergency has required a whole -of-State effort that has challenged every aspect of government operations . Across the pandemic response, including the burgeoning COVID - 19 vaccines effort, the following areas have informed preparedness, response, and resiliency in New Jersey: Fostering public c onfidence - New Jersey residents have overwhelmingly complied with evidence - based public health guidance, including stay -at-home orders, mask mandates, and participation in social distancing. Likewise, maintaining increased widespread testing (testing rat es increased from a rate of 1,000 tests/day to a daily average of over 30,000 tests /day as of October 16, 2020 ) and participation in contact tracing efforts by \"answering the call\" will continue to be critical in reducing the spread of COVID -19. Sharing c ontact information for individuals that people have had close contact with helps protect them and their families. While we have made significant progress in some areas, we recognize that we must redouble our efforts to further increase public confidence. Development and release of new transparent consumer -facing technology, such as the COVID -Alert NJ App, will engage and encourage all residents to play an active role in the State's COVID response. New Jersey works continuously to dispel fear and misinforma tion about the Department's public health efforts, such as vaccination. Given the ongoing evolution of our understanding of this disease, which creates the potential for mixed messages and misinformation, this work takes on even greater relevance and impo rtance. Harnessing c ollaboration - Strategic and tactical partnerships across government, jurisdictions, and communities have been fostered and mobilized to deliver public health interventions, health services, and social supports. For example, as part of our efforts to expand access, t he State of New Jersey have engaged interfaith and community leaders to promote testing in their communities. The State of New Jersey provides technical assistance and resource coordination and is grateful to the local and county partners that drive deliv ery efforts. Coordinating c omprehensive public health response - To respond to this novel pandemic, New Jersey has employed lessons learned and knowledge from its other continued public health efforts in testing, contact tracing, public awareness, vacci nation, quarantine/isolation, and protecting vulnerable populations. There are process parallels between reducing the spread of COVID and other communicable diseases such as measles and influenza, by increasing public awareness, NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 11 | P a g e encouraging testing and vac cination, and quarantining when persons are symptomatic. New Jersey is diligently building a more robust public health workforce to protect our families and communities and stop the spread. At the start of the pandemic, the New Jersey had approximately 300 hardworking and dedicated contact tracers in local health departments. In response to COVID - 19, New Jersey has onboarded and trained an additional 1,500 contact tracers to support State efforts. Additionally, NJDOH strongly advocated for enhanced testin g and response efforts, for vulnerable populations and those living in congregate settings. For example, through its regulatory framework, NJDOH directed LTCFs to conduct regular COVID testing of its residents and staff. A Long -Term Care Emergency Operatio ns Center (EOC) was established to provide a centralized command structure to manage pandemic response efforts, including monitoring of resident and staff COVID -19 testing and resources such as PPE, supplies, and therapeutics. Promoting meaningful a ccess - To execute an effective COVID response, recognizing and rectifying gaps in access is incredibly important. For example, during the early stages of the pandemic, COVID testing was only available for symptomatic residents in very limited locations and pr imarily at drive -up sites. As testing resources became less constrained, the Department strategically expanded State testing efforts through amplification of county and local testing efforts, expanding testing to asymptomatic residents, and providing test ing at locations beyond the traditional drive -through testing sites, including mobile pop -up testing sites utilizing federal testing resources through an expansion of the Community Based Testing Site program and procuring end -to-end testing services focuse d on six urban municipalities. Through these expanded testing efforts, over 4 million tests have been administered in New Jersey. Testing is widely available throughout the state - anyone can get tested and can find a testing location at covid19.nj.gov/testing . Emphasizing health equity - Throughout the pandemic, the State of New Jersey has been concerned about the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on vulnerable populations , such as those in congregate settings, and communities of color. These disparities are evident from data published on the New Jersey COVID -19 Dashboard ( https://covid19.nj.gov/ ). Across the nation and within the state, we have s een vulnerabilities to COVID -19 among these groups. To bridge this inequity gap, NJDOH has enhanced partnerships with State and county correctional facilities, expanded testing at LTCFs, correctional facilities, and State psychiatric hospitals, and pilote d \"boots on the ground\" testing at senior high rises, and among persons experiencing homelessness and seasonal farm workers. Although these efforts cannot wholly reverse centuries of systemic, structural, socioeconomic, and health inequities, we recognize the need to continue shining a light on increasing equity in public health actions, particularly in the development of continued COVID response and planning. Bolstering interagency resource coordination - At the beginning of the pandemic, there were very limited supplies available to respond to a pandemic, particularly a virus that caused severe and sudden respiratory distress. The State of New Jersey did not have a stockpile of supplies and there were significant supply chain disruptions for PPE which e xponentially increased both cost and delivery timeframes. The State received a series of deliveries from the Strategic National Stockpile, which was allocated and distributed to acute care hospitals, long term care facilities, NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 12 | P a g e first responders, and correc tional facilities. To enhance the State's continued preparedness efforts, an interagency coalition among NJDOH, the State Office of Emergency Management, and the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness developed a joint resource management program, ut ilizing State -contracted secure warehouse space. This program led to the creation of operational inventory and development of an emergency supply stockpile to support State, county, and local response to a potential resurgence of COVID as well as any futu re public health emergencies. Using iterative process es - On May 18, Governor Murphy unveiled a multi -stage approach to execute the responsible and strategic economic restart to put New Jersey on the road back to recovery from COVID -19. New Jersey enters new stages based on data that demonstrates improvements in public health and the capacity to safeguard the public. The restart is phased within each stage, rather than opening a ll businesses and activities at once within a stage. b. Lessons Learned: Routine Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Campaigns Routinely and continuing during the COVID -19 pandemic, NJDOH's Vaccine Preventable Disease Program (VPDP) is responsible for two federal initiatives in New Jersey: the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program and the 317 -Funded (317) Adult Program. Through the se programs, the VPDP annually distributes approximately 1.6 million doses of federally funded vaccines to approximately 900 registered providers throughout New Jersey. Registered providers include private healthcare providers, local health departments, F ederally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC), and other non -profit organizations. While NJDOH has robust systems in place for federally funded vaccines, most vaccine administration to children and adults in New Jersey occurs through private enterprises. Rec ently released data in CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR ) indicates that 72.3% of children aged 6 months through 17 years of age received in influenza vacc ine during the 2019 -2020 flu season when compared to the national average of 63.8%. For adults 18 years of age and older, 45.2% were vaccinated compared to the national average of 48.4%. Overall, less than 50% of New Jersey's eligible population gets an influenza vaccine each year, whereas the national target established in HealthyPeople is 70%. This year, New Jersey is preparing for a potential \"twindemic\" that would further strain healthcare resources. This year, more than ever, it is important that e veryone six months of age and older without a medical contraindication gets vaccinated. While the influenza vaccine will not protect against COVID -19, it will protect those vulnerable to complications of the flu. New Jersey is promoting the CDC recommend ation to receive influenza vaccination by the end of October. To expand and accelerate influenza vaccination in 2020, the New Jersey Department of Health, Vaccine Preventable Disease Program used supplemental immunization funding to support stakeholders i nvolved in influenza immunization efforts and to build the infrastructure for the upcoming COVID -19 immunization campaign. Specifically: NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 13 | P a g e Persuasive Communications - Funding was awarded to the Partnership for Maternal and Child Health of Northern New Jersey for a state -wide influenza campaign promoting the Power to Protect NJ . Infrastructure an d Cold Chain Capacity -building - Funding was awarded to 10 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) to build immunization infrastructure for influenza and for the upcoming COVID -19 immunization efforts. Investments in Vulnerable Populations - These FQ HCs are 317 -Funded Adult Vaccine providers routinely provide services to our most vulnerable populations within New Jersey and will serve critical roles to ensure equitable access to COVID -19 vaccines. This year, we have emphasized the importance of influ enza vaccine during pregnancy as this group was considered unlikely to be eligible to receive the COVID -19 vaccine during the early phase of release since the vaccine candidates had not yet been tested in this population. The VPDP is exploring opportuniti es to highlight flu vaccination among pregnant women. The NJDOH also encourages flu vaccination among healthcare workers since they work with vulnerable populations and are on the frontlines of the COVID -19 Pandemic. On January 13 , 2020 , Governor Murphy signed into law N.J.S.A. 26:2H -18.79 which requires influenza vaccination of healthcare personnel in certain settings. NJDOH is working with stakeholders to implement this new legislation. Promoting flu vaccination means that we need ample supply of the vaccine for those providers who choose to vaccinate. Flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers, so supply depends on manufacturers. Vaccine manufacturers have projected that they will supply as many as 194 to 198 million doses of influenza vaccine f or the 2020 -2021 season, the most ever. Most flu vaccine that is administered in NJ is administered using privately purchased vaccine. The NJDOH VPDP does provide federally funded flu vaccines through the New Jersey Vaccines for Children (NJ VFC) and 31 7-Funded Adult (317 Program). These programs provide free or low -cost vaccines to providers who serve children and adults who face economic barriers to immunizations. This year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has allocated more federa lly funded vaccines to NJ: VFC - 433,870 doses allocated this flu season (361,000 doses allocated last season). These vaccines can be given to children who are Medicaid eligible, uninsured, underinsured, or American Indian/Alaskan Native. 317 Adult - 440,000 doses allocated this flu season (19,000 doses allocated last season). This year no eligibility screening for 317 -Funded Adult flu vaccine which means that these adult doses can be given regardless of insurance status. 317 -Funded adult v accines usually require screening to ensure the recipient is uninsured/ underinsured. The VPDP and Office of Primary Care and Rural Health, Community Health Services is collaborating to make $3.5 million dollars available to 10 FQHCs that are 317 -Funded Adult vaccine providers. The immediate goal is to improve influenza vaccination rates in vulnerable populations and to build the infrastructure of vaccination clinics that can be used to administer the COVID -19 vaccine. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 14 | P a g e c. Lessons Learned: 2009 H1N1 Campaign In addition, NJDOH reviewed after -action reports from the 2009 H1N1 vaccination campaign in which several divisions and programs played a major role in the NJDOH response. NJDOH has used the experience of 2009 H1N1 to inform planning efforts for COVID -19 vaccination efforts. Key successes being replicated in the COVID -19 context include: Streamlined o rdering and distribution - Providers directly ordered vaccine through NJIIS, based on initial priority groups, and CDC's distributor (McKesson) directly sh ipped both vaccine and ancillary supplies to ordering providers. The first vaccine was shipped to New Jersey the week of October 5, 2009. Demand was high, and supply was low until the end of November 2009. Broad -base of p roviders and administrat ors - During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, NJDOH had excellent working relationships with outside stakeholders including health departments, FQHCs, hospitals, schools and universities, retail pharmacies, large corporation occupational health services, and other state a gencies (e.g., Department of Corrections, Department of Education, Department of Transportation). NJDOH shipped 2,592,500 doses of 2009 H1N1 vaccine to the following provider types: Figure 1.a.iii -1: Types of POD s (Point s of Dispensing) used in NJ's H1N1 campaign (Source: NJDOH internal data, McKesson shipping reports) Recipient POD Type H1N1 Doses Shipped Health Departments 1,327,900 Physicians and Employee Health 724,900 Hospitals 238,800 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) 91,600 Universities 85,700 Government/Confined 64,500 Retail 59,100 Total 2,592,500 Diverse communications channels - There was a robust internal and external communication network including a vaccine information line for providers and a hotline for public calls. Over the course of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, from 9/17/2009 to 3/30/2010, NJDOH received 14,300 calls from providers concerning registration, vaccine ordering, inventory management and temperature concerns, and recording doses administered. In addition, the public hotline fielded 33,463 calls from 10/6/2009 to 3/10/ 2010. Adaptable operations - The original plan to distribute vaccines from central locations with redistribution of produc t by state and local agencies evolved over the course of the pandemic to more direct shipments to vaccination service providers which was more in line with the distribution of federally -funded vaccine. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 15 | P a g e Key challenges informing quality improvements for the COVID -19 vaccines initiative include: Inconsistent reporting - Although 2,595,500 doses were shipped, only 1,112,193 were recorded as being administered as of March 30, 2010 (NJDOH unpublished data from H1N1 Vaccine System). Also, 10 percent of doses administered did not have a county of residence recorded and 33 percent did not have the municipality of residence entered. These deficits made tracking of vaccine and uptake difficult to assess. Figure 1.a.iii -2: Percent of NJ Population Receiving H1N1 vaccine by age (Source: NJDOH internal data) Poor data management - There was difficulty accounting for all vaccine doses from delivery to administration and an inability to generate reports to provide timely, meaningful metrics. Low public uptake - Subsequent data published in the MMWR indicated poor uptake of 2009 H1N1 vaccine in New Jersey. Insufficient provider training - New providers who did not have experience using the New Jersey Immunization Information System (NJIIS) experienced challenges with vaccine ordering. Deficient s uppl ies - Supplies that were supposed to accompany vaccine shipments from the CDC did not consistently arrive on time or had the incorrect supplies included (e.g., multiple dose vials of vaccine and needles bu t no syringes). NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 16 | P a g e Scarce funding - Programmatic operations were stymied by a lack of supportive funding. This COVID -19 Vaccination Plan is similarly predicated on the availability of funding. Workforce inadequacy - Inadequate number of trained staff withi n and outside NJDOH to support expanded programmatic operations. Figure 1.a.iii -3: CDC/BRFSS/NHFS Phone Interviews November 2009 to February 2010 Regarding H1N1 Flu Vaccination (Source: MMWR 4/2/2010) NJDOH has focused efforts to address gaps not ed during 2009 H1N1. As elaborated elsewhere in this plan, New Jersey has already initiated efforts to address the following gaps: Defining metrics and developing methods to track key parameters during the vaccination campaign. Enhancing NJIIS capability. Developing systems to account for vaccines on a dose -for-dose basis. Supporting providers in on -boarding to NJIIS and in ordering COVID -19 vaccines. Collaborating with response partners to deliver vaccines at scale. Collaborating with a broad range of stakeholders to build public confidence and ensure equitable distribution of COVID vaccine. B. Preparedness Exercises and Quality Initiatives a. Lessons Learned: Workshops and Tabletop Exercises Preparedness exercises specific to COVID -19 vaccines began in summer 2020 and have expanded and refined this plan and New Jersey's COVID -19 vaccines ambition. Exercises include but are not limited to: NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 17 | P a g e Reviews of lessons learned from routine vaccination programs (e.g. seasonal influenza) and from prior pandemic vacci nation (e.g. H1N1). Facilitated workshops across team leads and key NJDOH leadership to coalesce across work streams on shared principles and cross -cutting planning assumptions. Intensive end -to-end logistics and delivery tabletops to establish current sta te of play and opportunities to scale. Microsite visits provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Operation Warp Speed focused on Points of Dispensing Sites (POD s), Public Confidence Communications, and Phased Approach for Critical Pop ulations. Open questions asked of federal partners included but were not limited to: o Best practice guidance for supplies/infrastructure for POD s? o Best practice for repurposing and adding to the typical vaccine workforce given COVID -19 exigencies? o Availability of and costing of resources necessary to activate distribution at scale ? o Availability of federal support in creation of communications resources for public confidence building, including toolkits and translated informational materi als? o What operational, logistical, regulatory, communications, ethical, etc. considerations should NJ include in developing a Phased Approach? o Expectations for further federal guidance and resources in next planning stage and in initial delivery? o Delivery considerations for specific populations such as long -term care residents and staff? Collaborative discourse between NJDOH, Local Information Network Communications System (LINCS) agencies , and Local Health Departments (LHDs) to utiliz e lessons learned fro m their 2020 flu clinics and COVID -19 testing sites to inform their local and county COVID -19 vaccination plans. Workshopping around the State's vaccine security plan . Establishment of POD s throughout the State using a variety of dispensing sites (hospital s, FQHCs, pharmacies, urgent cares, and government -run sites) . Stress testing throughput assumptions for each site as they relate to achievement of estimated daily vaccination projections to achieve the State's vaccination goal . Cold chain management . Reviewing v accine administration and documentation protocols . Establishing t raffic flow, social distancing , and sanitation measures . Allocation and delivery of vaccines using the State's allocation model. b. Continuous Quality Improvement Process NJDOH's priority is to strengthen New Jersey's health system resiliency by investing in population health, promoting equity, and achieving be tter health outcomes for all New Jerseyans . NJDOH is committed to providing access to high quality, affordable, culturally competent, and trauma -informed care, as well as reducing and eliminating disparities in health outcomes across all health care servi ces. NJDOH's priorities align with evidence -based, national best practices, including the Institute of Medicine 's six dimensions of quality health care: NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 18 | P a g e Figure 1.b.ii -1: Incorporate IOM dimensions of health care quality in envisioning COVID -19 vaccine quality IOM Definition QI Example in NJ's COVID -19 Context Safe Avoiding harm to patients from the care that is intended to help them. Is informed consent provided on the one or more novel vaccines for this novel coronavirus? Effective Providing services based on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit and refraining from providing services to those not likely to benefit (avoiding underuse and misuse, respectively). How do the findings of clinical trials and recommendations of entities like the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) inform which subpopulations are prioritized in initial phases (e.g. is vaccine more effective at preventing severe disease or preventing transmission?)? Patient -Centered Providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions. What is the user experience of each POD for New Jersey's diverse population? Timely Reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for both those who receive and those who give care. Are vaccine sites adequately staffed to avoid waits and ensure social distancing? Efficient Avoiding waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy. Are supply chains scalable, rapid, and reliable within New Jersey? Equitable Providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic status. Is data collection inclusive and do disparities prompt action? Further detail is provided in Section 5G about how New Jersey is leveraging a quality improvement mind set to advance health equity. Each of these dimensions is centered in COVID -19 vaccine planning, may be monitored quantitatively and/or qualitatively, and should be recalibrated as necessary during implementation. As noted by the CDC, \"immunization is a dynamic, critical and measurable area of healthcare\" and is thereby well -suited for continuous quality improvement. Therefore, the overarching objectives of quality improvement for New Jersey's vaccine program will include: in comparison to other adult immunizations and/or in comparison to each prior phase of the COVID -19 rollout, measurable increases in aggregate COVID -19 adult immunization uptake and measurable increases in im munization within vulnerable critical populations sufficient to confer community protection. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 19 | P a g e Section 2: COVID -19 Organizational Structure and Partner Involvement A. Organizational Structure In early 2020, the residents of the State of New Jersey began facing a major threat to our health and well - being due to the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus , SARS -CoV-2. On February 3, 2020, N ew Jersey Governor Murphy issued Executive Order 102, which created the Coronavirus Task Force (CTF) and designated the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) as the Task Force Chair . The primary purpose of the Task Force was to ensure and maintain the safety and security of New Jersey's 9 million res idents. The C TF was charged with continuously monitoring national and global public health trends and developing and executing necessary and appropriate measures to protect its constituents threatened by the coronavirus. Figure 2.a.1: New Jersey Coronavirus Task Force Members In the days, weeks, and now months since, New Jersey has mobilized a comp rehensive , data -driven COVID -19 response that include s testing, contact tracing, emergency preparedness, vaccines , and long - term care. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 20 | P a g e Figure 2.a.2: COVID -19 Response Sustainability Planning - Department of Health responsibilities On July 31, 2020, the Vaccine Task Force (VT F) was formally convened as an arm housed within the Department of Health to support the C TF's efforts to plan and implement a statewide C OVID -19 vaccine program. The organizational structure began with the development of nine foundational teams , including : Logistics and POD (Point of Dispensing ) delivery, Federal Interoperability, IT, Data Flow Management and Surveillance, Specific Population Planning, Enabling Policy, Public Confidence, Strategic Communications, Analytics and Reporting, Management and Administration, and Flu Acceleration and General Immunization. NJDOH has three p rincip al branches: Health Systems, Public Health Services, and Integrated Health, and the cross -cutting Office of Population Health and Office of the Chief of Staff . The Vaccin ation Task Force resides within the NJDOH Public Health Services Branch and leverages the knowledge and efforts of various Branch programs, including the Office of Disaster Resilience (ODR), the Office of Local Public NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 21 | P a g e Health (OLPH), and the Vaccine Preventable Disease Program (VPDP) . Beyond the Public Health Services branch, the VTF incorporates expertise from across NJDOH in population health, data analytics, m inority and multicultural health, law, policy, communications, fiscal, health information technology, etc. Figure 2.a.3: COVID -19 Vaccine Organization within NJDOH - Working Structure Given the whole -of-government commitment to the COVID -19 vaccine ef fort, as described in subsequent sections, representation from across state agencies and from the Office of the Governor are incorporated into the work group structure for COVID -19 vaccination planning and implementation. Also incorporated formally or c onsultatively are statewide, regional, county, and local strategic and tactical partners. Advisory entities are also engaged in planning and will be pivotal to implementation. B. Internal COVID -19 Vaccination Program Planning and Coordination Team Purpose and Guiding Principles An internal COVID -19 Vaccination Program planning and coordination team is critical to ensure the vaccination response to COVID -19 is thoughtfully planned and successfully executed. The State of New Jersey fully underst ands this imperative and developed a robust , cross -functional, and versatile COVID -19 NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 22 | P a g e Vaccine Task Force with a broad array of internal and external members. A set of guiding principles were established within the VTF to provide clarity and maintain focus in the preliminary planning phase . The inherent difficulty of planning a statewide vaccine program for a novel virus requires navigating unprecedented territory, therefor e it is through these guiding principles that internal team engagement and collaboration are sustained . Figure 2.b.1: Preliminary Guiding Principles for Internal COVID -19 Vaccine Planning Overview of COVID -19 Vaccine Task Force Core functions for the COVID -19 vaccine plan rollout are summarized below by work group . The se functions were identified quickly and thoughtfully, identify a specific team for accountability , and require complex interdisciplinary coordination and collaboration. Two cross cutting elements \u2014equity and funding \u2014helped to guide the plan development and team functions . Within each work group, a team -specific list of deliverables is maintained and moni tored to ensure continuous progress, even in advance of COVID -19 vaccine availability. Each work group convenes collectively or in sub -groups throughout the week, with frequent cross -pollination and overlapping membership between the work groups. The V accine Task Force is at full strength during the planning period and will continue during the implementation period. In addition to internal actors, t here are also numerous strategic partnerships that serve to support and assist in the development and imp lementation of the Statewide COVID -19 vaccin ation plan. Examples of operational strategic partners include acute care hospitals, long term care facilities, retail pharmacies, and FQHCs (Federally Qualified Health Centers). NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 23 | P a g e Figure 2.b.2: Core Functions fo r Each COVID -19 Vaccine Task Force Work Group Overview of Team Membership Each of the VTF's nine work groups onboarded qualified internal team members to support and add value to their team's respective deliverables. Within state agencies, membership is not limited to NJDOH personnel and each team is intentionally multidisciplinary in nature. In addition to p ersonnel from across NJDOH, illustrative examples of other agencies that are members of the COVID -19 vaccine work groups include, but are not limited to: Logistics: New Jersey Office of Emergency Management (NJOEM), New Jersey State Police (NJSP) , Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness (OHSP ) Enabling Policy: Office of the Attorney General Reporting: Department of Labor and Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness (OHSP) As needed, t he groups also expand their member ship to engage participation from key stakeholder groups. For example : Logistics: New Jersey National Guard PODS: Key New Jersey Local Information Network Communication System (NJLINCS) and local public health (LPH) representatives , because the work of th e VTF will be supported by the 22 NJLINCS agencies (21 at county level, 1 at local level) and over 94 local health departments (LHDs). Specific Populations : Inclusion of central members from diverse entities representing our critical infrastructure, vulnerable populations , and tribal communities. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 24 | P a g e Overview of Team Leadership Departmental leadership identified team leads for each VTF work group . The team leads were sel ected by their professional credentials and experience that best suited the ir specific team. They include leaders that are both internal and external to the New Jersey Department of Health's Public Health Services Branch. Their collective expertise inclu des immunization, emergency preparedness, policy, public relations and crisis communications, information systems management, public health analytics , population health, management, and procurement . Overview of NJDOH COVID -19 Professional Advisory Committ ee Throughout the crisis, state leadership has engaged subject matter experts and thought leaders to guide New Jersey through this extraordinary and challenging time. During COVID -19, intra -agency, inter -agency, and advisory groups have emerged to study, inform, and deliver health equity initiatives. These include , but are not limited to , an internal vulnerable populations workgroup that operates across sectors and communities that consolidates data relevant to action on health equity , inter-agency action on these issues through the Coronavirus Task Force and ad hoc interagency partnerships , and multi -sector advisory and action entities like the Governor's Response and R ecovery Commission and Healthy New Jersey 2030 . Supporting the work gro ups of the Vaccination Task Force , one advisory body particularly informs and shapes the VTF's planning: the New Jersey Department of Health COVID -19 Professional Advisory Committee (PAC) and its subcommittees (Health Equity, Community Advocacy, and Medica l Ethics and Systems). The NJDOH COVID -19 Professional Advisory Committee (PAC) was convened in March 2020 and pivoted to focus on vaccines in summer 2020. The PAC is specifically called to advise the Commissioner of Health to ensure that New Jersey 's response to COVID -19 is based on the latest scientific, medical, ethical , and public health evidence. The COVID -19 pandemic has exacerbated existing and significant health inequities in our vulnerable communities. The recommendations provided by the PAC , an d especially its Health Equity Subcommittee , will be fundamental in preventing health inequities during vaccine planning and distribution. The Professional Advisory Committee informs the health response to COVID -19 in the following ways: Resource Allocation - How resources and services are procured, promoted, and provided in proximity to those who most need or require them to survive or thrive. Advisory and Consultative - Active communication to and from community and constituency perspect ives to inform considered ethical and equitable planning, policy, and practice and to build public confidence. Proactive and Participatory - Deliberative ideation and derivation of novel solutions. Community involvement endeavors to inspire public confidence and sense of ownership in the generation, implementation, and evaluation of public health interventions. Access - A holistic assessme nt of whether affordability, availability, accessibility, accommodation, and acceptability are attained and advanced. Quality - A consideration of the safety, effectiveness, patient -centeredness, timeliness, efficiency, and equitability of proposed initiat ives. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 25 | P a g e Outcome s - A descriptive, data -informed, and transparent synthesis of which population(s) or who survives versus thrives, who is adversely impacted or resilient, who is affected by collateral or generational damage, and/or who is at-risk for a contin uum of outcomes. Problem -Solving - An evaluation of which solutions transform the status quo by averting systemic and structural inequities and bias. Committee expertise will be leveraged to enhance development, reach, and utility of overall and population -specific COVID -19 vaccination plans, policies, data -to-action, communications, and delivery activities. Specific issues previously addressed by the PAC include informing allocation of critical care resources (e.g. ventilators) , distribution of scarce tre atment pharmaceuticals (e.g. remdesivir) , and targeted population -specific testing strategies. An integral role for the PAC is recommending to and advising the VTF on equitable vaccine prioritization and allocation. The membership of the PAC and its subc ommittees include New Jersey -specific expertise representing geographic, demographic, and professional diversity. Membership is informed by recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the JHU Working Group on Readying Populations for COVID -19 Vaccine. The NJDOH COVID -19 PAC charter and membership are enclosed in the Appendix . C. Internal and External COVID -19 Vaccination Implementation Committee The implementation of a statewide vaccination plan require s a supportive ecosystem across activated response partners and key stakeholders. While the NJDOH is the primary leader for coordinating the COVID -19 vaccination plan, other state and local agencies are essential at various stages of implementation. The St ate has identified three categories of partners to be engaged across purposes: Response partners - Such as Local Information Network Communications System (LINCS) agencies, Office of Emergency Management (OEM) , Domestic Security Preparedness Task Force (DSPTF) etc. will support site setup and delivery including any necessary distribution logistics . Specific population partners - May be responsible for identifying, contacting and following up with critical populations. In Phase 1 and 2, these groups could include h ealthcare and essential workers' employers , relevant state agencies for their service users , community -based organiz ations , Regional Health Hubs, Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers (FQHCs), h ealth insurers , etc. Dispensing sites partners - Will include h ospitals , retail pharmacies , FQHCs , Local Health Departments (LHDs) , urgent care centers, large primary care and multispecialty clinics will be responsible for end -to-end vaccine management including cold chain management, site setup (including equipment and supplies management),consumer registration, scheduling, second -dose follow -up, adverse event tracking, dat a gathering and reporting etc. Public confidence building through mass, strategic, risk, and crisis communications will involve a cross - section of the above and additional stakeholders during the COVID -19 planning and rollout. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 26 | P a g e Figure 2.c.1: New Jersey's COVID -19 Vaccine Implementation Ecosystem Internal implementation committees have been built into the VTF structure to support close coordination. Response partners have been identified and engaged across work groups. The State is executing a stepwise plan to engage with a range of external stakeholders in advance of the first vaccine doses becoming available. These includ e leaders across multiple levels of government, professional associations, employers and community groups. A sequence of interactions has been planned out and mapped through a stakeholder mapping tool . NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 27 | P a g e Figure 2.c.2 : Key response partners across COVID -19 VTF work groups - illustrative, not exhaustive Potential implementation partners across New Jersey were identified and classified according to CDC Playbook nomenclature: State and local government Employers Healthcare providers Health insurance issuers and plans Education Unions and professional organizations Organizations serving minority populations and people with disabilities Community and faith -based groups General population Other essential workers Other Groups were sequenced as: To be engaged before broader engagement To be engaged immediately once broader engagement has begun To be engaged during the planning process To be engaged before first doses become available D. Team Membership The Vaccine Task Force has been divided into nine working groups. The VTF is chaired by the Deputy Commissioner of Public Health, and each work group has one or two assigned Team Leaders equipped with internal organizational knowledge, as well as working partnerships with external members, stakeholders, and local health officials. Responsibility of each working groups' deliverables was shared amongst an expanding membership made up of expert contributors and directors in their respective fields of study a nd work (Figure 2.d.2). NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 28 | P a g e Each vaccination working group has been assigned a team lead with appropriate experience and expertise.

To perform his duties, he utilizes the data sources fro m which many of the metrics required for monitoring and evaluating the COVID -19 vaccine response will be derived. Dr. Rosenbaum has contributed to the state COVID -19 response constructing the survey and reporting infrastructure necessary to monitor and pri oritize the epidemiological response to outbreaks at long -term care facilities. Strategic Communications Maria Del Cid -Kosso, MPA P Team Leader Director, Office of Policy and Legislative Services, NJ Department of Health Brief Summary of Experience that Supports Team Designation: Maria Del Cid -Kosso s erves as NJDOH's liaison with the Governor's office and in legislative matters relating to the Department of Health's mission. During each legislative session, the Office is charged with tracking and assessing legislation, policy, and regulatory issues of importance to DOH's mission. The Office serves as the principal contact and coordinator for all Department interaction with t he Legislature and their staff and assists in solving constituent issues for legislative and government offices, and consulting and corresponding with other government officials, industry representatives and the general public to explain and receive commen ts on policy proposals as well as existing policies. Ms. Del Cid -Kosso also oversee and manages the Department of Health's Boards and Commission, which offer opportunities related to Department policy, regulations, and programs. Management and Administra tion Robin C. Ford, MS Team Leader for Insurance Affordability Executive Director, Office of Health Care Financing , NJ Department of Health Brief Summary of Experience that Supports Team Designation: The NJDOH Office of Health Care Financing monitors hospital fiscal performance through financial reporting requirements, including annual hospital cost reports and audited financial statements, as well as quarterly utilization reports. It also administers the New Jersey Hospital Care Payment Assistance Program (Charity Care) for people who are uninsured and underinsured and oversees the hospital charity care subsidy. E. Coordination between Juris dictions Success in planning and implementation of the COVID -19 vaccines initiative will rely upon close interstate and intrastate coordination. Illustrative but not exhaustive examples of government -based or government -sponsored partners that have been mobilized during New Jersey's COVID -19 response for testing, contact tracing, social supports, quarantine/isolation, and other activities include: NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 32 | P a g e Federal - Federal agencies, especially Health and Human Se rvices (including but not limited to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), Operation Warp Speed, and Federal Emergency Management Agency; New Jersey's Congressional delegation. Interstate - Contiguous and noncontiguous states. Especially frequent dialogues with neighboring states to accommodate New Jerseyans who may work or learn out -of-state, and vice versa. Regional - Pre-pandemic regional bodies like Maternal -Child Health Consortia and Regional Health Hubs as well as pandemic -specific regional entities like the Regional Collaborators (Level 1 trauma centers mobilized to regionally coordinate health systems). New Jerse y is generally organized for the purposes of the COVID -19 response into three regions: Northern, Central, and Southern. County - 21 County Executives and Boards of Chosen Freeholders (soon -to-be \"Boards of County Commissioners\"); county health departmen ts and offices of emergency management; 21 LINCS agencies. Local - Elected officials , including but not limited to mayors, township councils, and school boards; local health departments; LINCS agency (Newark) . For preliminary COVID -19 vaccination planning, the plurality of these partners already has been engaged by the State of New Jersey at the awareness, education, or action level. All are anticipated to be leveraged for ongoing strategic and tactical plannin g, technical assistance, and implementation collaboration and support. Given that New Jersey is a \"home rule\" state and given cross jurisdictional efforts in other aspects of the pandemic response , the State of New Jersey has a planning assumption of loca l delivery and close collaboration with regions, counties, and localities. T herefore, creating critical intrastate partnerships for New Jersey preparedness and response initiatives are especially important and continuously woven into the planning efforts. New Jersey has benefited from support by professional organizations in coordinating and convening interstate collaboration in vaccination planning. These include but are not limited to Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), Natio nal Governor's Association (NGA), and National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). Within New Jersey, advisory bodies and professional societies have assisted in brokering coordinated planning and delivery. For example, the New Jersey League of Muni cipalities, the New Jersey Conference of Mayors, and the New Jersey Association of County and City Health Officials (NJACCHO) . F. Tribal Community Engagement The Specific Population subcommittee is primarily responsible for the initial and ongoing engagement and coordination efforts with New Jersey's tribal communities and organizations. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 33 | P a g e The New Jersey Commission on American Indian Affairs, which sits within the New Jersey Department of State, includes representatives from each of the following State -recognized tribes: Nanticoke Lenni -Lenape, Ramapough Lenape, and Powhatan Renape. Each tribal community has approximately 3,500 to 5,000 members within New Je rsey's boundaries. New Jersey's Vaccine Task Force's early engagement activities included inviting a tribe member to join the Specific Population team and joining recent Commission on American Indian Affairs meetings to discuss COVID -19-related work, most particularly COVID -19 testing. As a result, a COVID -19 Testing and Education Needs Assessment was conducted through an online survey and ongoing phone interviews. In keeping with the safety measures and physical distancing requirements during collaborative efforts, communi cation will primarily be web and phone -based until the dynamic needs of the Vaccines Task Force change. G. Key Partners for Critical Populations Example Supply -Side P artners to Serve Critical Populations In planning for a phased rollout of COVID -19 vaccin es, the VTF has identified key external partners for the local delivery of COVID -19 vaccines to critical populations. These include, but are not limited to: COVID -19 Vaccine Dispensing Partners - In Phase 1, when limited doses are available for populations identified in Phase 1 A (high -risk healthcare workers) , 1B (essential workers ), and 1 C (those at high -risk), POD s will include hospitals, NJ LINCS agencies, and their affiliated LHDs, retail pharmacies, and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQ HCs). Once large supplies of vaccines are made available, additional POD s will be required, including retail pharmacies, urgent care sites, large primary care clinics, and physician practices. Additionally, each county or LHD may have a large -scale site to support the rollout of COVID -19 vaccines at scale. These sites will be managed by the LHD, municipality, and/or county OEM with some central support. The number and type of COVID -19 vaccine providers targeted for participation will be based on the av ailable supply and recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), CDC, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NA SEM) and other entities. Eligibility determinations will be coordinated and operationalized through the Office of the Attorney General's Division of Consumer Affairs, which includes the licensing boards for health professionals. This process may be dynamic and may require iterati on. COVID -19 Vaccine Response Partners - Response partners will support several planning activities, including, though not limited to, key distribution activities, vaccine operations and logistics, and POD s security. It is expected that the federal govern ment, along with McKesson, will be responsible for the procurement and distribution of the vaccines to the enrolled providers who NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 34 | P a g e ordered them through VTrckS. The OEM, in coordination with the NJ National Guard, NJDOH, and the provider networks, which incl ude LINCS agencies, health systems, and retail pharmacies , will support the management and configuration of the POD s, cold -chain logistics, security, and staffing support at large -scale county sites. Example Demand -Side Partners to Serve Critical Popul ations The State of New Jersey has mapped key governmental and nongovernmental touchpoints for critical populations throughout each phase of the COVID -19 vaccine rollout. Non -exhaustive exemplars include: COVID -19 Vaccine Specific Population Partners - Group leaders from communities, faith -based organizations, employers, and other state agencies will play a critical role in identifying and contacting the populations identified in Phases 1 A and 1 B. They will also play a role in communicating w ith these groups and may be leveraged for additional second dose reminders. They will be engaged during the establishment of PODS to ensure the appropriate groups can get sufficient access. Leveraging Existing Public -Private Partnerships - o Example: Com munity and Faith -based organizations - Since 1991, NJDOH Office of Minority and Multicultural Health (OMMH) has provided resources from the General State Fund to engage and support community and faith -based initiatives, such as assertive outreach, educatio n and patient linkage to healthcare services, aimed at eliminating health disparities. For instance, the OMMH's Community Health Disparity Prevention Program currently funds 18 organizations to implement evidence -based strategies or promising practices to reduce health disparities for a targeted population within the community. OMMH partners with governmental, non -governmental agencies and organizations and maintains a strong relationship with New Jersey local public health offices to support minority he alth and promote activities to reduce health disparities. Additionally, OMMH also maintains relationships with the New Jersey Primary Care Association and FQHCs that are included in all OMMH 's community outreach activities. o Example: Foundations - In anot her example of prior stakeholder engagement with community -based organization and local foundations, the NJDOH thirteen -member Healthy New Jersey (HNJ) Advisory Council (HNJAC) was formed in September 2019 and has met monthly with DOH's HNJ Coordinating Co mmittee (HNJCC) leadership since then to further the development of HNJ2030. Substantial engagement via email, video conference, and phone calls between HNJAC members and with HNJCC members has occurred over the past year in addition to the monthly meetin gs. o Example: Academic Institutions - NJDOH maintains strong collaborations with universities, graduate schools and centers of socio -economic research to engage and support these institutions in the study of health disparities and socio -economic determinant s of health. As an illustration, OMMH has supported the Rutgers' African American Brain Health Initiative: A University -Community Partnership. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 35 | P a g e o Example: Regional Health Hubs - Under 2020, NJ legislation , the Camden Coalition, Trenton Health Team, Greater Newark Healthcare Coalition, and the Health Coalition of Passaic County were designated as New Jersey's first Regional Health Hubs. Since 2011 these organizations have been Medicaid Accountable Care Organ izations. Through their positions as health leaders in their communities, the hubs support the State of New Jersey's health priorities by providing healthcare data infrastructure and analysis, supporting care management, and convening community stakeholder s in close coordination with the state's Office of Medicaid Innovation. In the past year, the four organizations have worked with NJDOH to address inequities in maternal health outcomes, access to cancer screening and treatment, challenges in access to he althy food, connections between healthcare and the faith community, youth tobacco use prevention, school attendance, improvements to the built environment, and more. They are currently engaged as participants in public confidence focus groups that will sh ape community messaging. Building Upon Existing Public Service - New Jersey has matched state agencies against critical populations to promote leveraging of existing relationships between government entities and the specific constituencies each serve. In cluded here is a broad summary. In practice, each state office may be called upon to leverage its relationships with its grantees, licensees, stakeholders, partners, and constituencies. Figure 2.g.1: Populations by CDC phasing and their relationships to state agencies CDC Phases Example subgroups Key touchpoints - state agencies Healthcare personnel 1A Hospital LTC workers Veteran's home workers Home care workers Ambulatory and urgent care clinic workers Dialysis center workers Dental office workers Morticians and funeral home workers Pharmacy workers Other non -hospital healthcare facilities workers Public health workers (e.g. FQHCs) Group home workers Other paid and unpaid licensed and unlicensed healthcare workers Department of Health Division of Consumer Affairs Department of Children and Families Department of Human Services Department of Military and Veterans Affairs Office of the Chief State Medical Examiner NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 36 | P a g e EMS personnel Other healthcare settings Long -term Care Residents 1A Long -term care facilities Veterans' homes Correctional facilities, prisons, juvenile centers, county jail IDD group homes Mental health group homes Psychiatric hospitals Other long -term care settings Department of Health Department of Military and Veterans Affairs Department of Corrections Department of Human Services Division of Consumer Affairs Department of Children and Families First Responders 1B Police Firefighters Other first responders Department of Health Office of Emergency Management Department of Community Affairs Other Essential Workers 1B Food service workers Port Authority workers New Jersey Transit workers Teachers, staff, and childcare workers Workers who support radio, print, internet and television news and media services Other critical workers (CISA) Other essential workers Department of Labor Port Authority New Jersey Transit Department of Education Office of the Secretary of Higher Education (OSHE) Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness (OHS&P) Department of Children and Families NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 37 | P a g e People at high risk of COVID - 19 illness 1C People at all ages with comorbid and underlying conditions that put them at high risk of COVID -19 (e.g., hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, immuno -compromised, sickle cell disease) People living or working in congregate or overcrowded settings - e.g. Colleges and universities People living or working in congregate or overcrowded settings - e.g. Migrant workers People living or working in congregate or overcrowded settings - Other Tribal populations Other people at high risk of COVID -19 illness due to comorbidities, occupations, demographics, etc. Department of Health Department of Human Services Department of Military and Veterans Affairs Department of Corrections Department of Children and Families Office of the Secretary of Higher Education (OSHE) Department of Agriculture Department of Labor New Jersey Commission of American Indian Affairs People 65 or older 1C People over 65 Department of Health Department of Human Services Department of Labor NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 38 | P a g e Section 3: Phased Approach to COVID -19 Vaccination New Jersey is planning to scale all vaccine implementation elements with increasing availability of vaccines to New Jersey. In this section, two dimensions are described in depth: eligibility to receive vaccine in each Phase and delivery system settings i n each Phase. Communications strategies to cultivate public confidence through vaccine promotion campaigning, risk communication, and engagement in each Phase are described in Section 12. Figure 3.1: When can I get vaccinated in New Jersey? Across all Phases, New Jersey will increase its capacity in every dimension, including but not limited to: Expanding outreach to all New Jerseyans; Enrolling sufficient providers through expansions in scopes of practice and concerted workforce recruitment; Connecting with increasing numbers and diversity of specific populations; Ensuring technological systems and data reporting capacity can meet increased usage and users; Deploying increasing capital, supply, and human resources; Monitoring equitable results and readjusting strategies and tactics accordingly. Iteration is key and New Jersey will adapt its phased approach as unknowns are resolved. Across each Phase, New Jersey must earn trust, communicate clea rly and factually, and provide meaningful access. Across phases, people will be eligible if they li ve, work, or are being educated in New Jersey and can self - identify as meeting the criteria for the current sub -phase. No professional nor medical document ation is required . NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 39 | P a g e Across all POD types, those administering vaccinations and staffing the PODs should be offered the opportunity to be vaccinated first. In accordance with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 's Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID -19 Vaccine , New Jersey is building upon existing systems across all levels of government to provide necessary resources to e nsure equitable allocation, distribution, and administration of COVID -19 vaccine s. However, like the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has found, the State of New Jersey does not anticipate that federal funding to NJ to -date will be sufficient to meet the resource needs for this complex, large -scale vaccination pr ogram. New Jersey recognizes that there may be a mismatch between vaccine supplies and public demand, so these factors may inform when New Jersey progresses between Phases: federal guidance, vaccine availability, time, public uptake, coordination across jurisdict ions. A. Phase 1: Potentially Limited Doses Available Prioritization and Allocation: New Jersey intends to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) framework and overarching definition for the broad outline of Phase 1 A, Phase 1 B, and Phase 1 C. Phase 1A includes healthcare personnel, who are defined by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and published by CDC as guidance in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report as \"Paid and unpaid persons serving in health care settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to pa tients or infectious materials .\" Phase 1A also includes residents of long -term care settings , who are defined by the ACIP as \"adults who reside in facilities that provide a range of services, including medical and personal care, to persons who are unable to live independently .\" Phase 1B includes essential workers. This will be defined in early 2021. Definition will be informed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) \"Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce\" advisory list , ACIP recommendations, and recommendations of the NJDOH COVID -19 Professional Advisory Committee . Phase 1C includes adults 65+ and adults with high -risk medical conditions who possess risk factors for severe COVID -19 illnes s. This will be defined in early 2021. It will be informed by COVID -19 cases and outcomes data and recommendations of the NJDOH COVID -19 Professional Advisory Committee . Within those initial Phases, sub -population prioritization is anticipated gi ven expectation of scarce vaccine availability at the onset and potential for supply shortages before vaccine manufacturing and distribution reaches scale. Further detail on the process is provided in Sections 4C (sub -group prioritization) and 7A (allocat ion). NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 40 | P a g e Written e xpectations for prioritization within the Phase 1A population at h ospital -based COVID -19 Vaccination Points of Dispensing at the start of the vaccination rollout was issued to acute care hospitals on December 10, 2020. The memo outlines the use of risk of acquiring infection and , as needed, the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to identify and offer vaccination to those at highest risk and then proceed stepwise to those with lowest risk. Prioritization and allocation decisions are constrained by logistical considerations (e .g. expectation that a site must be able to administer at least 975 doses per allotment of Pfizer vaccine product , at least initially), and will evolve with further clarity regarding reliability of vaccine supply and public demand. Phase 1A includes healthcare personnel. In accordance with Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations published by CDC as guidance in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, \"healthcare personnel\" are \"paid and unpaid persons serving i n health care settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials .\" This includes any type of worker within a healthcare setting. Examples include, but are not limited to: licensed healthcare professionals like doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and dentists staff like receptionists, janitors, mortuary services, laboratory technicians consultants, per diem, and contractors who are not directly employed by the facility unpaid workers like health professional st udents, trainees, volunteers, and essential caregivers community health workers, doulas, and public health professionals like Medical Reserve Corps personnel with variable venues like EMS, paramedics, funeral staff, and autopsy workers other paid or unpaid people who work in a healthcare setting, who may have direct or indirect contact with infectious persons or materials, and who cannot work from home For COVID -19 vaccination, any venue where healthcare occurs is a healthcare setting. Examples include, but are not limited to: Acute, pediatric, and behavioral health hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers Health facilities like psychiatric facilities, Federally Qualified Health Centers, and rehabs Clinic -based settings like urgent care clinics, dialysis centers, and family planning sites Long -term care settings like nursing homes, assisted living facilities, group homes, and others Occupational -based healthcare settings like health clinics within workplaces, shelters, jails, colleges and universities, an d K-12 schools Community -based healthcare settings like PACE and Adult Living Community Nursing Home -based settings like hospice, home care, and visiting nurse services Office -based healthcare settings like physician and dental offices Public health settin gs like local health departments, LINCS agencies, harm reduction centers, and medicinal marijuana programs Retail, independent, and institutional pharmacies Other settings where healthcare is provided Phase 1A also includes residents of long -term care facilities . Long -term care residents are adults who reside in facilities that provide a range of services, including medical and personal care, to persons who are unable to live independently. Examples of long -term care settings include, but is not limited to: NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 41 | P a g e Skilled nursing facilities Veterans homes Assisted living facilities, continuing care retirement communities, and personal care homes Group homes like residential care homes, adult family homes, adult foster homes, and intellectual and developmental disabilities group homes HUD 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program residences Institutional settings like psychiatric hospitals, correctional institutions, county jail s, and juvenile detention faciliti es (for eligible minors, e.g. 16+ years of age may be eligible for Pfizer vaccine under the emergency use authorization ) Other vulnerable, congregate, long -term settings Points of Dispensing : The number of PODS are informed by the amount of vaccine available, the frequency of restocking, and the cold chain parameters of the vaccine(s) authorized or approved. Geospatial mapping and facility capacities (e.g. ultracold chain) also inform which sites are established. During Phase 1, NJ will dispense vaccinations to identified target groups at one or more of the following: acute care hospitals (health care workers), as well as regional/county LINCS PODs , pharmacies , and FQHCs (first responders, critical infrastructure, and vulnerable populations). New Jersey is planning for Phase 1 A to be dispensed in closed and open PODs established by county level health departments , pharmacies, FQHCs, urgent care clinics , select primary care practices , and acute care hospitals . New Jersey aims for acute care hospitals to hold closed PODs for eligible employees and open PODs for other Phase 1A eligible healthcare workers. Additionally, a select number of LINCS agencies or local health departme nts may be engaged to establish POD s to ensure efficient deployment of vaccine, contingent on supply and demand. These could operate locally, county -wide, or regionally based on these dependencies. During Phase 1 B, NJ will continue PODs at acute care hospitals . NJ is working with large critical infrastructure sites that may be included in Phase 1 B to establish clo sed PODs. Vulnerable populations and other critical infrastructure personnel will be vaccinated at regional LINCS Agency PODs in coordination with other local health departments as well as FQHCs. Acute care hospitals may also expand eligibility at their open PODs to include Phase 1 B target groups beyond healthcare workers , vulnerable populations and essential workers included in Phase 1 B. Residents and staff of long -term care facilities have been a priority throughout the state's vaccination planning. N ew Jersey and federal agencies have partnered with CVS and Walgreens to provide end -to-end management of the vaccination process, including storage, handling, cold chain management, on -site vaccinations, and fulfillment of reporting requirements at certain types of long -term care facilities through the Pharmacy Partnership for Long -Term Care Program . During the October sign -up period, New Jersey actively promoted this opportunity to long -term care providers. For enrolled facilities, the partnership will facilitate safe and effective vaccination for residents and healthcare personnel serving within the ir facility who have not yet been vaccinated off -site. CVS and Walgreens will contact enrolled facilities to coordinate, share information, and, when the partnership is activated during Phase 1A, to begin scheduling on -site clinics. The Partnership will begin with serving skilled nursing facilities and will expand to other NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 42 | P a g e types of long -term care settings. New Jersey has also started to establish alternative providers for settings that are not served by the Partnership. In light of scarce resources, inclu ding vaccine and staffing, New Jersey is planning the establishment of approximately six very high throughput sites (up to 2,400 doses/day) to be opened in early 2021. These will be geographically dispersed across the state and complement the other nearby vaccine administration capacity. These may be managed by the state or by universities. Figure 3.A.1: Where can healthcare personnel and long -term care residents expect to get vaccinated in Phase 1A? B. Phase 2: Large Number of Doses Available, Supply Likely to Meet Demand Prioritization and Allocation: New Jersey intends to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) framework for the broad outline of Phase 2. While population prioritization may not be necessary once large numb er of doses available, scarce resource allocation may be necessary given potential for intermittent supply shortages and increasing numbers of POD s deployed statewide. Further detail on the process is provided in Section 7A. Prioritization and allocation decisions will evolve with further clarity regarding reliability of vaccine supply and public demand. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 43 | P a g e For planning and tabletop exercise purposes and informed by limited federal and national guidance to - date, the working assumptions as preliminarily reco mmended by the NJDOH COVID -19 Professional Advisory Committee are listed: Note : Many prioritization and allocation items remain in process. Note : These will be validated through governmental and nongovernmental channels, and are subject to change given f eedback, further information (including results of vaccine trials, additional federal guidance, and Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations), New Jersey's public health surveillance, modeling, reporting, and survey data, and other fact ors. Units of who is vaccinated: Individuals and households. Eligibility: o CDC's Phase 2 of Phase 1 populations.\" \"Critical populations.\" \"General population.\" o Inclusive of those who live, work, and/or are educated in New Jersey. Sub-population prioritization criteria not anticipated to be necessary. May need to target allocations to align with population density and capacity to efficiently, equitably deploy scarce resources statewide. Points of Dispensing : The number of POD s will be informed by the amount of vaccine available, the frequency of restocking, and the cold chain parameters of the vaccine(s) authorized or approved. Geospatial mapping and facility capacities (e.g. ultracold chain) will also inform which sites are e stablished. During Phase 2, NJ will scale the variety and number of POD s statewide. New Jersey will continue with dispensing sites at hospitals, regional/LINCS Agency PODs (and will add sites at additional LHDs and healthcare facilities, including FQHCs. NJ will add pharmacies as dispensing sites and will also work with large agencies (public and private) to provide on -site employee vaccinations through closed PODs. NJ will encourage enrollment by large medical practices and other interested private prac titioners in the program. If needed, NJ will open one or more state sites to augment the local and regional dispensing. C. Phase 3: Likely Sufficient Supply, Slowing Demand Prioritization and Allocation: New Jersey intends to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) framework for the broad outline of Phase 3. Processes for scarce resource allocation and population prioritization will remain until there is a reliable vaccine supply. When there is sufficient supply, resource alloca tion can shift to routine processes, such as \"as needed\" disbursement. However, no determinations have been made at this time due to significant unknowns in the interim. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 44 | P a g e For planning and tabletop exercise purposes and informed by limited federal and national guidance to - date, the working assumptions as preliminarily recommended by the NJDOH COVID -19 Professional Advisory Committee are listed: Note : Many prioritization an d allocation items remain in process. Note : These will be validated through governmental and nongovernmental channels, and are subject to change given feedback, further information (including results of vaccine trials, additional federal guidance, and Advi sory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations), New Jersey's public health surveillance, modeling, reporting, and survey data, and other factors. Units of who is vaccinated: Individuals and households. Eligibility: o CDC's Phase 3 = o f Phase 1 populations.\" \"Critical populations.\" \"General population.\" o Inclusive of those who live, work, and/or are educated in New Jersey. Sub-population prioritization criteria not anticipated to be necessary. Scarce resource allocation criteria not anticipated to be necessary. Points of Dispensing : NJ will scale back dispensing sites as demand wanes and transition to routine venues for vaccine administration . Since healthcare workers and residents at LTC facilities and other congregate settings will have been vaccinated in prior phases, NJ will focus on regional/county LHD sites and partnerships wi th pharmacies and private medical practices. However, New Jersey will used mixed methods research to assess reasons for slowing demand and may adapt response approach accordingly. Slow demand can be attributed to a multitude of causes, for example : Lack of trust from residents Lack of information to residents Lack of trust of the POD by residents Access points are barriers A plan to overcome these and other barriers will be fundamental to implementation across phases and will be evaluated at various poi nts of time. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 45 | P a g e Section 4: Critical Populations A. Critical Populations Given CDC-informed planning assumptions that there may be limited vaccine supplies relative to demand in initial phases and that there may be insufficient vaccine available at onset to achieve community protection as well as uncertainty about the volume and reliability of re sources to be provided to New Jersey's COVID -19 vaccines effort , the New Jersey Department of Health has coordinated identification, estimation, and geolocation of critical populations to inform planning, policymaking, and delivery. a. Identification In the se preliminary planning stages, New Jersey has identified critical populations in conformance with CDC guidance. Additional critical population groupings have been identified based off other COVID -19 response activities (e.g. testing, contact tracing, etc .). Further groupings may arise based on factors such as further federal guidance, the specific eligibility criterion of any authorized or approval COVID -19 vaccines, equity considerations for planning and delivery, or operational considerations to deploy scarce resources. Subject to all applicable laws and regulations, critical populations in New Jersey include, but are not limited to: Category Illustrative Examples Healthcare workers: Hospital workers Long term care workers Veteran's home workers Home care workers Ambulatory and urgent care clinic workers Dialysis center workers Dental offices workers Morticians and funeral home workers Pharmacy workers Public health workers (e.g., FQHC) Group home workers EMS personnel Other paid and unpai d licensed and unlicensed healthcare workers Other essential workers in sectors that include, but are not limited to: First responders Food and agriculture Transportation Education and child -care workers Energy Water and sanitation Law enforcement Government Other NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 46 | P a g e Adults at higher risk for severe COVID -19 due to congregate living and/or working environments, which include, but are not limited to: Long -term care facility residents Adults 65 years of age or older Adults with underlying m edical conditions (diabetes, obesity, COPD, asthma, CKD etc.) Adults who are immunocompromised Adults incarcerated or Adults detained in correctional facilities or county jails Adults in homeless shelters Adults in group homes Adults in other congregate s ettings, such as adults in psychiatric institutions and migrant and seasonal farmworkers Other Critical Populations considered high risk for COVID -19: People from communities that have disproportionately acquired and/or died from COVID -19 People from tribal communities People attending colleges/universities People living in rural communities People with disabilities People who are under - or uninsured *Note: These groups are not mutually exclusive, therefore selective double counting is expected. b. Estimation New Jersey's estimation of critical populations at the state and local levels is conducted by the New Jersey Department of Health. Estimates for each critical population are derived through collaboration between the New Jersey Department of Health , other state agencies (e.g. Office of Homeland Security, Department of Labor, Division of Consumer Affairs, Department of Human Services, Office of New Americans, etc.), and other external partners (e.g. employer and community groups). Estimates specific to COVID -19 vaccination planning build on data from other COVID -19 response activities. Preliminary population sizing estimates were compiled using data sources such as, but not limited to: NJDOH routine and pandemic -specific data sources (e.g. health facility licensing data). Office of the Attorney General - Division of Consumer Affairs routine data source (e.g. licensure data for all licensed professions). Office of Homeland Security (e.g. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency databa se maintained for New Jersey). Federal data sources (e.g. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Bureau of Labor Statistics). Survey data (e.g. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, American Hospital Association). Aggregate numbers of example c ritical population for New Jersey are displayed in the exhibit below. These estimates used CDC Phases as detailed in the Playbook issued 9/16/2020. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 47 | P a g e Figure 4.a.ii -1 - Population Estimates for CDC Playbook (issued 9/16/20) Phases - highly preliminary *Note: Since these estimates were compiled in September and October 2020, long -term care residents have been added to Phase 1A. Updated population estimates are pending and will be revised. c. Geolocation In addition to identifying and estimating critical populations, the State of New Jersey has worked across state agencies and in collaboration with external partners to locate each critical population.

Definition Figure 4.b.i -1: CISA Diagram of Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers (Source: CISA's Gu idance on Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers issued 8/18/2020 ) The State of New Jersey will work across key State Agencies and Departments to define and estimate numbers of persons in New Jersey's critical infrastructure workforce. Definition is in-process by such groups as: New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) , which chairs the State of New Jersey's Coronavirus Task Force (established under Executive Order No. 102 ) and whic h coordinates in conjunction with the State Director of Emergency Management (Superintendent of State Police) the activities under New Jersey's declared Public Health Emergency and State of Emergency (established under Executive Order No. 103 ). Office of Emergency Management (OEM) within NJ State Police, which coordinates in conjunction with the Commissioner of Health the activities under New Jersey's declared Public Health Emergency and State of Emergency (established under Executive Order No. 103 ). Domestic Security Preparedness Task Force ( DSPTF ) within New Jersey's Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness , which coordinates the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) data for the state of New J ersey. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 50 | P a g e Economic Development Authority (EDA), which will help reflect the differential impact of COVID - 19 on industry and economics in the state of New Jersey and which co -chairs the Restart and Recovery Commission. Further refinement of definitions may in clude such groups as: Other state agencies that may include or represent critical infrastructure workers (e.g. Department of Labor, Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, Board of Public Utilities, Department of Agriculture, Department of Community A ffairs, Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Transportation). Other groups within and outside government. e. Estimation Each of the entities involved in definition are or will be involved in estimation. The preliminary definitions and esti mations will be tested with key stakeholder groups, including the New Jersey Governor's Restart and Recovery Commission and the New Jersey Restart and Recovery Advisory Council. These entities were established to bring together leaders from various industry, community, and faith - based groups and institutions across New Jersey to advise state leadership on economic issues impacted by the pandemic and to begin creating a framew ork for New Jersey's long -term economic recovery . The Commission includes sub-committees focus on : Health Public & Social Services Economic / Fiscal The Advisory Council 's sub -committees focus on : Facilities and Construction Government Health Care Main Street Manufacturing and Supply Chain Professional Services Social Services and Faith Tourism and Entertainment Transportation Infrastructure See Commission, Advisory Council, and subcommittees membership in the Appendix. Highly preliminary aggr egate estimates for New Jersey's critical infrastructure workforce are included in the prior sub -section of this plan. These estimates do not yet account for which critical infrastructure workers face occupational exposure versus those who can work from h ome, for example. In addition to adding greater definitional specificity, sub -grouping may be necessary. Such sub -groupings may be NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 51 | P a g e evaluated against the risk -based criteria specified by National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 's (NASEM) Framework for Equitable Allocation of a COVID -19 Vaccine : Risk of acquiring infection : Individuals have higher priority to the extent that they have a greater probability of being in settings where SARS -CoV-2 is circulating and of being exposed to a sufficient dose of the virus. Risk of severe morbidity and mortality : Individuals have higher priority to the extent that they have a greater probability of severe disease or death if they acquire infection. Risk of negative societal impact : Individuals have higher priority to the extent that societal function and other individuals' lives and livelihood depend on them directly and would be imperiled if they f ell ill. Risk of transmitting infection to others : Individuals have higher priority to the extent that there is a higher probability of their transmitting the infection to others. All information being gathered for population identification, sizing, and locating will be layered with the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index as well as potentially additional indices. These indexes will be used to ensure an equity lens is applied to all p lanning. B. Process to Identify Critical Population Sub -Groups, If Insufficient Vaccine Supply Under New Jersey's Emergency Health Powers Act (N.J.S.A. 26:13 -23): a. [New Jersey Department of Health] commissioner shall develop and implement a New Jersey Vaccine Education and Prioritization Plan, as provided in subsection b. of this section, when the commissioner determines that: (1) an emergent condition exists and there is clear evidence that adverse and avoidable health outcomes from a preventabl e and acute communicable disease are expected to affect identifiable categories of high -risk individuals throughout the State; and (2) in order to protect or treat such individuals, assistance with the administration of vaccine is warranted due to a vaccin e shortage. b. To protect the public health during a vaccine shortage, the commissioner shall issue an order to implement a New Jersey Vaccine Education and Prioritization Plan, which shall comprise: (1) procedures for the assessment of available vaccin e Statewide; (2) procedures for the distribution and administration of vaccines that shall apply to physicians, nurses, health care facilities, pharmacies and others that dispense vaccines. The procedures shall include, but not be limited to, a definiti on of high -risk groups for priority protection or treatment in the event a vaccine shortage is imminent or existent; an (3) procedures for: (a) mobilizing public and private health resources to assist in vaccine distribution and administration; and (b) reallocating available supplies of vaccine to most effectively meet the needs of the State's high -risk groups, if necessary. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 52 | P a g e c. As used in this section, \"vaccine\" includes vaccines, immune products and chemoprophylactic and treatment medications. d. A person who willfully or knowingly violates the New Jersey Vaccine Education and Prioritization Plan or any procedures contained therein shall be liable for a civil penalty of $500 for each violation. The penalty shall be sued for and collected by the c ommissioner in a summary proceeding before the Superior Court pursuant to the \"Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999,\" P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58 -10 et seq.). e. The commissioner shall notify the appropriate professional or occupational licensing board or licen sing authority, in the case of a facility, of repeated violations of the procedures by a health care professional or licensed facility. This Plan establish es all of the procedures listed above. Deliberative Processes Throughout the COVID -19 crisis, state leadership has engaged subject matter experts and thought leaders to guide New Jersey through this extraordinary and challenging time. The New Jersey Department of Health COVID -19 Professional Advisory Committee (PAC) was convened as one su ch forum to inform the Commissioner of Health. The Professional Advisory Committee (PAC) provide s guidance to the Department to ensure that New Jersey 's response to COVID -19 is based on the latest scientific, medical, ethical and public health evidence. As the scale and impact of the COVID -19 crisis has evolved, the functions and focus areas of the PAC have evolved as well. The Committee previously informed allocation of critical care resources, distribution of scarce treatment pharmaceuticals (i.e. remdesivir), and targeted population -specific testing strategies (i.e. urban communities) during this public health emergency. Since summer 2020, the PAC has reviewed federal guidance and is in process of developing recommendations for equitable va ccination population prioritization and allocation. These recommendations will be informed by subcommittees focused on health equity, community advocacy, and medical ethics and systems. There is ongoing iterative information sharing between the PAC and t he work groups mobilized within state agencies for vaccination planning and implementation. Interim recommendations have been shared with state entities and state information (e.g. data, logistics plans, etc.) is recurrently shared with the PAC to inform recommendations. Upon receipt of the final recommendations of the NJDOH COVID -19 Professional Advisory Committee, the New Jersey Department of Health will socialize recommendations with other formal bodies and informal stakeholders to ensure diverse per spectives and a broad cross -section of New Jerseyans are integrated into planning. The ecosystem may include those listed in Section 2. The Cabinet as mobilized through the Coronavirus Task Force has been and will continue to be deeply engaged to ensure that no constituency is unjustly left behind. Additionally, close collaboration with the Office of the Governor will persist. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 53 | P a g e Interim Planning New Jersey intends to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) framework as outlined in the Playbook: Phase 1 A, Phase 1 B, Phase 1 C, Phase 2, and Phase 3. Within the initial Phases, sub -population prioritization is anticipated given expectation of scarce vaccine availability at the onset and potential for supply shortages before vaccine manufactu ring and distribution reaches scale. Sub -population prioritization and scarce resource allocation may also be needed at other times is supplies shortages arise. Informing that sub -prioritization will include, but are not limited to: New Jersey -specific d ata, including but not limited to epidemiological, occupational, geospatial, demographic factors. Principles articulated by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 's (NASEM) Framework for Equitable Allocation of a COVID -19 Vaccine , by the Johns Hopkins' Interim Framework for COVID -19 Vaccine Allocation and Distribution in the United States , and other public health expert guidance, data, and literature. Final ACIP recommendations on priority groups for each vaccine available through an EUA or traditional licensure. New Jersey expects real -time decision -making given variability in supply and demand. Logistical considerations (e.g. expectation that a site must be able to administer at least 1000 doses per allotment) a nd experiential data (e.g. throughput of specific sites). Unknowns such as reliability of vaccine supply, success in provider onboarding and POD s creation, and public demand. C. Process to Establish Points of Contact (POCs) and Communication Methods for Critical Population Sub -groups Process to Establish POC The State of New Jersey is establishing discrete points of contact for critical population groups to locate and notify potential vaccine recipients when the vaccine is made available to them. Led by the Specific Populations Planning work group, the VTF is leveraging points of contact from prior COVID -19 pandemic response work (e.g. contacts used as part of the COVID -19 Testing Taskforce and the long -term care COVID -19 response) and existing State a gency relationships. The list of critical populations by CDC Phase was shared with all NJDOH leadership and program staff. NJDOH personnel are collating contacts from existing grantees, boards and advisory councils, licensees, regulated entities, and ot her routine external partner and constituent engagement. This effort is expanding across state agencies to identify and establish points of contact to be able to reach critical populations. For example, the New Jersey Department of Labor has been engage d in development of this exhaustive stakeholder list. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 54 | P a g e External partners are also involved in broadening the universe of contacts for sub -populations as defined preliminarily by the CDC Playbook (further definition in progress as explained in other plan s ections). Every internal and external agency plans to share current list of existing and new stakeholders that have been engaged prior and during COVID -19 vaccine planning. These stakeholders include, but are not limited to: Faith -based Organization lea ders Community -based organization leaders Tribal Commissions Community Health Education leaders from NJSSOPHE Public Health academic partners Through these channels, the State of New Jersey has developed a mapping of population category, population subc ategory, organization, geographic (e.g. county or local health department region), point of contact, key group, and population estimate. Preliminary, illustrative mapping is provided in Figure 2.g.1. As more information is made available, this mapping wi ll continue to be updated. Communications for Critical Population Sub -Groups Purpose: To reduce any misinformation or concerns about the COVID -19 vaccine (s), it is important to ensure that our residents have accurate information on the benefits and risks of the vaccines(s), the priority groups to be vaccinated and the basis of the decisions why these groups were chosen, the importance of the vaccine to reduce the burden of the pandemic, and other vital information. Further detail about the ethos of COVID -19 vaccine -related communications in Section 12. In addition to utilizing mass communications (e.g. public -facing websites, Governor's press conferences, earned and paid media, etc.), the State of New Jersey or delegated entities may engage critical population groups directly, through their places of employment or occupational professional entities, through affinity groups (e.g. older adults th rough AARP), through trusted community leaders, and by other creative avenues. Illustrative, but not exhaustive examples of communication methods under consideration include: Partnering with employers to leverage existing technology - For example, util izing a wide use health network alert system for healthcare providers and staff. Healthcare systems use their text system to inform and provide next steps through smartphones. This can be done for vaccine access, shortage, dashboard on percent vaccinated , second dose reminders, and other useful information on this electronic mobile platform. Large employers' communication systems can also be utilized in the same fashion as the ones above. Partnering with local government entities or community -based organ izations to leverage existing notification channels - For example, u tilizing school districts (both public and private) communication systems to share vaccine information to students, parents, educators, school NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 55 | P a g e staff, and school administrators . This is th e same system that gives parents information on school delays, closures, events. Implementing new technological solutions specific to COVID -19 - For example , NJDOH will consider whether to deploy a vaccine app to outreach, educate, remind people of fir st and second doses, request feedback on access, efficiency, quantity, locations of PODs, and/or etc. A NJDOH mobile app for contact tracing was launched in October 2020. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 56 | P a g e Section 5: COVID -19 Provider Recruitment and Enrollment A. COVID -19 Vaccination Provider Recruitment and Enrollment Types of Vaccine Providers to be Recruited Led by the Office of the Attorney General's Division of Consumer Affairs, the State of New Jersey has identified the types of licensed health professionals qualified to administer COVID -19 vaccines. This will be continually reevaluated and potentially exp anded contingent on supply and demand needs for increased vaccine administration workforce. The current list of NJ professional licensees eligible to administer COVID -19 vaccines are listed in the Appendix. New Jersey is pleased that a prescription wil l not be required for COVID -19 vaccination under the Pfizer emergency use authorization letter . Should a prescription be necessary for other COVID -19 vaccines , only a limited subset of licensed pro fessionals may issue under current regulations . Types of Settings to be Enrolled Enrollment for New Jersey's purposes includes both signing of the CDC Provider Agreement and onboarding into the New Jersey Immunization Information System. NJDOH has a rob ust network of federally funded vaccine providers with over 800 VFC providers and 126 317-Funded Adult Vaccine Program providers. The current 317 -Funded Adult Vaccine providers include local health departments, FQHCs and non -profit organizations. Target ing specific providers to administer COVID -19 vaccine is determined to be the best approach, particularly in Phase 1 when supplies are limited. Using this approach will assure that all critical populations can be reached and that it can be assured that COV ID-19 vaccine is being administered to the appropriate populations identified for vaccination. Recruitment of providers will be facilitated by working with current governmental agencies, professional organizations, and other vaccine stakeholders. Initia lly in advance of Phase 1, the DOH is recruiting within the following provider types among those currently enrolled as 317 -Funded providers (e.g. expanding number of FQHCs enrolled) and is expanding the base to include additional sites to support vaccination within Phase 1 and into Phase 2 : Local Health Departments - The New Jersey Local Information Network and Communications System (LINCS) is a network of 2 2 strategically positione d local health departments located throughout the state of NJ. LINCS agencies will subsequently determine the Local Health Department partners in each of their 2 2 locations. NJDOH will also work in conjunction with them and other local and county authori ties to coordinate the vaccine effort within their jurisdiction s. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 57 | P a g e Acute Care Hospitals - NJDOH aims to enroll the 71 acute care hospitals in New Jersey. NJDOH has a strong working relationship with the New Jersey Hospital Association (NJHA) and licenses a ll acute care hospitals through the NJDOH Health Systems Branch . These sites will serve as vaccination sites for the Phase 1 vaccination effort of healthcare workers and will be utilized during Phase 2 and 3 to assist with broader vaccination efforts , as needed. Community Health Centers - NJDOH will also enroll community health centers and work with the New Jersey Primary Care Association (NJPCA) . There are 23 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) that operate 135 sites in neighborhoods throughout th e state, including school -based and mobile sites in each of the 21 counties of New Jersey. Community Health Centers provide healthcare services to over half a million New Jerseyan s annually and are uniquely posed to reach high -risk vulnerable populations. FQHCs are well represented among the VFC and 317 -Funded providers. DOH has awarded 3.5 million dollars in Immunization Supplemental Funding to 10 FQHCs that are also 317 -Adult providers. Through these funds, the NJDOH Vaccine Preventable Disease Program is working closely with these 10 facilities to improve their immunization infrastructure by purchasing appropriate vaccine storage units, digital data loggers, improving information technology capability, and augmenting staff. This improved infrastructur e enhances their ability to immunize against influenza and to support their future COVID -19 vaccination efforts. As a condition of the supplemental funding, these sites will be hosting mass influenza immunization events during fall 2020 which will assist these facilities with developing and testing their COVID -19 vaccination plans. Pharmacies - NJDOH will onboard pharmacy providers who are not receiving direct federal shipments as needed. Further detail provided in Section 5H. Health clinics - Urgent care centers and large primary care practices have been engaged to bolster the POD s network given the expectation that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will be available as soon as mid-December 2020. Health profession schools - New Jersey's leading health professional schools may implement PODs independently or in conjunction with their affiliated acute care hospital. As the vaccine becomes more available , the NJDOH will identify priv ate provider groups that serve the populations targeted for vaccination in later phases. Once the vaccine is approved for children, the NJDOH will target the existing VFC -enrolled providers for participation in the COVID -19 vaccination program. This robus t network of over 800 providers is comprised primarily of private providers to which the VFC - program annually distributes 1.6 million doses for administration to VFC -eligible children. B. COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Types and Settings for First Vaccine Shipmen t Types of Vaccine Providers NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 58 | P a g e Provider types for the initial COVID -19 vaccine available will include healthcare professionals who have historically included provision of vaccines within their scopes of practice. Preference is for vaccine administrators who provide this service often, because confidence on the part of the provider may yield public confidence. Types of Settings The first week of vaccine doses will be administered by the 5 2 acute care hospitals that are equipped to store, handle, administer, and bill for the newly authorized Pfizer vaccine . 76,050 first doses have been allocated to New Jersey for week 1 (week of December 14, 2020) of the Pfizer vaccine usage. New Jersey expects that second d oses will be sent to New Jersey's points of dispensing at the approval interval (e.g. to ensure second dose at approximately 21 days for Pfizer vaccine). The PODS network for the Moderna vaccine will be quite different as a broader diversity of facility types can manage this vaccine product. A portion of initial doses made available to New Jersey will be reserved for the Pharmacy Partnership for Long -term Care Program, which New Jersey aims to start as soon as possible in 2020. C. Provider Enrollment Data Collection and Submission to CDC New Jersey Department of Health has integrat ed the provider enrollment components within NJIIS, New Jersey's state immunization registry. Technical staff created a system to export data and submit in the CDC-provided Comma Separated Values (CSV) or JavaScript (JSON) format to CDC on a twice weekly ba sis. D. Vaccine Administrator License Verification NJDOH Vaccine Preventable Disease Program currently has a manual process that involves vetting the credentials of enrolling providers using online databases available through the Office of the Attorney General's Division of Consumer Affairs (OAG -DCA), the agency that licenses and regulates certain healthcare providers in N ew Jersey . NJDOH is exploring an alternate method of vetting through use of data available from the OAG -DCA website . The intention is that NJDOH would electronically match providers who enroll in NJIIS with the OAG -DCA electronic databases to ensure that persons identified as providers practi cing at the facility in the CDC COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Agreement have prescribing authority i n New Jersey . E. Provider Training The training and tracking of enrolled providers will use systems already in place for providers enrolled in the NJ Vaccines for Children and 317 -Funded Adult Programs. At least two representatives from each enrolled provider site (the Primary and Back -up Vaccine Coordinator) are required to take COVID -19 NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 59 | P a g e specific trainings via GotoWebinar. Additional people at each site will be trained per CDC recommendations/requirements. The webinar software provides detailed reports for registration, attendance, and co mpletion of training. That information will be documented in NJIIS and are available for output as required. Training topics include: ACIP recommendations COVID -19 vaccine ordering, receiving, storage and handling Inventory management Use of the NJIIS including data entry and interfacing Using NJIIS reports to review the doses administered data reported by the site Vaccine administration Management of vaccine wastage, spoilage, and temperature excursions Reporting adverse events to VAERS EUA facts sheet s and/or VISs NJDOH may require or offer additional training as deemed necessary to ensure appropriate vaccine storage and handling, and adherence to other terms outlined in the Agreement Requirements of the CDC COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Agreement. These trainings may be conducted in a variety of formats including virtual site visits. The identified CMO/CFO, Primary and Back -Up Vaccine Coordinators , and any staff involved in COVID -19 vaccination might be required to participate. In addition to these tra inings conducted remotely, onsite training in workflow process and discrete responsibilities for each role may be offered onsite. These may occur at the beginning of each operational day, as new staff members cycle into the POD, or at another cadence as d eemed necessary by the specific POD. These onsite trainings would be supplementary and are not substitutes for the statewide webinar . F. Approval of Planned COVID -19 Vaccine Redistributions NJIIS has the current capacity to track and approve transfers of vaccine to agencies that are currently enrolled in the system. Redistribution deliberations will be assessed and executed through collaboration across VTF workgroups. NJDOH is assessing if there are additional requiremen ts that are not satisfied by the current system alone and will integrate those requirements as necessary. G. Equitable Access to COVID -19 Vaccines An example of how New Jersey is applying a quality improvement mindset is in the way we will strive to achie ve equity in COVID -19 vaccination. According to the CDC, health equity is achieved when every person has the opportunity to \"attain his or her full health potential\" and no one is \" disadvantaged from achieving this potential because of social position or other socially determined circumstances.\" COVID -19 vaccine accessibility is related to removal of barriers includ ing, but not limited to : Transportation NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 60 | P a g e Process and criteria to rec eive vaccine (e.g., required documentation, long wait lines) Financial burden Cultural beliefs Limited English proficiency Perceptions/attitudes Please see exhibit below an outline of how New Jersey's equity -focused quality improvement will be applied ac ross multiple facets of the program. This list is descriptive, not exhaustive. Figure 5.g.1: Leverag ing quality improvement mindset to promote equity in vaccination Organizational Structure and Stakeholder Engagement Incorporating diverse collaborators and perspectives in planning and delivery Cultivating broad and inclusive partnerships Identifying which critical population leaders and advocates should be involved in every planning phase Ensuring active engagement with specific popu lation groups and stakeholders at the planning stages from beginning to end (before first doses are made available) Engaging with and planning for vulnerable populations early and often Phased Approach Ensuring equitable population prioritization when resources limited (e.g. including but not limited to consideration of NASEM and JHU frameworks) Enabling holistic and data -informed consideration of power, privilege, and vulnerability in prioritization and allocation Ensuring equit able allocation of constrained resources given variability in available vaccines and resources Public Confidence Providing transparency to foster trust Partnering with strong trusted leaders for community education Using conventional and innovative communications channels to connect with underserved populations Points of Dispensing Setup To remove transportation barriers , POD mapping, census tract mapping that includes social vulnerability indices, with distance between residence concentr ations and access accountability will be taken into account. Micro -geo-mapping can ensure that there is an access point that reduces transportation barriers for all communities. Ensuring COVID -19 mitigation strategies to prevent disease transmission o n-site: socially distanced seating, one -way traffic flow, mandate to wear masks, hand sanitizer, and plexiglass barriers Providing services during non -business hours to accommodate working families NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 61 | P a g e Providing vaccination in safe, familiar, and convenient locations Ensuring transportation accessibility ( e.g. walking distance t o mass transit like train s or bus, use of UberHealth, etc.) On-site, Off -site, and Mass Communications To ensure diverse cultural belief respected, develop and implement focused education for diverse communities . Engaging these diverse members with stakeholder forums and conversations to understand and respect beliefs while educating on vaccine benefits. Offering second dose reminders in multiple formats (e.g. digital, telephonic, written, etc.) to accommodate diverse consumers Issuing informed consent, emergency use authorization (EUA) fact sheets, vaccine information statement (VISs), and other documents in culturally competent, health literate, and l inguistically accessible formats . All materials and patient documents must be translated in the top 12 NJ languages and ensure interpretation services for each PODs Reviewing materials through a health literacy review committee (NJ SOPHE) Providing instructions and materials in the top 10 NJ languages Staffing Diversifying types of vaccin e administrators onboarded to provide coverage for all segments of population Including in POD s staffing a patient navigator (s) who is representative of the community served Including personnel who are bi lingual or multilingual to ensure understanding of limited English proficiency (LEP) consumers Americans with Disabilities Act (A DA) and Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) credentialing of staff , especially clinical personnel Specific Populations Engagement Concerted action to alert those with limited access to information about when, where , and how to receive vaccination Connecting and serving non -institution -associated subpopulations through unconventional partnerships Developing tailored strategies to accommodate those with limited mobility (e.g., those in institutional settings, thos e with ADA needs, etc.) Consumer Affordability Considering affordability options for uninsured, underinsured, and other vulnerable groups (e.g. those subject to Public Charge Rule ). If a cost is associated with vaccine services, a sliding scale of state poverty criteria should supersede federal criteria.

Recruitment and Enrollment of Pharmacies Pharmacy chains will be particularly valuable in reaching the adult population when vaccine supplies become ubiquitous. Retail pharmacies have likewise been critical in scaling COVID -19 testing in New Jersey's general population. NJDOH will also work with the associations representing pharmacists and the pharmacy industry during this process to more easily identify pharmacies not represented by the larger chains. NJDOH has been in touch with these entities throughout the pandemic regard ing testing, and NJOAG -DCA interfaces frequently with these entities through and in oversight of the New Jersey Board of Pharmacy. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 63 | P a g e Section 6: COVID -19 Vaccine Administration Capacity A. Estimation of COVID -19 Vaccine Administration Capacity The State is a dopting \"vaccine administration capacity,\" as defined by CDC, as the maximum achievable vaccination throughput regardless of public demand for vaccination . The State's planning assumption , therefore, is to vaccinate up to 70% of its current eligible population . This is in line with Healthy People 2030's national target for influenza vaccine uptake . We do not yet know the t hreshold to confer community protection (\"herd immunity\") for this communicable disease. For preliminary planning purposes, current eligible population exclude d those under the age of 18 and pregnant women , because these cohorts were not included in COVID -19 vaccine trials . Now that the Pfizer vaccine has been authoriz ed for limited use in pregnant persons and in minors aged 16 and older , New Jersey's estimates will change too . New Jersey's population is inclusive of those who live, work, and/or are educated in New Jersey. The State has developed its estimated vaccine administration capacity based on both an at -scale model (phases 2 -3) and the initial phase (limited doses available) outlined in the CDC Playbook issued 9/16/2020 . It has then overlaid, based on its own planni ng assumptions, county population, demographics, estimated populations of each identified phase, as well as the potential maximum throughput and anticipated participation of multiple POD sites, including but not limited to hospitals, FQHCs, pharmacies, urg ent care centers, and government -run sites. The State has assessed throughput by vaccination setting type, incorporating factors identified in the CDC Playbook (e.g., routine immunization programs being conducted simultaneously, infection control measures) . To that end, the State has developed an assumption of the average vaccination throughput needed on a daily basis if vaccinations are conducted 6 days per week for a 6 -month duration. This assumption has been further broken down proportionately by county based on population. The VTF will utilize the POD site throughput estimation model that we developed in order to right -size POD planning assumptions by county, which will inform State, county, and local decision -making on the number and types of PODs nee ded to achieve these goals. B. Application of Capacity Estimates to Provider Recruitment Planning This scenario planning has informed the State's POD s network plan that will be sequenced and implemented as scale dictates. This dynamic network plan accounts for the number, setting type, nature (e.g., closed transitioning to open), throughput, and location of the POD s that will be required in the State to deliver against its COVID -19 vaccine plan. Provider recruitment will directly follow from this POD s netwo rk sequencing plan. The State is utilizing this information to revise a toolkit for potential POD s to include minimum site requirements based on these planning assumptions. State leadership has implemented an outreach campaign to hospitals, FQHCs, pharmacies, government -run counties, and other potential dispensing providers to socialize these minimum requirements and ascertain any potential challenges that may be faced by these groups. This gap analysis will be used to help the State sequence provider recruitment and NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 64 | P a g e help each provider group overcome any anticipated challenges to meet throughput goals as estimated in the planning tools. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 65 | P a g e Section 7: COVID -19 Vaccine Allocation, Ordering, Distribution, and Inventory Management A. Scarce Vaccine Allocation Under New Jersey's Emergency Health Powers Act (N.J.S.A. 26:13 -23): a. [New Jersey Department of Health] commissioner shall develop and implement a New Jersey Vaccine Education and Priorit ization Plan, as provided in subsection b. of this section, when the commissioner determines that: (1) an emergent condition exists and there is clear evidence that adverse and avoidable health outcomes from a preventable and acute communicable disease are expected to affect identifiable categories of high -risk individuals throughout the State; and (2) in order to protect or treat such individuals, assistance with the administration of vaccine is warranted due to a vaccine shortage. b. To protect the publi c health during a vaccine shortage, the commissioner shall issue an order to implement a New Jersey Vaccine Education and Prioritization Plan, which shall comprise: (1) procedures for the assessment of available vaccine Statewide; (2) procedures for th e distribution and administration of vaccines that shall apply to physicians, nurses, health care facilities, pharmacies and others that dispense vaccines. The procedures shall include, but not be limited to, a definition of high -risk groups for priority protection or treatment in the event a vaccine shortage is imminent or existent; an (3) procedures for: (a) mobilizing public and private health resources to assist in vaccine distribution and administration; and (b) reallocating available supplies of vaccine to most effectively meet the needs of the State's high -risk groups, if necessary. c. As used in this section, \"vaccine\" includes vaccines, immune products and chemoprophylactic and treatment medications. d. A person who willfully or knowingly violates the New Jersey Vaccine Education and Prioritization Plan or any procedures contained therein shall be liable for a civil penalty of $500 for each violation. The penalty shall be sued for and collected by the commissioner in a summary proceeding before the Superior Court pursuant to the \"Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999,\" P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58 -10 et seq.). e. The commissioner shall notify the appropriate professional or occupational licensing board or licensing authority, in the case of a fac ility, of repeated violations of the procedures by a health care professional or licensed facility. This Plan establish es all of the procedures listed above. Deliberative Processes NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 66 | P a g e Throughout the COVID -19 crisis, state leadership has engaged subject matter experts and thought leaders to guide New Jersey through this extraordinary and challenging time. The New Jersey Department of Health Professional Advisory Committee (PAC) was convened as one such forum to inform the Commissioner of Health. The Professional Advisory Committee (PAC) provide s guidance to the Department to ensure that New Jersey 's response to COVID -19 is based on the latest scientific, medical, ethical and public health evidence. As the sc ale and impact of the COVID -19 crisis has evolved, the functions and focus areas of the PAC have evolved as well. The Committee previously informed allocation of critical care resources, distribution of scarce treatment pharmaceuticals (i.e. remdesivir), and targeted population -specific testing strategies (i.e. urban communities) during this public health emergency. Since summer 2020, the PAC has reviewed federal guidance about COVID -19 vaccine development and distribution and is in process of developing recommendations for equitable vaccination population prioritization and allocation, informed by ACIP and NASEM deliberations to -date. Recommendations for New Jersey will be informed by the pending final ACIP recommendations. The PAC's recommendations will be informed by subcommittees focused on health equity, community advocacy, and medical ethics and systems. There is ongoing iterative information sharing between the PAC and the work groups mobilized within state agencies for vaccination planning and im plementation. Interim recommendations have been shared with state entities and state information (e.g. data, logistics plans, etc.) is recurrently shared with the PAC to inform recommendations. Upon receipt of the final recommendations of the NJDOH COV ID-19 Professional Advisory Committee, the New Jersey Department of Health will socialize recommendations with other formal bodies and informal stakeholders to ensure diverse perspectives and a broad cross -section of New Jerseyans are integrated into plann ing. The ecosystem may include those listed in Section 2. The Cabinet as mobilized through the Coronavirus Task Force has been and will continue to be deeply engaged to ensure that no constituency is unjustly left behind. Additionally, close collaborati on with the Office of the Governor will persist. Interim Planning New Jersey intends to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) framework as outlined in the Playbook: Phase 1 A, Phase 1 B, Phase 1 C, Phase 2, and Phase 3. Within the ini tial Phases, scarce resource allocation is anticipated given expectation of scarce vaccine availability at the onset and potential for supply shortages before vaccine manufacturing and distribution reaches scale. Scarce resource allocation may also be nee ded at other times if intermittent supply shortages arise, as was the case with COVID -19 testing supplies. Informing that allocation will include, but are not limited to: New Jersey -specific data, including but not limited to epidemiological, occupational , geospatial, demographic factors. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 67 | P a g e Principles articulated by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 's (NASEM) Framework for Equi table Allocation of a COVID -19 Vaccine , by the Johns Hopkins' Interim Framework for COVID -19 Vaccine Allocation and Distribution in the United States , and other public health expert guidance, data, and literature. New Jersey expects real -time decision -making given variability in supply and demand. Logistical considerations (e.g. expectation that a site must be able to administer at least 1000 doses per allotment, at least initially) and experiential data (e.g. throughput of specific sites). Unknowns such as reliability of vaccine supply, success in provider onboarding and POD s creation, and public demand. B. Cold Chain Capability Assessment NJDOH will utilize existing processes in place in NJ for VFC and 317 -Funded Adult Providers to assess cold chain capacity . Current NJIIS functionalities include: Information about vaccine storage units is integrated into NJIIS. Providers are required to enter information about their current storage units upon enrollment and the information is maintained within the system. Additionally, NJIIS currently tracks temperature monitoring data for each enrolled pr ovider's storage units. Providers cannot place an order for vaccines if their temperature monitoring data is not current or if they indicate that their units have experienced temperature excursions. Currently, this data is only being tracked for refrigerat ed and frozen vaccines. Supplementing these NJIIS -based pathways, the State continues to survey each provider's cold chain capacity based on the guidelines established in the CDC Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit and the ACIP Best Practices for Immuniz ation. NJIIS upgrades in -process: The COVID -19 \"provider profile ,\" including the assessment of each provider's COVID -19 vaccine storage and handling capacity , was integrated into NJIIS . When providers enroll in NJIIS they will be requir ed to provide information outlining their capacity for cold chain maintenance. Ultra -cold storage unit temperature monitoring has not been incorporated into NJIIS at this point and NJDOH will require further guidance from CDC before developing this feat ure. C. COVID -19 Vaccine Ordering Procedures NJDOH will utilize systems currently in place for VFC and 317 -Funded Adult Program providers. Enrolled providers will place COVID -19 orders through NJIIS (as they currently do for core and influenza vaccines) and this information, along with any updated prof ile information (master data) and inventory data, will be transmitted via ExIS to VTrckS. Allocation restrictions will be built into the ordering module by provider NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 68 | P a g e type and population served. All orders will automatically go into review status for manual review by NJDOH staff prior to transmission. Tiberius and VTrckS are important tool s for the State of New Jersey to asses s and implement equitable allocation of scarce resources. D. Unplanned Repositioning Coordination All transfers will require prior approval by the immunization program per CDC requirements and all transferred inventory must be accounted for in NJIIS . Emergency plans will be coordinated by ESF (Emergency Support Function) via New Jersey Office of Emergency Management (NJ OEM ). Under the State of Emergency and Public Health Emergency declared originally under Executive Order No. 103, New Jersey's State Director of Emergency Management, in conjunction with the Commissioner of the Department of Health, coordinates the relief effort for the COVID -19 emergency with all government agencies, volunteer organizations, and the private sector. Provider sites will be responsible for the coordination of transferring doses to other enrolled sties if unplanned repositioning becomes necessary. Approval of redistributions is described in Section 5F. The Vaccine Operations Center is described in Section 15D. New Jersey will apply best practices and lessons learned from other scarce resource redistributions during the COVID -19 pandemic. E. COVID -19 Vaccine Wastage and Inventory level Monitoring NJIIS already has features to monitor and report vaccine wastage and inventory levels. This existing mechanism will be used to centrally and locally monitor inventory levels and to report vaccine wastage for COVID -19 vaccines as well. During the shipment process, the Controlant dashboard \u2014a function of the Tiberius system established by the federal government to provide real -time data and analytics to states and federal agencies \u2014will be closely monitored. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 69 | P a g e Section 8: COVID -19 Vaccine Storage and Handling A. COVID -19 Vaccine Storage and Handling Adherence Provider sites enrolling to receive COVID -19 vaccine must carefully review, implement, and keep curre nt on the storage and handling requirements outlined in : the CDC Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/index.html ), other materials from CDC for healthcare professionals participating in COVID -19 vaccination (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid -19/hcp/index.html ), information ( rs' information (e.g. https://www.cvdvaccine.com/ for the PfizerBioNTech COVID 19 Vaccine ), and NJ-specific recommendations and requirements (https://www.state.nj.us/health/cd/topics/covid2019_vaccination.shtml ). COVID -19 vaccination providers must have proper storage and temperature monitoring equipme nt to meet the specific needs of the COVID -19 vaccine product(s) that they w ill receive. This includes the correct vaccine storage unit(s) , whether a refrigerator, regular freezer, or ultra -low temperature (ULT) freezer. While it is not recommended that organiza tions purchase ULT freezer, it is recommended that facilities have bo th refrigerators and regular freezers, in order to accommodate the current and anticipated COVID - 19 vaccine products that might become available . The CDC and the New Jersey Department of Health (DOH) recommend purpose built \u2014also referred to as \"pharmaceutical grade \"\u2014refrigerators and freezers that are designed specifically for storage of biologicals, including vaccines. Household -grade units can be an acceptable alternative in some situations as specified in the CDC Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit. Never store any vaccine in a dormitory -style or bar -style combined refrigerator/freezer unit under any circumstances. It is essential for each vaccine storage unit to have a temperature monitoring device (TMD) to ensure vaccines are stored wit hin the correct temperature range. CDC and DOH recommend a specific type of temperature monitoring device called a \"digital data logger\" (DDL). PODs u se a DDL for each storage unit and each transport unit (emergency or non -emergency) to ensure that the t emperatures of the vaccines are maintained at all times while in a storage unit and during transport . DDLs must have a current and valid Certificate of Calibration Testing. A back -up DDL should be available should the primary unit malfunction or need cal ibration. The jurisdiction will use existing mechanisms in NJIIS to collect temperature logs from each site and assure vaccines are being maintained at proper temperatures. This same process will be employed for any COVID -19 vaccines that require refrig erator/freezer temperatures. Providers are unable to place orders NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 70 | P a g e for vaccine if their temperature logs are not up -to-date or if their units have experienced temperature excursions . The State uses the guidance contained in the CDC Vaccine Storage and Han dling Toolkit and this document will continue to be shared with each provider along with the CDC -developed checklist for satellite, temporary, or off -site vaccine clinics as part of the provider site toolkit. This guidance will also set forth a description of the roles and responsibilities required for each site. One of the critical roles that each site will be required to have is a Primary and Back -up Vaccine Coordinator who will be responsible for receiving vaccine shipments, monitoring storage unit tempe ratures, managing vaccine inventory , etc. This individual will act in coordination with the State's program experts and their field agents to be charged with ensuring adherence and compliance to the vaccine storage and handling requirements. The CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement also outlines that the Chief Medical Officer (or equivalent) and the Chief Executive Officer (or Chief Fiduciary) who signed that agreement are accountable for compliance with the conditions of that agreement. B. Assessment of Provider/Redistribution Depot COVID -19 Vaccine Storage and Temperature Monitoring Capabilities Depots will be required to report temperature monitoring data via NJIIS as any other provider would. The jurisdiction will be extremely judicious in the use of depots for redistribution. However, this mechanism is being considered for certain circumstances and , in those cases , all current guidelines will be followed regarding storage and handling capabilities. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 71 | P a g e Section 9: COVI D-19 Vaccine Administration Documentation and Reporting A. System for S tatewide Collection of COVID -19 Vaccine Administration Data Currently , the New Jersey Immunization Information System ( NJIIS ) is the mechanism used to capture vaccine doses administered i n the state, however supplemental vaccine systems (i.e. the soon -to-be launched New Jersey Vaccine Scheduling System ) are currently being evaluated and may be used as well to capture this data. Governor Murphy recently signed Executive Order No. 207 in preparation for the arrival of COVID -19 vaccines to New Jersey. Under EO No. 207, residents who decide to receive a COVID -19 vac cine will now automatically be enrolled in the New Jersey Immunization Information System (NJIIS), the statewide automated and electronic immunization registry. The change is aimed at maximizing efficacy and efficiency. Without proper accounting, patien t safety issues may arise if a consumer receives doses from two different novel vaccines. Inconsistent reporting was a key barrier to the H1N1 response. Under EO No. 207, individuals may opt -out of the registry 30 days after the public health emergency ex pires. The NJIIS can capture doses administered data by web entry via the user interface, HL7 2.5.1 interface for batch , or real -time submission (via web service) of doses administered data. The Interoperability work group develop ed a third option, which is an Excel file in a pre -defined format that will be transformed/processed electronically in an Excel to HL7 Rhapsody route. B. Submission of NJ COVID -19 Vaccine Administration Data Via IZ Gateway New Jersey has completed initial connectivity to the IZ Ga teway and have signed the MOU and DUA to allow for this interjurisdictional data exchange. The jurisdiction is awaiting production exchange test messages and will be ready as soon as CDC provides all requirements. C. Provider Capacity to Report within 24 ho urs. Provider enrollment in NJIIS requires each provider site to outline its capability for reporting all doses administered, including its technical capacity. Providers and staff at that location are required to take COVID -19 vaccine provider trainings, which include reporting requirements for vaccine doses administered. All reporting will adhere to the CDC reporting requirements for data and timeliness of reporting. Adequate resourcing of POD s is necessary for any provider to be able to report in a timely manner. When estimating personnel necessary for each size of POD, dedicated data entry personnel are factored into planning. Supplies to facilitate timely and accurate data entry, including but not limited to computers or tablets should be factored into procurement planning for locally delivered vaccine POD s. Likewise, considerations for selecting the initial POD s and high throughput POD s may include presence of reliable, onsite internet access. New Jersey appreciates any federal support to defray these costs. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 72 | P a g e Quality assurance and compliance reports are currently being developed to ensure identification of non - compliant sites for outrea ch by NJIIS staff. Note: Whereas the CDC Provider Agreement requires reporting within 24 hours, the current state regulation requires reporting within 30 days. Some providers have questioned feasibility of a 24 -hour turnaround. D. Real -Time Documentation a nd Reporting from Satellite , Temporary, or Off -Site Clinic Settings NJIIS is a web -based reporting system and is accessible anywhere there is an internet connection to anyone with a current login. Data reporting will be allowed via three mechanisms in to NJIIS: 1. Direct entry into NJIIS: This can take place in real -time at any location with an internet connection. 2. File submission, via an Excel spreadsheet that will be translated to HL7 for upload into NJIIS: This would be a way for a location to batch submit without an interface, however will also serve as a backup if there is a loss of internet connectivity, data can be logged into the spreadsheet and then submitted through secure file transfer. 3. Use of an HL7 interface with a provider's electronic h ealth record (EHR) system. While this will require internet connectivity, if there is an outage, once data is entered into the provider's system and the outage is resolved the data should transfer at that time. All providers are required to select a rep orting mechanism at the time of enrollment. Onboarding for users and sites reporting via Excel or HL7 will begin after they submit their COVID -19 preliminary site enrollment forms and user agreements. These are currently available on the NJIIS website : https://njiis.nj.gov/core/web/index.html#/newFacilityEnrollment . Additional technologies are being evaluated for large -scale vaccination sites, including the use of 2D barcode scanners for ease of data capture. E. Documentation and Reporting Monitoring Quality assurance (QA) and compliance reports are currently being developed to ensure identification of non-compliant sites for outreach by NJIIS staff. NJIIS technical staff are developing these reports, which will be run daily by the NJIIS QA Team Leads to assure that provid ers are reporting doses administered data completely and within 24 hours of vaccine administration. QA staff will be on hand to look for inconsistencies and will be working directly with providers if there are errors found. How instances of noncomplian ce are managed will depend on a multitude of factors , including , but not limited to: degree of documentation deficiency, length of delay in data input, frequency of incomplete reporting, technological infrastructure on -hand at vaccine site, etc. Under cur rent state regulations as of December 2020, there is a 30 -day window to report into NJIIS, which creates an incongruity with the 24 - hour standard established under the CDC Provider Agreement for COVID -19 vaccination. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 73 | P a g e Should NJ find an instance of noncompl iance, potential state -level actions taken may include: reminders, supplemental training, corrective action planning, data entry workforce supplementation, and/or strike teams for onsite support. The State of New Jersey is not fully aware of how federal a gencies will enforce noncompliance with the Provider Agreement, and the State of New Jersey is not a party to this contract at this time. F. Generation and Use of COVID -19 Vaccination Coverage Reports In order to monitor and guide the effective vaccination throughout the state of New Jersey, the VTF has developed a set of reporting goals. These goals, per the guidance from NASEM, \"will help evaluate existing or novel theory -driven strategies and interventions to decrease COVID -19 vaccine hesitancy, increas e COVID -19 vaccine uptake, and eliminate social, cultural, logistic, and legal barriers to COVID -19 vaccination in focal populations.\" The State of New Jersey recognizes that there are a range of factors that can affect vaccination coverage, and therefore New Jersey's vaccination coverage reporting goals include: Track vaccination status of high priority groups - Ensure prioritization guidance is being appropriately operationalized and sufficient access for vulnerable groups is provided . Support consumer navigation and second dose reminders - Monitor effectiveness of consumer outreach and navigation and ensure consistent and comprehensive second dose reminders (where appropriate) . Support provider communications and training - Ensure providers receive appropriate communication and training . Ensure effective distribution and use of vaccines - Develop approach to monitor vaccine distribution to match supply with demand and provide tr iggers for intervention (e.g., unplanned repositioning of vaccines as required with intent to minimize ). Monitor site operational efficiency and throughput - Ensure efficient operation of sites, incorporate process improvements, and support decision makin g to free up or redeploy additional capacity as needed . Ensure effective consumer engagement - Build and track public perception of the COVID -19 vaccine program to drive overall uptake of COVID -19 vaccines . The State of New Jersey is developing clear triggers and lines of responsibility should any gaps in vaccination coverage for high priority populations be identified. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 74 | P a g e Custom COVID -19 coverage reports will be generated by vaccine type and priority group. Mapping of vaccine administration will take place to provide visualization of vaccine coverage for the state by provider type, vaccine type, and population type. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 75 | P a g e Section 10: COVID -19 Vaccination Second -Dose Reminders A. Second -Dose Reminder Methods Providers can use existing reminder/recall mechanisms in NJIIS, however additional options are being vetted by the jurisdiction to provide expanded capability for these efforts. Additional options in process to engage consumers individually and/or colle ctively: Technological solutions - Supplemental vaccine systems, such as the New Jersey Vaccine Scheduling System , are being established to help ensure that these reminder/recall activities are optimized to bring vaccine recipients back at the correct int erval and given the correct vaccine. Strategic scheduling - Fixed and mobile POD s account for two doses of the same pharmaceutical during scheduling: o At fixed POD s: Aim to schedule vaccination appointments approximately 21 or 28 days apart (in accordance with federal guidance about appropriate spacing of doses). o At mobile POD s: Schedule mobile clinics to arrive on a set cadence. Drawing upon the strategy CDC has proposed for mobile clinics for long -term care vaccination , mobile sites should plan for three visits: Visit 1: First vaccine dose for all initial vaccinates. Visit 2: Second vaccine dose for visit 1 attendees + First dose for those catching up. Visit 3: Second vaccine dose for catch up cohort + First dose for ot hers who missed previous opportunities (this cohort will then be referred to a nearby static site for their second dose). Hard copy distribution - Distribution of physical vaccine card recording that the first dose was administered and with a stamp indicating on what day the patient should return for their second dose. On-site and off-site Consumer Navigators - Community -based health educators and community health workers/liaisons may also be utilized as COVID -19 vaccine navigators to remind their c lients with visits and phone calls about returning for the second dose. Directive on-site communication - Signage and communication by staff at each POD to notify public about necessity of returning for second dose and indicating either when to return or how to schedule return visit. Targeted reminders to vaccine administrators and primary care providers - Utilizing a wide use of the New Jersey Health Alert Network (NJHAN) for healthcare providers and staff. Collaboration with identified primary care providers - Healthcare systems and outpatient provider officers routinely use their text system to inform and provide next steps through NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 76 | P a g e smartphones. This can be done for vaccine second dose reminders, and other useful information on this electronic mobile platform. Partnering with employers or local entities to leverage existing notification channels - For example, large employers' communication systems could potentially be utilized. Likewise, individual POD s may consider utilizing local school districts (both public and private) communication systems to share vaccine information. This is the same system that gives parents information school delays, closures, events. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 77 | P a g e Section 11: COVID -19 Requirements for IIS s or Other External System s A. Contingencies for Documentation in Temporary or High -Volume Settings In the event of a loss of power, a process for paper -based documentation will be implemented, including an immediate plan to enter data into the IT system once power resumes. Supplementary support may be provided. B. Data Variables to be Collected NJIIS will securely store the vaccine recipient's name, address, date of birth, race, ethnicity, and gender. These are standard data elements that have been used across vaccines adm inistered in New Jersey. These will be requested during pre -registration and/or on -site. Information about the vaccine provider, substance, and administration will be collected from the POD personnel. There are other data that may be asked of vaccine recipient s and that will not be stored in NJIIS. Depending on the POD and its scheduling process, New Jerseyeans can also expect to provide additional demographic and occupational data to ensure equitable and efficient scheduling of vaccinations. These data points will be informed by ACIP recommendations about prioritization (e.g. Phase 1A will include healthcare personnel ). Finally, medical screening questions will be asked to assess eligibility under the EUA and ACIP recommendations specific to the vaccine product offered at the point of dispensing. Please refer to Appendix for a n evolving list of variables that may need to be collected and tracked during COVID -19 vaccines rollout. C. Current and Planned Data Exchange, Storage, and Reporting Capacity Before COVID -19 vaccination , NJIIS contain ed about 5 million patients, 12,150 facilities , and over 73 million immunization records. In prepar ation for one or more COVID -19 vaccine s, the NJIIS ' current IT infrastructure is being upgraded to support the a nticipated increase in load and capacity. The NJIIS Technical Team is building dedicated high throughput and low latency web and API clusters. We are also increasing processing capacity in our data tier, multifold. The upgraded infrastructure w as commissioned. NJIIS is working on to upgrade its Interface Management System (IMS) per the HL7 2.5.1 - CDC 1.5 specification to integrate with IZ Gateway. This will increase the availability and volume of complete and accurate immunization data stored wi thin NJIIS. To accommodate the immediate surge in facility enrollments that may not be compliant with HL7 2.5.1 CDC 1.5 specification, NJIIS is building an interface gateway to support such facilities by introducing an Excel reporting template option, in addition to HL7 interface. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 78 | P a g e NJIIS is working on enrollment for new COVID -19 facilities and users. The pre -registration function is currently live , allowing providers to begin the enrollment process by expediting the onboarding of providers to the registr y and pre -registering users for COVID -19 training. The NJIIS team is also developing a COVID -19 vaccine ordering enrollment module. The COVID -19 vaccine ordering enrollment module is integrated into NJIIS and is entirely online. All necessary information for the COVID -19 CDC Provider Agreement will be captured. All CDC reporting requirements will be supported as part of COVID -19 changes, including required reporting via the IZ Gateway and other requirements as needed. Figure 11.c.1 - NJIIS Landscape and Infrastructure Upgrades D. Plans for Rapid Enrollment and Onboarding of Vaccination Provider Facilities and Settings Expected to Serve Healthcare Providers and Other Essential Workers The NJIIS COVID -19 provider site pre -registration a nd enrollment process has been streamlined and can support rapid onboarding of the site, the users affiliated with the site, as well as the onboarding required NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 79 | P a g e for the selected reporting method. The process is agile and can support enrollment that will se rve first tier identified populations. Start here: https://www.state.nj.us/health/cd/topics/covid2019_vaccination.shtml E. Onboarding to IZ Gateway's Connect and Share Com ponents New Jersey has successfully completed an initial test of connectivity to the IZ Gateway. The MOU and DUA documents have been signed by the required entities at NJDOH. The NJIIS technical team is prepared to commence testing data submission via the IZ Gateway whenever required. F. Status Updates i. IZ Gateway DUA New Jersey's d ata use agreement with the Association of Public Health Laboratories to participate in the IZ Gateway was signed and submitted as of 9/28/2020. ii. CDC DUA New Jersey's d ata use agreement was signed and submitted as of 12/6/2020. iii. IZ Gateway Share MOU New Jersey's Memorandum of Understanding to share data with other jurisdictions via the IZ Gateway Share c omponent was signed and submitted as of 9/28/2020. G. Planned Backup Solutions for Offline Use if Lack Internet Connectivity The backup mechanism for submission when there is no internet connectivity is to collect data in a preformatted Excel spreadsheet th at can be sent to the State via secure file upload and translated into HL7 messaging to be uploaded into NJIIS. For providers with an electronic interface it is expected that as soon as internet connectivity is reestablished the data will be transferred v ia that mechanism. If there is a long -term outage, the provider would work with NJIIS technical staff to assure data would be sent in the appropriate timeframe. If NJDOH experiences a loss of internet connectivity and NJIIS is down, data received via Excel or HL7 will be h eld in queue until the system is back up, at which time data will begin processing. H. Data Quality Monitoring NJIIS has existing quality assurance checks in place for reporting via user interface as well as via HL7. The jurisdiction plans to bring on additional Quality Assurance staff to ensure an adequate capacity of individuals to review submissions for completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of reporting. Currently, QA NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 80 | P a g e reports are in development to validate the elements of doses administered data fr om provider sites and enable the QA team to evaluate submissions. A protocol will be established whereby reports are generated, reviewed, and noncompliant sites will be outreached to ensure daily reporting. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 81 | P a g e Section 12: COVID -19 Vaccination Program Communi cation A. Interim COVID -19 Vaccination Communications Plan i. Overarching Approach Building public confidence in safe and effective COVID -19 vaccine(s) is a complex challenge \u2014especially in New Jersey, where there is a vocal anti -vaccine movement. And, like other states, there is historical mistrust in government -sponsored vaccination among some communities of color that must be overcome with strategies tailored to specific populations. Credible and consistent health communication messaging will be shared through multiple strategies and across multiple media platforms to address the concerns of specific audiences using timely and science - based public health and medical information from tr usted sources. All messaging, infographics, FAQs, call center scripts, websites and other resource material that is disseminated to the public and stakeholder groups will be culturally appropriate and translated into multiple languages. To accomplish th is, the Department developed and is executing a stakeholder engagement plan with three objectives: Build trust among state, local public health, vaccine providers, and recipients of vaccines Understand how to ensure ease of access to the vaccine, and to i nformation about the vaccine Cultivate a network of diverse partners \u2014including trusted community thought and opinion leaders \u2014committed to safe, accessible COVID -19 vaccine. Engagement will increase trust and support among populations prioritized for vacc ination including health care and essential workers; individuals with co -morbidities; those 65 and older; underserved minority populations and others at highest risk of serious complications from COVID -19; individuals who have experienced historical vaccin ation traumas; and individuals who can build bridges to these populations, either by providing the vaccine themselves or by recommending it and forming connections with trusted providers. Transparency into any allocation process and future vaccine availabi lity will be provided to the public. Stakeholders are being engaged for three purposes: Awareness of the current pandemic situation in the state and state planning efforts for a large - scale vaccination plan Education of stakeholders and the public of the process for approval of the vaccine(s) and communicate that although the timeline is accelerated, that the safety checkpoints are in place. Safety is a guiding principle for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Action by arming stakeholders a nd the public with accurate, up -to-date scientific facts they need to make the best decisions for the health and safety of themselves and their loved ones. An engagement tracking tool described in the following exhibit has been developed to ensure that a ll appropriate groups are en gaged during development of the State's COVID -19 vaccine rollout plan. This tool and g roups that will be engaged are described in the Appendix . NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 82 | P a g e ii. Phase 1: Potentially Limited Doses Available Timely public health and science -base d vaccine information will be disseminated regularly by and through well-established public health channels including the NJLINCS agency Health Educators/Risk Communicators and professional organizations including the Medical Society of New Jersey, the New Jersey chapter of the National Medical Association, the New Jersey State Nurses Association, the New Jersey Hospital Association, the New Jersey Primary Care Association and the New Jersey COVID -19 Professional Advisory Committee and its Health Equity Sub committee. Other crucial channels for disseminating information include the New Jersey COVID -19 Information Center ; 2-1-1 call and text COVID to 898 -211); and the New Jersey Poison Center Call Center (1-800-222- 1222/Text: 973 -339-0702). State and stakeholder social media platforms will also be used as trusted sources of information dissemination. The Twitter account of Governor Phil Murphy has approximately 370,000 followers and has won national awards. Other social medial platforms that will continue to be used throughout the pandemic include those of the New Jersey Department of Health; sister state agencies; the state's congressional and legislative delegations; county executives, the Urban Mayors Association; New Jersey League of Munic ipalities; the New Jersey Hospital Association and other partners outlined in the stakeholder engagement below). During the phases of the vaccine rollout, in accordance with the equitable COVID -19 vaccin ation population prioritization, and in line with EU A parameters, high -profile individuals in New Jersey who choose to be vaccinated will be administered the vaccine publicly in the interest of building public trust. These may include such individuals as Governor Murphy, NJDOH Commissioner Judith Persichil li, NJDOH Deputy Commissioner for Public Health Services Dr. David Adinaro, members of the Cabinet of New Jersey, NJDOH COVID -19 PAC members, healthcare leaders serving historically vaccine skeptical communities, etc. Disadvantaged communities must see tha t people in power and influence are getting the vaccine to communicate that this is a safe thing to do and will help to protect the individual and the community. A state wide public awareness campaign will be tailored in Phase 1 to health care personnel \u2014 organizations and clinicians who will receive information about receiving and administering the vaccine \u2014 and workers in essential industries. The New Jersey COV ID-19 Profes sional Advisory Committee and its subcommittee s are charged with recommending what subgroups of priority populations should be considered under various scenarios of limited does amounts. Messaging will explain to those who are prioritized for initial phas es why they should participate, and to reassure those who are not provided this early opportunity why they can trust that the prioritization and allocation are equitable. Messages will emphasize the safety and efficacy of available COVID -19 vaccine(s) bas ed on reviews of data from vaccine trials and ACIP recommendations as well as the need to protect themselves, their families, their patients and customers and their community. These messages are being developed based in part based on feedback from a series of key informant interviews/listening sessions/surveys with key stakeholder groups that began in September. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 83 | P a g e Physicians and nurses have strong trusted relationships with their patients and will be pivotal influencers in building public confidence in any vaccine deemed safe and eff icacious by the federal government and the ACIP . According to a national poll conducted in late September, 57% of New Jersey respondents said their physician will be the most important influence on whether they get vaccinated when it becomes available. The Medical Society of New Jersey, the New Jersey Hospital Association , and the New Jersey Nurses Association are polling membership about attitudes about COVID -19. The PAC will review data from clinical trials and the National Medical Association formed an independent advisory committee \u2014with New Jersey representation \u2014to evaluate data from clinical trials. The potential for groups like the National Medical Association to enhance community confidence through independent scientific review of clinical trial data will be extremely important to address concer ns that lack of data transparency will undermine trust. To build confidence among parents and the boarder community, providers and other health care professionals will be provided effective information resources through the NJ COVID -19 Innovation Hub, the Department website, NJLINCS agency Health Educators/Risk Communicators, the PAC , and various professional organizations. The messages would include: Updated talking points/call center script s Coordinated social media messages Newly developed educational materials/infographics/fact sheets as needed to convey key vaccine messages regarding target audiences, safety, credible information sources, etc. Flu vaccine (required among health care providers in New Jersey this year for the first time) material iii. Phas e 2: Large Number of Doses Available, Supply Likely to Meet Demand As vaccine doses become more plentiful, communities, especially those disproportionately impacted by COVID -19, must be effectively, authentically, and meaningfully engaged in local vaccina tion plans. As a result, messaging will be shared with strong community partners like the four regional health care hubs \u2014 which participated in the Public Confidence workgroup's listening sessions and focus groups (see Exhibit III for details) \u2014will help the Department build public confidence in the vaccine. Testimonial PSAs will also be sought from survivors in the community \u2014or those who lost loved ones \u2014 coupled with a positive message about ending the pandemic together to build support. The Department has already successfully deployed this messaging during t hree previous pandemic public awareness campaigns: The Department's For Each Other For Us All testing and contact tracing campaign, which began over the summer; the COVIDNJ Alert App which launched October 1; and the statewide flu campaign. The theme of this year's Power to Protect NJ \u2014Against the Flu. Communication to the general public will also include: Updated talking points/call center script NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 84 | P a g e Coordinated social media messages Newly developed educational materials/infographics/fact shee ts as needed to convey key vaccine messages regarding target audiences, safety, credible information sources, etc. Feedback from key informant interviews/listening sessions/surveys likely to be effective in fostering public confidence especially among vuln erable populations Messages disseminated among established channels including the LINCS agenc ies Health Educators/Risk Communicators and various professional organizations iv. Phase 3: Likely Sufficient Supply, Slowing Demand As enough vaccine becomes availa ble and demand slows, it will be increasingly important for outreach at the community level through a statewide public awareness campaign. The campaign will include trusted public health officials and respected local religious and community influencers, bu t it will also amplify the voices of local survivors in the community and those who have lost loved ones. The campaign will use videos and PSA testimonials to make a connection between the 200,000+ people lost during the pandemic, and those who are still s uffering long -term effects of COVID -19. Communication to the public will also include: Updated talking points/call center script s Coordinated social media messages Newly developed educational materials/infographics/fact sheets as needed to convey key vac cine messages regarding target audiences, safety, credible information sources, etc. Posting of video PSA's from health officials to emphasize the importance of everyone getting a vaccine. Messages disseminated among established channels , including the LIN CS agencies, h ealth educators/ risk communicators , and various professional organizations. Feedback from key informant interviews/listening sessions/surveys likely to be effective in fostering public confidence especially among vulnerable populations. B. Risk, Crisis, and Emergency Communications Using our public awareness campaign and the tools outlined in the three phases of vaccination (updated talking points/updated call script/infographics/fact sheets), we will ensure that the New Jersey NJCOVID - 19 Information Hub; the state government and Dep artment websites; and social media channels of the state and stakeholders contain effective and evidenced -based messaging. As new information becomes available the Department will continually update messaging (talking points/call center scripts) and pro vide that information immediately to 211, the NJ PIES Call Center, the New Jersey COVID -19 Information Center and post it to the Department website and social media platforms. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 85 | P a g e As New Jersey has done throughout the pandemic, Governor Murphy, Health Commiss ioner Judith Persichilli, State Police Superintendent Patrick Callahan, and Homeland Security Director Jared Maples will provide regular updates as warranted. Newly developed educational materials/infographics/fact sheets will be disseminated among establ ished channels including the LINCS agencies Health Educators/Risk Communicators and various professional organizations as needed to convey key vaccine messages regarding target audiences, safety, credible information sources, etc. The Department will use these educational materials/infographics to communicate important information to specific audiences such as the younger population, doctors, schools, etc. In addition, coordinated social media messages will be sent by the Office of the Governor; the New J ersey State Police Office of Emergency Management; the Governor's Restart and Recovery Commission; the PAC and its subcommittees; as well as all of the social media platforms of local, state sister agencies and stakeholders. The New Jersey Department of Health uses three social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram \u2014with a total of 100,000 followers \u2014to rapidly push out relevant information and to dispel myths, misinformation and misreporting of scientific evidence misinformation as it p ertains to COVID -19. We know that negative vaccine perspectives are very common on social media and can cause vaccine hesitance among other social media users. The Department can engage social media users using Question and Answer sessions which have pro ven to be effective in the past. This will allow users to communicate their concerns directly to our health officials directly. This effort began in the summer with the Department's For Each Other For Us All testing and contact tracing campaign and later its COVIDNJ Alert App which launched October 1. Commissioner Persichilli filmed a video PSA to urge participation in the COVIDNJ Alert App. Since the end of the Department has also used its social media platforms to encourage people to get vaccinated aga inst flu protect themselves and prevent a drain on medical resources with the likely \"twindemic\" of flu and COVID -19 like illness. The statewide flu campaign, Power to Protect NJ \u2014Against the Flu , began October 1. In addition, the Department will use video PSA's from health officials to emphasize the importance of everyone getting a vaccine. Commissioner Persichilli got a flu shot at her neighborhood Walgreens and a video was posted on social media to encourage sta tewide vaccination. The Department will collaborate with other health agencies including the CDC, HHS, county and local health departments and all the groups outlined in our stakeholder engagement plan to reshare relevant information. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 86 | P a g e i. Listening Session Pl an In anticipation of COVID -19 vaccine availability, New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) conducted stakeholder engagement including focus groups, listening sessions and key informant interviews. Objectives Build trust between the State, local public health, vaccine providers, and recipients of vaccines Understand how to ensure access to the vaccine and clear, aligned information about the vaccine Cultivate a network of diverse partners committed to safe, accessible COVID -19 vaccination Engagement wi ll seek to increase trust and support among populations prioritized for vaccination, such as healthcare and other frontline workers, as well as individuals with co -morbidities; individuals who have experienced historical vaccination trauma and/or come from marginalized communities; and individuals who can build vaccination bridges to these populations, either by providing the vaccine themselves or by recommending it and forming connections with trusted providers and accessible conditions. Strategies The f ollowing strategies aim to elicit information quickly to support the vaccination planning process, while relying on partners with existing relationships with communities critical to ensuring safety, equity and trust: NJDOH and/or partners is conducting foc us groups, listening sessions and key informant interviews. The first sessions are being conducted with those who have begun to discuss the complexities of COVID -19 vaccination with their communities, including: o Healthcare providers that serve priority po pulations or marginalized communities o Local Health Departments and/or their local partners o Community -based organizations and Community Advisory Boards o Community Leaders, including faith leaders and local officials o Public health practitioners and health educators In addition, NJDOH will disseminate focus group tools to stakeholders across the State, including facilitation guide, data entry/notes template and vaccination talking points, and a mechanism for reporting data back to the Department and s haring insights with the State's vaccination task force. Draft questions/probing questions were developed for: (1) Healthcare providers and potential vaccine providers; (2) Vaccine Ambassadors and/or \"Connectors\" (e.g., elected officials, community -based organizations, faith leaders); and (3) Vaccine recipients. NJDOH asks partners engaging their communities to edit and adapt the questions as they see fit. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 87 | P a g e Section 13: Regulatory Considerations for COVID -19 Vaccination A. Provider Awareness, Access, and Und erstanding of Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) Fact Sheets and Vaccine Information Statements (VIS s) Awareness All providers will be made aware of the conditions and information outlined in the EUA fact sheets at the time of their required COVID -19 training, prior to the completion of enrollment as a COVID -19 vaccine provider. If the information is not available at the time of the training/enrollment, providers will be informed that the information is forthcoming and will be made available t o providers electronically (e.g., posting on NJIIS sites, email to enrolled providers) In addition, information about the need to provide an EUA -approved fact sheet or Vaccine Information Sheet (VIS) is included in CDC's Provider Agreement which must be si gned by the provider as a condition of participation. Access In addition to providing access to the EUA and /or VIS documents, as applicable, during onboarding and any supplemental training, tactics to provide access to these documents may include: Distribution from the manufacturer with vaccine shipment Posting to public -facing and vaccine provider -specific websites; Direct or mass emails to providers enrolled as COVID -19 vaccine administrators; Mass emails to potential vaccine providers in collabo ration with the Office of the Attorney General's Division of Consumer Affairs, responsible for licensed professionals; Incorporation in signage at POD s (contingent on scarce resources); Distribution in hard copy at POD s (contingent on scarce resources); Circulation through mass media. Meanwhile, the diversity of New Jersey's vaccination workforce must be accommodated through the provision of EUA, VIS, and other key documents in common New Jersey languages including Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Haitian Creole, Polish, Mandarin, Hindi, Portuguese, Korean, Gujarati, Vietnamese, Yiddish, Russian , and Filipino -Tagalog. New Jersey has requested federal provision of expert translation of these vital documents. Understanding Potential tactics to monitor understandi ng may include : Spot checks for quality assurance ; Hosting of forums for providers to ask questions about these documents ; Comprehension assessments associated with trainings. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 88 | P a g e B. Vaccine Recipient Awareness, Access, and Understanding of EUA Fact Sheets and VISs Awareness Trainings required for all COVID -19 enrolled providers will outline the need to provide EUA fact sheets and/or VIS statements to each vaccine recipient prior to vaccine administration. In addition, information about the need to provide an EUA -approved fact sheet or VIS is included in the CDC's Provider Agreement which must be signed by the provider as a condition of participation. Access Tactics under consideration for how to provide vaccine recipient direct access to EUA Fact Sheets and VISs include: Posting to public -facing and vaccine provider -specific websites; Incorporation in scheduling process and/or remi nder communications; Incorporation in signage at POD s (contingent on scarce resources); Distribution in hard copy at POD s (contingent on scarce resources); Circulation through mass media; Discussion by officials in public forums like the Governor's recurre nt COVID -19 press conferences. Meanwhile, the diversity of New Jersey's vaccination population must be accommodated through the provision of EUA, VIS, and other key documents in common New Jersey languages including Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Haitian Creol e, Polish, Mandarin, Hindi, Portuguese, Korean, Gujarati, Vietnamese, Yiddish, Russian , and Filipino -Tagalog. New Jersey has requested federal provision of expert translation of these vital documents. Recognizing disparities in health literacy, documents should be in accessible reading level. Understanding Potential tactics to monitor understanding may include : Availability of personnel at vaccine sites to answer questions or clarify documents; Hosting of forums for public or subpopulations to ask quest ions about these documents ; Encouragement of primary care providers (PCP) to counsel own patients on EUA Fact Sheet and VISs in advance of vaccine visit scheduling. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 89 | P a g e Section 14: COVID -19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring A. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) Requirements and Process The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), is a national program managed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to monitor the safety of all vaccines licensed in the United Stat es. VAERS collects and reviews reports of adverse events that occur after vaccination. An \"adverse event\" is any health problem or \"side effect\" that happens after a vaccination. VAERS cannot determine if a vaccine caused an adverse event , but it can de termine if further investigation is needed. VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning it relies on individuals to send in reports of their experiences. Anyone can submit a report to VAERS, including physicians, guardians and patients. Individuals wan ting to submit information on an adverse event are encouraged to report the adverse event online, directly though the VAERS website: https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html . Information about the req uirement to report to VAERS will be included in the mandatory training for providers enrolled in the COVID -19 vaccination program. The NJDOH VAERS Coordinator will develop and distribute information about reporting vaccine adverse events and administratio n errors related to the COVID -19 vaccine to NJ healthcare providers/facilities and public health partners. This will serve as a reminder of vaccine -related events that healthcare providers must report to VAERS, and steps/information needed for reporting t o VAERS. These messages will be distributed widely through NJ's Health Alert Network (LINCS) and other collaborating agencies such as the OAG Division of Consumer Affairs , which is responsible for licensing and regulating healthcare providers in NJ. Anyone who calls NJDOH through a forthcoming designated consumer call center regarding an adverse event related to a COVID -19 vaccine will be transferred to the VAERS Coordinator and/or others trained to accept the reports. The VAERS Coordinator will provide reporting information to the caller and refer them to the VAERS website. If the caller is unable or unwilling to report online through the VAERS website, the VAERS Coordinator will obtain necessary information from the caller and submit the report to VAE RS on behalf of the caller through the online reporting form. VAERS will begin sending unredacted adverse event data for the COVID -19 vaccine on a weekly basis to states via Epi -X. This information will be retrieved by the VAERS Coordinator, or designee, on a weekly basis and will be compiled in a password -protected file on a secure share d drive on the NJDOH server. Anyone who has access to unredacted adverse event data on Epi -X, or who is given access to the secure share d drive , will have to read the NDA that was compiled by VAERS, and then sign an Acknowledgement from NJDOH that will be kept on file by the data steward. Providers will also provide information to vaccine recipients regarding v -safe, CDC's new active safety monitoring system . Information about v -safe is available here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 - ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html . NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 90 | P a g e To promote provider awareness of VAERS and of the new CDC active su rveillance tool called v -safe, NJDOH delivered a presentation hosted by Rutgers Project ECHO. The first session focused on vaccine safety ad Phase 1A. Recording and materials can be found here: https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/community_health/other/project -echo/covid -19. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 91 | P a g e Section 15: COVID -19 Vaccination Program Monitoring A. Methods and Procedures for COVID -19 Vaccination Program Implementation Monitoring Please note : New Jersey has requested a Tiberius Analytic Support subject matter expert embed. This person works to ensure that NJ is optimally using the data available through Tiberius and other federal systems to monitor vaccination efforts, inform programmatic act ivities, and meet the federal reporting metric requirements. i. Provider Enrollment The jurisdiction will perform data exports daily (or at a frequency prescribed by CDC) of COVID -19 vaccine providers enrolled in NJIIS to track provider enrollment. ii. Access to COVID -19 Vaccination Services by Population in All Implementation Phases The jurisdiction will use data from all relevant data sources (e.g. NJIIS , VTrckS, and other on -site surveys) . Data exports will be performed at a frequency prescribed by CDC and in response to reporting needs that emerge for the state to monitor progress and impact . iii. IIS and/or Other Designated System Performance The NJIIS Technical Team will routinely monitor system performance using a variety of available technical tools. As technical infrastructure is enhanced and periodically, the system will be pressure tested to evaluate performance with respect to user interface/experience, ele ctronic interface (HL7) processing, and database performance. The NJDOH Health Information Technology office, which hosts and maintains NJIIS, will work closely with the State Office of Information Technology and be able to leverage additional tools and s upport from OIT as needed to assess performance and rapidly troubleshoot any issues. iv. Data Reporting to CDC Relevant data will be transmitted electronically via secure interface via the IZ Gateway, SAMS (provider site lists), and other required mechanism s. Transmissions will be constantly monitored to ensure success of all reporting initiatives. v. Provider -Level Data Reporting The jurisdiction will perform NJIIS exports daily and as needed that will include provider -level data reporting variables. These will be used to track success of the provider in administering the received doses, and compliance with reporting of doses administered data. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 92 | P a g e vi. Vaccine Ordering and Distribution The jurisdiction will perform exports daily and/or as needed from VTrckS and NJIIS data to monitor vaccine ordering, distribution, wastage, and storage and handling issues. vii. 1st and 2nd Dose COVID -19 Vaccination Coverage The jurisdiction will perform exports (at a frequency prescribed by CDC) of NJIIS data to monitor 1 - and 2 - dose coverage. NJIIS currently uses the Immunization Calculation Engine (ICE) for vaccine dose evaluation and forecasting. Once ICE enhancements for COVID -19 are i mplemented, New Jersey will integrate those changes to our forecasting and scheduler. Appropriate forecasting of second doses will be enabled via NJIIS, and via interface for HL7 bidirectional enabled data exchange sites. Those sites will be able to subm it a Z44 QBP message and receive a Z42 RSP with forecasting. Additionally, peripheral systems are currently being evaluated and may be utilized to remind patients regarding second dose scheduling. B. Methods and Procedures for Resource Monitoring i. Budget ii. Staffing iii. Supplies The State will conduct regular check -in meetings with all local jurisdictions on at least a weekly basis to monitor human and physical resources dedicated to the implementation of the State's vaccination plan. The State, in its planning p rocess, is working to create operational efficiencies and establish contingencies to mitigate any potential resource gaps. The State has various contracts in place which can allow the purchase of needed supplies and also allow for the provision of contract ed staffing services. Additionally, pursuant to State procurement law (N.J.S.A. 52:34 -6.2 and N.J.S.A. 40A:11 -12), political subdivisions of the State may participate in the State's Cooperative Purchasing Program, which allows counties and municipalities to leverage existing State contracts for goods and services. All resource requests from providers will be processed through the well -established emergency management system. Providers will contact local and County OEMs , with needs which will then be reviewed and processed through State OEM . Given the uncertainty of future funding streams to support implementation of the State's vaccination strategy, the State anticipates that any funding received would be proportionatel y distributed to counties and factor in each county's and POD s' ability to maintain compliance and throughput at each vaccination site within their jurisdiction . C. Methods and Procedures for Communications Monitoring i. Message Delivery ii. Communication Messages /Materials Reception Among Target Audiences The COVID -19 pandemic has been full of communication challenges unlike any other public health response to date. Not only has this been a worldwide pandemic, but one that has been caused by a novel strain of a virus that was relatively unknown to most people, a coronavirus. As these situations unfold the medical community builds its body of knowledge regarding the virus, its transmission, the scope of NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 93 | P a g e illness it creates, and the best practices in treatment. These things take time and recommendations change which can cause members of the public to lose trust in public health officials. Countering misinformation daily has been a significant challenge throughout, and social media makes this a difficult task. However, NJDOH wil l continue to provide public information based on the most current, updated and science -based data so that our constituents can take that information and make the best decisions for the health and safety of themselves, their loved ones, and their communiti es. The first step in bolstering public confidence is to learn the attitudes and beliefs among our target audiences. The Department is currently exploring ways to better understand any potential barriers to receive the COVID -19 vaccine among those who c an most benefit from it. Once we identify the barriers, we will devise strategies to overcome them and, and craft targeted communication messaging. To understand and inform public expectations of COVID -19 vaccine risks, benefits, and supply, NJDOH is seeking insights from focus groups run by external partners (e.g. hospitals that engaged communities around COVID -19 vaccine trials) and investigating how to conduct additional focus groups as NJDOH or through academic, regional health hubs, or community -based partners. Would a rushed approval affect willingness of people to get the vaccine? The key is to inform the public of the process for approval and communicate that although the timeline is accelerated, that the same safety checkpoints are in place. Safety is a guiding principle for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices that makes the recommendations on the use of the vaccine(s). How do we engage pro/anti/hesitant vaccine communities? Vaccine -hesitant individuals are a heterogeneous group who hold varying degrees of indecision about specific vaccines or about vaccinations in general. Vaccine -hesitant individuals may accept all vaccines but remain concerned about them; they may refuse or delay some vaccines but accept others; or they may re fuse all vaccines. Each of these groups requires different approaches when discussing vaccines and generally respond with different levels of success. The first step in addressing antivaccine sentiments, is to prioritize community engagement. By talking to community leaders and a cross section of the public who represent the diversity of our State, we can begin to have a dialogue to better understand their concerns and beliefs so that we can provide targeted information to allay these hesitancies. We ho pe to engage these communities through both our internal and external stakeholders. Through these collaborations, we can reach these populations using a grassroots approach. We can receive insights from these individual communities and try to engage commu nity leaders as spokespersons for vaccine acceptance. Healthcare providers have an advantage when communicating about the benefits of vaccines. A strong recommendation from a healthcare provider is the best predictor of adherence to the recommendation for vaccination. The NJDOH has strong partnerships with professional organizations including the NJ chapters of the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and the NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 94 | P a g e American College of Physicians. The Vaccine Preventable Diseas e Program (VPDP) supports providers by sharing evidence -based practices for communicating with patients who have concerns or hesitancy surrounding vaccination. The VPDP has also collaborated with these physician groups to deliver training webinars and con ferences on how to utilize the principles of risk communication, health literacy, and active listening skills, and motivational interviewing to enhance provider -patient conversations surrounding vaccinations. In addition, the VPDP works with health servic es grantees including both statewide and municipality -based coalitions to promote the use of evidence -based practices to increase vaccination. These practices include using the statewide immunization registry to accurately assess patient vaccination needs, using standing orders to avoid missed opportunities for vaccination, and designating an office/practice immunization champion who could help to promote a culture of vaccination acceptance. Everyone from the front desk staff to the physician needs to be o n-board with the pro - vaccination message to help foster a patient's choice for vaccination. How will COVID -19 flu messaging be synced with existing flu vaccination efforts? With the likelihood of both influenza viruses and the virus that causes COVID -19 circulating simultaneously this year, it will be of utmost importance that everyone 6 months of age and older get vaccinated against influenza. Although getting a flu vaccine will not protect against COVID -19, there are many benefits such as: Flu vaccines have been shown to reduce the risk of flu illness, hospitalization, and death. Getting a flu vaccine can also save health care resources for the care of patients with COVID -19. The NJDOH is working with internal and external partners on a statewide flu vaccination communications campaign. One of these partners is the VPDP's health services grantee, the Partnership for Maternal and Child Health of Northern NJ (the Partnership). VPDP has provided funding to the Partnership to develop a flu communication campaign that is stressing the importance of the flu vaccine during the pandemic. NJDOH's campaign will reinforce and expand on the Partnership's campaign to reach the statewide population. Materials developed highlight vaccination benefits, correct misi nformation, and inform the public about places to access vaccines. In addition to a public awareness campaign and focus groups, what support structures will be required e.g., call centers? The COVID -19 call centers will remain operational for the foreseeable future to provide information to the public by trained professionals. The NJ COVID -19 Information Hub will also remain an important online resource for the public as well as professionals to obtain information about various COVID -19 related in formation including the vaccine once it becomes available. The Department is also working to implement strategies to ensure equitable distribution of safe and effective COVID -19 vaccines, when they become available. Strong public private partnerships are critical to ensuring that New Jersey is prepared to efficiently administer COVID -19 vaccine(s) to everyone who is eligible to receive it. In this effort, the Department will rely on the existing strong working relationships with local public health agenc ies, healthcare providers, healthcare systems , and others. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 95 | P a g e To reduce any misinformation or concerns about the vaccine, it is important to ensure that New Jersey residents have accurate information readily available, such as the priority groups to be vacci nated and the decisions why these groups were chosen, importance of the vaccine to reduce the burden of the pandemic, safety and efficacy information, and other vital information sharing pieces of the vaccine. D. Methods and Procedures for Local -Level Situational Awareness Monitoring Supply -Side Given New Jersey's plan for local delivery, t he State will conduct regular check -in meetings with all local jurisdictions on at least a weekly basis to monitor human and physical resources dedicate d to the implementation and execution of the State's vaccination plan. The VTF will also utilize the \"boots on the ground\" resources, such as local and county health officers, local and county OEM coordinators, and NJ State Police regional rep resentative s to continuously monitor site operations. These resources will conduct regular on -site check -ins and work with each POD site administrator and safety officer to ensure that any operational challenges are overcome and elevated when necessary through an est ablished statewide Vaccine Command Center. The Vaccine Operations Center will operate in close partnership with NJ State Police, county and State offices of emergency management, the National Guard, and the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness. This center will provide a single conduit for the flow of bidirectional information and intelligence related to the transport, delivery, and deployment of vaccines throughout the State. The center will be physically located in 55 North Willow, which is th e new Department of Health headquarters. The Vaccine Operations Center will work in tandem with the Regional Operations Intelligence Center (ROIC), which is the State's primary fusion center across pandemic response efforts . Fusion centers serve as prima ry focal points within the state and local environment for the receipt, analysis, gathering, and sharing of threat -related information among federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) partners based on guidance provided by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security . Fusion centers are uniquely situated to empower front -line law enforcement, public safety, fire service, emergency response, public health, critical infrastructure protection , and private sector security personnel to lawfully gather an d share threat -related information , providing interdisciplinary expertise and situational awareness to inform decision -making at all levels of government. The Vaccine Operations Center will be supported by reporting mechanisms . Metrics aligning with the reporting goals as detailed in Section 9F and including those listed in Section 15E will be reviewed daily or weekly. These metrics will inform the State of New Jersey about resource and technical assistance needs, emerging challenges, best practices, an d opportunities for further quality improvement. Demand -Side The State of New Jersey also has an interest in local -level situational awareness to continually monitor user experience, barriers to access, and public opinion. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 96 | P a g e Strategy: Engagement of and collaboration with community leaders , local stakeholders , and members from critical populations . Activities: Frequent communication on community challenges, perceptions, vaccine service challenges, such as lack of availability, other info rmation to problem solve and further vaccination progress . This may be weekly for target populations, such as those in early Phases when significant public uncertainty or in latter Phases in communities where vaccine uptake has waned. Metrics: Weekly logs of communication that provide rich qualitative information used in quality improvement strategies . E. COVID -19 Vaccination Program Metrics The metrics that will be posted on the state of New Jersey public -facing website are still being determined, but the following metrics are among those under consideration: Vaccine coverage Doses distributed to POD s Doses administered Adverse events. NJ will coordinate with federal partners evaluating VAERS and other reporting mechanisms to ensure consistency with fed erally reported adverse events. The following data sources to generate metrics are under consideration : NJIIS VTrckS VAERS Communicable Disease Reporting and Surveillance System (CDRSS) Site reports Engagement platform Public confidence sources On-site surveys Additional sources The exact web location has not yet been determined. However, all other COVID -19 response -related data has been integrated into New Jersey COVID -19 Dashboard, which is accessible directly throu gh the New Jersey COVID -19 Information Hub ( https://covid19.nj.gov/ ) and through the Department of Health's website ( https://ww w.nj.gov/health/cd/topics/covid2019_dashboard.shtml ). Metrics already available publicly in New Jersey include but are not limited to COVID -19 case data, mortality data, hospital census and discharge data, contact tracing data, and data specific to select congregate living settings (e.g. long -term care fa cilities).

NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 120 | P a g e Section B: Memberships of Key COVID -19-specific Advisory Entities B.1.a. NJDOH COVID -19 Professional Advisory Committee: Charter Formed March 2020 Expanded September 2020 CHARTER COVID -19 PROFESSIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH On February 3rd, Governor Murphy issued Executive Order 102 convening the Coronavirus Task Force, to ensure a \"whole of Government response\" to this pandemic. Throughout the crisis, state leadership has engaged subject matter exp erts and thought leaders to guide New Jersey through this extraordinary and challenging time. The New Jersey Department of Health Professional Advisory Committee (PAC) was convened as one such forum to inform the Commissioner of Health. The Professional Advisory Committee (PAC) provides guidance to the Department to ensure that New Jersey's response to COVID -19 is based on the latest scientific, medical, ethical and public health evidence. The COVID -19 pandemic has resulted in significant health inequiti es in vulnerable communities. Health inequities are disparities in health or health care that are systemic and avoidable and, therefore, unfair or unjust. Health equity is a fundamental to the PAC's recommendations in the interest of preventing health in equity. As the scale and impact of the COVID -19 crisis has evolved, the functions and focus areas of the PAC have evolved as well. The Committee previously informed allocation of critical care resources, distribution of scarce treatment pharmaceuticals ( i.e. remdesivir), and targeted population -specific testing strategies (i.e. urban communities) during this public health emergency. Commencing in September 2020, the PAC will focus on comprehensive and equitable planning and rollout of COVID -19 vaccinatio n in New Jersey. The novel SARS CoV -2 virus is the cause of an unprecedented COVID -19 epidemic and requires a response that applies an equity lens to the development of strategies and tactics. Elevating the health equity lens in all parts of the respons e is critical. The PAC's work complements and enhances ongoing and sustained health equity initiatives and prioritization within state agencies. A health equity lens is of even greater imperative given the predicted and realized implications and complica tions of this unique public health crisis for vulnerable populations. Further, as a result of the catastrophic nature of this public health crisis, the demographic of those who identify as at -risk, under -resourced, and underserved has widened to include t hose who traditionally never identified in these vulnerable ways. The Professional Advisory Committee informs the health response to COVID -19 in the following ways: Resource Allocation - How resources and services are procured, promoted, and provided in proximity to those who most need or require them to survive or thrive. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 121 | P a g e Advisory and Consultative - Active communication to and from community and constituency perspectives to inform considered ethical and equitable planning, policy, and practice and to bu ild public confidence. Proactive and Participatory - Deliberative ideation and derivation of novel solutions. Community involvement endeavors to inspire public confidence and sense of ownership in the generation, implementation, and evaluation of public h ealth interventions. Access - A holistic assessment of whether affordability, availability, accessibility, accommodation, and acceptability are attained and advanced. Quality - A consideration of the safety, effectiveness, patient -centeredness, timelines s, efficiency, and equitability of proposed initiatives. Outcomes - A descriptive, data -informed, and transparent synthesis of which population(s) or who survives versus thrives, who is adversely impacted or resilient, who is affected by collateral or gene rational damage, and/or who is at -risk for a continuum of outcomes. Problem -Solving - An evaluation of which solutions transform the status quo by averting systemic and structural inequities and bias. Committee expertise will be leveraged to enhance develo pment, reach, and utility of overall and population -specific COVID -19 vaccination plans, policies, data -to-action, communications, and delivery activities. As New Jersey progresses through the rollout of COVID -19 vaccine(s), the PAC may inform New Jersey's answers to such questions as: Have equity considerations been implemented at each stage of planning and delivery? Can the public have confidence that the available vaccine(s) is safe and effective? How will vaccine(s) be prioritized, or sub -priori tized given scarcity and operational constraints? How to ensure vaccine uptake is sufficient to facilitate as possible a return to pre -pandemic conditions? To meet these varied purposes, specialized subcommittees of subject matter experts are convened as needed. On an ongoing basis, the NJDOH COVID -19 PAC's Health Equity Subcommittee monitors that New Jersey's COVID -19 vaccination initiative applies an equity lens in planning and a disparities focus in vaccine delivery. In the interest of mainstreaming equity, this subcommittee will routinely sit with the PAC. Meanwhile, the Community Advocacy Subcommittee is called as necessary to elevate community voices in order to better understand and inform public expectations of COVID -19 vaccine(s) risks, benefi ts, and availability. This will include representation from constituencies with historical vaccination trauma. Likewise, the Medical Ethics and Systems Subcommittee is convened as necessary to review scientific literature and medical guidance and to consi der resource allocation within facilities. This body may also be called upon to provide advice on issues relevant to the Department of Health's health systems regulatory authority. NEW JERSEY INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAN 122 | P a g e The PAC and its subcommittees will build and supplement ongoing vaccines -related engagement by the New Jersey Department of Health to raise awareness, provide education, and activate partnerships in New Jersey's communities. The membership shall include New Jersey -specific expertise representing geographic and professional diversity. The current membership include s state officials, epidemiology and immunization experts, health systems and health practitioners, local health champions, infectious and chronic disease providers, ethics and legal experts, equity and inclusion leade rs, academics, and health quality advisors drawn from across New Jersey. Membership is informed by recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Working Group on Readying Populations for COVID -19 Vaccine. B.1.b.
