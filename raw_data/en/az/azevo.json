Dr. Joseph Pizzorno, ND Chairman of the Board, Institute for Functional Medicine Editor, Integrative Medicine: A Clinician's Journal Co-Author, Clinical Environmental Medicine Fullscript Medical Advisory Board Learning Objectives After participating in this presentation, learners will be better able to: Understand the 5 toxins that contribute the most to common chronic diseases according to current research. Recognize the clinical manifestation of these toxins in patients. Identify laboratory tests for assessment of body load of persistent and non-persistent toxins. Help patients decrease exposure to these toxins. Effectively increase elimination of these toxins.Overview Worldwide epidemic of chronic disease Causes and risk factors: type 2 diabetes Bioaccumulation of top 5 environmental toxins Diseases caused Common sources Assessment Intervention: avoidance and elimination strategies SummaryPresentation data All human data Primarily U.S. data, as a lot more research is available Spot checking toxins in other countries shows the same toxin overload, but variations in which are most prevalent: Australia (higher PBDEs) Canada (higher lead) New Zealand (higher cadmium) Sweden (higher most toxic metals) UK (highest PDBEs in world, 3x OCP of US)Converting disease risk to % of disease due to toxinsAttributable fraction (AF) calculation Levin, M. L., (1953). The occurrence of lung cancer in man. p = underlying prevalence of risk factor in the population. rr = relative risk (the risk of contracting a disease in an exposed population divided by the risk of contracting the disease in an unexposed population). AF = % of disease due to the toxin.AF = p(rr-1) p(rr-1) + 1AF calculation: disease risk due to smoking Number of smokers and nonsmokers who contract disease. Rosen, L. (2013). An intuitive approach to understanding the attributable fraction of disease due to a risk factor: the case of smoking.

BPA and DES Synthetic estrogens developed during the 1930s. Very similar chemical structures. So widely used; very difcult to avoid exposure. Technically non-persistent, but practically semi-persistent. DES DES 'won' and was prescribed for pregnant women. Discontinued due to urogenital cancers in children and many other clinical problems. BPA BPA was 'put on the shelf' until the 1950s, when its ability to harden plastics was discovered.Bisphenols: diabetes risk There are 211 PubMed hits for: bisphenols / diabetes / human.

Foundational strategies Avoidance is key. The half-life of PCBs is 3 to 25 years. Choose wild sh; avoid farmed sh. Include ber. Rice bran: 10 g/d Sauna regularly. Sweating is key, the type of sauna is mainly for convenience. At least 20 minutes of heavy sweating, 1-4 times a week. If PCBS, use bile sequestrants . This includes holestimide, cholestyramine, and olestra.Foundational strategies Identify and stop the exposure . Greatly decrease the body's load . Some toxins become apparent only after others are removed. For damaged enzymes to work: Must displace the enzyme poison with nutrient cofactor, or Degrade and replace the enzyme. Half-life of MAO-B in baboon brain = 30 days. Finally, the damage has to be repaired .Practice patience; don't expect the speed of results seen with a drug or even nutrition therapy. Arnett, C. J., et al. (1987). Turnover of brain monoamine oxidase measured in vivo by positron emission tomography using SummarySummary Toxins are ubiquitous in the industrialized world. Toxins have become the primary drivers of chronic disease . Five toxins account for most of the damage. Avoidance is critical. Toxin elimination can be facilitated with diet, nutrition and saunas.Further reading "}
