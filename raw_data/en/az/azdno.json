Security measures begin long before you arrive at the airport. TSA works closely with the intelligence and law enforcement communities to share information. Additional security measures are in place from the time you get to the airport until you get to your destination. TSA adjusts processes and procedures to meet the evolving threat and to achieve the highest levels of transportation security.
