One of the hottest topics of the past two years has been 'how to boost the immune system.' Your immune system works on its own to ward off infections and diseases. You can help this process by maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, exercising regularly, not smoking, getting enough sleep, and not drinking are some things you can do to naturally boost your immune system. In our modern times, this also includes making sure that you have the most up-to-date vaccines to fight infection such as the COVID-19 vaccine. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 vaccines are our best defense against potential infection. They can enable a broad immune response that offers protection from more severe disease and hospitalization due to the infection.

Below, you'll find a breakdown of how to boost your immune system after getting your shot. What is the Immune System? The immune system is a powerful part of the body that protects you from \"invaders.\" Invaders are germs, bacteria, viruses, fungi, or toxins. The immune system is composed of the innate immune system and adaptive immune system. The innate is the body's rapid response system; whereas the adaptive produces antibodies to immediately protect your body from invaders. They function and operate together to keep you healthy. COVID-19 Vaccine on the Immune System In the case of COVID-19, the virus contains ribonucleic acid (RNA), along with spike proteins that latch on some human cells. This then replicates, which infects even more cells and spreads to the lungs. Many people wonder how the COVID-19 vaccines work. According to the CDC, it is a safe and effective vaccine that helps you to build protection (your immunity) against the virus. This typically happens after two weeks. In the U.S, there are three vaccine types available whose does are specific to the age of the person. This includes an adult dose for ages 18 and up and a child dose for ages 12 and up.
