This study evaluated whether using blended learning (e-learning plus a workshop) to train oncology physicians in providing advice on complementary and inte- grative medicine (CIM) therapies to their patients with cancer, in addition to distributing an information leaflet on reputable CIM websites, had different effects on patient-reported outcomes for the consultation than only distributing the leaflet. METHODS: In this multicenter, cluster-randomized trial, patients from private practices/hospital departments, recruited by 48 oncology physicians randomly allocated to an intervention group (CIM consultation plus information leaflet) or a control group (information leaflet), received CIM information. Patient-reported outcomes included satisfaction (Patient Satisfaction With Information on Cancer Treatment), readiness to make a decision (Preparation for Decision Making), and physician-patient communication (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire and Communication 26 [EORTC QLQ-COMU26]) for the consultation. Qualitative interviews were conducted with a physician subsample. RESULTS: A total of 291 patients (128 in the intervention group and 169 in the control group) advised by 41 physicians participated. Patients in the intervention group rated physician-patient communication higher on all EORTC QLQ- COMU26 scales (mean total score, 73.6 [95% CI, 69.3- 78.0]; P=.002), were more satisfied with the advice (mean, 4.2 [95% CI, 4.0-4.4] vs 3.7 [95% CI, 3.5-3.8]; P<.001), and were readier to make a decision (mean, [95% CI, 57.4-69.6] vs 53.2 [95% CI, 47.8-58.7]; P= .016) than the con- trol group.

INTRODUCTION Up to 70% of patients with cancer do not spontaneously disclose the use of complementary medicine (CM) therapies to their oncology physicians.1- 3 The reasons could include a perceived lack of knowledge and approval from the treating phy - sician or the assumption that CM therapies are harmless and do not interfere with cancer treatment.4- 6 Clinical practice guidelines show that there is an emerging body of evidence for both beneficial and harmful interventions.7 Nevertheless, patients want to gain information from their oncology physicians on CM therapies8 and to receive support for decision- making.9,10 Because CM is not always part of cancer treatment, oncology physicians often do not give advice regarding Corresponding Author: Claudia M.

Integrating CM into cancer treatments could at its best result in an integrative oncology approach described as a \"patient- centered, evidence- informed field of cancer care that utilizes mind and body practices, natural prod - ucts, and/or lifestyle modifications from different tradi - tions alongside conventional cancer treatments.\"14 For this project, we used the term complemen - tary and integrative medicine (CIM) because the train - ing aims to enable oncology physicians to provide evidence- based advice but does not train them in the full set of competencies needed for an integrative on - cology provider.15 Previous research has shown that patient- centered communication can influence patient satisfaction, decision- making, well- being, compliance with cancer therapy, and malpractice litigation.16,17 Numerous train - ing programs for oncology physicians focusing on com - munication18,19 or CIM20 coexist; however, the key to targeting the communication gap for CIM use in oncol - ogy might be training that focuses on both communica - tion and CIM. The systematically developed Competence Network for Complementary Medicine- Consultation T raining for Oncology Physicians (KOKON- KTO) training21 sup - ports oncology physicians in providing evidence- based ad - vice on CIM to their patients with cancer on the basis of a consultation manual that can be applied in routine care. In clinical practice, the time that can be spent with a patient with cancer is limited. Therefore, it would be important to know whether a consultation that takes 20 minutes and requires training is more beneficial than ad - dressing the topic in 5 minutes on the basis of a leaflet about CIM websites. In the KOKON- KTO study, we evaluated whether training oncology physicians to give advice on CIM to their patients with cancer, in addition to distributing an information leaflet about reputable websites, had different effects on outcomes at the patient, physician, and physician- patient levels in comparison with only distributing the information leaflet.22 This arti - cle focuses on the patient- reported outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Design In this prospective, multicenter, cluster- randomized, con - trolled study, 48 oncology physicians were randomized by clusters (at the hospital department or private practice level) into an intervention group or a control group. The intervention group received the KOKON- KTO train - ing21 (nine 45- minute e- learning modules and a 2- day onsite skill- training workshop), and the control group received only a short e- learning module (45 minutes) on how to distribute the KOKON- KTO information leaf - let for reputable CIM websites.22 Oncology physicians in both groups were asked to provide advice for up to 10 of their patients with cancer (1 consultation per patient and a maximum of 10 patients per oncology physician). Both oncology physicians and patients with cancer completed standardized questionnaires. Then, the oncology physi - cians in the control group also received KOKON- KTO training and were asked to conduct consultations on the basis of the KOKON- KTO framework21 with up to 5 patients with cancer. Patients completed baseline questionnaires before consultation with the oncology physician. T wo weeks after their consultations, the patients received a second questionnaire. Subsequently, qualitative interviews were con - ducted with a subsample of oncology physicians who gave advice in both consultation settings. The study followed the usual guidelines for clinical trials (Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice where ap - propriate) and was approved by the respective ethics committees. The heads of the participating hospitals, oncology physicians, and patients with cancer provided written informed consent to participate in the study. For further information on the study design, see the published study protocol.22 The whole project, includ - ing the development of the KOKON- KTO frame - work,21 the trial, and the maintenance, was guided by the RE- AIM implementation research framework.23 KOKON- KTO Training KOKON- KTO training is an evidence- based, blended- learning program training oncology physicians to con - duct CIM consultations with their patients with cancer in a practice- relevant timeframe of approximately 20 minutes.21 The KOKON- KTO framework has been systematically developed and has been positively evalu - ated with an implementation research framework,21 and it addresses the core competencies for integrative oncology providers.15 It is based on the semistandard - ized consultation manual, and the training consists of 9 units, each 45 minutes in length, of e- learning con - tent and 16 units of the skill- training workshop over 2 days.21Advising Patients on Complementary Therapies/Rogge et al 3 Cancer Month 0, 2021Eligibility Criteria Oncology physicians Oncology physicians (50% oncology gynecologists treating female malignancies, including breast cancer only, and 50% oncologists) were recruited from hos - pital departments (in each case, 2 oncology physicians as clusters) and private practices (in each case, 1 oncol - ogy physician) specializing in oncology as part of the KOKON- KTO study.22 Physicians were eligible if they fulfilled the following selection criteria: self- reported little knowledge of CIM, no previous structured train - ing in CIM in the field of oncology, minimal experience in advising patients with cancer on CIM, the ability to participate in the onsite skill- training workshop, and good German language skills. Eligibility criteria were determined in a standardized telephone interview with oncology physicians (self- disclosure). The included on - cology physicians either were board- certified oncology residents or were in residency training for oncology as a medical specialty and were treating their own patients with cancer in Germany.22 Patients Patients were eligible if they met the following criteria: they were interested in receiving advice on CIM, they were 18 years old or older, they were diagnosed with cancer, they were being treated at a participating hos - pital department or private practice, cancer treatment was planned or ongoing, and they had good German language skills. Patients with severe cognitive impair - ments were excluded by the participating oncology physicians.22 Randomization and Masking Cluster randomization occurred at the physician level (level I, hospital department [2 oncology physicians per hospital] or private practice [1 oncology physician per private practice]; level II, specialization in oncology gy - necology or oncology) with an allocation ratio of 1:1 according to a first- come, first- served principle for both strata. The randomization list was generated by a statisti - cian not otherwise involved in the study with SAS soft - ware (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). Patients were blinded to group assignments and recruited by participating oncology physicians. All of the patients were in treatment by the consulting oncology physician and hence knew the cancer treatment team and private practice/hospital department. However, because of the different training settings in both groups, the participat - ing oncology physicians were not blinded.Procedures Intervention procedures Patients with cancer in the intervention group received a 20- minute KOKON- KTO consultation by their treat - ing oncology physician in addition to the KOKON- KTO information leaflet describing 4 reputable CIM websites.22 The KOKON- KTO consultation was developed to train oncology physicians in giving advice on CIM to their patients with cancer.21 Control procedures Patients with cancer in the control group received a 5- minute consultation introducing the KOKON- KTO information leaflet by their treating oncology physician. No additional advice on CIM therapies was provided. Physicians in both groups received the same e- learning (including a example sentence and example video) for distributing the information leaflet. While handing out the flyer, physicians were trained to intro - duce only the websites and not to go into specifics about CM therapies. More detailed information on the flyer is described in the KOKON- KTO study protocol.22 Patients with cancer in both groups were asked to complete the baseline assessments before the consultation with the oncology physician and further questionnaires 2 weeks after the consultation. CIM consultations or the distribution of the information leaflet was included in the routine care visits. Information about the KOKON- KTO study was displayed via flyers in hospital departments or in the re - ception areas of private practices. Patients with cancer interested in receiving information about CIM then in - dicated their interest in participating and were recruited according to a first- come, first- served principle. Quantitative Outcomes and Outcome Measures Outcomes and outcome measurements were based on a literature search and an expert consensus procedure.24 Patients completed questionnaires on the quality of com - munication (European Organisation for Research and T reatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire and Communication 26 [EORTC QLQ- COMU26]25), their satisfaction with the CIM information provided during the consultation (Patient Satisfaction With Information on Cancer T reatment [PS- CaTE]26), and their prepara - tion to make a decision about CIM (Preparation for Decision Making [PrepDM]27) 2 weeks after the consul - tation with the oncology physician.Original Article 4 Cancer Month 0, 2021Baseline Characteristics and Other Variables At the baseline, patients documented sociodemographic data (eg, age, sex, and education), previous use of CIM therapies, and assumptions about their effectiveness (positive, neutral, or negative). Moreover, patients were asked to answer questions on their level of knowledge about CIM (multiple- choice questions based on 3 case vignettes; see the supporting information for CIM ques - tions). Patients also rated their treating oncology physi - cian's empathy (Consultation and Relation Empathy Scale28) and their physician's attitude toward CIM (self- developed instrument). In addition, disease- specific information was doc - umented by the oncology physician directly after the consultation. T wo weeks after the consultation, patients answered questions on the usefulness of the CIM websites provided by the KOKON- KTO information leaflet, answered the same multiple- choice questions on CIM knowledge that were asked at the baseline, and responded to questions about current and planned CIM use (and, in the case of current use, its effectiveness). Statistical Analysis Continuous variables are presented as means and standard deviations, and categorical variables are presented as abso - lute and relative frequencies. The outcomes of the study were analyzed across all consultations (from a maximum of 10 consultations per oncology physician) via a linear mixed model with fixed effects: a control group effect, an intervention group effect, and the variables with which the randomization was stratified (hospital department/ private practice and oncology/gynecology). The cluster - ing of patients within 1 oncology physician was included as a random effect. Patients who completed the follow- up questionnaires were analyzed for study purposes. Because all of the statistical analyses are considered exploratory, linear mixed model adjusted group means and 95% con - fidence intervals (CIs) are displayed, and no sample size was calculated.22 Statistical analyses were conducted with RStudio software.29 Qualitative Data Collection and Analysis The oncology physicians in the control group received KOKON- KTO training after the intervention phase. After the KOKON- KTO skill- training workshop, on - cology physicians were invited to conduct up to 5 KOKON- KTO consultations with their patients on a voluntary basis because doing so was not part of the ini - tial study agreement. In addition, to know more about their experiences with both settings, these physicians were invited for a qualitative telephone interview. After 9 interviews, we seemed to have reached a saturated spec - trum of expressed topics and experiences by the physi - cians and subsequently stopped recruiting for more interview partners. In the qualitative interviews (see the supporting information for interview guidelines), oncol - ogy physicians were asked about potential differences between the 2 consultation settings (KOKON- KTO consultation vs KOKON- KTO information leaflet only) in general and about differences in patient satisfaction with the advice given. Interviews occurred 8 to 10 weeks after the KOKON- KTO training. The interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. A qualitative con - tent analysis was performed according to Flick30 and was supported by MAXQDA qualitative data analysis software.31 The transcripts were coded in content units combining deductive and inductive coding strategies. The research team predefined deductive codes accord - ing to the KOKON- KTO consultation manual.21 Other subcategories were created in a continuous process of in - ductively building and verifying codes from the data; this was accompanied by an intersubjective validation of the coding by 2 independent researchers (A.A.R. and C.C.) to verify the reliability and robustness of the data analy - sis. In this article, concerning qualitative data, we focus on the reporting physicians' perceptions of patients' sat - isfaction with both settings. RESULTS Patients with cancer received consultations between February 15, 2018, and November 30, 2018 (see Fig. 1 for the Consolidated Standards of Reporting T rials study flow). In total, 291 patients (128 in the intervention group and 169 in the control group) received advice from 41 of the 48 randomized oncology physicians. T wo- thirds of the patients were diagnosed with breast cancer or gynecological cancers. Oncology physicians in the con - trol group treated patients with more severe tumors (see Table 1 for patients' baseline data and Table 2 for physi - cians' baseline data). Oncology physicians in the control group were slightly older, and there was a higher prevalence of women. They were also slightly more experienced working with patients with cancer than those in the intervention group. Patients with cancer (124 from the intervention group and 157 from the control group) answered fol - low- up questionnaires 2 weeks after consultation with their oncology physician. No significant differences Advising Patients on Complementary Therapies/Rogge et al 5 Cancer Month 0, 2021in CIM knowledge or use between the patient groups were observed. However, the intervention group used slightly more CIM websites than the control group. Patients in the intervention group rated the consultation significantly higher on all EORTC QLQ- COMU2625 scales (total score, [95% CI, 69.3- 78.0]; P = .002). Oncology physicians who received the intervention seemed to be able to communicate better with respect to correcting misun - derstandings (mean, 66.9- 76.1]; P < .001) and showed better skills related to the information given (mean, 73.6 [95% CI, 67.4- 79.8] vs 58.3 [95% CI, 52.8- 63.8]; P < .001). The patients in the intervention group were more satisfied with the advice given (PS- CaTE26; mean, 4.2 [95% CI, 4.0- 4.4] vs 3.7 [95% CI, 3.5- 3.8]; P < .001). They also felt readier to make a decision (PrepDM27; mean, 63.5 47.8- 58.7]; P = .016; see Table 3 for the quantitative results) after the consultation.Figure 1.

Supplement 3 of the support - ing information shows representative quotes from the interviewees. From the physicians' perspective, both patients with cancer receiving the information leaflet and patients receiving the KOKON- KTO consultation were satisfied with the information provided. Overall, patients from both groups seemed very grateful for their physicians' dedicating a considerable amount of their consultation time to discussing CIM. Patients receiving the KOKON- KTO consultation seemed to appreciate the opportunity to personally discuss the CIM possibil - ities with their physician. However, patients with cancer in the control group welcomed the short consultation and seemed interested in exploring CIM websites. Although none of the patients with cancer explicitly expressed dissatisfaction with the short consultation, 2 oncology physicians assumed that some patients might have expected more in- depth information and advice on CIM than only a leaflet. In particular, they agreed to participate in a respective scientific study. Some physi - cians felt more connected to their patients when provid - ing the KOKON- KTO consultation. However, patients with cancer also seemed satisfied with being referred to the information leaflet. Physicians reported that only a few patients asked for additional information and fur - ther support for decision- making in favor of or against CIM for their specific individual conditions. DISCUSSION The results show that the structured consultation taught in the KOKON- KTO training had positive effects on physician- patient communication (EORTC QLQ- COMU26), readiness to make a decision about CIM (PrepDM), and patient satisfaction (PS- CaTE) in com - parison with a setting in which patients with cancer re - ceived only an information leaflet describing reputable CIM websites. To our knowledge, this study is the first evaluating blended learning training for oncology physi - cians about advising patients with cancer on CIM in rou - tine cancer care.The research process was guided by an implemen - tation research framework23 and started with framework development21 and the systematic definition of relevant patient- reported outcomes24; this was followed by the im - plementation of the KOKON- KTO framework and its evaluation in a cluster- randomized trial and an in- depth qualitative analysis.22 Aspects of maintenance are cur - rently being evaluated. Although our training is scientifically founded and is now prepared for broad implementation, our study still has limitations when we consider the results at the patient level. According to previous research,24 the definition of a single primary outcome based on the current state of scientific knowledge is not recommended when one is evaluating communication training programs in oncology. Therefore, the main patient- reported outcomes of the KOKON- KTO study were defined on 3 different levels, including the patient level.22 Because of the number of outcomes, the statistical tests were planned and judged in an exploratory man - ner. Nevertheless, the results across all of the outcomes were homogeneous because they showed the positive effects of KOKON- KTO consultation in comparison with the information leaflet alone. Another limitation is that the \"correct\" implementation of the KOKON- KTO consultation manual (in accordance with the re - spective KOKON- KTO framework21) was monitored only during the KOKON- KTO training. The ratings showed that all of the trained physicians were able to correctly implement it.21 However, there was no video recording of the physicians providing advice in actual routine care settings. The advantages and limitations of video recording were discussed when the study was being designed. On the basis of experience from a pre - vious study32 in which video recording was performed, physicians gave feedback suggesting that video record - ing negatively influenced the consultation; therefore, for this study, we decided to not use it.

The study compared 2 settings (KOKON- KTO consultation vs an information leaflet on CIM websites); interestingly, the physicians in both groups reported during the interviews that their patients seemed satis - fied. However, the self- reported quantitative patient data showed much higher levels of satisfaction in the group that received the KOKON- KTO consultation. One ex - planation might be that patients are reluctant to provide open feedback directly in consultations; this phenome - non has been shown in other studies.33 On the basis of this outcome, the patient- reported data of this study might provide a more realistic picture. Adding qualitative data on the physicians' view of patient satisfaction and comparing these data to the quantitative patient- reported outcomes showed an interesting gap, which might be an interesting aspect for future research, but more compara - ble evaluation tools should be used. Time spent with the oncology physician in the consultation differed between the interventions (5 vs 20 minutes), and a question might arise regarding whether this finding explains the much higher level of satisfaction in the KOKON- KTO group. However, having more time in this context might not al - ways result in better patient- physician interaction because previous research has shown that physicians without CIM training felt uneasy in such situations.34 Moreover, it is uncertain in what way the difference between the 2 groups in the cancer treatment objective (curative vs palliative) might have influenced study out - comes because previous experiences, the type of cancer, expectations, and the social environment can also influ - ence outcomes, and this makes it difficult to judge. In summary, the results of the KOKON- KTO study at the patient level show that the consultation has a pos - itive influence on patient satisfaction, physician- patient communication, and decision- making. As described in the literature, barriers to physician- patient communica - tion persist and can have a negative influence on cancer treatment; however, physicians' acceptance of patients' interest in CIM and their knowledge of the safety and efficacy of these therapies might help to improve com - munication about this topic.16,17 Oncology physicians addressing CIM with a structured approach could en - hance patient satisfaction and improve patient adher - ence to cancer treatments. A future directive might be to introduce a framework earlier in physicians' medical training on how to advise patients with cancer on CIM (eg, in medical school). Additionally, the KOKON- KTO framework was developed as an evidence- based, system - atic approach tailored to physicians' and cancer patients' needs; hence, in future initiatives, it could be interesting to explore whether this framework could be transferred to other health professions or disease areas. In conclusion, this is the first study to implement and evaluate an evidence- based CIM consultation in routine cancer treatment. Advising patients with cancer according to a structured, evidence- based consultation manual showed positive effects on patient satisfaction, preparation for decision- making, and physician- patient communication in comparison with only distributing an information leaflet on CIM. The study results emphasize the importance of communication in physician- patient relationships. The implementation and application of the KOKON- KTO manual might lead to greater pa - tient compliance and reporting of CIM use. Future studies should investigate whether the application of the KOKON- KTO consultation leads to changes in behavior (eg, use of CIM) in patients who are later than 4 weeks into the course of cancer treatment.
