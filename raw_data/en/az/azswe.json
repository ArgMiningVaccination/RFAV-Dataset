The purpose of the chapter is to provide a resource and starting point to occupational health and stress researchers who may be interested in religion/spirituality. A review of critical religion/spirituality concepts is provided, along with a discussion of how religion/spirituality can be integrated into common occupational stress theories and reconciled with commonly studied variables within this domain. A series of future research directions involving religion/spirituality and occupational health and stress are ultimately presented. Keywords Acknowledgements Acknowledgments Sincere thanks are owed to my colleagues Paul Watson and Ralph Hood for their support, encouragement, and review of elements of this work. I also sincerely appreciate the efforts of my graduate assistant at the time of writing this chapter, Craig Holton, for helping to locate critical resources that support various elements in this chapter.
