Where can I obtain general information about coronavirus and what is being done? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) website has general information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus that causes COVID-19. The Safer Federal Workforce Task Force webpage offers a comprehensive understanding of the Task Force focus areas, resources, and news. The DOE Webpage has information about what DOE laboratories and sites are doing to support the COVID response efforts. If you still have a question, you may contact the DOE COVID-19 Hotline at COVID-19Inquiries@hq.doe.gov or by calling 202-586-2683. 2. If I am required to come into a DOE facility, am I required to wear a face mask? See new 5/21/2021 FAQ Below: Q: Do I need to wear a mask at a DOE site/facility if I have been fully vaccinated? On May 13, 2021, the CDC updated their Interim Public Health Recommendations for Fully Vaccinated People. In keeping with the new CDC guidelines and guidance from the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, fully vaccinated Federal employees, fully vaccinated contractors, and fully vaccinated visitors to Federal buildings are no longer required to wear masks or maintain social distance, except where called for by Federal, State, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations. People are considered fully vaccinated: 2 weeks after their second dose in a 2-dose series, such as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines; or 2 weeks after a single-dose vaccine, such as Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine Individuals who are not fully vaccinated are still required to wear a mask and maintain social distancing in keeping with public health guidance. This change is related to mask wearing and social distancing only. Maximum telework and occupancy limits remain in effect. The DOE COVID-19 Workplace Safety Plan has recently been updated to reflect the new guidance from the CDC and the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force. 2/25/2021 Updated 5/24/2021 3 See also new 5/21/2021 FAQ below: Q: Do I have to remove my mask if I am fully vaccinated? You may continue to wear a mask at your discretion. See also new 5/21/2021 FAQ below: Q: Where do I still need to wear a mask? CDC guidelines say fully vaccinated people must still wear a mask in health care settings, transportation hubs such as airports and stations, and public transportation. See also new 5/21/2021 FAQ below: Q: Do I need to wear a mask while on official travel? Yes, that includes planes, buses and trains traveling into, within or outside of the U.S. as part of a federal mask mandate that was extended to September 13, 2021. 3. Do I need to wear two masks? While not required, double masking is one way to improve the efficiency of a mask. There are two ways to make sure that your mask works the best it can: make sure your mask fits snugly against your face and pick a mask with layers to keep your respiratory droplets in and others' out. Using a cloth mask over a disposable mask is one way to add layers of material to a mask. It is important to make sure that you can see and breath easily. It is not recommended to wear two disposable masks or combine an N95 or KN95 respirator with any mask. Check out more ways to improve your mask's efficiency at the CDC website, Improve How Your Mask Protects You. 4. What should I do if I have COVID-19-like symptoms or have been in close contact with someone who has or may have COVID-19? Please notify your supervisor and contact your site or the DOE COVID-19 Hotline at COVID-19Inquiries@hq.doe.gov or by calling 202-586-2683. Personnel should also refer to the latest CDC guidance at www.cdc.gov/coronavirus for additional information. See new 5/21/2021 FAQ below: Q: If I experience COVID-19 like symptoms after being fully vaccinated, do I need to isolate? The Department follows CDC guidance. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should contact your health care provider, get tested, and stay home and away from others. Also notify your supervisor and follow the instructions for your site. 2/25/2021 Updated 5/24/2021 4 5. What should I do to protect my family? The Department strongly encourages everyone to follow the guidance provided by the CDC for protecting yourself and your family. COVID-19 Response 1. What will happen if someone who has been in the building is confirmed to have COVID-19? Personnel with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 are asked to report their condition to their supervisor and their site or DOE COVID-19 Hotline. The site or DOE COVID-19 response team will work with the person and/or their supervisor to identify any work-related close contacts and will help identify which areas need to be cleaned and sanitized. In accordance with CDC guidelines, any individual who has been in close contact with the sick or confirmed individual will be asked to self-quarantine if they have not been vaccinated. Depending on when the sick or confirmed individual was last in the building, the workstation of the individual will be sanitized. Additional cleaning will be done on a case-by-case basis. See also 5/21/2021 FAQ below: Q: The CDC recently updated their recommendations for cleaning which are different from the cleaning and disinfecting requirements outlined in the DOE COVID-19 Safety Plan. Are DOE sites and facilities following the updated guidance? Yes, DOE sites and facilities may follow the updated guidance regarding cleaning and disinfecting a facility. If a person who has been sick or tested positive for COVID-19 has been in a facility within the last 24 hours, the spaces occupied by that person should be cleaned and disinfected. If more than 24 hours has passed since the person has been in the space, cleaning is sufficient. If more than 3 days have passed since the person was in the space, no additional cleaning is necessary. See also 5/21/2021 FAQ below: Q: Do fully vaccinated employees need to quarantine following an exposure/close contact with someone who has COVID-19? Fully vaccinated employees do not need to quarantine or be tested following an exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, as long as they have no symptoms. They should still monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days following an exposure. If they experience symptoms, they should isolate themselves from others, be 2/25/2021 Updated 5/24/2021 5 clinically evaluated for COVID-19, including SARS-CoV-2 testing, if indicated, and inform their health care provider of their vaccination status at the time of presentation to care. 2. How are sites screening the workforce as they come to work? If Federal employees, contractors, or visitors are not feeling well, they are not to enter the Federal workplace. DOE sites and facilities have implemented screening processes requiring Federal and contractor employees working on site to complete screening for signs and symptoms and other exposure history factors. Visitors will also be asked to complete symptom screening and exposure history before entering a DOE facility. More information can be found in the DOE COVID-19 Workplace Safety Plan. 3. If an individual has recovered from a confirmed COVID-19 case, when can they come back to work in a DOE workspace? Individuals should contact their immediate supervisor to determine when they may return. 4. Will contact tracing continue? Please refer to \"Contact Tracing\" in the DOE COVID-19 Workplace Safety Plan. See also 5/21/2021 FAQ: Do fully vaccinated employees need to quarantine following an exposure/close contact with someone who has COVID-19? Travel 1. What travel guidelines should be followed? Federal and contractor employees should adhere strictly to CDC, state, and local guidelines before, during, and after travel, regardless of whether the travel is personal or for official business. More information on this topic may be found in the DOE COVID-19 Workplace Safety Plan. See also 5/21/2021 FAQ below: Q: Can I be required to be vaccinated before being approved for official domestic or international travel? DOE does not require federal employees to get vaccinated and has not directed its contractor partners to require their employees to get vaccinated. The CDC has published guidance for travel for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. DOE is following CDC guidance for domestic and international travel and expects that individual travelers will follow the travel restrictions appropriate to their situation. For example, per CDC's current guidance, if the traveler is fully vaccinated (2 weeks after the first shot of a one-shot regime or the second shot of a two-shot 2/25/2021 Updated 5/24/2021 6 regime) then post-travel quarantine is not required; if not fully vaccinated, then quarantine or testing, as applicable, may be required. Where you travel matters. If you travel to a high transmission area, you are also at greater risk for getting COVID-19 and transmitting it to others. Check out the CDC's travel recommendations by destination. See also 5/21/2021 FAQ below: Q: Do I need to wear a mask while on official travel? Yes, that includes planes, buses and trains traveling into, within or outside of the U.S. as part of a federal mask mandate that was extended to September 13, 2021. 2. Can I receive temporary duty (TDY) allowance if I self-quarantine at home after official travel? No, except in limited emergency circumstances involving employees who serve in a law enforcement, investigative, or similar capacity. In those cases, the head of the agency may approve appropriate subsistence payments for the employee or members of the employee's family (or both) while occupying temporary living accommodations at or away from the employee's designated post of duty. Such situations will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Vaccines 1. Do I need to quarantine if I've been vaccinated? According to the CDC, fully vaccinated individuals who meet all of the following criteria will no longer be required to quarantine following an exposure to someone with COVID-19: Are fully vaccinated (i.e., it has been more than 2 weeks following receipt of the second dose in a two-dose series, or more than 2 weeks following receipt of one dose in a single-dose series); and It has been less than 3 months since the last dose in the series; and Have remained asymptomatic (no symptoms) since the exposure. Anyone who does not meet all three criteria should continue to follow the current quarantine guidance after an exposure. 2. If I've been vaccinated, do I need to continue to wear a mask, practice social distancing, and follow the COVID-19 safe practices? See 5/21/2021 FAQ below: 2/25/2021 Updated 5/24/2021 7 Q: Do I need to wear a mask at a DOE site/facility if I have been fully vaccinated? On May 13, 2021, the CDC updated their Interim Public Health Recommendations for Fully Vaccinated People. In keeping with the new CDC guidelines and guidance from the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, fully vaccinated Federal employees, fully vaccinated contractors, and fully vaccinated visitors to Federal buildings are no longer required to wear masks or maintain social distance, except where called for by Federal, State, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations. People are considered fully vaccinated: 2 weeks after their second dose in a 2-dose series, such as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines; or 2 weeks after a single-dose vaccine, such as Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine Individuals who are not fully vaccinated are still required to wear a mask and maintain social distancing in keeping with public health guidance. This change is related to mask wearing and social distancing only. Maximum telework and occupancy limits remain in effect. The DOE COVID-19 Workplace Safety Plan has recently been updated to reflect the new guidance from the CDC and the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force. 3. Should I get a vaccine for COVID-19 if one is offered? Yes, you are strongly encouraged to get an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine once it is available. Even if you have had COVID-19 in the past, the CDC still recommends getting the vaccine. 4. If I have an adverse reaction to a vaccine, where should I report it? Most people do not have serious problems after being vaccinated. Your arm may be sore, red, or warm to the touch at the injection site. These symptoms usually go away on their own within a week. Some people report getting a headache or fever when getting a vaccine. These side effects are a sign that your immune system is doing exactly what it is supposed to do. It is working and building up protection to the disease. FDA and CDC are continuing to monitor the safety of the vaccine and ask you to report any side effects. If you do have an adverse reaction, you should contact your health care provider and then report the side effects using the V-safe application which can be downloaded to your phone. You will need a smartphone and information about the COVID-19 vaccine you received. If you do not have a cell phone, you can register any effects in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). This information will also be provided on the CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Record Card which you will receive at the time you receive your first dose. 2/25/2021 Updated 5/24/2021 8 Federal employees are authorized up to two days of Administrative leave for adverse reactions from the COVID-19 vaccine. 5. Are employees granted administrative leave for the COVID-19 vaccine? Federal employees are allowed up to 4 hours of administrative leave for each dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. This leave is not allowable for illness due to the COVID-19 vaccine; employees are expected to take their sick leave. DOE has also encouraged all contractors to grant a similar 4 hours of administrative leave for employees who work onsite at DOE facilities. Returning to the Workplace 1. I want to return to my physical workplace as soon as I can. When can I expect to do so? Personnel will be given advance notice and guidance for when they may return to work in accordance with site specific procedures, contracts, and local conditions. Personnel are encouraged to consult with their supervisor for information related to their specific workplaces. 2. Is DOE still using a phased approach for returning to the workplace (i.e., Phase 1, 2, 3)? The Department now follows the Department of Energy COVID-19 Workplace Safety Plan, which supersedes DOE's COVID-19 Return to the Federal Workplace Framework, which was issued on May 18, 2020. Although sites can still use phase terminology as needed in describing their postures, the COVID-19 Workplace Safety Plan requires cognizant Departmental Elements and sites to review the mission critical work being performed in-person or on-site, refine their plans, and minimize, where necessary, on-site work. This plan continues to maximize telework to protect the health and safety of the workforce. 3. Who can I contact if I am suffering from stress, anxiety, or grief? The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) provides counseling and other resources to help manage stress, anxiety, and grief. Please contact your site's EAP program. All DOE Federal employees may contact Espr at (877) 801-5752 to speak to a counselor. Headquarters Federal employees may also contact the Headquarters EAP Specialist at (202) 586-4995 during business hours. For additional resources, Federal employees may visit the Espr website. DOE's password to the site and additional resources can be found on the internal EAP page to work. "}
