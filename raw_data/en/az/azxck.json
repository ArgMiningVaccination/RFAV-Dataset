Drawing on esoteric tradition as well as scientific research, such as Rupert Sheldrake's morphic field studies, the author maps out the human energy field in all its subtleties, providing diagrams of the human energy body, the spectrum of states of awareness, the multilayered fields of consciousness, and the psychoenergetic dynamics of the transformation process. Through compelling testimonials of powerful healings, Adams demonstrates how the processes of healing and of peak spiritual experience are closely aligned with harmony within the larger energetic field of consciousness. Proposing a new model of consciousness, reality, and energy healing that incorporates the anomalous phenomena that occurs on the outermost edges of human experience, the author draws these many strands together to outline not only a multilayered approach for different kinds of energy healing modalities, such as Reiki, breathwork, EFT, and remote healing, but also a useful program of self-help that anyone can follow to make lasting improvements to their physical, emotional, and spiritual health. About the Author Peter Mark Adams and his wife, Kenzie, have shared a healing and personal development practice for more than 20 years where they specialize in energy and meridian therapies, breathwork, and meditation. For more than 45 years, he has practiced a range of meditative and energy-based techniques, including Mind Connection Healing, Reiki, EFT, mindfulness, Vivation, and Rebirthing Breathwork.

I highly recommend Adams's work--this one especially!\" \u2014 Greg Kaminsky, author and host of the Occult of Personality podcast \"Brilliantly challenges our deepest-held beliefs about the nature of consciousness. Through rigorous documentation in case reports and practical, lucid explanations, Peter Mark Adams empowers us with a new set of tools and contexts to practically code and recode our reality, heal our ancestral past, understand the paranormal, and move through each moment with ethical intentionality.\" \u2014 Alexander Eth, host of the Glitch Bottle podcast \"As one in search of the lost consciousness technologies of the ancients, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Peter reveals the multidimensionality of the human being by skillfully mapping the energy field of intelligence supported by groundbreaking scientists such as Rupert Sheldrake. His rational and logical methodology delivers a solid melding of scientific theories and energy healing that questions the terms of existence in which the scientific world operates. What makes this book a page-turner is the collection of real-life energy healing cases. Packed with mystery and wonderment, perhaps the most powerful thing about this book is that Peter provides hope by expanding what is possible onone's own healing journey.\" \u2014 Vanese McNeill, executive producer of the Magical Egypt documentary series \"The Power of the Healing Field outlines a new horizon of possibilities of controlling our awareness. The examples of the usage of psychic energy explained in the book illuminate the dark areas of our subconscious fears and help us to overcome the inherent fear of the infinite and impersonal. This is a very timely book that I would recommend to all thoughtful readers.\" \u2014 Alina Kiprey, proprietor of the esoteric publishing house Inverted Tree \"Peter Mark Adams provides a much-needed, inspiring exploration of energy healing and the ways its successes challenge the materialist assumptions of our culture. The Power of the Healing Field is a paradigm-shifting work, and I highly recommend it for everyone drawn to the healing arts and wider ways of knowing and interacting with spirit.\" \u2014 JoAnna Farrer, cofounder of the North Wyldewood Tradition of Witchcraft \"Peter Mark Adams continues to impress with the breadth of experience he brings to the topic and his ability to present it clearly and concisely. This is a fine book for beginners as their foundation will be well established, and equally, experienced healers will find it insightful and practical. There is truly something for everyone in these pages.\" \u2014 Mark Stavish, author of Egregores \"As a careful researcher and spellbinding nonfiction author, Peter Mark Adams's star has been on the rise and continuing to climb with each new offering. His unflinching willingness to tackle issues relating to the blind spots and limitations of modern Western thinking and some much-needed course corrections for modern Western science and technology are handled with his characteristic clarity, brilliance, and a frankness that is rare in this age. This book is an eyes-wide-open presentation of the very furthest frontiers of what modern science has discovered about the governing fields and invisible forces that organize the physical realm, the invisible causal movers, and primary influencers of biology. The insights offered in this book may hold the key to pulling humanity back from the brink of self-imposed annihilation, a muchneeded cause to take pause and to reexamine the presumptions that have led us to this precarious state we find ourselves in.\" \u2014 Chance Gardner, writer and producer of the Magical Egypt documentary series \"The Power of the Healing Field is an unequivocal declaration that materialism is an entirely inadequate explanation for the human experience, especially in regards to modalities for physical and emotional healing.This book will be especially valuable to those who are hungry for a thoughtful taxonomy and nomenclature through which to better understand the varieties of experiences that expose the limitations of contemporary science.\" \u2014 Stav Appel, author of The Torah in the Tarot \"This is an invitation to a radical change of paradigm, the embrace of which may help the effort to make us sane and whole again.\" \u2014 Gordan Djurdjevic, author "}
