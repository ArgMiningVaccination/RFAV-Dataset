any previous time. Inthe years since the publication of the first edition of Disease and Mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa in 1991, numerous reports have been issued by national governments, development agencies, and researchers addressing the health status of African popula-tions and proposing strategies to more effectively combat poorhealth with improved delivery of health services to prevent and cure diseases. Prime among these was the World Bank's 2005report Improving Health, Nutrition and Population Outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa\u2014The Role of the World Bank , which gave rise to the publication of this book. Increased funding for healthfrom governments, multilateral and bilateral donors, as well as new public-private partnerships and foundations has become available for assisting African countries to deliver more effectivehealth interventions. The Millennium Development Goals havefocused the attention of the world on achieving a clear set ofgoals\u2014several of which are directly concerned with improvinghealth outcomes\u2014to be achieved by 2015. Y et the sobering reality is that life expectancy has decreased by almost five years for the continent as a whole since the 1991publication, and by much more in some countries. As the chap-ters in this volume document, children under five are dying atunacceptably high rates from causes for which effective inter-ventions exist, and adult mortality from infectious diseases has risen to extraordinary levels. HIV/AIDS has spread fromeastern Africa to the rest of the continent, affecting southernAfrican countries the most. Malaria mortality of childrenincreased during the 1990s, and TB has reemerged as a leadingcause of death for adults, largely due to the spread of AIDS. Notsurprisingly, at this time Sub-Saharan Africa is not on track toreach any of the health Millennium Development Goals. It is important to recognize that not all trends have been neg- ative. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS has significantly decreasedin several African countries, including Uganda, one of theworst-affected countries at the time of the publication of thefirst edition. Measles mortality has been virtually eliminated inthe countries of southern Africa in the past decade. Enormousstrides continued to be made in the control of onchocerciasisduring the 1990s. Although many factors contributed to thesesuccesses, a common theme in these and other successful pro- grams has been the emphasis on the monitoring of disease indi-cators and the effectiveness of programs to address them. Without knowledge of disease incidence, prevalence, and sever- ity, setting policies for prioritizing interventions risks misallo-cating resources to combat causes of ill health that contributelittle to the overall health status of a population. Good epidemi-ological information does not ensure good policy decisions or effective implementation, but without reliable epidemiologicaldata, efforts to design cost-effective strategies and to implementtechnologies are no more than theoretical exercises. Since the publication of the first edition of Disease and Mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa , many new sources of health and demographic information have become available, includ-ing data on trends in HIV infection from antenatal clinic sur-veillance sites, the first set of African life tables from a growingnumber of demographic surveillance sites, injury statisticsfrom a small number of injury mortality surveillance registers,and cancer data from cancer registers. Improved methods forestimating the incidence of several other diseases, includingtuberculosis, maternal mortality, and chronic diseases, havealso improved the reliability of health statistics. Verbal autopsystudies have linked with demographic surveillance sites, addingto our knowledge on changes in the cause-of-death composi-tion in several countries. Notwithstanding these advances in health statistics, a theme that emerges from all the chapters in this volume is that too little is known about trends in the diseases and conditionsincluded here in order to monitor and evaluate the effective-ness of programs intended to produce better health outcomes.As we get closer to the 2015 end point of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals, reaching the goals will become increas-ingly challenging. The continued improvement of disease sur-veillance and other regularly published health informationremains as important a priority for African health systems as itwas for the first edition.

Its main purpose was to assist the World Bank's work in the health sector by describing conditions and diseasesthat contributed most to the overall burden of disease and by identifying ways to prevent and manage these causes of illhealth. The volume was timely because of the adverse effectthe economic downturn of the early 1980s had on health inAfrica and because of the need to evaluate the impact of pri-mary health care strategies that had been promoted in thepreceding decade. Epidemiologic information coming fromdemographic surveillance sites that had not previously beenfully compared and disseminated provided a new source forassessing trends in mortality. All this occurred against a backdrop of increasing concern about how the humanimmunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syn-drome (HIV/AIDS), then still a relatively new and geo-graphically more limited disease, could potentially affecthealth and development in Africa. In the years since the publication of DMSSA-1 in 1991, epidemiological and demographic changes have occurredthat require an update if the volume is to remain useful forpolicy makers in addressing the \"Key Concerns\" shown inbox 1.1. The most significant impact on disease and mortal- ity in Africa has been the growth of the HIV/AIDS epidemic,which has infected more than 30 percent of adults in somecountries while spreading across the continent. Its impacthas changed trends in many of the diseases covered in this volume and dramatically worsened the overall level of mor-tality in many African countries. The potential impact ofHIV/AIDS was anticipated in DMSSA-1; the current volume documents the burden the disease is currently inflicting onAfrica. APPROACH Although the second edition (hereafter called DMSSA-2 ) has the same overall objective of informing policy makers (at the World Bank as well as in countries and among other development partners), the approach taken to compile the information was quite different from that for the first edi-tion. DMSSA-1 was organized in three broad sections, cov- ering patterns of mortality, diseases and conditions, and longitudinal studies of mortality in demographic surveil-lance sites. In DMSSA-2, the number of chapters coveringChapter1 Changing Patterns of Disease and Mortality in Sub-SaharanAfrica: An Overview Florence K. Baingana and Eduard R. Bosdiseases and conditions has been expanded from 8 to 17 (out of a total of 24 chapters), with greater emphasis onemerging noncommunicable conditions and injuries. Thesection discussing the demographic surveillance sites hasbeen dropped, and the information from the sites is now covered in a synthesis chapter that enables a better compar- ative perspective. The number of authors and editors hasincreased along with the number of chapters: there are now24 chapters with one to eight authors each (for a total of 70);most chapters have at least one author from Sub-SaharanAfrica. CONDITIONS NOT COVERED IN DMSSA-1 DMSSA-1 emphasized communicable diseases, which are responsible for the largest disease burden and cause the highest number of deaths. The burden of communicablediseases has increased since the publication of the firstedition, largely owing to the rapid rise in HIV/AIDS. Non- communicable diseases, however, are also becoming a sig-nificant burden in several countries, leading to dual burdensof disease. DMSSA-1 combined cardiovascular disease and cancers in one chapter; DMSSA-2 expands the coverage of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) substantially. Chapterson the following diseases and conditions have been added: Developmental Disorders . This chapter discusses the high- er rates of severe mental retardation, visual impairment, and hearing impairment found in Sub-Saharan Africa than inmore developed regions. An estimated 47 percent of visualand 50 to 66 percent of hearing impairments in Sub-Saharan Africa are found to be preventable. Risk factorsinclude congenital disorders, malnutrition.Lifestyle and Related Risk Factors for NCDs . Increased use of tobacco and increased consumption of fats, sugar, alco-hol, and animal products are critical risk factors for manyNCDs. At the same time, the amount of physical exercise has been decreasing, leading to a sedentary lifestyle that is asso-ciated with obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. This chapterprovides an overview of the risk factors for the NCDs dis-cussed in subsequent chapters. Diabetes Mellitus . Three million people in Sub-Saharan Africa were afflicted with type 2 diabetes as of 1994, but that number is projected to increase by two- or threefold by2010. The highest prevalence is found among populations ofIndian descent, urban populations, and those with a family history of diabetes, obesity, or physical inactivity. The chap-ter includes a discussion of studies of diabetes onset andmortality in Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Challenges to the pro-vision of health care for diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africainclude short consultation times, inadequately trained staff,nonexistent referral systems, inadequate levels of staff, and poor record keeping. Cancers . Cancers have been a low priority in Sub-Saharan Africa, yet the probability of a 65-year-old woman develop- ing cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa is only 20 percent lowerthan in Western Europe. Factors affecting cancer incidenceand mortality include increases in the prevalence of tobaccoconsumption; HIV-induced immunosuppression; increaseduse of alcohol; the high prevalence of cancer-associatedagents like papilloma viruses, hepatitis B virus, and human herpes virus 8; and exposure to aflatoxins. The top threecancers for men are Kaposi's sarcoma, liver cancer, andprostate cancers; for women, cervical cancer, breast cancer,and Kaposi's sarcoma. Cardiovascular Diseases . Cardiovascular disorders are the second most common cause of adult deaths in Sub-SaharanAfrica, as well as a major cause of chronic illness and dis-ability. Half of cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths occur 2| Florence K. Baingana and Eduard R. BosBox 1.1 Synopsis of the Key Concerns for DMSSA-1 \"What are, or should be, the information needs of policy makers? How can available analyses and data be best presented to serve those needs? How can the methods of data collection and analysis that are now available improve the information base for policy?\" Policy makers must address the questions of whether the health sector ought to be a priority concern, whereproblems of differing types are most severe, which con- ditions and diseases are placing the greatest burden on the populations (and on the health care system), why diseases occur (through quantification of risk factors), and how most efficiently and effectively to prevent dis- ease and manage those cases that do occur.

Incidence of stroke in Sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to be about 1 per 1,000. Survival outcomes are poor, due to delayed hospital-ization, absence of thrombolysis and angioplasty, and lowsocioeconomic status and illiteracy. Rheumatic heart dis-ease, still prevalent among children and teenagers, is a disease of poverty that is related to overcrowding, poor housing, and undernutrition. Mental Health, Alcohol and Substance Abuse. Depression in Sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to have an incidence rate of 15 to 18 percent and a lifetime prevalence rate of 18 to30 percent. Common mental disorders (depression and anx-iety) have a point prevalence rate that ranges from 1 to 5 percent. The point prevalence rate for schizophrenia isthe same as in other parts of the world, ranging from 2 to5 per 1,000 population, with a lifetime prevalence of 7 to9 per 1,000. The Sub-Saharan Africa region, the mostconflict-affected region of the world, has seen rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depressionrange from 20 to 60 percent, and alcohol abuse has seen asharp increase. In South Africa, suicide is found to be muchmore frequent among those who are HIV positive. Neurological Disorders . The prevalence of epilepsy in Sub- Saharan Africa ranges from 2.2 to 58.0 per 1,000 people. Stroke has been found to be as common in Sub-Saharan Africa as in the West. The leading causes of neurological dis-orders are infections during pregnancy, neonatal infections,and sequelae to the disorders that cause high under-five mortality. Challenges to the management of neurologicaldisorders include the lack of adequately trained personnel able to recognize and manage the disorders, lack of equip- ment necessary to confirm a neurological diagnosis, and unavailability of the common drugs that would controlepilepsy. Violence and Injuries . Intentional injuries (violence) resulted in the deaths of more than 300,000 people in Africain 2000. Intentional injuries also are estimated to result inat least 6.2 million disabled or incapacitated people, 20 timesthe number of deaths. Road traffic injuries, burns, drown-ing, war, and homicide are the major causes of injurymortality in Sub-Saharan Africa. KEY DEVELOPMENTS SINCE DMSSA-1 This section deals with the changes in the overall socioeco- nomic environment that have had a major impact on preva-lence of diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa, such as economicand demographic developments, as well as the changes in how health in Africa is addressed by developmentorganizations. The Impact of HIV/AIDS A striking feature of DMSSA-2 is the documentation of the direct impact of HIV/AIDS on the epidemiology of almost all infectious diseases included in this volume, as well as on overall adult and child mortality. According to the United Nations' (UN) 2004 projections, life expectancy at birth hasdropped by three years since 1990 for the region as a whole;for countries most affected by HIV/AIDS, the drop in life expectancy has been 20 years or more. As shown in the chapters in this volume, HIV is linked to worsening trends in many diseases, for both adults and chil- dren. For example, Madhi and Klugman (chapter 11) statethat as much as 45 percent of hospitalizations and 80 per-cent of deaths due to lower respiratory tract infectionsoccur among HIV-infected children, and strides made in reducing childhood mortality from lower respiratory tractinfections during the 1980s and the early 1990s have beenreversed. In chapter 13, on tuberculosis, Dye and hiscolleagues discuss how people latently infected withMycobacterium tuberculosis are at greater risk of developing active tuberculosis if their immune systems are also weak- ened with HIV infection. Consequently, the tuberculosiscaseload has increased by a factor of five or more in thecountries of eastern and southern Africa most affectedby HIV . Malaria has a two-way relationship with HIV/AIDS. Anemia resulting from malaria increases the risk for HIVinfection through increased use of blood transfusions. Inthe review of malaria (chapter 14), Snow and Omumboreport an odds ratio for HIV infection of 3.5 for malariapatients transfused once, 21.5 for those transfused twice,and 43.0 for those transfused three times during a singleadmission. HIV infection, in turn, increases the risk ofmalaria, which is associated with higher density of para-sitemia and more severe symptoms of malaria in adults. HIV/AIDS not only affects the incidence of communica- ble diseases but is also a risk factor for several noncommu- nicable diseases. As discussed in chapter 10, children withHIV infection are at special risk for developmental disabili-ties. Low birthweight, prematurity, poverty, malnutrition, and micronutrient deficiencies, more frequently seen inHIV-infected children, are likely to compromise early childdevelopment. Maternal-child interaction is also affected; Changing Patterns of Disease and Mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Overview | 34| Florence K. Baingana and Eduard R. Boseven HIV-uninfected children of HIV-infected mothers are at higher risk for cognitive and language delays. Kaposi's sarcoma, now ranked first for male cancers and third for female cancers in the region, is also associated with HIV/AIDS. Prior to the epidemic, this was a rare cancer, butit has increased twentyfold, and in countries with a highprevalence of HIV , Kaposi's sarcoma is the leading cancer in children. As discussed by Mbewu and Mbanya (chapter 21), 30 percent of those living with HIV show evidence of car- diac involvement. Mental health also shows the impact of HIV/AIDS: psychiatric sequelae of HIV/AIDS include depression, anxiety disorders, manic symptoms, and atypi-cal psychosis. Maternal HIV infection compromises the provision of care and undermines global cognitive development even in the uninfected children. HIV-infected infants demonstratelower mental and motor development (Baingana, Thomas,and Comblain 2005). Other effects of HIV on the nervoussystem are discussed in chapter 23. The direct impact of HIV on the incidence of and mor- tality from both communicable and noncommunicable dis-eases is documented in the chapters that follow. HIV/AIDSfurther affects health and mortality because of the social andeconomic consequences of the disease, including a largeincrease in the number of orphans, the burden on healthservices, the impact on human resources for health, and theimpoverishing consequences of the disease. The extraordi-nary impact of HIV/AIDS has created a \"development cri-sis\" that extends far beyond its epidemiological effects. The Socioeconomic Context Growth in GDP per capita in low-income countries in Sub- Saharan Africa has continued to lag behind most otherregions (figure 1.1), and real per capita GDP growth wasnegative for the period 1991 to 2000. Growth acceleratedduring the first few years of the twenty-first century but still lagged behind that of all other regions except Latin Americaand the Caribbean in 2004; the World Bank predicts that itwill remain slow until 2015. In the 1980s, per capita incomeexpressed in purchasing power parity (PPPs, internationaldollars) was higher in Africa than in other low-incomecountries, but it has gradually deteriorated (figure 1.2) and,as of 2004, was well below that of other low-income coun-tries (World Bank 2005c). Although some countries experienced rapid growth, more countries showed declines in real per capita income (expressed in US$) during both the 1980s and 1990s(table 1.1). Growth rates have also been more volatile: of the 45 Sub-Saharan African countries, only 5 consistentlyrecorded real per capita growth rates above 2 percent peryear (Botswana, Cape Verde, Mauritius, the Seychelles, andSwaziland), whereas nearly three-quarters of the countriesexperienced at least one year of per capita growth lower thanminus 10 percent (World Bank 2005a). Closely linked to the low level of economic growth is the lack of progress in reducing poverty. Although most of the world is on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of a 50 percent reduction in the number ofpeople living below $1 per day, poverty has been on theincrease in Sub-Saharan Africa: in 1990, 44.6 percent of the/H1100222 Source: World Bank 2005a.6% per year8 4 0 East Asia and Pacific Europe and Central Asia Latin America and the Caribbean Middle East and North Africa South Asia Sub-Saharan Africa low-income countries middle-income countries region 1991-2000 2001-04 2005-15Figure 1.1 Real GDP per Capita Growth, by Region, 1991-2015 Source: World Bank 2005c.year04,0006,000constant international $7,000 5,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2003 Sub-Saharan Africa other low-income region other mid-income regionFigure 1.2 Real GDP per Capita, by Developing Region, 1980-2003population lived below the $1 per day line; this had increased to 46.4 percent by 2003. There is little doubt that slow economic growth and increasing poverty are related to slow progress in health out- comes. Wagstaff and Claeson (2004) summarized findingson income, coverage of interventions related to health, andhealth outcomes, documenting that higher incomes lead to improved access to and use of preventive and curative inter- ventions, such as antenatal care, immunizations, use oftreated bednets, and receipt of therapy for diarrhea andmedicines for reducing fever. Income is also an important determinant of access to nutritious food, which, in turn, leads to lower levels of malnutrition, a key risk factor formany childhood diseases. While some countries at lower-middle levels of income have achieved good health outcomes, such examples are rare for the countries with the lowest incomes. A basic packageof health interventions would in the case of the poorest low-income Sub-Saharan African countries overwhelm publichealth budgets, and prospects for scaling up public healthservices from domestic resources are unfavorable. The Demographic Context Sub-Saharan Africa is the \"youngest\" of the World Bank regions, as measured by the proportion of the populationbelow age 15 and by the median age of the population.About 44 percent of the population is younger than 15(compared with 28 percent globally), and the median age of the population is just 17.5 years (compared with 27 yearsglobally; figures 1.3, 1.4). In countries such as Uganda andNiger, the proportion below age 15 is close to 50 percent ofthe population. Fertility in Sub-Saharan Africa continues tobe the highest in the world despite some decline in recentyears. From 1990 to 2003 the total fertility rate (TFR)declined somewhat, but it is still higher now than in anyother region in 1990 (figure 1.5). The youthfulness of the population reflects fertility and mortality rates, which in turn have an impact on the epi- demiological characteristics of the population. High fertili-ty and high adult mortality lead to a high proportion ofyoung people, who are much less likely to be vulnerable tochronic diseases that typically affect the adult and elderlypopulations.

At a rate of 2.5 percent, the populationwould double in less than 28 years. However, population growth rates are projected to fall precipitously in countries in which HIV/AIDS has infected a large number of people.World Bank projections for the region as a whole show thepopulation growth rate declining to 2.0 percent during 2000-10, and 1.9 percent during 2010-15. In the most affected countries in southern Africa, World Bank projec-tions show a decline to between 0.2 and 0.5 percent growthper year. Other agencies that have published demographicprojections show an even greater impact of AIDS mortality,leading to population decline by 2010 in some countries.Due to the high mortality of AIDS during the young adultyears, age structures of the affected countries will become characterized by an unusually small number of adults, asshown in the age pyramid for Botswana (figure 1.6). Increasing International Attention to Health in Sub-Saharan Africa In the years since the publication of DMSSA-1, the attention being paid to health conditions in Sub-Saharan Africa has rapidly increased, as evidenced by the number of studies 6| Florence K.

Many reports have either explicitly focused on Africa or have focused on health conditions in poor countries, leading to a strong emphasis on Africa. Among the more prominentrecent studies are the 2001 report Macroeconomics and Health: Investing in Health for Economic Development(Commission on Macroeconomics and Health 2001); the2005 report Our Common Interest (Commission for Africa 2005); and World Bank studies and publications, such asthe 1998 publication Better Health in Africa: Experiences and Lessons Learned, the 2005 report Improving Health, Nutrition, and Population Outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Role of the World Bank, and the Global Monitoring Report 2005: Millennium Development Goals\u2014FromConsensus to Momentum (World Bank 1998, 2005b, 2005a, respectively) . New initiatives and partnerships formed or strengthened during recent years have similarly provided advocacy forincreased attention to diseases of the poor, generally with afocus on Africa. Among these are partnerships that focus onneglected diseases that mostly affect Sub-Saharan Africa,such as guinea worm, trypanosomiasis, onchocerciasis, andschistosomiasis. Other global partnerships have increasedthe availability of pharmaceuticals at lower costs, throughpooled procurement, for diseases such as malaria and tuber-culosis and for vaccine-preventable diseases. Foundationsand funds, such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation orthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis,have made large amounts of new financing available toaddress diseases that disproportionately affect Sub-SaharanAfrica. Traditional donors, such as bilateral development agencies, the World Bank, and regional development banks,have also increased financing for health, and the jointWHO-World Bank High-Level Forum on the Health MDGsis considering new mechanisms to expand the availability of resources to combat communicable diseases . An important influence on priorities for the global health agenda are the MDGs, endorsed by 147 heads of state at theUN Millennium Summit of September 2000. The goalsinclude numerical targets that are to be achieved between1990 and 2015. Of the eight goals, three are directly con-cerned with mortality and morbidity, and six have beenidentified as \"health related\" (box 1.2). The focus of theMDGs on achieving health outcomes has increased the awareness of the lack of progress in Sub-Saharan Africa.Other low- and middle-income regions show progresstoward some of the MDGs (although current trends indi-cate that not a single World Bank region is making suffi-cient progress to reach all of them). Sub-Saharan Africa isnot on track to achieve a single one of the targets. Halfwaythrough the period from 1990 to 2015, not a single Sub-Saharan Africa country is on track for the under-five mor-tality rate target, and only one in four would achieve themalnutrition target on current trends. The increased focuson monitoring of trends has also provided evidence thatmany countries in the region have worse indicators thanthey did 15 years ago. Expanding Data Collection Efforts Efforts to collect more data on health outcomes have inten- sified over the past decade, and as a result DMSSA-2 is more Changing Patterns of Disease and Mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Overview | 7Box 1.2 The Health-Related Millennium Development Goals and Indicators Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger- Target is to cut in half the proportion of people who suffer from hunger between 1990 and 2015.

Goal 4: Reduce child mortality - Target is to reduce the under-five mortality rate by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. Goal 5: Improve maternal health- Target is to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters between 1990 and 2015.Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and otherdiseases- Target is to have halted and begun to reverse the spread of these diseases by 2015.

Household sur- veys, including the Demographic and Health Surveys, the UNICEF Mulitiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, the World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Surveys, and othersurveys conducted by the World Health Organization as wellas by country statistical offices, have vastly increased theavailability and quality of the data. Demographic surveillance sites have joined in an alliance, called the INDEPTH Network, which has published stan-dardized reports on demographic indicators, including a setof life tables. The network, which has grown to include 20 African sites, supports cross-site collaboration, capacity building, and dissemination of the collected data. Anotherarea in which surveillance has greatly improved is HIV sur- veillance in antenatal clinics. Through annual reports of thedata, such surveillance has been used to document the sharpincreases in HIV prevalence among pregnant women insouthern African countries, as well as the decline in HIVprevalence in Uganda. Other areas of improvement over thepast decade include the surveillance and reporting of can-cers, from an increased number of cancer registries, andinjuries, from injury surveillance systems. Advances havealso been achieved in malaria mapping and in the estima-tion of diabetes and lung disease incidence. Nevertheless, the availability of morbidity and mortality data is far from sufficient for monitoring disease outbreaks, the impact of health interventions, or even annual monitor-ing of incidence and prevalence of most diseases. Routinevital registration is still absent in almost all countries (exceptMauritius and the Seychelles), although progress has beenmade in mortality registration in South Africa. One conse-quence of this lack is the general unavailability or reliabilityof the denominators needed to estimate overall mortalityor cause-specific rates. Efforts to expand the coverage ofvital registration beyond urban areas would have substantialpayoffs for improving the quality of epidemiologicalinformation. Human Resources for Health: A Worsening Crisis? Human resources have been described as \"the heart of the health system in any country,\" and \"the most importantaspect of health care systems\" (Hongoro and McPake 2004).The recent study Human Resources for Health: Overcoming the Crisis, by the Joint Learning Initiative (2004), suggests that both the number and the skill levels of health workers in Sub-Saharan Africa are far below what is needed toreduce mortality (table 1.2). The region has 25 percent ofthe world disease burden, but only 1.3 percent of the share of the world's health workforce (Commission for Africa2005). Central to the problem are issues of supply, demand,and mobility (transnational, regional, and local). Theseinclude large differences in remuneration and nonreward-ing work in the low-income countries juxtaposed with agrowing demand for skilled workers, in particular, nurses, inthe high-income countries (Joint Learning Initiative 2004).The problem of low staff numbers is compounded by lowmorale and skills and the maldistribution of staff geograph-ically. Further challenges are the wars and other internalconflicts that adversely affect health infrastructure, services,and personnel retention. The HIV epidemic increases theworkload, and AIDS mortality has reduced the number of health workers. In countries such as Malawi and Zambia, itis estimated that the illness of health workers has increasedfive- to sixfold (Padarath et al. 2003). Conflicts, Refugees, and Internally Displaced People In the years since DMSSA-1 was published, the continent has undergone numerous armed conflicts, including civil wars and genocide. Since 1980, more than 30 wars have plagued Africa. It is estimated that as of the end of 2003, 16 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa had been displacedthrough conflict (WHO 2002). Low-income countries aredisproportionately affected by conflicts. Fifteen countries in the region had a major conflict between 1990 and 2003 (UNICEF 2005). Table 1.3 illustrates the relative globalburden of conflict-related deaths by region. Injuries due to collective violence are concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa. In the last decade, the bulk of lives lost to war injuries in Africa have resulted from conflicts in theDemocratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, and Rwanda. The 8| Florence K. Baingana and Eduard R.

As of October 2004,1.2 million Sudanese had been uprooted from their homes, many killed by militias, and those who found their way into Chad faced disease, poor nutrition, and inadequate shelter.In a typical five-year war, the under-five mortality increasesby 13 percent and adult mortality even more. During the first five years of peace, the average under-five mortality was found to be 11 percent higher than the corresponding levelbefore the war. Sexual violence during conflicts increases thespread of HIV (UNICEF 2005). In Sub-Saharan Africa, for children who survive the first four years of life, injury becomes the most likely cause ofdisability and death. Most intentional injuries are caused by war; it is estimated that 120,000 to 200,000 child soldiers age5 to 16 years are participating in conflicts, putting them atrisk for bullet and shrapnel wounds, burns, and land mineinjuries (UNICEF 2005). Psychosocial and mental disordersresulting from conflicts had affected 15.5 percent of thepopulation in Rwanda five years after the genocide; depres-sion, anxiety, and PTSD can range from 20 to 60 percent inconflict-affected populations (Baingana, Thomas, andComblain 2005). The most dramatic outbreak of a diarrhea epidemic occurred in July 1994 among Rwandan refugees in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo, when almost 50,000refugees died (see chapter 9). Conflicts have also had animpact on immunization rates. From 1990 to 2000 the vac-cination rates for diptheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT) inthe Central African Republic fell from 82 percent to 29 per- cent, and in the Democratic Republic of Congo, from79 percent to 33 percent (see chapter 12). The probability ofsurviving from age 15 to age 60 in 2000 was less than 50 per-cent in almost half of the Sub-Saharan Africa countries, duein part to the conflicts. REFERENCES Baingana, F., R.

At the dawn of the twentieth century, Sub-Saharan Africa was characterized by extremely high under-five mor-tality levels and by low life expectancy at birth. By the end ofthe century, however, mortality among children under five had decreased from about 500 per 1,000 live births to about 150 (World Bank 2005). Similarly, the average length of life,which was less than 30 years about 100 years ago, hadincreased to more than 50 years by the early 1990s. Much ofthe mortality decline happened in the second half of thetwentieth century, the fastest rate of decline occurring in thefirst decades after World War II (Hill 1991). In the 1990s, mortality decline stalled for the region overall, with manycountries experiencing reversals in the upward trend in lifeexpectancy largely because of AIDS mortality. This overview focuses on the period between 1960 and 2005. This period roughly corresponds to the postcolonialera in many countries in the region, in which large economicand social changes occurred. Some of these changes werebeneficial to the health of the population (such as economicgrowth and increasing access to health interventions),whereas others are associated with increasing exposure to risk factors that lead to increased morbidity and mortality(such as increasing exposure to risks for noncommunicablediseases or the spread of new and reemerging communica-ble diseases). Therefore, monitoring mortality levels and trends in the Sub-Saharan region provides not only a directreflection of the health status of populations but also anindirect gauge of the effects of economic, political, and epi-demiological turbulence that faced the region. INDICATORS OF MORTALITY LEVELS AND TRENDS In this overview chapter, two indicators of mortality are used to assess levels and trends for Sub-Saharan Africa, itssubregions, and countries. The infant mortality rate, calcu-lated as the proportion of newborns in a given period thatdo not survive to their first birthday, is a standard measure not affected by age structure and therefore suitable to use forcomparisons over time and across regions. Life expectancyat birth, calculated as the average number of years anewborn would live if subject to the mortality rates for agiven year, is used to compare the force of mortality acrossChapter2 Levels and Trends in Mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Overview Jacob Adetunji and Eduard R. Bosthe entire age spectrum. The dearth of reliable data is one of the main problems confronting the study of mortality levels and trends in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although vital registra- tion systems exist in most countries in the region, they usu-ally do not produce reliable data. In the absence of reliablevital registration systems and good quality census data thatare needed for direct calculation of infant and child mortal- ity rates, demographers have developed indirect methods for obtaining these vital statistics from incomplete and oftendefective data. However, over the past 30 years, informationavailable for the study of mortality patterns, particularly among children under age five, has improved dramatically. The improvement in information is largely due to theimplementation of large-scale household survey programs, such as the World Fertility Surveys (WFS) program of1972-84, the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), andUNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS). Of allthese survey programs, the DHS has had the largest impacton data availability, analysis, and report dissemination.About 70 DHS surveys have been conducted in 33 of the 46major countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Apart from the DHS-type surveys, Sub-Saharan Africa has an extensive network of longitudinal study sites. At least 19 such study sites exist in the region and their data havebeen invaluable in deriving mortality estimates by age as wellas model life tables that show how the age pattern of Africanmortality differs from the model life tables constructed byCoale and Demeny (1983) and United Nations model lifetables (INDEPTH Network 2001). The main problem with this source is that most of these longitudinal study sites arebased in rural settings and are scattered throughout the whole region and therefore provide estimates of unknown generalizability. The locations of the sites are neither system- atically planned to represent the Sub-Saharan Africa regionnor do they adequately represent the countries in which theyare located. In this chapter the estimates for countries and subre- gions are those issued most recently by the United NationsPopulation Division; the estimates are based on a variety ofsources, including surveys, censuses, and demographicmodeling. The delineation of geographic subregions usedare those defined by the United Nations. MORTALITY LEVELS AND TRENDS The following section will provide a comparison of indica- tors of mortality trends discussed above, first comparingtrends in life expectancy and infant mortality in Sub-SaharanAfrica and other regions, followed by a comparison of these mortality indicators for subregions within Sub-SaharanAfrica. Sub-Saharan Africa Relative to Other, Less Developed Regions Sub-Saharan Africa is, by far, the region of the world with the highest level of mortality. Overall life expectancy at birthis 46 years, whereas in Asia, the region with the secondlowest life expectancy, it is 67. As shown in table 2.1, the disparity between Sub-Saharan Africa and other regions of the world has widened since the 1960s. In that decade the difference in life expectancy withthe Asian region was only 6 years, but this has grown toalmost 21 years now. And, whereas all other regions haveexperienced uninterrupted increases in life expectancy, inSub-Saharan Africa life expectancy peaked in the early 1990sat 50 years, and has since fallen back by almost 4 years. Declines in infant mortality rates in Sub-Saharan Africa started to slow down considerably in the 1990s. These slow declines have meant that Sub-Saharan Africa has laggedmore and more behind other regions and hence the mortal-ity gap has widened (table 2.2). Subregional Differences in Mortality In Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, infant mortality rates declined from 149 per 1,000 live births in the 1960s to about101 in 2005\u2014a 32 percent decline over a period of 35 years.T oward the end of the last decade of the twentieth century,the decline in infant mortality rates leveled off, decreasing only slightly for the region as a whole. 12| Jacob Adetunji and America and Caribbean Northern America Source: United Nations 2005. Table 2.1 Life Expectancy at Birth for World and UN Regions, 1960-2005In regard to subregional disparities, infant mortality rates are highest in West Africa and in Middle Africa and have consistently been so from 1960 (table 2.3). The infant mor- tality rate declined somewhat faster in West Africa, and as aresult, Middle Africa is currently the subregion with the highest rate. Of all subregions of Sub-Saharan Africa, coun-tries in Southern Africa have had the lowest infant mortalityrates. For example, in 1960 the rate was 42 percent lowerthan in other subregions, and even with increasing overallmortality in the 1990s, the infant mortality rate in SouthernAfrica was still less than half the average for Sub-SaharanAfrica in 2000. Life expectancy at birth has increased 3.5 years for the continent as a whole since 1960, but it is now lower in Southern Africa than in the 1960s (table 2.4). All the subre-gions reached peak levels of life expectancy about 1990, butthey have since shown a decline, largely due to AIDS mor-tality. Nowhere has the decrease in life expectancy beensteeper and greater than in Southern Africa, where 40 yearsof increases in life expectancy were reversed in a period of10 years.Country Differences in Mortality Figure 2.1 illustrates the differences in the levels and trends in the infant mortality rate in selected Sub-Saharan Africacountries. The rates vary from 15 in Mauritius, to 165 inSierra Leone, and the rates of change from 1960 to the pres-ent differ from about 20 percent in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone to over 50 per- cent in countries in Southern Africa. It is noteworthy,however, that infant mortality has declined in all countriessince 1960. Figure 2.2 shows country patterns in life expectancy at birth. The range in current levels is about 35 years, from ahigh of 72 in Mauritius to a low of 37 in Zimbabwe andZambia. Recent trends are clearly negative in many coun-tries, where increases in adult mortality resulting from AIDS have led to a decline in overall life expectancy. Most of thesecountries experienced the highest life expectancies during1985 to 1990 and have since declined to below the levelsin 1960.

Reductionof the under-five mortality rate (U5MR) by two-thirdsbetween 1990 and 2015, equivalent to an annual average rate of reduction of 4.3 percent, is one of the six health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Data indicatethat some 11 million children under the age of five dieannually in the world as a whole, and more than 10 millionof these deaths occur in the developing world. Sub-SaharanAfrica is the region most affected and accounts for morethan one-third of deaths of children under the age of five (Hill et al. 1999). Some two-thirds of the child deaths in thedeveloping world are caused by diseases (predominantlyacute respiratory infections, diarrhea, and malaria) forwhich practical, low-cost interventions, including immu-nization, oral rehydration therapy (ORT), and antibiotics,exist (Jones et al. 2003). The quality and quantity of data on child mortality have increased dramatically over the last 30 years, particularly inSub-Saharan Africa. However, the quantity, timeliness, and quality of available information vary widely by country.Figure 3.1 contrasts the data availability for the Republic ofCongo and Kenya. The only information available forthe Republic of Congo is a set of indirect estimates derived from data collected by the 1974 census, effectively coveringonly the period 1960 to 1970. Kenya, in contrast, has esti-mates from several censuses, a World Fertility Survey(WFS), a National Demographic Survey (NDS), and three Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs). For the Republicof Congo, there exists no possibility of consistency checks, and there has been no empirical basis for estimating childmortality since about 1970. For Kenya, however, the differ-ent data sources provide a large number of estimates, not all of which are mutually consistent, for overlapping time peri-ods and a considerable density of observations covering theearly 1960s to the late 1990s. The multiplicity and in some cases inconsistency of U5MR estimates from different sources has made the deter-mination of national trends problematic. Hill and Y azbeck(1994), and subsequently Hill and colleagues (1999), devel-oped and applied an explicit, objective, and replicableChapter3 Trends in Child Mortality, 1960 to 2000 Kenneth Hill and Agbessi Amouzou methodology to derive a single consistent time series of esti- mates for infant and under-five mortality from the assem-bled data. In this chapter, the estimates by Hill and colleagues (1999) for countries of Sub-Saharan African are updated. Country data that have become available since that study areadded in order to provide more complete informationabout levels and trends of under-five mortality since 1990. DATA SOURCES AND METHODS In countries with accurate registers of births and deaths, infant mortality year by year is measured by the infant mor-tality rate (IMR), the ratio of deaths of infants under oneyear to births in the same year obtained from civil registra- tion data. The mortality of children after infancy is typicallyobtained from civil registration information on deaths ofyoung children by age and from population census infor-mation on the size of the population of those ages exposedto the risk of dying. 1Thus, civil registration data provide all the information needed to measure infant mortality, which can therefore be readily calculated annually, but measure- ment of mortality after infancy requires additional informa- tion on population sizes. In countries where the registration of vital events is not complete, the registration of infant deaths is often less com-plete than the registration of births, with the result that theregistered IMR underestimates the true value. In thesecountries, estimates of infant and under-five mortality aretypically obtained instead from one or more of three typesof survey data. Most similar to registration data is thatobtained from the longitudinal or prospective samplesurvey. A sample of the national population is followed over a period of time, with all vital events being recorded. Suchdata provide the basis for calculating the conventional IMRas the ratio of infant deaths to births, and also provide thebasis for calculating mortality rates after infancy, sincepopulation numbers are also available. Such surveys havenot been widely used, partly because they are expensive tomount, and partly because they require careful supervisionover an extended period to provide good data on trends. The second data source is a retrospective sample survey that collects full birth histories. Each mother is asked for information on the date of birth and, if relevant, the age atdeath of every live-born child she has had. In the 1970s andearly 1980s the WFS program, and more recently the DHSproject, collected such data in many developing countries.Both IMRs and U5MRs for periods up to 15 years before thesurvey can be calculated from the data, dividing deaths forgiven ages and time periods by exposure to risk (expressedas person-years of life lived) of the reported children(Somoza 1980). However, the collection of such informa-tion by surveys is complex and requires high levels of inter-viewer quality and training. The surveys are therefore quiteexpensive and can cover only relatively small samples. The third data source is a retrospective survey that col- lects summary birth histories. Each woman surveyed isasked for very simple information: her age, the total numberof children she has borne, and the number of those childrenthat have died; in short, a summary birth history with noinformation about individual children. For a particular agegroup of women, the proportion of children dead depends 16| Kenneth Hill and Agbessi Amouzoua.

William Brass (1964) first developed a method for deriving estimates of child mortality from suchdata. The Brass method and developments of it (Sullivan1972; Trussell 1975; United Nations 1983) adjust the pro-portions of children dead by age group of mother for an estimated exposure distribution in order to arrive at pure measures of under-five mortality and of reference dates forthese measures. The adjustment process assumes certainpatterns of fertility and under-five mortality by age, and results can be quite sensitive to the choices made. The methodology is better suited to estimating under-five mor-tality than infant mortality (Hill 1991). Hill and colleagues (1999) reviewed more completely methods for measuring under-five mortality in countries lacking accurate vital registration data, and Hill (1991)reviewed their various advantages and disadvantages. Data Used The basic data used in this chapter are observations of U5MR derived from full or summary birth histories. Asummary birth history provides seven observations ofU5MR, one for each five-year age group of mothersbetween ages 15 and 49. A full birth history typically pro- vides three observations of U5MR, for the periods 0 to 4, 5to 9, and 10 to 14 years before the survey, although obser-vations are sometimes also calculated for the periods 15 to19 and 20 to 24 years before the survey. The observationsused are the same as those used by Hill and colleagues(1999), updated with observations that have become avail-able more recently. Observations for time periods since the early 1990s come primarily from DHS surveys conducted since 1995 and from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) conducted in2000. A DHS is a nationally representative survey; such sur-veys have been conducted in many developing countries,and an increasing number of countries have conductedmore than one survey. A typical DHS survey records fullbirth histories of women of reproductive age (15 to 49)along with the survival status of each child ever born tothem. Thus, DHS data provide a basis for both direct andindirect estimation of child and infant mortality. The surveyreports tabulate direct estimates for at least the three five-year periods preceding the survey. In this chapter we have also used the birth history data as a basis for indirect esti-mation using the Manual X version of the Brass techniqueof estimation of child mortality from information on chil- dren ever born and children surviving (see United Nations1983). The MICS surveys are also nationally representativesurveys, conducted by UNICEF in many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Most MICS surveys record only summarybirth histories for each woman of reproductive age, thusallowing only indirect estimation of infant and child mor-tality. Only one country in the region\u2014South Africa\u2014isthought to have vital registration data that are completeenough to provide valid estimates of the IMR (Rob Dorrington, personal communication 2004). These esti-mates are not used here, since there is no satisfactory way ofknowing at what point in the recent past the infant mortal-ity information became complete. Nine of the Sub-Saharan African countries that Hill and colleagues (1999) included in their study have no informa-tion on child mortality more recent than that alreadyanalyzed. Seven countries\u2014Angola, Comoros, Gabon,Guinea-Bissau, Somalia, S\u00e3o T om\u00e9 and Principe, and South Africa\u2014that they did not include are in the present analysis.The database they used has been updated with direct orindirect estimates of infant and child mortality based onrecent data for 27 countries. Some small countries\u2014CapeVerde, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Mauritius, R\u00e9union,and the Seychelles\u2014are not included because they did not have appropriate data or were not regarded as being repre- sentative of Sub-Saharan Africa. In sum, a total of 153 datasets covering 42 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa are includedin this analysis. Methodology for Estimation of Trends The methodology adopted in this chapter is that used by Hill and colleagues (1999; see appendix 3A for a detaileddescription). The chapter focuses primarily on under-fivemortality; all the observations used come from full or sum-mary birth history data collected by censuses or surveys, and it is argued that such methods of data collection providebetter estimates of U5MR than of IMR. For each country,many observations with a range of time reference dates areavailable. These observations are not typically mutually con-sistent, so some approach is needed to obtain a set of esti-mates from the various observations. In our approach, aregression model is fitted to the observations of U5MR byreference date. The model assumes that at the country levelthe rate of change of U5MR is constant over defined time periods, the time periods themselves being determined bythe number of observations available. Thus, a country with Trends in Child Mortality, 1960 to 2000 | 17a large number of observations can have a more flexible time trend of U5MR than a country with few observations. Estimates of U5MR are then derived from the model for specified time points from 1960 to 2000. It is these estimatesthat are described below. The appendix shows countryexamples of observations and the time trends fitted to them. RESULTS The U5MR is widely recognized as an important indicator of development. In high-mortality settings, it is preferable tothe IMR as a single index because the U5MR captures the substantial mortality risk after 12 months of age (Hill 1995). Consequently, this section focuses on changes in U5MRderived from the country-specific analyses undertaken inthis chapter, rather than on changes in the IMR. However, for completeness we do present country estimates of the lev- els of infant mortality in 2000, but it must be emphasizedthat these estimates are derived from the U5MR estimatesusing the Coale-Demeny model life table system IMR, five-year time points from 1960 to 2000. Table 3B.1 also shows the number of censuses or surveys for each countryon which the estimates are based, and gives a subjectiveassessment of the quality of the estimates, based on theirconsistency. Figure 3B.1 provides graphs of available esti-mates plotted against time for one example country in eachcategory. Levels and rates of change in U5MR over the 40 years from 1960 to 2000, estimated using the methodologydescribed above, are summarized here in the form of boxplots 2for major regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, and for Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. The United Nations (UN) definitions of regions\u2014Middle, Eastern, Southern, and Western\u2014are used (see tables 3B.1 and 3B.2 for countries included in each region). The model in equation 3.1 is used to estimate U5MR lev- els for the mid-point of years ending in 0 or 5. ln(5q0)i/H11005b0/H11001b1(date)i/H11001b2(postk 1)i /H11001b3(postk 2)i/H11001b4(postk 3)i/H11001.../H11001/H9255i(3.1) Change is then measured between estimated values over five-year periods, 1960-65, 1965-70, and so on.

Note that in this section, the unit of analysis is the coun- try, not the child. A country will appear in the analysis for a particular time point only if the U5MR is supported by an observation within two years of that time point. Thuscountry-time point estimates are selected for data availabil-ity, so that, for example, the countries contributing toestimates for 1990 will not be the same as the countries con-tributing to estimates for 1995. Any association between lev-els and rates of change of U5MR on the one hand and dataavailability on the other may cause a bias. Estimated Level of U5MR and IMR in 2000 Estimated levels of U5MR and IMR in 2000 are shown in figure 3.2. The U5MR ranges from 47 per 1,000 births (SouthAfrica) to 314 per 1,000 (Sierra Leone); the median is 153 per1,000.

The comparable figure for the developing world as a whole is less than 100 per 1,000, and for the more developed world, less than 10 per 1,000. The interquartile range is from 124 to 217, indicatingcontinuing high child mortality in the majority of countriescovered. Infant deaths account for almost two-thirds ofunder-five deaths. The median IMR is 101 per 1,000 with an interquartile range from 80 to 133 per 1,000. There is considerable variability in the level of U5MR and IMR by region. The Middle and Western Africa regions have the highest median level of U5MR at 174 per 1,000 live births, followed by the Eastern region with a median of 168 per 1,000. The Southern region exhibits a comparatively lowrate of U5MR of 58 per 1,000. The Western region has the highest level of IMR (a median of 117 per 1,000), followedby the Middle and the Eastern, which have similar rates(medians of 105 per 1,000). The Southern region has thelowest level of IMR (a median of 46 per 1,000). The Westernregion has the highest variability between countries ininfant and under-five mortality, and the Southern regionhas the lowest. Trends in U5MR Figure 3.3 presents levels of U5MR at time points separated by five years, from 1960 to 2000. For Sub-Saharan Africa asa whole, U5MR declined from 1960 to 2000. However, most of the decline took place between 1965 and 1990, during which period the median U5MR dropped from 232 to 165 per 1,000. Since 1990 the downward trend has stalled. Thisoverall trend also characterizes each region, although at dif-ferent levels and speeds. The countries of the Western regionhad the highest U5MR in 1960, with a median value ofabout 291 per 1,000 live births. This level fell below 183 per1,000 by 1990. The Middle region had a median rate of 268per 1,000 in 1960 and experienced a decline to 164 per 1,000in 1990. The median in the Eastern region oscillated around 200 per 1,000 prior to 1975 before declining to 170 per 1,000 in 1990. The Southern region had the lowest median U5MR in 1960 (about 200 per 1,000) and experienced the sharpestdecline, to about 70 per 1,000 by 1990. The Western andSouthern regions thus experienced the fastest declines from1960 to 1990, with the countries of the Middle and Easternregions showing the slowest improvement. Declines appearto have stalled in all regions in the 1990s. Figure 3.4 summarizes the annual rates of change in U5MR over five-year periods. For Sub-Saharan Africa as awhole, rates of decline averaged about 1 percent in the1960s, increasing to close to 2 percent between 1970 and 1985, dropping back to about 1 percent between 1985 and1990, and averaging less than 1 percent during the 1990s.These rates of decline are much below the average annual Trends in Child Mortality, 1960 to 2000 | 19Source: Table 3B.1.

Indeed, between 1960 and 2000, themedian rate of decline in U5MR approached the required rate of decline in only one region (Southern) for only one five-year period. Also, these rates of decline average onlyabout half those of the developing world as a whole. The rel-atively poor performance of Sub-Saharan Africa in the 1990s is underlined by the observation that a large number of countries, especially in the Middle, Eastern, and Southernregions, have a positive rate of change in the 1990s, indicat-ing increasing U5MRs. In the Middle Africa region, the esti-mates indicate increases in U5MR for Cameroon and Chadand a stall in the Democratic Republic of Congo (see thecountry-specific estimates in table 3B.1). In the Eastern Africa region, the rise or stall is observed in Burundi, Kenya,Rwanda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. In the Southern region,Botswana and Swaziland are adversely affected, whereas inthe Western region, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Mauritania,and Sierra Leone show increases. All these countries haveone or more things in common: they are seriously affectedby the human immunodeficiency virus and acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic orhave suffered an economic crisis or political instability thatcreated a civil war. It is likely that these factors have played amajor role in the poor health performance observed in these countries and in Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. Age Patterns of Under-Five Mortality Birth histories, such as those collected by the DHSs, provide information not only about childhood mortality levelsbut also about the age pattern of that mortality. The birth history data can be used to calculate the probability of dyingin the first year of life (the IMR) and the probability ofdying between exact ages one and five (the child mortalityrate, or CHMR). Long data series for the developed worldindicate that as under-five mortality declines, CHMRtends to decline faster than IMR, leading to an increasedconcentration of mortality risk in the first year of life(Hill 1991). The historical experience of the developedworld also shows substantial variation in the relationshipbetween IMR and CHMR between populations (Coale andDemeny 1983). Figure 3.5 plots recorded CHMR against recorded IMR for each DHS survey included in this analysis for three 20| Kenneth Hill and Agbessi AmouzouMiddle Source: Table 3B.1.

Inspection of an early version of this figure using different symbols for observations from countries for five differentregions of Sub-Saharan Africa (Eastern, Southern, Middle,Western Coast, and the western Sahel, using UN definitionsof regions except for the additional breakdown of Western Africa into coastal and Sahelian countries) suggested no clear differences of pattern for the countries of Eastern,Southern, and Middle Africa, but possibly different pat-terns for the Western Coast and the western Sahel. Different symbols are therefore used to identify points in figure 3.5 for the Western Coast, the western Sahel, and theother areas. Although there is a considerable amount of scatter, countries of the western Sahel appear in general tohave higher CHMR relative to IMR than other countries,but the differences appear to decline as IMR drops. WesternCoast countries appear to have broadly similar patternsto the countries of the Eastern, Middle, and Southernregions at lower levels of IMR, but lower CHMR at higherlevels of IMR. T o explore differences in age patterns more fully, the nat- ural log of CHMR was regressed on the IMR for each of three groups of countries: Eastern, Middle, and Southern asone group, Western Coast as another, and western Sahel asthe third. Predicted values of CHMR for each group forgiven values of IMR were obtained. 3Figure 3.6 shows the summarized age patterns of under-five mortality for the three groups.As can be seen, the broad pattern of the relationship between CHMR and IMR is similar for populations of Eastern, Middle, and Southern Africa on the one hand andthe populations of Sahelian West Africa on the other, exceptthat for a given level of IMR the CHMR in the former groupof countries is about 30 per 1,000 lower than in the lattergroup. The Western Coast, however, appears to have a verydifferent pattern, with lower CHMR at higher levels of IMRand higher CHMR at lower levels of IMR than the otherareas. A final model was estimated relating the log of CHMR to IMR using dummy variables to identify populations of coastal Western Africa and of the western Sahel, plus adummy variable to identify estimates with a reference peri-od of 1990 or earlier and a dummy variable to identify esti- mates for the period 0 to 4 years before a survey (as opposedto 5 to 9 or 10 to 14 years before a survey). The fitted modelis as follows: earlier) /H110010.1167(0-4 years before survey) (3.4) As expected from the previous analysis, the Western Coast and western Sahel dummy variables are positive and highly significant. The dummy variables for estimates with areference date of 1990 or earlier and for the period 0 to 4years before the survey are also both positive and significant,although only at a 5 percent level. That the reference datevariable is positive implies that, controlling for region and level of IMR, mortality risks between ages one and five fellfaster in Sub-Saharan Africa in the 1990s than previously,perhaps because of successful measles vaccination pro-grams. It is puzzling that the coefficient for the dummy vari-able identifying estimates for the five years immediatelybefore the survey is positive. Two errors thought to affectbirth histories are a tendency to round age at death up fromunder one year to \"one year,\" thus tending to inflate CHMR at the expense of IMR, and a tendency to differentially omitdeaths of very young children, thus tending to reduce IMRbut without any effect on CHMR. Our prior expectationwas that both these errors would be more prevalent the fur-ther before the survey of the event being reported, thustending to increase CHMR relative to IMR for time periods5 to 9 or 10 to 14 years before the survey more than in thetime period 0 to 4 years before the survey. The data suggestthe opposite, but we have no ready explanation for why thatmight be so.

This exercise reveals that Sub-Saharan Africa has performed rather poorly in terms ofchild mortality reduction over the period. The averageannual decline in U5MR of less than 2 percent per year isonly about half the average for the developing world overalland less than half the rate needed to meet MDGs. The medi-an U5MR for Sub-Saharan Africa in the year 2000 alsoexceeded the developing world median by a substantial mar-gin. The countries of Sub-Saharan Africa have performedunevenly over the period in reducing infant and child mor- tality, both by region and by time period. About 1960, coun-tries of Western Africa had high U5MR, on average close to300 per 1,000 children; countries of Eastern and SouthernAfrica had somewhat lower risk, on average close to 200 per1,000; and the countries of Middle Africa had an intermedi-ate risk, on average about 250 per 1,000. Since 1960, thecountries of Western and Southern Africa appear to haveachieved the most rapid declines in U5MR, and across allregions the period between 1975 and 1985 appears to haveseen the fastest improvements. Rates of decline were lowerprior to 1975 and have slowed practically to zero since 1990,and a quarter of all countries actually experienced increases. The populations of Sub-Saharan Africa have experienced changes in many areas other than child survival since 1960.There have been improvements in literacy and formaleducation, fluctuating but generally rising standards of liv-ing, rapid population growth and urbanization, widespreadpolitical instability and civil strife, and since the mid-1980sthe devastating HIV/AIDS epidemic. Further analysis isrequired to understand better how all these other changeshave affected child mortality, why Sub-Saharan Africa hasperformed worse than other developing regions in reducinginfant and child mortality, why the period 1975 to 1985 wasthe period of most rapid improvement, and why the U5MRdecline has stalled since 1990. The period of most rapidimprovement, between 1975 and 1985, occurred in a periodduring which a number of low-cost interventions (oralrehydration therapy, vaccines) were developed and distrib-uted widely with the support of international agencies andaid programs. The poor performance in the 1990s has coin-cided with rapid expansion of the HIV epidemic, whichhas almost certainly been a factor in the child mortalityincreases, along with a \"loss of focus\" (Jones et al. 2003) on the part of international agencies. A handful of inexpensive interventions of demonstrated effectiveness could have, with universal coverage, prevented well over half the 4.4 million deaths of children under age five estimated to have occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa in2000 (Jones et al. 2003). Efforts to reduce the U5MRthrough the widespread use of these inexpensive interven-tions may have been responsible for the rapid declines seenbetween 1975 and 1985 in Sub-Saharan Africa and thedeveloping world more broadly. Renewed emphasis on thesesame interventions, with a small number of recent addi-tions, such as micronutrient supplementation, can still havea major impact today. APPENDIX 3A: METHODOLOGY AND DETAIL RESULTS There are many ways in which a set of estimates can be obtained from a series of observations and in which extrap-olations forward or backward to any desired time point can be made. The simplest procedure is hand smoothing: draw- ing a freehand curve through a set of observations andextending its general trend onward to some specified timepoint for which an estimate or projection is required. Such a procedure is unlikely to be objective\u2014different analysts would almost inevitably draw different lines, particularly forextrapolations beyond the earliest or latest observations. Analternative would be to use hand smoothing for the periodcovered by observations and then apply a model to extrapo-late; this is essentially what was done in both the UnitedNations (1988, 1992) reports on under-five mortality in the developing world. With this method, the hand smoothing isstill subjective, and it is hard to specify the extrapolationmodel satisfactorily. Regression analysis offers a set of possible approaches: robust regression, locally weighted least squares, weighted least squares, or ordinary least squares. Such regression tech-niques offer a greater degree of objectivity than handsmoothing but still require the choice of model specifica-tion. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages.Ordinary least squares makes few assumptions about thenature of errors, but the results are heavily influenced byoutliers. Robust regression essentially underweights outly-ing observations that have an inordinate influence on thefitted line, but no prior information about the likely accu-racy of particular types of observation is used. Locally 22| Kenneth Hill and Agbessi Amouzouweighted least squares fits a nonparametric trend to a set of observations, but provides no basis for extrapolation.Weighted least squares requires the use of predetermined weights, introducing a subjective element into the analysis but at the same time allowing the incorporation of priorknowledge about the likely accuracy of different methods ofmeasurement. Weighted Least Squares with Linear Splines The approach adopted here is that used by Hill and col- leagues (1999). A regression line is fitted to the relationshipbetween IMRs or U5MRs and their reference dates using weighted least squares. The basic model assumes that the rateat which infant or under-five mortality changes is linear in time, that is, that mortality risk changes at a constant annual percentage rate over some defined time period. Thedependent variable is the logarithm of either the IMR orthe U5MR. The independent variables used are date vari-ables. The simplest model relates the logarithm of each esti-mate of the risk of dying to the date of the estimates; thismodel implies a constant rate of change in mortality overthe entire period studied. Figure 3A.1a shows a hypotheticalexample of such a simple model for under-five mortality. More complex models can allow the rate of change of mor-tality to vary over the period; figure 3A.1b is an example ofwhere the relationship between the U5MR and time isallowed to change two times, reflecting two \"knot\" points(defined every time a sum of weights reaches five, asexplained below). Clear changes in trend are indicated inthis instance. Linear Splines and \"Knots\" The model used in this chapter allows the rate of change of infant or under-five mortality to vary according to the num-ber of independent observations available. At the countrylevel, U5MR is modeled using linear splines, whereby therate of change in U5MR over time is assumed to be constant for some period, but then is allowed to change at some timepoint or \"knot.\" This model, shown as equation 3A.1, relatesthe log of U5MR (by using logs the rate of change is heldconstant) to a date variable and additional variables meas-uring time since a series of knot dates. The number andlocation of these knot dates are determined by the numberand location in time of observations available for a particu-lar country. Knots are defined working backward in timefrom the most recent observation. Observations of particulartypes (for example, an observation derived from a full birth history for the period zero to four years before the survey)are assigned weights reflecting a priori judgments of theirlikely validity. The weights for successive observations aresummed, and a knot is defined every time the sum ofweights reaches a multiple of five. This definition of a knotis based on the idea that five years of vital registration, or one set of indirect or direct estimates such as one DHS, are sufficient to define one trend or slope. The weights assignedto five years of vital registration, or to one set of direct orindirect estimates, sum to five. Thus, the process of allowinga knot to be defined when weights sum to five means, ineffect, that each DHS, WFS, or other such survey, and eachfive-year period of vital registration defines a particularslope. The only exception to this procedure is for the last knot defined (the earliest knot in time). For this last knot, the remaining weights must sum to at least five to ensure that Trends in Child Mortality, 1960 to 2000 | 23a.

The more acceptable observa-tions there are for a particular country, the more knots therewill be and the more flexible the trend in infant or under-five mortality over time will be. The underlying model used is ln( nq0)i/H11005b0/H11001b1(date)i/H11001b2(postk 1)i/H11001b3(postk 2)i /H11001b4(postk 3)i/H11001.../H11001ei simply the calendar year; postk 1 is date minus the date of the earliest defined knot if positive, or zero otherwise, and picks up any change in trend after the first knot (recall that the knots are defined from the presentbackward into the past, but the earliest knot is defined to ensure at least five observations between it and the start of the series); postk 2 is date minus the date of the second defined knot if positive, or zero otherwise, and picks up anychange in trend after the second knot; and so on. Thus, thenumber of slope-changing time variables varies with thenumber and weight of the observations over time. The coef- ficients on postk 1, postk 2, and so on, can be interpreted as changes in the rate of change of infant or under-five mor- tality with time in that particular period. Thus, the rate ofchange in period 1 is b 1; in period 2, ( b1/H11001b2); in period 3, (b1/H11001b2/H11001b3); and so on. Referring back to figure 3.1, only a single date variable with no slope-changing variables would be used to fit a trend in U5MR for the Republic ofCongo, since the data weights only sum to five. For Kenya,the date variable and seven slope-changing variables would be used, since the data weights sum to 42.5 (figure 3.1b). It should be noted that the error term e iis assumed to be normally distributed around the logarithm of the mortality indicator. As a result, estimates of mortality obtained byexponentiating an estimated value of the logarithm of themortality indicator will be biased upward by an amount that will depend on the goodness of fit of the model. This is a rel-atively benign bias in the sense that the infant or under-fivemortality estimates obtained will tend to be on the high side,and the poorer the fit of the model the more on the high sidethe estimates will be. Weights Weighted least squares regression is used to fit equation 3A.1 to each country's data. Weighted least squares is used becausea substantial body of evidence suggests different validityweights for different types of observations. For example,it is generally thought that the quality of retrospectivelyreported information deteriorates with the length of time elapsed since the events (Som 1973). Each estimate from vital registration or a prospective sur- vey is given a \"standard\" validity weight of 1.0. For vital regi- stration, the weight is justified by the typically large numberof events involved and by the lack of any substantial lagbetween event and report; for prospective surveys, theweight is justified by the lack of lag and by the accuracyenforced by the data collection methodology. Estimatesderived from birth histories are assigned standard weights that vary with the length of time before the survey to which the estimate refers, on the grounds that recent informationis more likely to be more accurate than information for peri-ods further in the past. Specifically, estimates for the 5 yearsbefore the survey are given a weight of 2.0; for periods 5 to9 years before the survey, 1.8; and for periods 10 to 14 yearsbefore the survey, 1.2. Weights for indirect estimates based on the proportions dead of children ever born vary by the age group of the mother; estimates based on reports of young women are given low weight\u2014zero for women age 15 to 19 and 0.2 forwomen age 20 to 24\u2014because of the well-known selectionproblems that affect such estimates (early childbearing isoften highest among the poor, who also suffer the highestU5MRs). Estimates based on reports of women in the agegroups 25 to 29, 30 to 34, and 35 to 39 are given the highestweights, 1.2 each. Then, as age increases the weights declineslowly, on the grounds that information about events longerago is more prone to error, such that estimates for the agegroup 40 to 44 get a weight of 0.8, and those for the age group45 to 49 get a weight of 0.4. Note that it is these weights that are summed to deter- mine the location of knots described earlier. The under-five mortality estimates from a particular survey collecting birthhistories have a combined weight of five, as do the estimatesfrom a particular survey providing indirect measures. Incases in which a particular survey contributes two types ofestimates (for example, a DHS survey that provides bothdirect estimates from the birth history and indirect esti-mates from children ever born and children surviving),the two sets of weights are reduced to half their standard level, so that the data source is not overly weighted. Theobservation-specific weights described earlier are essentiallybased on the authors' judgment and experience. However,robust regression techniques can be used to estimate robustweights for particular types of observations; these estimatedrobust weights can then be compared with the observation- specific weights. 4 24| Kenneth Hill and Agbessi AmouzouApplying the Methodology The intention of the methodology is to provide a transpar- ent and largely objective way of fitting a smoothed trend toa set of observations and of extrapolating the trend to coverthe period from 1960 to the present. However, subjectivejudgments are involved at every step. In step 1 of the smoothing and extrapolation process, the regression model in equation 3A.1 is fitted to observations of U5MR using appropriate date variables and standardvalidity weights as defined above. Results from step 1depend on the standard validity weights applied to differenttypes of data. The standard validity weights are objective inthe sense that they are invariant across data sets or acrosscountries, but they are subjective in the sense that differentanalysts would choose different values. In step 2, results from step 1 are critically examined and data sets that are clearly aberrant are identified, such as indi- rect estimates that are clearly inconsistent with the majorityof other sources. The weights for the entire aberrant data setare reduced by a constant factor that is generally zero (givingno weight to estimates from that data set). Step 1 is thenrepeated using these revised weights. This second step involves subjective choices as well. Most important is the decision as to whether to underweight entire data sets and, if so, by how much. The decision tounderweight some data sets relative to others can have a large effect on the sequence of under-five mortality estimatesobtained. In the process followed in this chapter, this deci- sion is made on the basis of graphical inspection. If the esti-mates from one source are clearly higher or lower than the bulk of available estimates or if their time trend is clearly different, a constant factor of zero (giving zero weight to the entire data set) might be used. If the estimates fluctuate a lot or display some other undesirable characteristic a constantfactor between zero and one might be used, thus reducingthe standard weight for the entire data set. It is this decision that is most likely to introduce substantial differences inresults between analysts. In the analysis reported here, it isassumed that errors are more likely to result in underesti-mates of under-five mortality than in overestimates. Thus,when two data sets indicate very different levels, other things being equal, the set indicating higher mortality is assumedmore likely to be right.

Countries are categorized into fourgroups depending on the number of surveys available and the consistency of the under-five mortality estimates obtained from those surveys.

Theoretically, in a population with perfect registration of vital events and no migration, the mortality of children after infancy could also be measured purely from civil registration data. However, in practice, regis- tration is not perfect, and migration is not negligible, so mortality in child-hood is calculated from deaths from civil registration data and from expo-sure to risk according to a census or population estimate. 2.

A lack of empirical data about the lev-els of mortality experienced by adults in this region has fueled this neglect, combined with the focus on maternal and child health, which has the highest incidence of diseaseand subsequent mortality. This picture is changing. Thehigh mortality of adults in the African region is now being recognized more widely, and a response has begun to emerge, particularly with regard to the impact of the AIDSepidemic and high mortality due to malaria. The Global Burden of Disease studies of 1990 and 2000 estimate that Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest burden of disease in the world (Murray and Lopez 1996; WHO 2000).These and related studies have revealed high levels of adult mortality resulting from the multiple burdens of diseaseexperienced by the populations in the region (Murray, Y ang,and Qiao 1992). The studies show that fast-growing epi-demics of human immunodeficiency virus and acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and certainnoncommunicable diseases coexist with the conditionsrelated to underdevelopment, such as malaria, malnutrition, and tuberculosis. In addition, they highlight the increasingroad traffic injury burden and the less predictable toll ofmortality due to war and violence. Health sector reforms have swept the continent during the last 20 years and given primary health care priority in attempts to provide accessible health care to rural commu-nities and contain costs. However, the strategies of primaryhealth care have focused largely on maternal and childhealth and the provision of acute care. These strategies haveyet to overcome the challenges posed by the health needs ofadults, such as the management of chronic conditions and, more recently, the provision of treatment for AIDS. Theimperative of these challenges has been obscured by the lack of good data on the levels of adult mortality and its trendsand causes. Although childhood and maternal mortalityonce faced the same problem, survey-based techniques,including indirect methods of estimation and the wide-spread collection of birth histories, have improved the situ-ation in this regard.Chapter4 Levels and Trends of Adult Mortality Debbie Bradshaw and Ian M. TimaeusSOURCES OF DATA Vital registration systems are the ideal source of data with which to monitor mortality levels and trends. However, thestatistics systems of most Sub-Saharan Africa countries con-tinue to be underdeveloped; few countries are able to pro-vide adequate vital statistics. In 2001 the World Health Organization (WHO) contacted all member states in Sub-Saharan Africa to try to obtain death statistics for a globalassessment of the burden of disease (Kowal, Rao, andMathers 2003). Just 9 out of 46 member states provided suchdata. Furthermore, coverage of registration was less than60 percent in most of these 9 countries, with only Mauritiusand the Seychelles providing vital registration data that weremore than 90 percent complete. These two island statesmake up a tiny fraction of the population of Sub-Saharan Africa. Adequate vital statistics are far more widespread inother regions, particularly Europe and the Americas, and60 percent of the countries for which the WHO could notobtain registration data are in Sub-Saharan Africa. Dataseries of any time length are particularly rare. Due to a lackof appropriate direct data, the Adult Mortality inDeveloping Countries project, which studied trends in adultmortality in 27 developing countries (Hill 2003), includedonly 2 countries from mainland Sub-Saharan Africa (Beninand Zimbabwe). Among the mainland countries, SouthAfrica is an exemplary country because of the government'sdetermined efforts in the last decade to improve its statistics.The lack of reliable mortality data had been dubbed the\"black hole of vital statistics\" (Botha and Bradshaw 1985),but national efforts during the 1990s resulted in over 90 per-cent of the adult deaths being registered (Dorrington et al.2001). Y et, even in South Africa, the production of timely cause-of-death statistics remains a challenge. The pervasive lack of vital registration data makes it nec- essary to derive estimates of mortality using indirect demo- graphic techniques based on survey and census data. Themost readily accessible data that can be used to estimate adultmortality come from the Demographic and Health Surveys(DHS). At least one such survey has been conducted in mostAfrican countries, and many of the African surveys includesibling histories that were developed to obtain estimates ofmaternal mortality (Rutenberg and Sullivan 1991).Unfortunately, almost all DHS samples are too small toenable the study of age-specific mortality in adulthood ormortality trends in any detail. Moreover, concerns existabout both the reliability and validity of reports on the sur-vival of respondents' siblings. Although Bicego (1997) foundgood correspondence with other data, Stanton, Abderrahim,and Hill (1997) suggest that sibling survival may progres- sively underestimate adult mortality as the time since theevent lengthens. These authors conclude that sibling historiescan at best provide an estimate of adult mortality in the fewyears before the data were collected. Comparison of succes-sive sets of sibling history data in the three African countriesthat have collected them in two DHS surveys also supports this conclusion (Timaeus and Jasseh 2004). Apart from the DHS surveys, several other international programs of sur- veys have been conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa during thepast decade. However, although the Multiple IndicatorCluster Surveys (MICS) conducted by UNICEF are animportant source of child mortality estimates, they have notincluded questions on adult mortality. Moreover, data fromthe World Health Survey have yet to become available. Data on adult mortality can be collected in national cen- suses either by including questions about recent deaths in households or by asking about the survival of the parents of household members. Only some African countries have atradition of asking one or both sets of questions in their cen-suses, and few additional countries responded to the grow-ing concern about adult mortality from AIDS and othercauses by adding them to their schedule for the 2000 census.Even fewer countries have yet published these data.Although reporting of recent deaths can often be incom-plete and subject to reference period and age reportingerrors, a range of methods exists for the evaluation of suchinformation and, in favorable circumstances, the correction of inadequate data (Bennett and Horiuchi 1984; Brass 1975;Hill 1987). Data on the survival of parents can be used toestimate conventional life table indexes by means of theorphanhood method (Brass and Hill 1973; Timaeus 1992).The method can be used to estimate the historical trend inmortality and has been refined in various ways in order toproduce more up-to-date estimates (for example, Timaeus1991). Moreover, adjustments can be made to orphanhooddata to correct for the biases introduced by the excess mor-tality of orphans who have been vertically infected with HIV(Timaeus and Nunn 1997). Two consecutive censuses can also be used to estimate adult mortality from intercensal cohort survival or age- specific growth (Preston and Bennett 1983). The ratioresulting from matching age groups in the second popula-tion to the first population provides a summary measure ofadult mortality. This requires that the population be closedto migration and that the census coverage be the same inboth censuses. Few, if any, Sub-Saharan Africa countriescome close to meeting either of these conditions. Thus, themethod has not been used much or with great success. 32| Debbie Bradshaw and Ian M. TimaeusDemographic surveillance of local populations has been used for many years in a handful of African populations to study mortality and provide a framework for epidemiologi- cal research and the trial of health interventions (for exam-ple, Pison and Langaney 1985). In response to the spread ofHIV in Africa, many more such longitudinal surveillancesystems have been established recently in which vital events are monitored at regular intervals (Gregson et al. 1997; Hosegood, Vanneste, and Timaeus 2004; Nunn et al. 1997;Sewankambo et al. 2000; T odd et al. 1997; T ollman et al.1999; Urassa et al. 2001). Almost all these sites, however, cover only small and select populations. Therefore, they are of little use for the estimation of adult mortality in nationalpopulations. The partial exception is the surveillance system organized by the Adult Morbidity and Mortality Project(AMMP) in Tanzania, which covers three districts thatinclude both rural and urban areas, although it is not statis-tically representative of the population of the country as awhole (Kitange et al. 1996). Because of the shortage of reliable empirical estimates, World Population Prospects (United Nations 2003) uses esti- mates of child mortality and assumptions about the age pat- tern of mortality taken from a family of model life tables todetermine life expectancy in all of mainland Sub-SaharanAfrica. The system of model life tables adopted by the United Nations (UN) Population Division implicitly defines the level of adult mortality. In most of these countries thePopulation Division simply has assumed that non-AIDSmortality at all ages conforms to a Princeton North modellife table. These models are derived from historical datalargely on northern Europe (Coale, Demeny, and Vaughan1983) and are fitted to an estimate of under-five mortality(United Nations 2002). In a few countries, Princeton Westmodels (Coale, Demeny, and Vaughan 1983) or UN FarEastern models (United Nations 1982) have been used in thesame way. Moreover, Sub-Saharan Africa is the only area inwhich data are completely lacking for a few countries andmortality in them has to be guessed from estimates forneighboring countries. The UN Population Division basesits estimates of AIDS deaths in high-prevalence Africancountries on those produced by the Joint United NationsProgramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) using epidemiologi-cal models fitted to HIV seroprevalence data collected inantenatal clinics (UNAIDS Reference Group 2002).Although these models are based on careful review of thedata coming out of a range of research studies, at present noattempt is made by any of the UN agencies to use empiricaldata on mortality in national populations to estimate AIDSdeaths in particular countries.The WHO reviewed the various estimates and observed substantial variations, depending on the different proce- dures and judgments made (Lopez et al. 2002). It produced its own set of life table estimates for 191 countries in 2000 based on its own mortality database and a new family ofmodel life tables, which in turn were based on an extensionof the Brass logit system (Murray et al. 2003). Although the basis of these life tables was measures of mortality from direct registration wherever possible, the only mainlandSub-Saharan Africa countries for which such data wereadopted were Zimbabwe and South Africa and in addition,for Tanzania, where the AMMP surveillance data for part ofthe country were used. For the rest of Africa, the WHO, like the UN Population Division, was forced to estimate adult mortality and life expectancy by extrapolation from estimates of child mortal-ity. It did this by modeling the relationship between adultand child mortality in its database of more than 1,800 life tables, using its modified logit life table system. Given thelack of such data, however, this database includes few life tables from Sub-Saharan Africa and few with levels of childmortality as high as those that are typical of the Africanregion. Thus, although the WHO's estimates are based onmodels developed using contemporary developing countrydata, there is no guarantee that they will be more accuratefor Africa than those made by the UN Population Divisionusing model life tables based on historical data on high-mortality Western populations. Moreover, like thePopulation Division, the WHO was unable to locate any up-to-date mortality data on some eight African countries. T oproduce the final life tables, mortality levels were estimatedwithout HIV/AIDS, and then estimates of the additionaladult AIDS deaths were added, based on the impactobserved in the direct estimates from the demographic sur-veillance sites in Tanzania and the national vital registrationsystems of Zimbabwe and South Africa (Salomon andMurray 2001). MORTALITY LEVELS Table 4.1 shows estimates of adult mortality based on the WHO life tables for Africa in 2000 (Lopez et al. 2002). Theindex presented is the probability of dying between exactages 15 and 60 ( 45q15). It refers to a particular year but can be interpreted as the probability that someone who had survived childhood would die before old age if he or she went through life subject to the age-specific death rates of the year in question. This measure has been adopted by Levels and Trends of Adult Mortality | 3334| Debbie Bradshaw and Ian M. TimaeusTable 4.1 Probabilities of Dying between Ages 15 and 60 (45q15) in Sub-Saharan Africa WHO region and country Male Female WHO region and country Male Female Southern Africa Western Africa Angola from Lopez et al. 2002. many international agencies, including the WHO, as a good indicator of the overall level of adult mortality. Unlikelife expectancy at age 15, it is not influenced by death ratesat age 60 and over, which are very difficult to measure incountries with defective vital statistics systems. One limita- tion of the measure is that it is heavily influenced by deathrates in the upper part of the 45-year age range. Thisreduces its sensitivity to trends in death rates in early adult-hood. In addition, without supplementary data or assump-tions, neither sibling history data, which refer mainly toyoung adults, nor orphanhood data, which refer largely tomiddle-aged parents, can provide robust measures of adultmortality across the whole of this wide age range.In its estimates of mortality, the WHO found that of the 40 countries with the highest mortality, 37 were from the Sub-Saharan region. The level of adult mortality is highly variable across African countries. Southern and Eastern Africa have particularly high adult mortality, whereas mor-tality in Western Africa is lower and the Indian OceanIslands, which accommodate relatively small populations, have the lowest rates. According to these WHO estimates, the probability of surviving from exact age 15 to exact age 60in 2000 was less than 50 percent in nearly half of thecountries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Most of these are countriesaffected severely by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, but the listalso includes war-torn countries, such as Sierra Leone. Theestimates suggest that adult men have consistently higher mortality than adult women in Sub-Saharan Africa, with thefemale advantage in survivorship being smallest in the very high mortality countries and largest in the low-mortality island states. The estimates of adult mortality produced by the WHO for 2000 and those made by the United Nations Population Division for the period 1995-2000 are compared in fig-ure 4.1. It is clear that the WHO estimates tend to be signif-icantly higher than those issued by the Population Divisionfor both men and women. The discrepancies are especiallylarge in several countries in the Southern African region, butare also significant for men and of borderline significancefor women ( p/H110050.059) in the other countries of the region. As much of Africa is experiencing rising adult mortality from HIV/AIDS, one would expect the WHO's 2000 esti-mates to be slightly higher than those made by thePopulation Division for a period on average 2.5 years earli-er. However, HIV/AIDS can explain only a small part of thediscrepancies between the two sets of estimates. Instead,they are rooted in part in differences in what is assumedabout the level of child mortality by the two organizations,in part in the use of different model life tables to extrapolatefrom child to adult mortality, and in part in differentassumptions about the scale of AIDS mortality in particularcountries. One cannot readily quantify the relativeimportance of these contributions to the scatter revealedby figure 4.1. It seems likely, however, that the large discrep-ancies between the estimates for some southern Africancountries result at least in part from different assumptionsabout the severity of AIDS mortality in them.TRENDS IN ADULT MORTALITY There is growing evidence of rising trends in adult mortality in the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The eastern andsouthern African regions have been particularly hard hitby the AIDS epidemic, and the available data show largeincreases in adult mortality rates. For example, data from Malawi show that adult mortality was declining until themid-1980s but that this trend was reversed in the 1990s(table 4.2). These results are based on the intercensal sur- vival method but are broadly consistent with estimates based on recent household deaths and DHS sibling historydata (Blacker 2004). They suggest that mortality for menand women were at similar levels, rather than women hav-ing lower mortality, but long-standing evidence exists tosuggest that Malawi may be exceptional in this regard (Timaeus 1993, 1998). Analyses of data from censuses in Kenya also suggest that a reversal in the trend in adult mortality occurred in that country during the 1990s (table 4.3). The orphanhoodestimates of person-years lived indicate that slightimprovements were made between the 1970s and 1980s butthat an even larger decline occurred in the next decade. Inthis country, the mortality of women is lower than that ofmen.

This is in keeping with the rising prevalence of HIVobserved in antenatal clinics during the late 1980s and early1990s. Trends in the probability of dying between ages 30and 65, 35q30, are shown in figure 4.2. The estimates from vital registration, household deaths, and survival of parents are reasonably consistent, although the last of these series may underestimate somewhat for the earlier period and place the subsequent rise in mortality slightly too early.Mortality probably fell during the 1970s and early 1980s, butage-specific death rates and probabilities of death subse- quently rose by 200 to 300 percent between the late 1980s and late 1990s for both adult men and adult women. Analysis of a range of data sources from South Africa that also include vital registration data shows that adult mortal-ity rates were fairly constant during the 1980s, followed byan increase in the late 1990s (Timaeus et al. 2001). Trends in 45q15, the probability of surviving from 15 to 60, are shown in figure 4.3 and reveal the initial signs of the impact of the major HIV epidemic that emerged during the 1990s. More recent data collated from the national population register show that there has been a continued rise in the number ofadult deaths registered in South Africa (figure 4.4) and theincrease has followed the distinct age pattern associated with AIDS. However, improved registration of deaths and improved registration on the population register couldaccount for some of this increase. Taking into account these improvements as well as population growth, the increase in deaths of persons at ages 15 years or more has been approx-imately 40 percent. Age-specific rates can be calculated forSouth Africa from these data by adjusting for underregistra-tion of deaths (Dorrington, Moultrie, and Timaeus 2004 ). This can only be done for the years up to 2001, the date of the most recent census, which provides an estimate of the population against which to assess the underregistration. Itconfirms that a large rise in the mortality of young adultshas occurred. The relative increase in mortality rates hasbeen greater for women than for men, although startingfrom a lower base. Also, the increase for women occurs at ayounger age than that for men. Comparison of the empirically based estimates presented in figure 4.3 with those in table 4.1 suggest that the model- ing procedure used by the WHO to estimate adult mortalityin South Africa in 2000 has produced severe overestimates,particularly for women. This highlights the uncertaintyattached to estimates of adult mortality made from dataon children and to projections using epidemiological mod-els fitted to HIV data. It may be the case that the WHOalso overestimated women's mortality in the other south-ern African countries for which it published much higherestimates than the UN (figure 4.1).

For example, the estimates for Zimbabwe produced by the WHO arebroadly consistent with the most up-to-date empirical esti-mates shown in figure 4.2. Although the rise in adult mortality in South Africa by 2000 remained moderate at the national level, adult mortality had already risen far more in some parts of the country. Datafrom a demographic surveillance site in a rural area of one ofthe provinces that has been most severely affected byHIV/AIDS show that a massive rise in adult mortalityoccurred between the mid-1990s and 2000. By the latter yearthe probability of dying between exact ages 15 and 60 reached58 percent for women and 70 percent for men (Hosegood,Vanneste, and Timaeus 2004). Moreover, this site collects information on causes of death using verbal autopsies. Asthey are based on a review of symptoms, these data are lessliable than the official statistics to attribute AIDS deaths toother causes.

Church records from northern Namibia have been used to estimate the mortality experience of the parishioners (Notkola, Timaeus, and Siiskonen 2004). Adult mortalitydid not change much during the 1980s but increased rapid-ly from about 1994. In 2000 the death rates of women at ages 20-64 were 3.5 times higher than in 1993; for men they were 2.5 times higher. An analysis of the sibling histories collected prior to 1997 in 11 DHS surveys in Sub-Saharan Africa showed that, although adult mortality was falling or stagnant in WesternAfrica and in Namibia in the 1980s, it had begun to risesharply in Eastern Africa (Timaeus 1998, 1999). Moreover, four of the six Eastern African countries considered werecharacterized by unusually high mortality of young adultsrelative to older adults. Unfortunately, DHS surveys collectsibling histories only from women of reproductive age(although respondents report on siblings older than them-selves) and the surveys cover rather small samples for thestudy of adult mortality, especially at ages 45-59. Thus, thesesurveys lack the statistical power to enable one to producemeaningful estimates of how the age pattern of mortality inadulthood is evolving in each country as the overall deathrate rises. Timaeus and Jasseh (2004) incorporate the resultsof more recent DHS surveys into an analysis based on 26studies in 23 countries. They attempt to sidestep the rela-tively small size of DHS samples by estimating a commonage pattern of mortality increase across all the countries inwhich HIV has become present while determining the sizeof that mortality increase separately for each country. Theirsmoothed summary estimates of the level and trend in theprobability of dying between ages 15 and 60 are shown intable 4.4 and by the WHO region in figure 4.5, which alsoplots the WHO's own estimates of the same index for theyear 2000 (Lopez et al. 2002). The results of the analysis by Timaeus and Jasseh (2004) show that the fastest rises in adult mortality have occurredin South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Uganda, Guinea, andCameroon. Adult mortality has risen relatively slowly orcontinued to fall in the Sahel. A significant change in thetrend about four years after the development of a general-ized HIV/AIDS epidemic is observed in 16 of the 19 coun-tries in which the sibling histories cover the relevant period.Of the three countries in which HIV has become prevalentbut mortality has not risen markedly, the data for Nigeriaare known to be of poor quality, but it is unclear whyEthiopia and Rwanda do not conform to the usual pattern.The increase in mortality is concentrated among women age25 to 39 and men age 30 to 44. On average, men's death rates have risen by about a third more than those of women.However, as women are dying at younger ages and Africanpopulations have grown rapidly during the last few decades,the sex differential in the number of AIDS deaths is small. Extrapolation of the trend in the sibling history estimates forward to 2000 and comparison of them with those made by the WHO (also shown in figure 4.5) reveal that theyare in quite good agreement for some countries, includinghigh mortality countries, such as Malawi, Zambia, andZimbabwe. For men, the WHO estimates are much higherthan predicted by the sibling history estimates inMozambique and in countries where the prevalence of HIVinfection is fairly low, that is to say Chad and western African countries such as Benin, Burkina Faso, and Mali. Forwomen, the discrepancies between the two series are larger and more widespread. They extend to South Africa, the east-ern African countries and, to a lesser extent, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Guinea, and T ogo in western Africa. These discrepancies might result from severe underreporting of dead siblings inthe DHS. However, it is unclear why this should be moreserious in lower mortality countries and, in some cases, for sisters alone. Alternatively, the UN agencies may tend to overestimate adult mortality in Africa. An analysis compar-ing the numbers of orphans implied in the estimates by thePopulation Division with empirical data gathered by theDHS on the proportions of children orphaned provides evi-dence in support of the latter interpretation (Grassly et al.2004). The DHS data find far fewer orphans than are pre- dicted by models based on the Population Division and 38| Debbie Bradshaw and Ian M.

Just as in the comparison of the sibling history estimates with the WHO estimates presented here, these discrepancies tend to be larger for maternal orphans than paternal orphans and larger in low-mortality countries than in high-mortality countries. This pattern of discrepancies suggests that, rather than the prob-lem being underreporting of orphanhood in DHS or exag-geration of the scale of AIDS mortality, the model life tablesystems used by the UN agencies may systematically overes-timate background adult mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa,especially for women. CONCLUSION The lack of good quality vital registration data in Sub- Saharan Africa has resulted in uncertainty in the levels ofadult mortality. Estimates of adult mortality vary, depend-ing on the data source, the methodology used, and theassumptions made. Despite the uncertainties in the data, theevidence shows that adult mortality rates are generally high, reflecting poor levels of health in the region. By the mid-1990s the levels of adult mortality do appear to have become far more varied among the regions and countries andbetween the genders than they had been a decade earlier.Many countries have shown an increase, with death ratesreaching unprecedented heights. This is in stark contrast tothe findings by Hill (2003) that adult mortality has beendeclining in most developing countries\u2014at a rate of 1 per-cent per year for men and 2 percent per year for women.Estimates of adult mortality for some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are by far the highest in the world. Because of the inadequacy of vital statistics in Sub- Saharan Africa, both the UN Population Division and the WHO estimate adult mortality and life expectancy in thecountries of the region by extrapolating from estimates ofchild mortality using model life tables and adding in an esti- mate of AIDS deaths based on antenatal clinic data.

The assumption that a fixedrelationship between adult and child mortality holds acrossthe continent is bound to produce estimates that are badlyin error in particular countries, even if they are unbiased overall. In addition, evidence from DHS orphanhood data(Grassly et al. 2004), DHS sibling histories (Timaeus andJasseh 2004), and earlier surveys and censuses (Timaeus1993) all suggest that in recent years the PopulationDivision's extrapolations using Princeton North model lifetables have overestimated non-AIDS adult mortality in largeparts of the region. The WHO's estimates infer the relation-ship between child and adult mortality from a database ofpopulations that tend to have lower mortality than is typical of Africa and appear to suffer from very similar limitationsto those produced by the Population Division. Given the limitations of the demographic and epidemio- logical data, there are inevitably large errors in some of theestimates of AIDS mortality made by UNAIDS and the WHO. Nevertheless, the evidence that adult mortality isnow rising in most of Sub-Saharan Africa is clear cut.Moreover, the empirical evidence as to the size and speed ofthe rise in adult mortality in different countries in the region and the evolving age pattern of the mortality impact is con-sistent with predictions from epidemiological surveillancedata and models of the impact of HIV/AIDS on adult mor-tality in most countries. The annual toll of AIDS deaths inSub-Saharan Africa continues to grow rapidly, and theurgency of responding to the poor health conditions inthe region has been exacerbated by the emergence of theHIV/AIDS epidemic. In some African countries significant numbers of people have been dying from AIDS since the 1980s. In such coun- tries it is difficult to imagine what would have happened torates of mortality by today in the absence of AIDS. Thus, itis no longer viable to estimate and forecast mortality by 40| Debbie Bradshaw and Ian M.

Estimates extrapolated to 2000 are presented for countries conducting a survey in 1998 or later.adding an estimate of AIDS deaths to a separate estimate of non-AIDS mortality. Instead, new approaches for making mortality estimates and projections are required that can be calibrated to data on both the prevalence of HIV infectionand all-cause adult mortality. While existing data do signal the broad scale of the impact of AIDS on the mortality of adult populations in Sub-Saharan Africa, they are clearly not sufficiently detailed, reli-able, or timely to provide the description of changes in leveland age pattern that is urgently needed to monitor theimpacts of programs that are being funded by African gov-ernments, the Global Fund, the World Bank, and bilateraldonors. The fundamental cause of the uncertainty aboutlevels of adult mortality and the impact on them of AIDS in Africa remains the limitations of epidemiological monitor-ing and demographic data systems in the region. The rolloutof antiretroviral care and treatment activities throughout thecontinent should have a major impact (short, middle, andlong term) on mortality dynamics and the demographiclandscape of the region. More than ever before, better epi-demiological and demographic data are required to evaluatethe impact of health programs and to assess whether theseefforts are effective in reducing the mortality of young adults. National statistical offices, technical advisers, donors, and researchers are urged to assign more priority to the collec- tion of adult mortality data in this region. In addition to responding to the poor levels of adult health, reinvigoratingvital registration and statistics is essential in the long termand must also be placed high on the health and develop- ment agenda. An effective registration system is the only wayof producing detailed annual series of mortality statistics, including those on causes of death. Moreover, as countries in Sub-Saharan Africa experience the phenomenon of aging, improved vital registration systems will be critical toprovide information about mortality trends at older ages,which are largely unknown at present and difficult to inves-tigate using methods based on survey data. Thus, countriesare encouraged to establish expert teams to critically reviewtheir national civil registration systems in regard to theirlegal framework, organizational issues, system design, train-ing needs, and quality control issues and to implementstrategies for their improvement. Given the stresses on governments in the region (in part due to the impacts we are trying to measure), it is also vitalto propose ways in which survey data, census data, anddemographic surveillance data might be expanded and bet-ter used to track and understand changes in mortality whilevital registration still remains defective. Demographic andepidemiological surveillance in localized sites has provedinvaluable and can yield relatively reliable statistics on causes of death. However, it needs to be balanced by othersources that can provide nationally representative data. Although sibling history data have serious limitations, in particular their limited statistical precision in all but thelargest surveys, they have proved useful. We believe thatcountries should continue to collect these data. Moreover, they should collect them repeatedly, as this greatly increases the scope for assessment of the quality of the statistics thatresult. However, the crucial source of demographic data forplanning, particularly at the subnational or district level, isthe population census. All African governments are facedwith either the reality or the threat of massive rises in adultmortality and they should all include questions about household deaths by age and sex and about orphanhood intheir 2010-round censuses. A major drive is needed on the part of the United Nations agencies and donor organiza-tions to support African governments in this, so as to ensure that question and form design, enumerator training, datacapture, and the analysis of these data are all conducted successfully.

Timaeus43Consistent estimates of cause-specific mortality are essential for understanding the overall epidemiological profile of dis-ease in a population. The principal data source for these esti- mates is civil registration systems. Adequately functioning systems that produce statistics on causes of death on a regu-lar basis exist in only about one-third of all countries of theworld (Lopez et al. 2002). In Sub-Saharan Africa, very little information has been available on cause-specific mortality, let alone data from civil registration systems, as described inthe previous edition of this book (Feachem and Jamison1991). Estimates at that time were derived largely from inde-pendent disease-specific epidemiological studies and werenot examined within the context of an overall demographic\"envelope\" of mortality, as is required to ensure that claims about causes of death are not exaggerated. Over the past decade, much progress has been made in the collection of mortality statistics from a wide array of sources. These include data from previously existing sources thatwere uncovered during a systematic search, as well as datafrom new data collection ventures that were established to fillthese data gaps. Although we are still a long way from havingsatisfactory empirical data that can be directly used to derivenational and regional cause-specific mortality estimates,the expansion in available data suggests that estimates of causes of death can now be made with somewhat greaterconfidence. The absence of complete vital registration datain virtually all countries of the region nonetheless means thatwe need to rely on epidemiological research and demo- graphic surveillance to generate model-based estimates ofdeaths by cause. Such an estimation process is complex and involves two stages. First, a demographic estimate of overall mortalityby age and sex is required. Second, a cause-specific mortalitystructure is fitted to this estimate. Many assumptions arerequired, and an attempt has been made here to delineatethese clearly, so that they can be kept in mind when inter-preting the results. DATA SOURCES The previous edition of this book provided information on cause-specific mortality in the form of a set of estimates forthe entire region, disaggregated over seven broad diseasecategories, and in six age groups. These estimates wereessentially derived from linear models relating mortalityChapter5 Causes of Death Chalapati Rao, Alan D. Lopez, and Yusuf Hemedlevels to broad causes of death (Preston 1976), with very lit- tle attempt to incorporate other epidemiological informa- tion. The authors stated that the large proportion of deaths lumped under other causes reflected the weakness of theestimates, and suggested great caution in interpreting orusing them (Feachem, Jamison, and Bos 1991). Building on previous experience, researchers have made much more comprehensive attempts over the past decade to collect and analyze information in order to estimate thecause-specific mortality structure for Sub-Saharan Africaas part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study(Mathers, Stein et al. 2002; Murray and Lopez 1996).Discussed here are the results of two major data collectionefforts that were undertaken to estimate the burden of pre- mature mortality in Africa. The first effort involved a searchfor, and analysis of, epidemiological literature on causes ofdeath in the region. The second effort involved a similarexercise using data from national vital records. Review of Epidemiological Literature Much of the earlier attempts to estimate causes of death in the region drew on published and unpublished reportsbased on epidemiological studies. Adetunji, Murray, andEvans (1996) conducted a major review of epidemiologicalstudies to identify usable cause-specific mortality data. They identified a total of 48 research studies from 16 countriesthat met specific criteria related to data definition and dataquality issues for inclusion in the analysis. The main criteriafor inclusion was that the study should have reported therelative magnitude of all causes of death and not focus on asingle or a few causes without mention of other causes with-in the sample. Other criteria refer to methods used to derivethe cause of death, age groups reported, site, and period ofthe study. Reports from South Africa were excluded from this analysis, since the data overlapped with that availablefrom vital records. About 80 percent of the reports werebased on information from hospital records, verbal autopsyinterviews, or both. A majority of the studies (again 80 per-cent) focused on causes of maternal and child mortality,whereas causes of adult male deaths were relatively neg-lected. The authors presented results in the form of causecomposition of mortality for three distinct cause groups:communicable diseases and maternal, perinatal, and nutri-tional conditions (group 1); noncommunicable diseases(group 2); and injuries (group 3). These cause groups werethe same as those used in the GBD Study. The results of theirreview of deaths of children younger than five years aresummarized in table 5.1.The high proportion of deaths for which the cause was unknown raises serious questions about data quality. The largest number of deaths in this review was in the vitalrecords for Abidjan, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (1987-92). However,these too have high proportions of \"other\" causes (29 per-cent). A detailed analysis of specific causes based on the data from these studies suggested that respiratory infections,diarrhea, malnutrition, and anemia were the leading causesof death in this age group. At ages 5 to 14 years (see table 5.2), the largest number of deaths was also in the vital records from the same source,although the total number of deaths registered is very small.In such situations, deriving a meaningful estimate of eventhe proportions across broad cause groups is difficult,because paucity in numbers is coupled with high propor-tions of ill-defined causes (44 percent). Nevertheless, the results suggested that malaria, diarrheal diseases, andmalnutrition were the leading causes of death amongschool-age children. 44| Chalapati Rao, Alan D.

Includes ill-defined conditions and cause unknown.Table 5.2 Proportion of Deaths Due to Diseases and Injuries in Children Age 5 to 14 Years, by Source of Data For ages above 15 years, epidemiological studies on causes of death concentrate on causes of maternal mortality. Adetunji, Murray, and Evans (1996) reviewed information from 21 studies and identified 3,818 deaths due to maternalcauses. About 80 percent of these studies were based onhospital records. This could have two possible implications.On the one hand, hospital-based studies could overesti- mate maternal mortality, as high risk and emergency cases are likely to be concentrated in hospitals. On the otherhand, better emergency care in hospitals may avert moredeaths than would have occurred in the community. Notwithstanding these possible biases, the causes as docu- mented in hospital records are likely to be more reliable thanthose from community-based studies. The pooled results suggested hemorrhage (19 percent), puerperal sepsis(13 percent), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (7.8 per-cent), and ruptured uterus (7 percent) as the leading causesof maternal mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa, at least amongwomen referred to hospitals. Adetunji, Murray, and Evans (1996) also documented three sources of data on causes of adult mortality; two fromvital records in Lagos (1977) and Abidjan (1987-92), andone from the Adult Morbidity and Mortality Project(AMMP) in Tanzania (1992). The data from Lagos predatethe HIV/AIDS period and record accidents and violenceas the leading cause of adult deaths (26.3 percent). In Abidjan, the data suggest hypertensive disease (31 percent),diarrheal disease (11 percent) and HIV/AIDS (10.5 percent)as the leading causes. Data from the AMMP are available bysex and show HIV/AIDS to be the leading cause in bothsexes (higher proportions in women) and injuries in malesand pregnancy-related causes to be the other significantconditions. All these results suggest that hypertensive dis-ease, HIV/AIDS, pregnancy-related causes, and injuries arethe leading causes of death among adults in Sub-SaharanAfrica. We have described this review in some detail in part because it was the most comprehensive previous attempt to estimate causes of death in Africa, and in part to show thatcompiling information from various sources, despite theenormous effort involved, still results in substantialuncertainty about the cause structure of mortality owing tobiases in the way the data were collected and the highproportions of unspecified causes in the reports. However,these epidemiological studies were designed to focus on oneor a few specific causes of mortality, yielding usefulinformation on incidence, duration, and case-fatality rates.These indexes were used by independent researchers to infermortality specific to that cause at the population level,and such epidemiological estimates for individual causes are useful to build the overall cause-specific mortalitypicture. Information from Vital Records Another data collection effort was centered on the acquisi-tion of vital records data. The World Health Organization(WHO) conducted a comprehensive search for these data over the period 2001-02, as part of the data collection for the GBD 2000 project (Kowal, Rao, and Mathers 2003). Fewcountries in Africa have vital registration systems that aremore than 50 percent complete. Coverage is about this level in Kenya and Zimbabwe (Lopez et al. 2002), and close to 90 percent in South Africa (Dorrington et al. 2001). InMozambique a major exercise was undertaken to improvemortality registration and cause-of-death attributionin four cities (Cliff et al. 2003). The ministries of health inBotswana, Eritrea, and Zambia collect and collate informa-tion on causes of death from health facility data and from vital records, essentially in urban areas. The AMMP inTanzania has built up a comprehensive district-level mor-tality surveillance system that operates currently in threedistricts (Hai, Morogoro, and Dar es Salaam) and hascompiled information on causes of death over a 10-yearperiod. Vital records data from the city of Antananarivo havebeen systematically compiled over a 12-year period todescribe urban causes of death in Madagascar (Waltisperger,Cantrelle, and Ralijaona 1998). Data from all these countrieshave been collated and analyzed at the WHO. Vital records data, although impressive in overall num- bers of deaths for which information on cause is available, have their own limitations. First, coverage is incomplete, andit is not possible to map these data to an underlying popu-lation to make an assessment of death rates. Second, there isno indication of the bases used for cause-of-death attribu-tion, whether physician attribution at the time of death,hospital records, verbal autopsy, or lay reported informa-tion. The proportionate distribution of causes of death aretherefore examined in this chapter according to the GBDgroups at different ages, as was done in the earlier analysesusing data from epidemiological studies. Included in these tabulations are the proportionate distributions for two epidemiological subregions in Sub-Saharan Africa (AFR D and AFR E), 1as estimated by the GBD cause-of-death study. These subregions group coun- tries with similar estimated levels of child and adult mortality, as described in detail later in the section on the GBD estimation process. For comparison purposes, and so Causes of Death | 45their plausibility may be judged, these figures are included here with available local data. Among children under five, the highest proportion of deaths, as expected, is from group 1 causes (perinatal condi-tions, communicable diseases, and malnutrition), ranging from 75 percent in the South African data set to 94 percentin the data from Zambia. A reassuring feature of these vitalrecords data is the relatively low proportion of deaths notclassified in any of the three cause groups. In the GBDestimates, unclassifiable deaths at ages below five yearsare reallocated to group 1 (Murray and Lopez 1996).Hence, we estimate that about 95 percent of deaths at theseages are due to group 1 causes, which approximates theupper end of the range of observed proportions from this cause category from the vital records data sets (table 5.3). As age increases, the proportion of deaths due to noncommunicable diseases and injuries rises. In globalcomparisons, this shift in cause composition across ages isless evident in Sub-Saharan Africa than in other regions, dueto the catastrophic HIV/AIDS epidemic. At ages 5 to 14years, the South African data set suggests a low proportionof deaths due to group 1 causes, which may be because thepopulation covered by registration is urban, with highersocioeconomic status (expressed as GDP per capita) thanthe national average (table 5.4). Another possible cause for low group 1 proportions is that the coverage of vital regis- tration in South Africa is only 90 percent, and the misseddeaths could be group 1 deaths. However, such correctionswould result only in marginal changes in the specificproportions of the groups. Again, from all the data sets, the proportion of deaths due to ill-defined causes is low. In theGBD estimation process, these deaths due to ill-definedcauses at ages above five years are reallocated proportion-ately across group 2 causes. In comparison, group 1 propor- tions in the estimates again approximate the higher end ofthe range of observations in the local data. Much more complex is to estimate cause-specific mortality for the young adult (15 to 44 years) age group. At these ages in Sub-Saharan Africa, a triple burden of cause-specific factors exists, namely, the HIV/AIDS epidemic; highincidence rates of injury and violence, especially amongmales; and the high burden of maternal mortality amongfemales. These aspects of cause-specific mortality are evident from the results of the epidemiological literaturereview discussed earlier. Table 5.5 shows the group-specificproportions from vital records at these ages. The proportionof deaths in vital records due to injuries at these agesappears to be low in most countries, given the wars andviolence in the region. The GBD estimates of war-relateddeaths are included in deaths due to violence and marginallyincrease the proportions of deaths due to injuries. Also, therelatively low proportion of deaths due to group 1 causesin the Madagascar data set could be because the populationcovered was urban, or that HIV prevalence, transmission,and mortality is low in Madagascar (Ravaoarimalala et al. 1998). Group 1 conditions appear to cause a major propor-tion of mortality at these ages. Local data for deaths at older ages (45 years and older) from all sites have significantly higher proportions of unclassifiable 46| Chalapati Rao, Alan D.

As part of the GBD approach, deaths from ill-defined categories are reallocated to specific categories.Table 5.4 National Vital Records Data: Proportionate Distribution of Cause of Death at Age 5 to 14 Yearsdeaths, approaching 31 percent in Zimbabwe (table 5.6). At these ages, one would normally expect higher proportions ofdeaths from noncommunicable diseases, which is reflected in the data. There is a possibility of misclassification between group 2 and group 1, since in some instances individualswith long-standing noncommunicable diseases developinfectious complications during terminal stages, which tend to be more readily identified and classified as the underlying cause of death. The estimates are close to the upper end of therange of proportions of group 2 conditions from local data. From the above analyses, vital registration data would seem to be useful in understanding general patterns of cause- specific mortality at broad-cause-group level. However,biases introduced by incomplete or selective coverage and difficulty in identifying specific causes beyond the broad-cause-group level preclude their usage directly in the estima-tion process. In situations of incomplete data, the process ofestimating mortality from specific causes entails the synthesisof information from different data sources or, if necessary, bydrawing on other regional or international cause-specificmortality patterns. GBD Process for Estimating Cause-Specific Mortality The GBD Study method of estimating cause-specific mor- tality in populations without detailed information on thelevels or cause structure of mortality is essentially based onthree sequential steps: 1. The first step is to derive an overall envelope of mortality, in terms of estimated numbers of deaths, for each age-sex group within the population. In practical terms, a modellife table-based age-specific risk of mortality is applied to a national age-sex population estimate. The purpose ofthis step is to provide an upper limit or \"demographicenvelope,\" to constrain cause-of-death estimates withinthe bounds of demographic plausibility. 2. The second step is to use cause-of-death models to pre- dict a GBD group-specific (broad causes) proportionate composition of mortality for each age-sex group and toapply the proportions to the mortality envelope derivedin step 1 to derive an age-sex GBD group-specific enve-lope of mortality. 3. The third step is to fit a condition-specific cause structure of mortality for each broad-cause group onto their respective envelopes as derived in step 2 to derive esti-mates of deaths from specific conditions by age and sexfor the population. In the current analysis, separate estimates were developedfor each country in Sub-Saharan Africa, and they weresummed up to generate two subregional population aggre-gations. The classification of WHO member states into the mortality strata was carried out using population estimatesfor 1999 (United Nations Population Division 1998) andestimates of child mortality (defined as 5q0;the risk of dying between birth and age 5) and adult mortality (defined as 45q15;the risk of dying between ages 15 and 60) based on WHO analyses of mortality rates for 1999 (Mathers, Steinet al. 2002). Five mortality strata were defined in terms ofquintiles of the distribution of 5q0and45q15(both sexes combined). Adult mortality45q15was regressed on5q0and the regression line used to divide countries with high child Causes of Death | 47Year of data No. of Gp 1 Gp 2 Gp 3 Ill-defineda Country collection deaths (%) (%) (%) (%) Botswana 1998 2,658 76 19 3 2 Kenya 2001 69,910 75 11 6 8 Madagascar 1984-95 23,056 39 40 13 9 Mozambique 2001 8,008 71 12 9 8South Africa 1996 83,482 25 22 43 10 Tanzania 1998-2000 3,943 72 11 9 9 Zimbabwe 1995 30,124 59 13 8 19GBD AFR D 2000 913,976 69 13 18 \u2014 GBD AFR E 2000 1,879,690 82 7 11 \u2014 Source: Authors.

Stratum Eincludes the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa where HIV/AIDS has had a substantial impact. A fundamental principle in the estimation process is to maintain internal consistency between the overall demo- graphic envelope of mortality and the cause compositionwithin the envelope. In other words, the mortality due tospecific causes within an age group should exactly sum up tothe life table-derived envelope of mortality. Such con-straints call for significant assumptions and judgments;hence, the final estimates should be interpreted based onthese choices. With the high estimated levels of HIV/AIDSmortality in the region, judgments regarding burden due to competing causes of death are based on evidence from vitalrecords and epidemiological estimates for specific diseases.However, preceding these issues is the process of derivingthe life tables for estimating the mortality envelope by ageand sex and the use of cause-of-death models for allocatingdeaths to broad-cause groups. Life Tables Detailed age-specific mortality rates are required to con- struct life tables for populations. Such rates are not availablefor any country within Sub-Saharan Africa. Attempts atestimating death rates based on recall of deaths in censusesand surveys have generally led to implausibly low death rates (Brass 1968). The best available data on mortality risk are lev-els of child mortality derived from Demographic and HealthSurveys (DHS) conducted in most countries within theregion during the 1990s. These estimates are derived usingdata from birth histories collected from women respondentsage 15 to 49 years. In a few countries, information on sibling survival, subsequently analyzed to derive estimates of adult mortality, has also been collected and compiled. A new modified logit model life table system (Murray et al. 2003) allows for predicting an abridged life table usingas inputs true or estimated levels of child and adult mortal-ity or, if necessary, using only levels of child mortality.Recent work by Murray and colleagues has resulted in devel-opment of a validated life table system that uses a singleglobal standard that represents the full range of mortalitypatterns seen in contemporary human populations; the sys-tem generates better predictions of age-specific mortalityrates than the Coale-Demeny or original Brass systems. 2 A set of 1,802 life tables, based on empirical data from national mortality registration systems between 1901 and 1999, were used to develop and test this model. These life tables were based on observed mortality risks in HIV-freepopulations, and hence, predicted life tables from the model can be used to estimate HIV-free age-specific mortality. Inthis context, estimates of child mortality from DHS surveysfor the 52 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa were used todevelop HIV-free envelopes of mortality at the nationallevel. Steps 2 and 3 as described earlier were carried out foreach country to construct a cause-specific mortalityestimate without accounting for HIV , and as a final step,epidemiological estimates of HIV mortality were added onto derive the overall national age-, sex-, and cause-specific mortality estimate (Lopez et al. 2002). Figure 5.2 shows, byway of example, the final age-specific death rates forZambia, for the year 2000. Note the markedly high deathrates at young adult ages, including the deaths due to AIDS. Compositional cause-of-death models have been devel- oped around the relationship between cause-specificmortality and total mortality by age, as observed from pat-terns of causes of death recorded in nations with good vitalregistration systems (Salomon and Murray 2002). For eachage-sex group an income variable for each observedcountry-year of data has been added to the model tostrengthen the predicted proportionate composition by thethree GBD cause groups. The models have been built usingan empirical data set of 1,576 country-years of observationsfrom 58 countries for the years 1950 to 1998. A set of regres-sion equations have been developed that predict the causecomposition of mortality by age, for a given input of totalmortality by age and an estimate of national per capita grossdomestic product (GDP). For each country, the estimate oftotal mortality by age and sex derived from the life tables(from step 1) and the national GDP are used as inputs, andthe model produces an implied cause composition of 48| Chalapati Rao, Alan D.

Since the empirical data set for developing the regression equations does not include anyinformation on mortality in countries experiencing AIDS epidemics, it is difficult to predict with confidence the pro- portions of deaths due to group 1 causes at different ages.Wherever possible, the outputs of the model were validatedagainst compositional structures from available vital records data from the country or region and from small-scale longi- tudinal population surveillance systems. An example of themodel outputs is shown in figure 5.3, depicting the predictedproportionate composition by age for males and females,respectively. Communicable diseases (group 1) account for a large proportion of deaths at all ages up to about age 60. The proportions derived from the model are used to derive GBDgroup-specific numbers of deaths for each age group fromthe life table-derived total numbers of deaths in each agegroup. After this, information from vital records or specificdisease epidemiological studies are used to construct thedetailed cause-of-death estimates.Epidemiological Estimates Cause-of-death models in combination with life table- derived mortality risks and national population estimatesprovide an estimate of the numbers of deaths by age, sex,and broad-cause group. Estimating the numbers of deathsdue to specific causes within each broad group\u2014for exam- ple, the composition within group 1 due to different infec-tious diseases and perinatal disorders at infant ages or thecomposition within group 2 due to neoplasms, cardiovas-cular diseases, and other noncommunicable diseases atadult ages\u2014is the next stage. The mass of epidemiologicalevidence on mortality due to different infectious diseasesand maternal causes over the past two decades has beeninvaluable in this estimation process. Researchers have crit-ically examined data from different studies and used them to derive independent epidemiological estimates of cause-specific mortality for the region.

We have included in this discussion results from such estimation exercises avail- able for Africa in 2003. There is a need to conduct similar estimations for other important conditions, such as tuber-culosis and road traffic accidents. Malaria. Malaria is one disease that has been extensively researched in Africa. Snow and his colleagues initially esti- mated malaria mortality in the region for 1990 and laterrefined their approach to produce another set of estimatesfor 1995 (Snow et al. 1999). They integrated evidence fromresearch on several aspects of the epidemiology of malaria.First, they used a detailed analysis of environmental factors that affect the distribution, seasonality, and transmissionintensity to develop an epidemiological stratification of thecontinent into five regions based on climatic suitability forthe existence and stability of malarial transmission. In thenext step, they used geographical information systems todefine at-risk populations within regions suitable for trans-mission based on different transmission scenarios asdescribed. A specially constructed population database formore than 4,000 administrative units in Africa (Deichmann1996) was used in this step. Finally, direct estimates of fatalrisks for malarial mortality were selected from over 200empirical data sources on the health impact of malaria, and these were combined with estimates of at-risk populationsto derive age-specific estimates of deaths due to malaria inthe region, as summarized in table 5.7. The median esti-mates were taken as the guideline for the GBD estimates forthe entire region. Diarrheal Diseases. Estimates of death rates due to diar- rheal disease from epidemiological studies vary widely across populations, and within populations over time. Also,complex interactions between intrinsic factors, such as nutritional status, and extrinsic factors, such as exposure tomultiple infections, make the attribution of death to a singleunderlying cause extremely difficult. Kosek, Bern, andGuerrant (2003) reviewed 34 studies in 21 countries to derive an estimate of diarrheal mortality rates. Studies wereincluded only if diarrheal deaths were ascertained throughactive surveillance, and in the selected studies only a primarycause listed as diarrhea was considered as a diarrheal death.As a result, they estimated a mortality rate of 4.9 per 1,000children under five per year (95 percent confidence interval(CI), 1.0-9.1) in countries with high levels of overall childmortality. On a global scale, this appears as a decline from anestimated rate of 13.6 per 1,000 in 1982 (Snyder and Merson 1982). In view of different cause-of-death attribution strategies in different settings, proportionate mortality due to diar- rhea is considered as an alternate approach to estimating thenumber of deaths due to this cause. Morris, Black, andT omaskovic (2003) developed a prediction model to esti-mate the distribution of deaths among children under fiveby cause. The model estimated that about 20 percent of allunder-five deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa would be caused bydiarrhea.

Stein and colleagues (2003) conducted an epidemio- logical exercise to estimate measles mortality. They used national-level information on vaccine coverage from healthsurveys and estimates of disease incidence, vaccine efficacy,and case fatality from specific epidemiological studies todevelop a static model by which to estimate regional and global measles mortality. They estimated a total of 452,000 deaths due to measles in Sub-Saharan Africa in the year 2000,of which approximately three-fourths would occur amongchildren under five. Crowcroft and colleagues (2003) developed a model by which to estimate cases and deaths due to pertussis for theyear 1999. Parameters used in the model included vaccine coverage and efficacy data and estimates of case-fatalityratios from epidemiological studies. Two coverage scenarioswere used in the model, at levels below and above 70 per-cent, based on information from WHO reports adjusted bysurvey data where available. For each scenario, a differentage structure was used to represent a range of possiblepatterns of infection in susceptible children. The modelassumed a vaccine efficacy of 95 percent for preventingdeath. They estimated 170,000 deaths due to whoopingcough in the African region in 1999. Lower Respiratory Infections. Acute respiratory infec- tions (ARI) are the third leading cause of death globally among children under five years of age. Much uncertaintysurrounds the ascertainment of pneumonia as the underly-ing cause of death, principally from verbal autopsy-basedstudies in developing countries. In these settings, signifi-cant comorbidity exists in the form of measles, whoopingcough, diarrheal diseases, or malaria. Williams and col-leagues (2002) developed a model to predict the propor-tion of ARI mortality for a given level of under-five mor-tality. A review of 49 studies provided data on the level ofchild mortality and the proportion of deaths due to ARI.The researchers fitted a log linear curve to the data; fromthe resultant equation they estimated the number of deathsdue to ARI for all countries, using WHO estimates ofcountry-specific under-five mortality in the year 2000.Through this model they estimated a total of 794,000deaths due to ARI in the region in the year 2000. Theauthors demonstrated that differences between predictedproportions from the model and observed proportionsfrom verbal autopsy studies could be explained by the vari-ability inherent with the use of verbal autopsy methods,induced by such comorbidity.Maternal Mortality. Hill, AbouZahr, and Wardlaw (2001) in collaboration with researchers at the WHO collated avail- able evidence on country-specific maternal mortality in the form of vital registration records, DHS-type sibling survival surveys, and special Reproductive Age Mortality Studies to develop a statistical model to predict the proportion of deaths of women of reproductive ages due to maternal causes (PMDF). The PMDF was found superior to the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) as the dependent variablefor estimating the number of deaths from maternal causes,mainly because of its applicability to a demographic \"enve-lope\" of deaths at maternal ages. Also, information fromnational-level sisterhood surveys were found to yield morerobust measures of PMDF than MMR to use as inputs in the construction of the model. Independent variables chosen to predict national PMDF were general fertility rate, female lit- eracy, per capita income, percentage of deliveries attendedby skilled attendants, country-specific estimates of HIV prevalence, and variables for region and level of vital regis-tration in individual countries. The predicted PMDF foreach country was then applied to age- and sex-specific mor-tality estimates from World Population Prospects (United Nations Population Division 1998), to derive the absolute numbers of deaths due to maternal causes. Based on themodel, Hill, AbouZahr, and Wardlaw (2001) predicted atotal of 272,500 maternal deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa for1995, with a mean MMR of 1,006 per 100,000 live births. HIV/AIDS. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the WHO established an Epidemiology Reference Group to work toward makingestimates and projections of mortality on a biennial basis.Country-level information on prevalence of infectionamong attendants at antenatal clinics and sexually transmit-ted disease clinics and prevalence among other high-riskgroups, such as intravenous drug users, homosexual males,and commercial sex workers, has been used to monitor epi-demics at the country level. Using these data, an epidemio-logical model was developed that included the followingparameters: 1. the initial rate ( r) of spread of HIV as determined by the reproductive potential 2. the peak prevalence ( f) as determined by the fraction of population at risk of infection 3. the final epidemic prevalence ( /H9278) as determined by the behavioral response of the population 4. the start date of epidemics in individual countries. Causes of Death | 51A negative value of /H9278indicates that people become less likely to adopt risky behavior in response to observed AIDS mor- tality or prevention programs. Hence, apart from prevalencedata from sentinel sites, behavioral surveys are essential toassess the potential of HIV epidemics and to estimate the size of at-risk populations. An assessment of factors that affect survival of adults suggested that an overall median survival time of 9 years, with a range of uncertainty of 8 to 11 years, and a Weibulldistribution of the survival function were used in themodeling process. For children, the survival curve was builtto account for two periods of high mortality, which areinfancy, when HIV frequently overwhelms the immatureimmune system, and after age nine years, when the response to HIV infection resembles that in adults. Overall, the sur-vival curve for children predicts 40 percent survival fromHIV-related mortality at five years of age. The UNAIDS/WHO model was used to develop country- specific point estimates of HIV/AIDS mortality for 2001(WHO and UNAIDS 2002). The estimated regional deathtoll from this disease for Sub-Saharan Africa stands at a totalof 2.2 million deaths. Policy decisions aimed at addressingthis epidemic should include activities aimed at improvingsuch measurements. Cancers. Ferlay and colleagues (2001) at the International Agency for Research in Cancer developed a data set of worldwide estimates of cancer incidence, mortality, andprevalence for the year 2000, which they called the Globocan2000. Their mortality estimates were based on vital registra-tion data where available; for other regions they usedinformation from survival models derived from availablecancer registry data (Sankaranarayan, Black, and Parkin1998). These mortality estimates did not correct for under-reporting in vital registration or for possible misclassifica-tion of causes of death. As part of the GBD 2000 Study, Mathers, Shibuya et al. (2002) used relative interval survival data from theSurveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)Program at the National Cancer Institute in the UnitedStates to develop an age-period-cohort survival model,which was further adjusted for levels of economic develop-ment. The model was then applied to age-, sex-, andsite-specific incidence estimates from cancer registries thatwere compiled for the Globocan 2000 and from otherspecific incidence studies. The model was useful to smoothout random variations in observed incidence and survivalrates that resulted from small numbers of cases or cases lostto follow up. The estimated cancer survival rates by site, age, and sex for different regions in the world were used as keyinputs to estimate the distribution of cancer deaths by site.Estimates of cancer mortality by region were then developed(Shibuya et al. 2002), correcting for levels of overall mortal- ity in regions with incomplete coverage of registration, andalso correcting for the likely differences in cause-of-deathpatterns that would be expected in uncovered and oftenpoorer subpopulations. As a result, the GBD 2000 Studyestimated a total of 572,000 deaths due to cancer within theregion. Wa r. Deaths due to war within Sub-Saharan Africa merit attention as an avoidable burden. Murray and colleagues (2002) used a comprehensive analysis of media reports, vitalregistration records, and adjustments based on observedrelationships between direct and indirect mortality to esti-mate the global burden of mortality due to armed conflict.Keeping in mind the limitations of estimates based largelyon qualitative analysis of media reports, conservative esti-mates were used for some of the major conflicts in theworld. According to these estimates, armed conflicts hadresulted in an overall death toll of about 77,000 for Sub-Saharan Africa for the year 2001. Estimating Cause-Specific Mortality Using all the various dimensions of cause-specific mortality estimation for Sub-Saharan Africa\u2014available data fromvital records, specific studies, and global disease epidemio- logical extrapolations for the region\u2014we have prepared estimates of causes of death in Sub-Saharan Africa based onthe GBD approach. Figure 5.4 summarizes the estimationprocess for countries within the region. As mentioned earlier, predicted proportions for broad- cause groups by age and sex were validated against informa- tion from country-specific vital records where available andfor neighboring or epidemiologically similar countrieswhere possible. Also, wherever applicable, cause-specificproportions from vital records for specific causes were usedin deriving population-level estimates for these causes. The resultant cause-specific structure was finally adjusted withdisease-specific mortality estimates to produce the overallnumbers of deaths by age, sex, and cause. National estimateswere summed up to totals for two subregions and for Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. During this process of synthesiz-ing epidemiological estimates into the overall demographicand cause-of-death model based on the broad-cause group 52| Chalapati Rao, Alan D. Lopez, and Yusuf Hemedenvelope of mortality, some of the disease-specific estimates described earlier were reduced to meet these envelope constraints. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Distinct differences exist between countries belonging to the two epidemiological subregions, essentially divided by the level of HIV/AIDS-related mortality within them. Overall, we estimate that about 10.8 million deaths (table 5.9) occurred in the year 2002 in the region, or just under 20 percent of global mortality. The age structure ofmortality roughly divides into 46 percent of deaths occur-ring before the age of 15 years, another 36 percent betweenthe ages of 15 and 59 years, and the remaining 18 percentat age 60 and above. It is not surprising, therefore, that five of the six esti- mated leading causes of mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa are Causes of Death | 53Source: Authors.WHO model life table UN population estimateCause-of-death model predictions of GBD group proportions by age Age-specific GBD cause group mortality estimate Disease-specific epidemiological estimates Final cause-specific mortality estimate by ageAge-specific mortality estimateAge-specific mortality riskFigure 5.4 Summary of GBD Process for Estimating Cause- Specific Mortality in African Countries Cause of death in Total deaths Cause of death in Total deaths Cause of death in Total deaths all persons (10,778,044) (%) males (5,557,783) (%) females (5,220,261) (%) 1 HIV/AIDS 20.4 1 HIV/AIDS 19.4 1 HIV/AIDS 21.6 2 Malaria 10.1 2 Lower respiratory infections 10.3 2 Malaria 11.0 3 Lower respiratory infections 9.8 3 Malaria 9.3 3 Lower respiratory infections 9.34 Diarrheal diseases 6.5 4 Diarrheal diseases 6.6 4 Diarrheal diseases 6.3 5 Perinatal conditions 5.1 5 Perinatal conditions 5.8 5 Perinatal conditions 4.5 6 Measles 4.1 6 Measles 4.0 6 Measles 4.27 Cerebrovascular disease 3.3 7 Tuberculosis 3.8 7 Cerebrovascular disease 4.1 8 Ischemic heart disease 3.1 8 Ischemic heart disease 3.1 8 Ischemic heart disease 3.1 9 Tuberculosis 2.8 9 Cerebrovascular disease 2.6 9 Tuberculosis 1.8 10 Road traffic accidents 1.8 10 Road traffic accidents 2.4 10 Pertussis 1.6 11 Pertussis 1.6 11 Violence 1.9 11 Road traffic accidents 1.2 12 Violence 1.2 12 Pertussis 1.5 12 Maternal hemorrhage 1.1 13 COPD 1.1 13 War 1.5 13 Nephritis and nephrosis 1.1 14 Tetanus 1.0 14 COPD 1.3 14 Tetanus 1.0 15 Nephritis and nephrosis 0.9 15 Tetanus 1.0 15 Diabetes mellitus 1.0 16 Malnutrition 0.9 16 Malnutrition 1.0 16 Malnutrition 0.8 17 War 0.8 17 Drownings 0.9 17 Maternal sepsis 0.8 18 Syphilis 0.8 18 Syphilis 0.9 18 COPD 0.8 19 Diabetes mellitus 0.7 19 Nephritis and nephrosis 0.8 19 Syphilis 0.8 20 Drownings 0.6 20 Prostate cancer 0.7 20 Hypertensive heart disease 0.8 21 All other specific causes 23.2 21 All other specific causes 21.4 21 All other specific causes 23.2 Source: Authors.

About 20 percent of the estimated2.2 million deaths due to HIV/AIDS are also predicted tooccur in childhood. Although the rank order of tuberculosis is almost similar in males (7) and females (9), the estimatednumber of deaths in males (about 210,000) is more thandouble that predicted in females (95,000). Similarly, roadtraffic accidents, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,and war were estimated to cause more than double thenumber of deaths in males than in females. In the entireregion, maternal conditions are estimated to cause 4.4 per-cent of deaths in females. A subregional disaggregation of the magnitude of cause- specific mortality sheds more light on the epidemiological variation possible in Sub-Saharan Africa. Two-thirds of thetotal mortality occurs in countries within the AFR E region,which contains just over half (54 percent) of the regionalpopulation. A comparison of the rank structure of leadingcauses of death between the two epidemiological subre-gions, AFR D and AFR E, is shown in table 5.10.The threefold difference in rank and percentage of deaths caused by HIV/AIDS between the two regions translates into a nearly fourfold difference in absolute numbers ofdeaths. There is reasonable similarity in the rank order andmagnitude of the other leading causes, when deaths due to all ages are combined. The importance of war as a cause ofdeath at all ages in AFR E stands out, being ranked as the12th leading cause. At childhood ages, the rank structure and proportion of deaths from individual leading causes is almost similar in thetwo regions, and between males and females, except for theHIV/AIDS subregional difference mentioned earlier. Overall,the subregional proportions of child mortality are nearlyequal; 48 percent of deaths occur in AFR D, and 52 percent occur in AFR E. Sex differentials too are slight, with 52 per-cent of deaths in males and 48 percent in females. Table 5.11 shows the leading causes of child deaths for the two subregions together. As expected, estimated leading caus- es in Sub-Saharan Africa are infectious diseases, perinatalconditions, and malnutrition. Two important implications ofthese observations are that childhood mortality remains a 54| Chalapati Rao, Alan D.

When comparing mortality during adulthood, however, there are sizable differences, both between the two subre- gions and, within each subregion, between males andfemales. The mortality differences between the two subre- gions, as seen from the leading causes for both sexes com- bined, are shown in table 5.12. The most striking feature is that the estimated number of deaths at these ages in AFR E is nearly double that estimated for AFR D. Readers will recall that the number of childhooddeaths in the two regions is nearly equal. From table 5.12it is clear that in AFR E, the HIV/AIDS epidemic and in specific countries, armed conflicts are the causes of theexcess mortality. Clearly, the number of deaths from each of the leading causes is significantly higher in AFR E, despite asomewhat similar rank structure of causes apart fromHIV/AIDS and war. As observed at childhood ages, the difference between mortality in males and that in females is minimal (52 to 48). The leading causes of mortality in each sex in AFR E areshown in table 5.13. Apart from the high burden of mortality due to infec- tious diseases, it is evident that injury-related causes of death among males, pregnancy-related causes amongfemales, and cardiovascular diseases in both sexes are major issues to be dealt with. The high mortality due to HIV/AIDSin both sexes has a major bearing on the occurrence of or- phanhood within these countries.

The leading causes of death at these ages are similar for the two mortality strata. For convenience, the discussion here will focus on the differencein the cause-of-death structure between the two sexes,aggregated for both regions together or, in other words, for Sub-Saharan Africa. As expected, in both sexes, cardiovascular diseases are estimated as the leading causes of mortality among the eld- erly (table 5.14). Among males, chronic obstructive pul-monary disease and prostate cancer are other leading causes,whereas in women, kidney disorders and diabetes mellitus are major causes of mortality. Cirrhosis of the liver is estimated as the 11th leading cause in males; the correspon-ding rank for women is taken by breast cancer. The presenceof lower respiratory infections, tuberculosis, diarrheal dis- eases, and HIV/AIDS among the leading causes of death inboth sexes, even among the elderly, clearly defines theimportance of communicable disease control in Africancountries. CONCLUSION Estimating cause-specific mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa poses a major epidemiological challenge. The availabilityof data and information on causes of death has increased within the region, and the results lead us to a few important observations. First, childhood mortality is a major cause ofthe high premature mortality rates in Africa, accounting fornearly half the total mortality in the region.As a corollary, the 56| Chalapati Rao, Alan D.

Second, the young adult population in countries within the AFR E mortality subregion is at significant risk of possible premature death from HIV/AIDS, armed conflictand other forms of violence, road traffic accidents, tubercu-losis, and, among women, causes related to pregnancy andchildbearing. Third, nearly a fifth of the mortality in the region occurs among individuals age 60 years and older. The proportion of deaths at these ages is much less than that observed indeveloped countries. For instance, in Australia, over 80 per- cent of deaths occur above the age of 60 years (ABS 2003).However, in Sub-Saharan Africa, the absolute number ofdeaths itself\u20141.92 million\u2014merits attention to the healthneeds of the elderly. At these ages, cardiovascular disease,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancers (prostatecancer in males, cervix and breast cancer in females), and,notably, infectious diseases are the major causes ofmortality. It is generally accepted that statistics from complete vital registration systems are the \"gold standard\" for nationalmortality statistics. Although cause-of-death information from vital records is subject to some biases on account ofquality of cause-of-death attribution within the system, thereis ample global evidence to justify a reliance on such data fornational cause-specific mortality analysis and estimation. It is heartening to note that countries within the region are making special efforts to improve vital registration systems. The process, however, involves huge resources, and can be expected to take decades before data of reasonable quality from national vital registration systems will beavailable for such estimation exercises. It has been observedin Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe that although thecoverage of registration of vital events by age and sex canbe improved rapidly by instituting certain administrativereforms, obtaining information on the cause of deathremains elusive, on account of deaths occurring at home inthe absence of medical attention in remote areas. An alternative system that has been tested and found effective has been sample registration, as has been employedin India and China. A representative sample of villagesor population clusters is routinely monitored for vitalevents, and upon death, a formal verbal autopsy procedureis employed to ascertain its probable cause. Initiatives suchas the Health Metrics Network (established by the WHO)are currently devising a framework for testing and establish-ing the Sample Vital Registration and Verbal Autopsy method of obtaining information on causes of death fornational mortality estimation purposes. This is the most viable interim solution to meet requirements of data for both health policy as well as for monitoring the impact ofhealth programs and interventions. The GBD method ofestimation, with the extensive use of models and extrapola- tions from specific epidemiological studies, may not be use- ful for the monitoring function. Another area of data collection that warrants attention at this stage is the function of physician certification of causeof death and the implementation of guidelines, based on theInternational Classification of Diseases, for coding and clas-sification of causes of death. Capacity building in these areas will assist national health information systems in providinguseful information on causes of death, at least in urban areas, where a significant number of deaths would occur inhospitals or where the deceased may have been attended by a physician in the time immediately preceding death. Undoubtedly, there is vast uncertainty about causes of death in Africa, but enough is currently known to prepare preliminary estimates, adhering to a rigorous scientificframework for evaluation of data quality and ensuring sub-stantial prudence in interpreting the findings. What data areavailable suggest that further, massive responses to the HIV epidemic are needed and that major communicable diseases and maternal health require scaled-up investments.Prevention of injuries, in part from war, would contributemuch to the improvement of health and survival of youngadult males. But what is most urgently needed is investmentin cost-effective methods to monitor mortality if we are notto be similarly ignorant about health conditions in Africa10 years hence.

The Coale-Demeny system is a system of model life tables that pre- dicts age-specific mortality rates based on two parameters only, the level of (usually child) mortality in any age group and some idea of the relation-ship between infant and child mortality, which define the family (N, S, E,W). The Brass logit system is a relational model life table system that pre-dicts the set of age-specific death rates from knowledge of any two rates(usually child and adult ages 15-59) and the choice of a survival curve asstandard.

Dye. 2002. \"Estimates of World-Wide Distribution of Child Deaths from AcuteRespiratory Infections.\" Lancet 2: 25-32.59The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) affects population size and composition in several ways. In partic-ular age groups, deaths increase directly from AIDS and may also increase indirectly, as orphans, for instance, face higher mortality risks. Fertility can be affected, not only biologicallybut also from changes in sexual behavior. Communities maybe weakened, and migration may alter the geographic distri- bution of the population. This chapter draws on the work of agencies that pro- duce global population projections to discuss the overall population effect of AIDS in Sub-Saharan African coun-tries. It does not attempt to elucidate all the mechanismsinvolved\u2014each of which deserves separate attention.Instead, the chapter focuses on the broad demographic impact. Decades after the start of the epidemics, estimatesof this impact generally ignore all subtle and indirect effectsand cover only the additional mortality directly from AIDS.Even this impact is highly uncertain. There is general agree-ment on substantial impact but no consensus on how sub-stantial and long lasting it is.APPROACH AND DATA The projections of demographic impact to be considered come from three agencies: the Population Division of theUnited Nations (UN), the U.S. Census Bureau, and theWorld Bank. Each agency has produced population projec-tions for most countries for some time. Up to 50 Sub- Saharan countries or territories are covered, although thesmallest ones are left out in some data series. For at least adecade, these agencies have explicitly incorporated the effectof AIDS in selected countries. In general, mortality due toAIDS is added to a life table for a given country, and thenoverall mortality is projected into the future together withother vital parameters in order to project population.Possible effects of AIDS on fertility (for example, Zaba andGregson 1998) and migration, except for indirect effects of mortality change, are not modeled. The projections vary not only because of the mortality assumptions but also because of assumptions about initialpopulation size and composition and fertility and migrationChapter6 Population and Mortality after AIDS Rodolfo A. Bulataotrends. These differences are not detailed here. A recent description and results are in United Nations 2003a, 2003b,2004; for the other two sets of projections, recent descrip-tions are difficult to find, but one might consult earlierdescriptions in McDevitt 1999, Bos and colleagues 1994, and National Research Council 2000. Results are in Stanecki 2004 and World Bank 2004. Although the approach to incorporating AIDS mortality in the projections is similar across agencies, important details are different. Agencies differ in how initial levels of mortalityare estimated and projected and how AIDS mortality is projected. United Nations Population Division The Population Division of the UN seeks to apply country life tables where available but mostly uses UN model lifetables. These are projected with reference to life expectancy, with gains expected to diminish as life expectancy rises. In the medium scenario (the only one considered here), the annual gain is 0.4 years for males and 0.5 years for females from a life expectancy level for both sexes combined of60 years, but the gain shrinks to 0.1 years for males and0.2 years for females when life expectancy reaches 75 years. AIDS mortality is added to the life tables for 38 of the 50 countries or territories in Sub-Saharan Africa. The remain-der, with reported low prevalence of the human immunod-eficiency virus (HIV) or no data from UNAIDS, are islandcountries, except for Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, and Somalia. A criterion of HIV prevalence no higher than1 percent appears to be used in excluding countries, but thesize of the affected population is also taken into account.(This is noticeable mainly outside Sub-Saharan Africa,because AIDS mortality is also added for China.) T o add AIDS mortality, a separate projection of HIV/AIDS in the population is necessary. The procedurebegins with reported levels of HIV prevalence among adults.With appropriate assumptions, the UN back-calculates theincidence of HIV and distributes cases by sex and age. Fromthe size of the infected population and the remaining, susceptible population, the UN estimates the trend in sub- sequent infections. It derives mortality associated with AIDSgiven assumptions about the progression of the infectionand adds additional mortality from perinatal infections. Lifetables are adjusted for the additional mortality. The Population Division has described the procedure for estimating AIDS mortality, which follows the recommenda-tions of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS(UNAIDS) Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling andProjections (UNAIDS Reference Group 2002), in World Population Prospects: The 2004 Revision (United Nations 2004, 136-79). Calculations start with estimates of HIV prevalence over time, mainly estimates for pregnant womenfrom antenatal clinics. The future trend of AIDS mortalityis basically an extrapolation, with appropriate adjustments,from this trend. HIV prevalence estimates as of 2001 aretaken from UNAIDS Reference Group 2002. For Djibouti,Gabon, Guinea, and Liberia, UNAIDS (2002) reports noestimate, and the UN Population Division makes its own.The source of estimates prior to 2001, used to establish atrend, is not specified, but is presumably the database main-tained by the U.S. Census Bureau and similar sources.Although an attempt is made to match the UNAIDS (2002) estimate for 2001, fitting a trend sometimes leads to an HIVprevalence figure that varies from it, by a maximum of 2 per-centage points (for Botswana) or 12 percent (for Uganda). U.S. Census Bureau The U.S. Census Bureau follows a similar but not identicalprocedure (Stanecki 2004). Usually, a life expectancy targetis set in the future without considering AIDS, and logistic curves represent the trend to this target, with appropriate life tables generated to match it. AIDS mortality is addedfor 37 Sub-Saharan countries. In contrast to the countriescovered by the UN Population Division, the Census Bureau does not introduce AIDS-specific deaths for Equatorial Guinea, The Gambia, and Sudan but does cover Niger andSenegal. The criterion for inclusion is national HIV preva-lence above 1 percent (as estimated by UNAIDS for 1999),HIV prevalence of 5 percent or more in low-risk urban pop-ulations, or a prevalence trend that suggests the latter levelwill soon be reached. Instead of modeling the AIDS epidemic in each country separately, the bureau takes a shortcut. It defines five epi- demic scenarios, progressively more severe, ranging from a\"low\" to a \"super high\" epidemic, each starting at an indefi-nite date. These scenarios are developed using a programlabeled iwgAIDS (Stanley et al. 1991), which models thespread of HIV infections, the development of AIDS, andsubsequent deaths in a population. Each scenario incorpo-rates the effect of increased condom use and shows HIVprevalence eventually plateauing and declining. Each country is assigned to a scenario, or more precisely to an interpolated scenario between an assigned pair ofthese five. The assignment is made by matching the reportedtrend in HIV prevalence in urban areas to scenario trends.T otal country prevalence is then used to determine dates for 60| Rodolfo A. Bulataothe epidemic. It is assumed that HIV prevalence will peak in 2010 and AIDS mortality will decline to zero by 2070. AIDS deaths are therefore added to the life table, from the projected epidemic, up to 2070, at which time the life table reverts towhat it would be without the epidemic. Uganda is treated as a special case, because of a reported decline in prevalence from the mid-1990s, which violatesthe assumption of a 2010 peak. Separate epidemics are mod-eled: a high one up to 1995 and a low one from 2005 on,with an interpolated epidemic in the intervening period. The initial HIV national prevalence levels used are simi- lar to those adopted by UNAIDS, relying heavily on report-ed infections among pregnant women. In this, the bureauprojections resemble those of the UN Population Division. However, the future trend imposed on prevalence is unusual.The year 2010 represents a later peak to the epidemics thanprojected by the UN, in most cases. Peak incidence, in55 percent of the Sub-Saharan cases in the UN projections,is before 1995, and in 95 percent of the cases before 2000.Although prevalence tends to peak later than incidence, thisis unlikely to adequately account for the long delays betweenUN incidence peaks and Census Bureau prevalence peaks. World Bank World Bank mortality projections begin with life tables that already incorporate AIDS. However, these life tables, devel-oped by the World Health Organization (WHO) for 2000, are constructed in a familiar way, with AIDS mortality being added to mortality from all other causes. The WHO takes estimates of child mortality ( 5q0) and adult mortality (45q15) and expands them into life tables for each country, using the Brass logit approach (Murray et al. 2000; Lopez et al. 2001). The child mortality estimates were selected from survey and census estimates after systematic review of available statistics (Ahmad, Lopez, and Inoue2000). The adult mortality estimates were more problematic.For Africa, plausible national estimates in the literature prior to 1990 (to exclude the effect of AIDS) were used, supple- mented where necessary with UN estimates (United Nations1998), and projected forward to 1999 and, later, 2000. T o add AIDS mortality, the WHO begins with reported HIV prevalence (based, as usual, on pregnant women) and works backward to HIV incidence and then forward toobtain an overall AIDS mortality level. (The researchers caution, based on preliminary work for Zimbabwe, that\"these models may overestimate the level of the epidemic\"[Salomon, Gakidou, and Murray 1999, 8], a point wereturn to below.) An age pattern of deaths, based on limiteddata from Tanzania, South Africa, and Zimbabwe (Lopez et al. 2001), is imposed, and AIDS mortality is then added to the life table. In projecting mortality forward from the initial life tables taken from the WHO, the World Bank does not attempt tomodel the HIV/AIDS epidemics in any way, but simplyassumes that their effect will gradually be reduced to zero by2020 at the latest (depending on the country), at which timecountry mortality trends resume a standard pattern used inthe Bank's projections. Comparisons Counterfactual projections that include no effect of AIDS are useful in assessing impact. Only the UN PopulationDivision provides detailed results for such a scenario. Thebureau has run such scenarios and provides brief descrip-tions but quite limited numerical information on the results (Stanecki 2004). The World Bank has no such scenario.Most comparisons to be made, therefore, will rely on the UNno-AIDS scenario. It is not obvious from the approach taken in each projec- tion set which should show the greatest current impact ofAIDS on population and mortality. For future impact, how-ever, a possible order emerges. Because the Census Bureauassumes a relatively late peak to the epidemics, one mightexpect greater demographic impact in its projections. Because the World Bank assumes a fairly direct decline inmortality impact, with the elimination of this impact by2020 instead of the Census Bureau's projection of 2070, onemight expect these projections to show the least futureimpact. This depends crucially on specific parameters, how-ever, and the results of comparisons need not be uniformacross countries. EFFECTS ON POPULATION SIZE, DECOMPOSED Population trends taking AIDS into account are illustrated for 2000-50 in figure 6.1, which compares results from thethree agencies. An additional line represents the special UNscenario with no AIDS mortality. For Sub-Saharan Africa asa whole, the three projections of total population are well below the no-AIDS scenario practically from 2000 and fairlyclose to each other up to about 2015. By 2020, somedivergence appears, with the Census Bureau projection0.1 percent above the UN projection and the World Bankprojection 2.5 percent below it. Divergence increases as theprojections lengthen, so that by 2050 the Census Bureau Population and Mortality after AIDS | 61projection is 8.6 percent above the UN projection and the World Bank projection is 9.4 percent below. This is thereverse of the relative impact one would expect from com-paring methodologies. Three countries are shown in figure 6.1: Nigeria, with the largest regional population and an HIV prevalence rate intermediate for the region (5.4 percent infected of adults 15to 49 years old, as reported by UNAIDS [2004] for 2003);Benin, with low HIV prevalence, for the region, of 1.9 per-cent in 2003; and Swaziland, with one of the highest HIVprevalence rates, for the region or the world, of 38.8 percent in 2003. For these individual countries, greater divergence in projections is evident than for the region as a whole, someof it clearly not due to AIDS mortality. The Census Bureau, for instance, projects a larger population than in the no-AIDSprojection for Nigeria by 2035, as well as a larger populationfor Benin all the way back to 1990. Although AIDS doesaffect population size, its effects are entangled with, and may be overwhelmed by, assumed change (or lack of change) inother parameters, particularly fertility. Fertility assumptions are indeed quite variable across the projection sets. The UN projection and the no-AIDS scenario, but not the other two projections, have similartotal fertility rates by design. World Bank estimates of totalfertility in Sub-Saharan countries for 2000-05 range from21 percent below to 23 percent above UN estimates, with atendency to be lower rather than higher. Census Bureau esti-mates, in contrast, range from 37 percent lower to 53 percenthigher than UN estimates, with a decided tilt toward beinghigher. The variation tends to increase, in percentage terms,for later years, at least up to around 2025. Higher bureau and lower Bank fertility projections appear to counteract theeffect on projected population of longer-lasting epidemicsfor the Census Bureau than for the Bank. 62| Rodolfo A.

Such scenarios are not available, at least not in sufficient detail, for the other two sets of projections, but we do attempt to separate the effects of thefertility and mortality assumptions. We decompose the ratioof populations from two separate projections into multi- plicative factors representing differences in the assumed base population and in fertility, mortality, and migrationassumptions. 1This decomposition does not specifically identify AIDS impact, but it at least helps us separate out the fertility and mortality effects. Table 6.1 shows the results for 2020 and 2050. The com- parison between the UN projection and the no-AIDS sce- nario (also from the UN) has some interesting points. Theprojected total population for 2020 is 89 percent of the projection without AIDS (as the first \"T otal\" column shows). Therefore, the overall reduction in population dueto AIDS is 11 percent by 2020, 17 percent by 2050. Most ofthis is due to mortality, but other effects also contribute. Partis due to differences in the base population, the populationassumed for the start of the projection in 2000. The UN esti-mates that AIDS had already produced some demographic effect before 2000, reducing regional population by over2 percent. The largest such effect across countries is 9 per-cent, for Zimbabwe. Births also have an effect\u2014a positive one in the UN projection, in contrast to the no-AIDS scenario. The effect issmall for the region as a whole, at 1.4 percent in 2020, rising to 2.6 percent by 2050. It is, however, positive for each coun-try where some effect of AIDS is modeled. Since the sametotal fertility is assumed country by country in the UNprojection and its no-AIDS scenario, this result deservessome explanation. Crude birth rates differ between the projections, as fig- ure 6.2 illustrates. For the region as a whole, the difference is relatively slight, but for countries severely affected byAIDS, the difference can be much larger, as in the projec-tion for Botswana. AIDS raises the crude birth rate becauseof its effect on the age structure. Figure 6.3 shows the dis-tribution by age group of women of reproductive age in Botswana. Whereas, without AIDS, the age distribution is projected, over 50 years, to gradually become rectangularover the range of 15 to 49 years, with AIDS it remainsskewed toward those under 35. This translates into a highercrude birth rate because fertility is higher among womenunder 35 years. The fertility advantage of younger women isassumed to decline over time, but the decline does notentirely offset the relative increase, when AIDS is taken intoaccount, in proportions of younger women. The effect isentirely distributional and does not involve any assump- tions about the biological impact of HIV , which, if it weretaken into account, might moderate the result somewhat.AIDS does not increase the number of births, but theseresults indicate that it does increase the ratio of births to thepopulation.

Part of this, as for the UN, may be due to the effect of AIDS on the age structure, but a larger part is simply higherassumed fertility than in the no-AIDS scenario. As expected,the births effect is negative for the World Bank. The direct effect of mortality on population size in the projections is of course negative and much larger in the absolute than the effect of fertility, implying a reduction inpopulation size for the region, if the UN projection is com-pared with the no-AIDS scenario, of 10 percent by 2020 and8 percent by 2050. For the region as a whole, the mortalityeffect is roughly comparable, if the U.S. Census Bureauprojections or the World Bank projections are compared withthe same standard. We expected the Census Bureau to show a stronger mortality effect than the World Bank, given theassumption of longer-lasting epidemics, but the reverse is thecase, except when the most affected countries are considered.

Although the agencies generally agree about which countries are more affected by AIDS mortality, their estimates of the degree of this effect vary, particularly for the most affected countries.For countries where the UN estimates that AIDS mortalityreduces population in 2020 by at least 20 percent, theCensus Bureau estimates that the population reduction on average is 5 percentage points less, and the World Bank estimates that it is 8 percentage points less. For countrieswhere the UN estimates a population reduction of at least20 percent by 2050, the Census Bureau estimates an average reduction that is 3 percentage points less, and the World Bank a reduction of 13 percentage points less. These comparisons involve not only AIDS mortality but mortality generally. It is likely, however, that the differences have to do mainly with variation in AIDS mortality thanin mortality from all other causes, although this cannot beestablished. At any rate, the results fail to substantiate anygeneral agreement about the demographic effect of AIDSmortality.LIFE EXPECTANCY Looking at other mortality indexes does not help further specify the AIDS effect but does provide additional perspec-tives on the severity of the impact. Figure 6.5 shows some projected life expectancy trends. For Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, the UN Population Division indicates that by2000-05 life expectancy had already fallen 8.8 years shortof what it would be without AIDS and that the relative deficit will grow to a maximum of 10.4 years by 2010-15 before beginning to shrink slowly. The Census Bureausuggests that the current deficit is slightly smaller, and theWorld Bank suggests it will shrink slightly faster. For theregion as a whole, there is not great disagreement about lifeexpectancy trends. For individual countries, however, the differences among projections can be substantial. The UN projections start (in 2000) with a much higher estimate of life expectancy forNigeria than the other two projections, a gap that is generallymaintained over time. For Benin, the Census Bureauprojects a substantial fall in life expectancy, unlike the other two agencies. For Swaziland, the decline in projected lifeexpectancy up to about 2010-15 is greatest for the UN,which has it falling to 30 years. The decline is smallest forthe World Bank, for which the minimum, in 2005-10, is 43 years. Subsequent trends for Swaziland are also quitedifferent: the UN projects a long, slow recovery; the WorldBank sees a quick, rapid recovery; and the Census Bureaufinds a delayed but accelerating recovery. How far life expectancy falls depends on current esti- mates of HIV prevalence. Figure 6.6 shows the maximumfall in life expectancy by country, when each set of projec-tions is contrasted with the no-AIDS scenario. In the UNprojection, a country loses four years of life expectancy when HIV prevalence is 2.5 percent among adults, and a littlemore than one additional year of life expectancy for every1 percentage point rise in HIV prevalence. 2The U.S. Census Bureau projects a similar result (when the comparison is made to the UN no-AIDS scenario), and the World Bankprojects a somewhat less serious effect, particularly at highHIV levels. The greatest effect on life expectancy is most often seen in the period 2015-20. For the UN, the periodmay be five years earlier or later, but for the Census Bureau,there is less temporal variation. For the World Bank, however,the period of maximum deficit is 2005-10, and this is fairlyconstant across countries. The crude death rate is affected similarly. The maximum increase in the rate is about 7 per 1,000 people when HIVprevalence is 2.5 percent, rising to 25 per 1,000 when HIVprevalence is 35 percent. The greatest increase in the crudedeath rate tends to be a few years earlier than the greatest loss in life expectancy. The decline in life expectancy affects women more than men. Worldwide, in the period 2000-05, women had a4.3 year advantage in life expectancy. In Sub-Saharan Africa,their advantage would have been 3.1 years without AIDSand would have stayed essentially constant up to 2050 (inthe no-AIDS scenario). Because of AIDS, their advantagehas fallen to 1.9 years, according to the UN projection, andwill fall further to 0.6 years for most of the period 2010-25,before recovering slowly, to barely more than 1.5 years by 2050. The Census Bureau shows less of a change, with thefemale advantage at 2.2 years in 2000-05, falling undertwo years during 2005-15, and recovering more quickly toabout four years by 2050. (The World Bank does not providethese data.) Country by country, projected trends in the female advantage can look strikingly different (figure 6.7).Although there are some commonalities in country pat-terns, the UN and the Census Bureau appear to disagreeabout many aspects of these trends: what the female advan-tage is initially, when and how steeply it declines, and if andwhen it begins to increase again. The Census Bureau gener- ally assumes an earlier decline in the female advantage thanthe UN but a somewhat shallower decline at lower HIVprevalence levels. In both sets of projections, the femaleadvantage falls by a year for every 4 to 5 percentage pointincrease in initial HIV prevalence. This can turn the femaleadvantage into a disadvantage. Where HIV prevalence reaches 20 percent or more, female life expectancy usually falls, at some point in the pro- jection, at least two years below male life expectancy. Most of these countries are in southern Africa, or in the slightlybroader Southern African Development Community(SADC). The UN always shows some recovery by 50 years,although in the worst case, Botswana, the female disadvan-tage, at 4.5 years, is still extreme at the end of this period.The Census Bureau, in contrast, shows either a quick and substantial recovery, as is shown in figure 6.7 for Zimbabwe, or an apparently unarrested fall, as for Namibia, where thefemale disadvantage exceeds seven years by 2050. Long-termtrends, particularly where HIV prevalence is high, are a par-ticular area of disagreement. The changes in life expectancy, and in the female advan- tage, are the result, of course, of rising adult mortality. The estimates of adult mortality ( 45q15) used in the projections are available only for the UN. These show the substantial rise in mortality over projected trends without AIDS, as well 66| Rodolfo A.

The increasesin the risk of death between ages 15 and 60, relative to thesituation without an AIDS epidemic, can be substantial. IfHIV prevalence in 2001 is 10 percent, the maximum increase in risk over the following two decades is, on averagefrom a quadratic regression, 29 percentage points for malesand 34 percentage points for females. If HIV prevalence is30 percent, the increase in risk is 65 percentage points formales, 75 percentage points for females. Population by Sex and Age The shrinking (and occasionally disappearing) female advantage in life expectancy is projected to alter the sexratio, although for national populations the effect is notlarge. For a handful of southern African or SADC countries,the sex ratio may rise 10 to 20 percentage points in the UN projection and slightly more in the Census Bureau projec- tion. As a result, the highest sex ratio in these projectionswould be about 120 males per 100 females. This is notunprecedented. In 2000, five countries\u2014all in the PersianGulf and none particularly affected by AIDS\u2014had higherratios, up to 190 males per 100 females. National sex ratiosapproaching 120 could be destabilizing, depending on theflexibility, or lack of it, of particular cultures. At specific ages, sex ratios may become more extreme. Figure 6.9 illustrates the situation for Zimbabwe, one of the countries most affected by AIDS mortality. Over decades,the imbalance between males and females resulting fromhigher female AIDS mortality produces a hump in the sexratio, which, in this case, reaches about 230 in the year 2030for those age 50 to 54 years. This hump, as it rises, graduallymoves toward older and older ages and eventually begins to Population and Mortality after AIDS | 67Sources: Calculated from Stanecki 2004 and United Nations 2004.U.S. Census UN no AIDSZimbabwe01234 1990 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050Sub-Saharan Africafemale advantage (years) female advantage (years) female advantage (years) female advantage (years)year /H110026/H110024/H11002224 06 1990 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 01235 4 1990 2000 2040 205 0 year /H110028/H110024 /H110026/H11002224 06 1990 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 205 0 yearFigure 6.7 Female Advantage in Life Expectancy, Sub-Saharan Africa and Three Selected Countriesdemographic transition\u2014toward lower dependency, a stalled fertility decline is at least as effective an impediment. Initial Assumptions Is it possible to sort out the differences in projections andcome to some reasonable conclusions about the likely demographic impact of AIDS? There is no way to determine in advance which forecasts will be most accurate inthe decades to come. The only useful approach to assessing the relative adequacy of the different projections, therefore,would be to look at their methodology, especially the waythey model the effects of HIV/AIDS. These models, however,are quite complex, not completely transparent, and beyondthe scope of this chapter to critique in detail. We thereforesettle for examining some of the initial assumptions that gointo these projections, particularly assumptions about adultmortality and HIV prevalence. These two sets of parametersundergird projections of AIDS impact. For the World Bank projections, calculations of adult mortality can be made from the WHO life tables for 2000 (Lopez et al. 2002). Similar calculations can be made fromUN survivorship ratios; for 2000, we average estimates forthe periods 1995-2000 and 2000-05. (Similar data are notavailable from the Census Bureau.) UN figures are plottedagainst WHO figures by country in figure 6.11. The UN and WHO adult mortality estimates generally agree. On average, UN estimates are only 1 percent lowerthan WHO estimates. (The differences may be slightlygreater at high mortality levels.) Figure 6.11 also shows,however, another set of estimates of adult mortality, derivedby Timaeus and Jasseh (2004) from sibling histories and 68| Rodolfo A.

Having almost two-and-a-half males for every female at older ages is unusual, but whether it is a seriousissue depends on the culture. Where age patterns are involved, the dependency ratio might be a particular concern. A low dependency ratio, implying a relatively large workforce, could be an economicadvantage, but AIDS impedes progress toward a lower ratioby increasing adult mortality more than infant and childmortality. How great the effect is, though, is difficult to tell.In the countries most severely affected by AIDS, the depend-ency ratio might rise from 50 or 60 dependents per 100 adultsof working age to 70 or 80 dependents. Comparison of theUN projection with the no-AIDS scenario suggests such arise for various countries in southern Africa. However, the exact level of the dependency ratio will be heavily influencedby future fertility, about which there appears to be little con-sensus (figure 6.10). The apparent effect of AIDS is easilyswallowed up by differences in assumed fertility trends.Although AIDS does delay the movement\u2014typical in theincorporating recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data. These estimates, which cover seven countries,appear consistently lower than those from the WHO and the UN. (The only exception is for Zimbabwe, where the WHO estimate, but not the UN estimate, is slightly lower.) The gapappears to be substantial. The probability of dying betweenages 15 and 60, averaged without weighting across the seven countries, is between 51 and 57 percent in the WHO and UN estimates (depending on which estimates and which sex isinvolved). The averages for Timaeus and Jasseh's estimates, incontrast, are 44 percent for males and 34 percent for females. Somewhat more countries can be compared for 1995, for which year Timaeus and Jasseh (2004) cover 20 countries. These estimates are mostly well below the UN estimates for 1995 (estimated as the average for 1990-95 and 1995-2000).The average probability of dying between ages 15 and 60across the 20 countries is 36 percent for males and 29 per-cent for females, according to Timaeus and Jasseh (2004).According to the UN, the respective averages are 50 percentfor males and 42 percent for females.The Timaeus and Jasseh (2004) estimates cannot be con- sidered an entirely reliable standard because of the limited data on which they are based and the assumptions necessaryin their calculation, such as the assumption of a commonage pattern of mortality increase across countries (see also chapter 4 in this volume). Nevertheless, the consistentlylower levels of adult mortality they determine may suggestsome overstatement in the UN and WHO mortalityestimates, which could be tied to an overestimation in themodeling of the mortality impact of AIDS. Without getting into the intricacies of these models, we can look at the estimates of HIV prevalence with which the modeling starts. These are generally UNAIDS estimates for2001. The UN estimates, as noted earlier, begin with these estimates but may be adjusted in order to fit the prevalencetrend. The Census Bureau maintains the database thatUNAIDS uses in making its estimates and reports similarfigures, at least for countries for which it has estimates. Thesource of the WHO estimates is not specified but is presum-ably the same.

In 2004, UNAIDS (2004) revised these estimates, changing almost twice as many downward as upward. The changes were sometimes large. UNAIDS (2002) had previously reported \"low\" and \"high\"estimates to bracket their main estimates for 2001.In 10 cases,the new estimates were lower than the previous \"low\" esti- mates. In only two cases were they higher than the previous \"high\" estimates. The adjustments may have been made toensure consistency with new estimates for 2003. These weregenerally lower than the earlier 2001 estimates, which mighthave suggested epidemics on the decline. Instead, by lowering2001 estimates, UNAIDS can speak of \"stabilization\" in HIVprevalence in the region, which it attributes to a balance between deaths and new infections. Figure 6.12 compares UNAIDS estimates of HIV preva- lence in 2003 with the earlier estimates for 2001 (UNAIDS 2002, 2004). Among the reductions, 15 countries have 2003rates that are at least 1.5 percentage points lower than theearlier 2001 estimates, three of them at least 5 percentagepoints lower. Among the increases, only one country (Swaziland) has a 2003 rate at least 1.5 points higher thanin 2001. Between 1999 and 2001, in contrast, increases and decreases in prevalence were more balanced, with increasesbeing slightly more likely and somewhat larger. If the epidemics are indeed at a plateau or past their peak, that may be uncomfortable for the agency projections. TheCensus Bureau projections are inconsistent with this idea,since they assume that peak prevalence is not reached until2010. Whether the UN projections are consistent withplateauing epidemics is not clear. The UN reports that peakincidence for the epidemics\u2014not peak prevalence\u2014wasreached on average about 1994, which could be consistentwith some decline in prevalence by 2001. Country by coun- try, however, there is no relationship between an earlierassumed incidence peak for the UN and the amount ofapparent prevalence decline in the UNAIDS estimates. Onlythe World Bank projections, which effectively assume that AIDS-related mortality is already in decline, would be con-sistent with the interpretation of epidemics in at least earlydecline in the region. The correction of 2001 HIV prevalence rates is also uncomfortable for projections, which relied on the earlier rates. The correction seems to have some basis. Table 6.2compares UNAIDS estimates with estimates from DHS datafor five countries. Based mainly on antenatal clinic reports,the earlier UNAIDS estimates were typically higher than theDHS estimates. Among these countries, rather high rates for Kenya and Zambia were brought into the range of the DHSestimates, and rates for the other three countries were alsolowered. The survey estimates are meant to cover the adult popu- lation more comprehensively than sentinel surveillancesystems based on special populations, especially pregnantwomen. Survey estimates do have their own problems, such 70| Rodolfo A.

The survey reports suggest one important reason why earlier UNAIDS estimates could have been too high. In four out of five cases, male prevalence is clearly lower than femaleprevalence. The exception, in Burkina Faso, occurs at a low prevalence level. This is in keeping with the typical patternexpected in primarily heterosexual epidemics, where maleinfections are initially more frequent than female infections,but the reverse eventually becomes the case. Given thatUNAIDS applies rates for pregnant women to the popula-tion as a whole, earlier overestimates are certainly plausible,particularly at higher HIV prevalence levels. Further down-ward adjustments in prevalence may be needed as moresurveys become available. They will, of course, come too late for the current set of population projections, all of which\u2014if this interpretation is correct\u2014start out from too-highlevels of HIV prevalence and therefore AIDS deaths. Revised Projections These projections may be revised, in later rounds, to allow for slightly lower current adult mortality overall and, partic-ularly in the most affected countries, either lower or declin-ing HIV prevalence levels, if further research confirms eitherto be the case. Pending such revision, precise conclusions about the demographic impact of AIDS in the region cannotsafely be drawn. The revisions to the projections might haveto be substantial in some cases. For Kenya, for instance, theUNAIDS estimate of HIV prevalence for 2001 was 15.0,and the current set of projections depend on this estimate.The 2003 estimate fell to 6.7, consistent with DHS results.The 2001 estimate implies that the maximum reduction inlife expectancy\u2014relative to the no-AIDS scenario\u2014wouldbe 17.7 years, using the equation in note 2. The 2003 estimate implies a maximum reduction half as large, at 8.7 years. T o get a further, although only preliminary, idea of how projections might change in the most affected countries,we draw on projections recently prepared for the CentralStatistical Offices (CSOs) in Zambia and Botswana (Bulatao2003a, 2003b). The Zambia projection adopts HIV preva-lence estimates from the 2001-02 DHS rather than fromUNAIDS. The DHS data suggest that HIV prevalence amongall adult women is only 75 percent of that among pregnantwomen, and that male prevalence is still lower. Theseassumptions are adopted for the neighboring country ofBotswana, for which DHS data are not available. Botswana, with a relatively good health system for the region, has mon-itored the proportion of males infected, based on clientsat counseling and testing centers. The proportion of malesinfected is, indeed, lower than that for women. Surveillancedata on the age distribution of both men and womeninfected in Botswana also match quite closely the distribu-tions in the Zambia DHS. 3 Other procedures for these CSO projections follow World Bank methodology. However, in place of WHO life tables incorporating AIDS mortality, Coale-Demeny (1983) life tables without AIDS are used, so that AIDS mortality can be specifically modeled. The modeling follows the usualprocedures, involving calculations of HIV incidence fromprevalence and estimation of subsequent deaths, relying on procedures previously described (Bulatao and Bos 1992) but with curves fit to prevalence trends rather than specificcalculations, from sexual behavior, of transmissionprobabilities. The Zambia projection begins with a 1980 census, in order to incorporate the effects of an epidemic initially rec- ognized about 1984, and progresses to 2025. The Botswana projection begins with a 1981 census and goes to 2031. Theassumed total fertility trends were constructed from censusand survey data, some of them only locally available, but aregenerally in the range of those that the UN, the CensusBureau, and the World Bank assume for the country. Figure 6.13 compares the projected population with the previous projections.

Which of the preceding projections the CSO projections are closest to is determined more by fertility assumptions than themodeling of the AIDS effect, since the World Bank has thehighest fertility trend for Botswana and the Census Bureau for Zambia. By 2025, the CSO projections give a Zambia population 6 to 32 percent larger than the other projections,but still almost 20 percent below that in the no-AIDS sce-nario. For Botswana at the same date, the CSO projection is10 to 30 percent higher than the others but almost 30 per-cent below the no-AIDS scenario. Like the World Bank, butunlike the UN and the Census Bureau, the CSO projections show no population decline.If we look instead at projected life expectancy (fig- ure 6.14), the differences from the other projections stand out as sharply. For Zambia, the CSO projection showslevels 5 to 10 years higher than the other projections for theperiod 2000-25, although still about 10 years short of what the no-AIDS scenario shows. For Botswana, all three agencyprojections show a similar decline up to about 2000,followed by rapid divergence. The CSO projection shows nofurther decline beyond 2001-06, so that about 2025 lifeexpectancy is 15 to 25 years higher than in the other projec-tions, although almost 15 years below the no-AIDS scenario.Adjusting projections to incorporate somewhat lower sur-vey estimates of HIV prevalence could therefore have a sub-stantial effect. In these severely affected countries, it reduces the deficit in life expectancy for 2025 by anywhere from one-third to two-thirds. 72| Rodolfo A.

Sophisticated models of the course ofHIV/AIDS epidemics have been developed and linked withpopulation projection approaches that have proved relative- ly reliable in the past (National Research Council 2000).However, these projection models have used inadequatedata on mortality and HIV/AIDS. The regional projections, part of the global work done by three agencies, the UN Population Division, the U.S. CensusBureau, and the World Bank, show the population of Sub-Saharan Africa falling below what it would be without AIDS,by 11 to 13 percent by 2020 and by anywhere from 10 to25 percent by 2050. For individual countries, the population shortfall is projected as high as 34 to 48 percent by 2020 and48 to 68 percent by 2050. That there will be a shortfall rela-tive to what it would have been had HIV/AIDS not invadedthe region is certain. That it will be of these dimensionsis not. Each of the projections of countries affected byHIV/AIDS starts with UNAIDS estimates for HIV preva-lence in 2001, some of which were clearly overestimates.For how many this is true cannot yet be told. Between 2002 and 2004, UNAIDS generally revised downward its estimates for 2001 adult HIV prevalence inSub-Saharan Africa. DHS data show sharply lower estimatesof adult prevalence in three countries, and UNAIDS madematching adjustments for two (and somewhat smalleradjustments for the rest). For countries where HIV preva-lence is high, initial overestimates could have been due tothe practice of generalizing prevalence estimates for preg-nant women to the adult population. Prevalence amongmales tends to be lower than among females, particularly athigher levels. Unfortunately, the population projections available rely on the earlier estimates of HIV prevalence. This could lead to overstated base adult mortality, as well as to an overstatedfuture trend in AIDS deaths. Comparing projections thatrely on survey-based HIV estimates suggests that, in severelyaffected countries, the reduction in population due to AIDSmay be only 50 to 75 percent of what the agency projectionsshow and that life expectancy may be reduced, at themaximum, by a third to two-thirds of what agency projec-tions show. If the agency projections are not, at present, a reliable guide to future populations in areas affected by HIV/AIDS, they nevertheless illustrate patterns of demographic impact.The effect on population does appear larger when countriesare strongly affected by HIV/AIDS. However, even in these cases, AIDS is not necessarily the dominant factor in futurepopulation trends nor the main source of uncertainty aboutthem. Fertility is at least as important. Differing judgmentsabout future fertility trends can produce at least as great variation in future population as the variation betweensituations with and without an AIDS epidemic. Fertility itself is affected by HIV/AIDS. Y ounger women are more likely to be infected than older women, but theireventual deaths leave gaps in the age structure that persistinto and become increasingly evident at older ages. Crudebirth rates actually rise slightly as a result, because younger,more fertile women continue to be replenished in the agestructure. Unfortunately, this compositional effect is the only effect on fertility that can be seen in current projec- tions. Biological and behavioral mechanisms that may lead to lower fertility are insufficiently understood to be modeledacross countries. The effect of HIV/AIDS on mortality, the primary mech- anism by which it affects population growth in agency pro-jections, appears substantial but may be overblown. Lifeexpectancy is projected to fall a maximum of one year belowits expected path for every one percentage point increasein initial HIV prevalence. With UNAIDS adjusting its esti-mates of HIV prevalence downward, life expectancy shouldprobably be expected not to decline as much. For Kenya, for example, UNAIDS reduced its estimate of 2001 HIV preva- lence from 15 to 8 percent. The projections show maximumloss in years of life ranging from 15 to 21 years, but a small-er loss of 8 to 14 years would seem more likely. Given that the HIV/AIDS epidemics in Sub-Saharan Africa are mainly heterosexual, the rise in mortality affectswomen more than men. The female advantage in lifeexpectancy will shrink and could turn into a female disad-vantage. This effect too depends on levels of HIV preva-lence, and the projections may overstate the change. Effectson the sex ratio, as well as on age structure, are moresubstantial at high HIV prevalence levels, but even in thesecases they do not appear to produce patterns more extremethan those seen in other populations. Each agency projection will undoubtedly be revised in the future to take adjusted HIV prevalence levels intoaccount. How they came to adopt HIV prevalence levels thatwere too high is an interesting question. The agencies devotesome effort to ensuring that they use the best possible esti-mates of current fertility and mortality. Perhaps they havenot spent as much effort carefully considering the accuracyof input data on HIV/AIDS and have been insufficientlycritical of UNAIDS reports. Even with the adjustments Population and Mortality after AIDS | 73made to previous HIV prevalence estimates, there remain some that probably deserve closer scrutiny. There also remain other challenges to future rounds of these projections. Although data on HIV prevalence are gradually improving, what path the epidemics will take onthe downslope remains conjectural. How therapies and vac-cines may help, what behavior changes can be anticipated, and what the implications for infections and deaths will be are matters about which little if any empirical informationcan be adduced. In this area projections are, at best, edu-cated guesses. Another challenge will be managing the complexity of the methodology to project AIDS mortality. Complexityneed not itself be a problem, but where it disguises a poverty of data and lends an inappropriate air of authoritativenessto results while concealing the calculations on which theyare based, it can easily mislead. Projections need to convincenot only with sophisticated models but also with a goodappreciation of historical patterns and trends. More trans-parency would probably make it easier not just to detect theweaknesses of the projections but also to better appreciatewhat they actually contribute. NOTES 1.

Bulatao75Empirical, longitudinal, population-based data on mortality in Africa have, until recently, been unavailable. This criticalinformation gap for Sub-Saharan Africa became even more evident as an impediment to our understanding of health and disease in Africa with the arrival of a major new causeof rapidly increasing mortality in the form of HIV/AIDS.At about the same time, during the 1990s, many large-scale mortality intervention trials were conducted at the commu- nity level, principally for understanding the efficacy of newinterventions such as vitamin A supplementation, and theuse of insecticide-treated mosquito nets for malaria control(Alonso et al. Binka et al. 1996; Nevill et al. 1996; Rosset al. 1995). All these trials used demographic surveillancesystems (DSSs) to measure the impact of mortality. These successful mortality intervention trial efforts focusedrenewed attention on the usefulness of DSSs for illumi-nating the fundamental age, sex, and cause structure ofmortality in resource-constrained settings in Africa. Themalaria intervention trials themselves forced a completereconsideration of the previously underestimated role ofmalaria as a direct and indirect cause of mortality in Africa(Breman, Egan, and Keusch 2002). More and more DSS sitesestablished for these trials have continued to operate long after the end of the original trials and have proved increas-ingly useful for both researchers and policy makers(Armstrong et al. 1999; de Savigny et al. 1999; TanzaniaMinistry of Health 1997). Accurate data on mortality conditions in Africa are still scarce. Until recently, the main tool for bridging this gap was the use of indirect demographic estimation techniques andmodel age-specific mortality schedules produced by Brassand colleagues (1973), Coale and Demeny (1966), and theUnited Nations Department of International Economic andSocial Affairs (1982). The Brass relational system is based onempirical data collected in West Africa during the middle ofthe twentieth century. In contrast, neither the Coale and Demeny nor the UN model life table systems use significantamounts of data collected from Africa. Moreover, all three ofthe systems are based on 30- to 50-year-old data. Given thedramatic demographic changes that have affected Africa inthe past 20 to 30 years and the fact that two of the systemsare based largely on data collected from other regions ofthe world, whereas the third is based on data from only oneregion of Africa, it may be problematic to use them in theChapter7 Levels and Patterns of Mortality at INDEPTH DemographicSurveillance Systems Osman A. Sankoh, Pierre Ngom, Samuel J. Clark, Don de Savigny, and Fred Binkacurrent African context. No doubt, the World Fertility Survey (WFS) and the Demographic and Health Surveys(DHSs) have remedied the above situation in part byincreasing our knowledge of the level, trends, and differen-tials in infant and child mortality in the developing world. Also, since independence, several African countries have undertaken national censuses, but mortality data from these sources are often plagued with underreporting and need,therefore, to be adjusted using hypotheses that are notalways realistic. Much of the developing world is not adequately covered by accurate vital registration systems, leading to a substan-tial lack of direct empirical data describing mortality.Because planning must still be undertaken, information on mortality is inferred through interpolation or extrapo-lation from existing commonly observed age patterns ofmortality\u2014the so-called model life tables. These modelage patterns of mortality are used to substitute, extend, orfill in where observed mortality data are missing and areoften key ingredients in methods used to estimate demo-graphic indicators from sparse data. Underlying epi-demiological profiles are inferred based on those that areknown to underlie the existing model of mortality patternsthat most closely match the observed data. The closest-fitting model patterns are then used, among other things,to estimate levels of child mortality and create population projections. DSSs bridge the data gap that exists in resource- constrained countries. A DSS refers to a methodological approach for monitoring a registered, dynamic cohort of thetotal population of a geographically confined area. TypicalDSS populations monitored include at least 60,000 individ-uals per site. This is usually sufficient to provide adequatesample sizes to monitor trends in all-cause mortality andthe most common cause-specific mortality, by sex and agegroup. Members of the dynamic DSS cohort are registeredas such during an initial census. New members enter thecohort either by system-registered births or in-migrations,and members exit either by system-registered deaths orby out-migration. Causes of death are determined for alldeaths by verbal autopsy. Continuous cycles of reenumera-tion maintain an accurate person-time denominator andhelp identify numerator events such as pregnancies, births,deaths, and migration. These cycles of reenumeration typi-cally take place three to four times per year in order to opti-mize the chance to identify pregnancies and thus determineoutcomes of pregnancy. In addition to the routine datacapture performed by specialist teams of enumerators andsupervisors, larger numbers of community key-informants continuously notify the system of birth or death events forimmediate follow-up. Only events occurring to registered households and members are linked to the database for analysis. Sophisticated field operational logistics and linkeddata quality control and computing systems support thisroutine DSS surveillance (MacLeod, Phillips, and Binka 1995; Phillips, MacLeod, and Pence 2000). DSS sites can generate accurate population structures, person-years atrisk, mortality rates, cause-specific mortality rates, propor-tional mortality, fertility rates, and rates of internal andexternal migrations. In addition, because of the intensity ofhousehold survey frequency, DSS sites commonly docu-ment a large array of contextual information on household structures, dependency, occupation, education, access toand use of services, as well as socioeconomic status. A typical DSS produces more than 100 health- and poverty-monitoring indicators annually on each household. Details of DSS concepts and methods are provided by INDEPTHNetwork (2002). On the completeness and reliability of data produced by DSS, Korenromp and colleagues (2003) wrote in theirreview paper,\"For Africa, with an increasing number of sitesthat monitor cause-specific mortality at a population levelby means of standard methods under the INDEPTH net-work, DSS may at present form one of the more complete data sources.\" And WHO/UNICEF (2003, 20) conclude intheir Africa Malaria Report \u20142003 that \"[a]t present, the most reliable data on trends in malaria death in children under 5 years of age is obtained from demographic surveil-lance systems (DSS).\" In 1998 a large number of DSS sites formed an interna- tional network called the INDEPTH Network. Details ofthe sites, their locations, the populations they follow, andbasic demographic outputs of each site are available on theInternet (www.indepth-network.net) and in INDEPTHNetwork (2002). The central purpose of the INDEPTHNetwork is to facilitate cross-site analyses of comparabledata across broader geographic areas with more diverse cir-cumstances in order to answer questions that cannot beanswered within individual sites. Comparative mortalityand mortality patterns are an obvious first endeavor of sucha network, and these are provided in this chapter. By theefforts of the members of the INDEPTH Network, for thefirst time schedules of mortality in Africa and empiricaldata on age standardization and on age and sex structureare available. This network is the source of the analysespresented in this chapter. 76| Osman A. Sankoh, Pierre Ngom, Samuel J. Clark, Don de Savigny, and Fred BinkaStandardized mortality rates were computed based on the new INDEPTH Network standard population that for the first time is derived from empirical data. The INDEPTH standard population typifies the true structure of the youngpopulation in Sub-Saharan Africa. The chapter then pres-ents basic life table indicators for INDEPTH sites, based ontheir age-specific mortality rates over the 1995-99 period. Seven new mortality patterns are developed from more than 4.2 million person-years of observation at the AfricanINDEPTH sites. These patterns are demonstrated to be sub-stantially different from conventionally used model mortal- ity patterns applied to Africa. LEVELS OF MORTALITY AT INDEPTH NETWORK SITES The data used in this chapter come from 17 DSS sites in Sub-Saharan Africa for which information on mortality wasavailable for at least a full year from 1995 to 1999 (table 7.1). The overall average length of the observation period for the contributing sites is four years. The data yield a total of 3,979,155 person-years of exposure, during which 55,356deaths occurred. An average of about 17 percent of the person-years exposed were lived at ages younger than fiveyears, and an average of 39 percent of the deaths alsooccurred between birth and age five. The crude death ratefor both sexes combined ranges from a low of 7 per 1,000 inAgincourt, South Africa, to 39 per 1,000 in Bandim, Guinea- Bissau. Overall Mortality The crude death rate and the expectation of life at birth are the two indicators used in this section to examine overalllevels of mortality at the INDEPTH sites. In order to removethe influence of each site's age structure and to make thecomparison of the crude death rates more reasonable, it is necessary to standardize such rates. T o do this, there areseveral widely used standard age distributions, includingSegi's world standard and World Health Organization(WHO) standard age distributions (Est\u00e8ve, Benhamou, andRaymond 1994). Both of these standards reflect populationswith relatively low fertility and mortality. Consequently,they give significant weight to the middle years of life. All theINDEPTH sites record information from relatively young Levels and Patterns of Mortality at INDEPTH Demographic Surveillance Systems | 77Reporting Duration Observed Observed Crude Deaths Person-years Site Country period of period deaths person-years death rate under age 5 (%) under age 5 (%) Agincourt South Africa mid-year to mid-year annual periods resulted in a five-year reporting period from July 15, 1994, to July 15, 19 98.Table 7.1 Summary of Mortality Data from INDEPTH Sites, 1995-99populations with comparatively high fertility and high mortality. Under those conditions, there are proportionally more young people in the population, giving it a \"younger\" age distribution. When the Segi or WHO standard age dis-tributions are applied to the INDEPTH data, they give toomuch weight to the relatively high mortality rates prevailingat middle and older ages and too little weight to mortality at younger ages. Consequently, the absolute level of the age- standardized crude death rates produced with those stan-dards significantly overestimates the true level of mortalityat the INDEPTH Network sites. T o address this problem and create age-standardized crude death rates that more accurately reflect the true levelof mortality at the INDEPTH sites, we have constructed the INDEPTH standard age distribution. An average agedistribution is constructed for each site over the period1995-99 by taking the weighted average of the person-yearsof exposure in each age group across all the years for whichdata are reported. The weight for each year is the totalnumber of person-years reported for all ages during thatyear. The INDEPTH standard age distribution is calculatedby taking the weighted average of the individual site aver-age age distributions in each age group. In this case theweights are the total number of person-years in each ofthe individual site average age distributions. In figure 7.1, the younger age distribution of the INDEPTH standard,which is typical of developing countries, is contrasted withthe much older population structures of the Segi and WHOstandards.Table 7.2 displays the crude death rate for each site and the age-standardized crude death rates calculated using both the INDEPTH and Segi standard age distributions alongwith the values for the expectation of life at birth. The INDEPTH Network standardized crude death rates range from 7 to 33 per 1,000 for males and 5 to 27 per 1,000 for females, revealing a wide range of mortality at theINDEPTH sites. The figures for the expectation of life atbirth vary in a relationship that is loosely inverse to thevalues of the crude death rate (figure 7.2), and they cover asimilarly wide range of from 66 to 36 years for males and 74to 40 years for females. The data from Bandim are anom-alous and reflect some unresolved questions concerning themanner in which they were collected and reported. There is some geographic clustering. T ogether at the low end of the spectrum are three rural sites from Tanzania (Hai, Ifakara, and Rufiji) and one site in Senegal (Mlomp).In the middle of the pack are three sites in West Africa:Farefenni, Nouna, and Oubritenga. At the high end there isa mixture of sites from West, East, and southern Africa. Theabsolute level of mortality varies considerably over space;sites located close to each other have similar levels of mor-tality, but all major regions of Africa show a wide range ofmortality levels. For the most part the sex differentials are relatively small but are generally in favor of females, as expected. Two of thesites in southern Africa\u2014Agincourt, in South Africa, andManhica, in Mozambique\u2014have significant male migrationand register more substantial sex differentials, which standout in contrast to the rest of the sites. Bandim, West Africa,also records a substantial sex differential, but as noted abovethere may be a methodological explanation for this. Infant and Child Mortality The measures of child mortality displayed in table 7.3 are the life table probabilities of dying in a specified age group: 1q0for ages zero to one year,4q1for ages one to five years, and5q0for ages zero to five years. The conventional infant mortality rate\u2014the ratio of the number of deaths below one year of age and the number of births for a given period\u2014is also included. As shown in figure 7.3, there is a wide range in the level of child mortality. The probability that a newborn dies before reaching its fifth birthday ranges from 32 per 1,000 to255 per 1,000 for males and 34 per 1,000 to 217 per 1,000 forfemales. The Agincourt site in South Africa records acomparatively low level of child mortality. Another cluster, 78| Osman A. Sankoh, Pierre Ngom, Samuel J.

The next higher cluster is composed ofsites from various regions of Africa including Dar es with 5q0close to 175 per 1,000 for males and and Bandafassi, Senegal\u2014all have substantially higher values of 5q0closer to 225 per 1,000. There is a wide range in the level of child mortality, but except at the lowest and highest levels, there does not appear to be any geographical clustering. The lowest levels are defi- nitely found in South Africa, whereas the highest levels arereported from West Africa. Table 7.3 also displays the ratio of 1q0to 4q1in order to elucidate the changing risk of death faced by children before and after their first birthday.1This ratio reveals that children in Rufiji who survive to age one face a probability of death that is improved by nearly a factor of four, whereas childrenSenegal; and Bandafassi, Senegal\u2014where there is a clear dif- ference favoring females, except in Rufiji, where males arefavored. Adult Mortality Values for the probability that persons who survive to theirtwentieth birthday will survive to their fiftieth birthday, thatis, 30q20, are displayed in table 7.4 along with values of5q0 and the ratio of5q0to 30q20.2There are wide variations in the levels of adult mortality from 159 per 1,000 to 501 per1,000 for males and 112 per 1,000 to 421 per 1,000 for females. A number of sites record substantial differences in adult mortality between sexes\u2014Agincourt, South Africa;Hai, Tanzania; Manhica, Mozambique; Mlomp, Senegal; andNavrongo, Ghana, in particular. There also exists the opposite differential, wherein female mortality rates exceed male rates, at two sites: Rufiji, Tanzania; and Dar es Salaam,Tanzania. The human immunodeficiency virus andacquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) andmaternal mortality may explain these patterns. For the first time, Agincourt in South Africa does not define the low end of the range. There also does not appear 80| Osman A. Sankoh, Pierre Ngom, Samuel J. Clark, Don de Savigny, \u2014 /H11005not available.Table 7.3 Infant and Child Mortality (per thousand) 0 Source: INDEPTH Network 2002. 1005q0 per Probability of Dying between Birth and Age Five (5q0) in Bandafassi face a nearly constant probability of dying throughout the first five years of life. Differences in child mortality according to sex are rela- tively small and do not appear to consistently favor one sex over the other. Interestingly this pattern is broken by four sites\u2014Manhica, Mozambique; Rufiji, Tanzania; Niakhar,to be any substantial geographical clustering of similar risk of adult mortality within the region. The cluster of moder-ate risk includes sites from all major regions of Sub-Saharan Africa as does the high risk cluster. The relationship between child and adult mortality reveals two distinct groups: sites in West Africa and those in the rest of Africa. Some of the West African sites clearlyrecord levels of child mortality that are high relative to thecorresponding levels of adult mortality. In the West Africansites of Senegal; Farefenni, Senegal, this is theresult of unusually high child mortality coupled with sub-stantial adult mortality. INDEPTH NETWORK MORTALITY PATTERNS This section summarizes the method used to identify the seven INDEPTH patterns of mortality. For a full descriptionof the process, see INDEPTH Network 2002, chap. 7. Keyconsiderations in identifying common underlying patterns(empirical regularities) are the filtering out of small, unim- portant, and potentially random variation; the reduction ofthe dimensionality of the data to as few dimensions as possible; and the provision of a common reference to whichall of the observed patterns can be compared. Principal Components The principal components technique is used to identify 15 age components that together are able to represent all buta negligible amount of the variation in age patterns of mor-tality among the 70 male and female site periods. In fact, thefirst four of these components represent the vast majority of the variation in the original data. When recombined withthe appropriate weights the components are able to repre-sent all the observed age patterns of mortality in theINDEPTH database, and furthermore, by choosing differentweights any arbitrary age pattern of mortality can be repre-sented to within a negligible error. The first four principal components address all three of the key considerations important to identifying common underlying patterns: by dropping the other components much of the small-magnitude, random noise is eliminated;the dimensionality of the data is reduced to four weightsinstead of 18 age groups; and the four principal components Levels and Patterns of Mortality at INDEPTH Demographic Surveillance Systems | 81Male Female Site5q03 0 7.4 Adult Mortality and Child and Adult Mortality Ratio (per thousand)provide a common reference against which all the observed patterns can be compared. The task then becomes how to identify similar observed patterns. Clustering The aim of cluster analysis is to identify groups of similar objects. The objects are usually described by a vector ofnumbers representing measurements of some attributes of the objects. In this case, the vectors each contain four coeffi- cients representing the weights on the first four principalcomponents that are necessary to reproduce a givenobserved mortality pattern. 3The hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to identify five clusters of similar mortality patterns for males and seven for females. Because the seven female patterns are quite different from one another and because the male patterns corresponding to the two addi- tional female patterns are grouped together in the male clus- ters, the seven female clusters are chosen as the final clustersof observed mortality patterns. Once the clusters are identified the person-year weighted average of the individual age patterns in each cluster is cal-culated to yield the characteristic age pattern of mortalityfor each cluster. The Seven INDEPTH Mortality Patterns The seven commonly observed age patterns of mortality emerging from the INDEPTH data are sufficiently differentfrom the existing model life tables (INDEPTH Network 2002) to qualify as new mortality patterns; and because almost all the data on which they are based come from Africa, they are African patterns appropriate for use inAfrica. The natural log-transformed, ln( nqx), values are dis- played in figure 7.4. Underlying epidemiological profiles underpinning each pattern are still being identified. The INDEPTH Network is actively engaged in gathering and analyzing information on cause of death corresponding to the raw mortality rates pre-sented here. Once that work is complete, it will be possibleto identify the specific causes of death contributing to eachpattern. However, until that time we must speculate andinfer from what is known about the regional distribution ofmajor causes of death in Africa. The following discussion of the patterns has largely been excerpted from chapter 7 of Population, Health, and Survival at INDEPTH Sites (INDEPTH Network 2002).Pattern 1. The first pattern is similar to the Coale-Demeny North and UN Latin American model life table age patterns of mortality (INDEPTH Network 2002). There is no indica-tion that HIV/AIDS affects pattern 1, and the male andfemale age patterns are similar with the exception of a bulgein the female pattern during the reproductive years, pre-sumably caused by maternal mortality. Pattern 1 is primarilyderived from sites in West Africa over the entire period cov-ered by the INDEPTH Network data set. HIV/AIDS has notyet become as significant a problem in West Africa as it is incentral and southern Africa, so a large impact of AIDS in thedata from West Africa is not expected. It is worth noting thatchild mortality between the ages of one and nine is signifi-cant and substantially elevated above the most similar exist-ing models. This is in keeping with the fact that malaria is asignificant cause of death in West Africa, and it has a largeimpact on those ages. Pattern 2. The INDEPTH Network pattern 2 is derived largely from Asian data and for that reason is not discussed here; see INDEPTH Network 2002 for a discussion ofpattern 2. Pattern 3. The sites contributing to pattern 3 are almost exclusively located in southern Africa and East Africa, South Africa and Tanzania in particular. This pattern obviouslycontains some influence of HIV/AIDS but not nearly to thedegree observed in pattern 5. The South African data comefrom the Agincourt site (INDEPTH Network 2002), wheremortality is extraordinarily low compared with the otherINDEPTH sites in Africa, and where HIV/AIDS is recog- nized but does not yet affect the population in the cata-strophic sense that it does in other parts of southern andEast Africa. The remainder of the data come from the Dar esSalaam site, where the impact of HIV/AIDS appears to begreater. This pattern is most similar to the UN Far East pat-tern of mortality, corresponding to the low infant and child mortality compared with mortality at older ages (INDEPTH Network 2002). A noteworthy feature of this pattern is thatinfant and child mortality does not appear to be substan-tially elevated, as might be expected when HIV/AIDS is animportant contributor to mortality. Timaeus (1998) sug-gests that the strong secular decrease in child mortality thathas been observed in many settings in Africa during the lat-ter half of the twentieth century may largely cancel out theincrease in child mortality brought about by HIV to yieldapproximately unchanging child mortality, rather than the 82| Osman A. Sankoh, Pierre Ngom, Samuel J. Clark, Don de Savigny, and Fred BinkaLevels and Patterns of Mortality at INDEPTH Demographic Surveillance Systems | 83male female Source: 1-7, ln(nqx)increase that might be expected when HIV is having such an easily observed impact on adult mortality. Pattern 4. Pattern 4 is a variation on pattern 1 with the important difference manifested in the 35 to 69 age range. At all other ages, patterns 1 and 4 are negligibly different except that infant and child mortality in pattern 4 is consis-tently slightly lower than pattern 1. But between ages 35 and,roughly, 69 pattern 4 reveals significantly higher mortalitythan pattern 1. This pattern is most similar to the UN gen-eral pattern for females and UN Latin American pattern formales (INDEPTH Network 2002). As was the case with pat-tern 1, most of the data contributing to pattern 4 comesfrom West Africa. Pattern 5. The HIV/AIDS pattern of mortality is most clearly visible in pattern 5. The data contributing to pattern 5 are derived from the three Tanzanian sites run by the AdultMorbidity and Mortality Project (AMMP) in Dar es Salaam,Hai, and Morogoro (INDEPTH Network 2002). There is astriking bulge in the mortality of males between the ages of20 and 54 and for females between the ages of 15 and 49.The female bulge is significantly narrower and more pro-nounced, corresponding to the earlier infection of thefemale population and within a tighter age range than themale population. This pattern is not particularly similar toany of the existing model patterns, but it is most closelymatched with the UN General (female) and Latin American(male) model patterns (INDEPTH Network 2002).Pattern 5 differs from pattern 3 mainly in the shape of theHIV/AIDS impact. The effect is more diffuse with age inpattern 3, meaning that mortality is elevated through abroader age range, the magnitude of the elevation is moreconsistent, and the differences between the sexes are lessapparent. Pattern 3 is derived largely from the Dar es Salaamdata, and this may reflect the fact that the epidemic is more mature in Dar es Salaam and has consequently had enough time to infect a wider age range of people of both sexes. Aswith pattern 3, it is worth noting that infant and child mor-tality do not appear to be substantially affected in a mannercomparable to adult mortality. Pattern 6. Pattern 6 is one of the two additional patterns identified in the female data. It is an interesting pattern that reveals high mortality of children and teenagers and com-paratively low mortality of infants and adults of all ages.This pattern is exhibited by sites in northeastern Africa andWest Africa, with most of the data coming from Ethiopia.Without additional information, it is not possible to specu- late on what may be producing this unique pattern. Themale pattern is most similar to the Coale-Demeny Northmodel pattern, and the female pattern is closest to theCoale-Demeny West model, both of which embody high mortality in the same age ranges (INDEPTH Network2002). They deviate from those patterns in that infant mor- tality is substantially less than would be found in either model pattern, and child and adolescent mortality is signif-icantly higher: this might be called the \"Super North\" pattern. Pattern 7. Pattern 7 is the other additional pattern identi- fied in the female data, and it, too, is interesting. It is derived from two sites located in central and West Africa. The reasonit was identified in the female data is obvious; there is asubstantial bulge in the female age pattern between ages 25and 44. This pattern comes mainly from one small site inZambia, so it is probably not worth extensive interpretation.The corresponding male pattern is similar to pattern 6, andboth are similar to the Coale-Demeny North model pattern(INDEPTH Network 2002). The North model pattern con-tains relatively high child and teenage mortality coupledwith comparatively low mortality at older ages. This is con-sistent with the fact that malaria is an important contribu-tor to mortality in both sites. CONCLUSION In their 1996 review of demographic models, Coale and Trussell (1996) describe the identification of \"empiricalregularities\" as one of the central motifs of demographic modeling. Their term accurately describes the formulation of model mortality schedules and hints strongly at the lim-its of their usefulness. Because there are no general, reliable,theory-driven models of the individual risk of death, we must rely on commonly observed patterns to guide us\u2014 empirical regularities . Because these are simply commonly observed patterns, however, we must be careful not to inap-propriately overinterpret them or substitute them for athorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying therisks of death that lead to each pattern. Beyond being thefirst step in understanding these mechanisms, identifying underlying empirical regularities in age patterns of mortal-ity is still a useful exercise in its own right. With fertility and to a lesser degree migration, mortality shapes the size and age composition of a population and is 84| Osman A. Sankoh, Pierre Ngom, Samuel J. Clark, Don de Savigny, and Fred Binkaconsequently of great interest to policy makers who must adequately plan for the future of a population. Mortality is one of the most valuable indicators of the health of a popu- lation and, as such, is of critical importance to those whomanage health care infrastructures. As a sensitive indicatorof where a population is and where it will be in the nearfuture, knowledge of mortality is a vital component of pop- ulation planning and management. Existing systems of model life tables include systems developed by the Population Branch of the United Nations Department of Social Affairs (1955) in the early 1950s, by Coale and Demeny (1966) in the early 1960s, by Ledermann and Breas (1959) in the late 1950s, by Brass (1971) in the late1960s, and finally by the UN again in the early 1980s (United Nations Department of International Economic and SocialAffairs 1982). Only two are in common use today; the Coaleand Demeny system and the 1982 UN set. However, neitherof these systems was formulated with anything more thantrivial data from Africa: apart from the West pattern thatappears to contain a small amount of data from the whitepopulation of South Africa, none of the Coale and Demenypatterns is based on data from Africa; and apart from a smallamount of data from Tunisia, neither are the recent UNpatterns. The lack of empirical data from Africa underlying either of the commonly used model mortality systems is a signifi- cant problem for demographers working in Africa, asPreston, Heuveline, and Guillot (2001) eloquently state: \"Alimitation, common to all the systems discussed so far[excluding the 1982 UN models], is that their empiricalbasis consists almost exclusively of the experience of devel-oped countries. Most applications of model life tables,however, are addressed to developing countries with incom-plete data.\" Making this problem worse is the dissimilarity of the epi- demiological profile of large parts of Africa to that of the developed world; it is clear that malaria and HIV are prima-rily to blame. Both increase overall levels of mortality andmay affect certain age groups disproportionately. The signif-icant endemic prevalence of these two diseases is responsi-ble for vast excesses in mortality in some of the harder hitage groups; malaria for young children and HIV for childrenand young-to-middle-aged adults. It is clear that the existing model mortality patterns are not appropriate for use in Africa, given that they were notbuilt using data from Africa and that there is good reason tobelieve that the mortality profile of Africa is different fromother parts of the world. Until now, however, there has beenno alternative. It is to begin addressing this need that the INDEPTH Network has compiled a database of primarilyAfrican empirical mortality data and has begun to identify common age patterns of mortality described by those data (INDEPTH Network 2002). DSS site data are sometimes challenged as being unrepre- sentative (Lopez et al. 2000) of surrounding constituencies due to the history of clinical and community-based inter-vention trials that are conducted in such populations fromtime to time. However, there is little evidence that the mor-tality patterns in trial sites are markedly different from thoseprevailing in similar settings nearby, where trials have notbeen conducted. The reason for the paucity of evidence isthat most trials are conducted on a subset of the population, and they target a specific cause of mortality. Usually theinterventions do not continue after the trial, unless theyare adopted as broad implementation policy (for example,insecticide-treated nets), whereby the nontrial areas are, within a few years, at the same level of coverage for the inter-vention. We must also appreciate that our health system interventions have relatively weak modulating effects onpopulation mortality compared with secular trends insocioeconomic circumstances and environmental forces.We should recognize that the modest population size of aDSS site does not constitute a major flaw, however, as evensites monitoring small-sized populations can producerobust measures of age-specific mortality when data areaggregated over a period of several years. Moreover, datacollected over long periods of time from the same popula-tion living in the same area can reveal important age-specific trends in the risk of death. Furthermore, when datafrom a number of widely dispersed sites are broughttogether, they provide both a geographically and temporallyrepresentative measure of mortality conditions. At present,only DSS sites provide data that can be used to depict thetemporal and geographical contours of mortality patternsin Africa.

Clark, Don de Savigny, and Fred Binka87Child undernutrition remains one of Africa's most funda- mental challenges for improved human development.Because the time and capacities of caregivers are limited, far too many children on the continent are unable to access and effectively use at all times the food and health services theyneed for a healthy life. An estimated 200 million people onthe continent, both children and adults, are undernour- ished, their numbers having increased by almost 20 percent since the early 1990s (FAO 2003). This undernutrition startsearly in life\u2014more than a third of African children underthe age of five are stunted in their growth and must face arange of physical and cognitive challenges not faced by theirbetter-nourished peers. Malnutrition underlies 55 percentof all deaths of children under five years of age globally (Pelletier et al. 1994), and undernutrition is the majorrisk factor for over 28 percent of all deaths in Africa\u2014some2.9 million deaths annually (Ezzati et al. 2003). Further,Pelletier and Frongillo (2003) have shown that had coun-tries in Sub-Saharan Africa reduced undernutrition ratesover the period 1975-95 at the same modest rates as otherregions of the world, the region would have experienceddeclines in under-five mortality rates 28 percent lower thanthose currently achieved. Childhood and maternal under- nutrition is the primary risk factor contributing to almost30 percent of the estimated annual burden of disease onthe continent (table 8.1). The continuing human costs ofundernutrition for individual Africans as measured by its contribution to high mortality and morbidity and unreal-ized human potential are enormous, and the aggregate costsat the national level impose a heavy burden on efforts tofoster sustained economic growth and improved humandevelopment. It is important to recognize the links between undernu- trition, poverty, and, at the aggregate level, broad economicgrowth and national development. A necessary componentfor the success of new initiatives in Africa against poverty must be a sharp reduction in the current high levels ofundernutrition. Broad-based economic growth is necessaryto increase incomes and consumption and thereby to reducepoverty. Economic growth can primarily be achievedthrough enhanced economic productivity. Enhanced pro-ductivity comes about through broad improvements in theintellectual, physical, and technical capacity of the popula-tion. The potential intellectual, physical, and technicalChapter8 Trends and Issues in Child Undernutrition Todd Benson and Meera Shekarcapacity of the population is dependent on improved nutri- tion, particularly for young children and women in theirchildbearing years. Similarly, the effective use of such capac- ity is dependent on a properly nourished population in which individuals are living healthy and active lives and areable to creatively contribute to their own and the nation'seconomic well-being. Malnutrition in any stage of childhood affects schooling and, thus, the lifetime earnings potential of the child. Malnutrition affects educational outcomes, including areduced capacity to learn (as a result of early cognitivedeficits or lowered current attention spans) and fewer totalyears of schooling. In Zimbabwe, stunting, via its associationwith a 7-month delay in school completion and a 0.7-year loss in grade attainment, has been shown to reduce lifetimeincome by 7 to 12 percent (Alderman, Hoddinott, andKinsey 2003). In general, in low-income agricultural coun-tries, the physical impairment associated with malnutritionis estimated to cost 2 to 3 percent of gross domestic product(GDP) per year, even without considering the long-termproductivity losses associated with developmental andcognitive impairment (Horton 1999). Iron deficiency inadults has been estimated to decrease productivity between5 and 17 percent, depending on the nature of the work per- formed (Horton 1999). Data from 10 developing countries have shown that the median loss in reduced work capacityassociated with anemia in adults is equivalent to 0.6 percentof GDP , whereas an additional 3.4 percent of GDP is lost asa result of the effects on cognitive development attributableto anemia in children (Horton and Ross 2003). The impactof iodine deficiency diseases on cognitive developmentalone has been associated with productivity losses totalingapproximately 10 percent of GDP (Horton 1999). It is only when Africans have improved nutrition security that we will begin to see sustained progress toward theachievement of the aspirations laid out in the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDG), in the plans under the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), and in themany national poverty reduction strategies. WHAT CAUSES UNDERNUTRITION? The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) conceptual framework of the determinants of the nutritional status ofchildren shown in figure 8.1 presents a generalized under-standing of how undernutrition is the outcome of specificdevelopment problems related directly to the dietary intake and the health status of the individual. The quality of theseimmediate determinants, in turn, is determined by theunderlying food security status of the household in which achild resides. However, of equal importance is the availabilityof health services and a healthy environment and the qualityof care the child receives\u2014that is, whether the availabledietary resources for good nutrition are used effec-tively through appropriate caring practices. Sustainedhealthy and active life is only possible when these underly- ing determinants\u2014food, health, and care\u2014are each maxi-mized. None of these is sufficient in itself, but all are neces-sary for good child growth. The degree to which these three underlying determinants are expressed positively or negatively is a question of resources. These resources include the availability of foodbut extend much further to include the physical and eco-nomic access that a child or his or her caregiver has to thatfood, the caregiver's knowledge of how to use available foodand to properly care for the child, the caregiver's own healthstatus, and the control the caregiver has over resources with-in the household that might be used to nourish the child. Finally, the level of access to information on and services for 88| Todd Benson and Meera ShekarChildhood and maternal undernutrition 29.5 Underweight 18.0 Iron deficiency 2.9Vitamin A deficiency 4.7 Zinc deficiency 3.9 Other nutrition-related risks 3.0 High blood pressure 1.3 High cholesterol 0.6High body-mass index (BMI) 0.4 Low fruit and vegetable intake 0.4 Physical inactivity 0.3 Sexual and reproductive health risks 20.1 Unsafe sex 19.4 Lack of contraception 0.8 Environmental risks 10.1 Unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene 5.3Indoor smoke from solid fuels 3.5Other 1.1 Occupational risks 0.7 Addictive substances 2.9 Source: Ezzati et al. 2003.

Total estimated DALYs lost annually in Africa is 349,513,000.Table 8.1 Percentage of Total Estimated Annual Burden of Disease in Africa Attributed to Major Risk Factorsmaintaining health, whether preventive and curative health services are available, and the presence or absence of ahealthy environment with clean water, adequate sanitation,and proper shelter all contribute equally to determining thenutritional status of a child. When the distribution of resources within society is cen- tral to accounting for why some are undernourished and others are not, the framework moves from the realm of theindividual and household to the political. The frameworklinks the availability of nutrition resources to a set of basicdeterminants, which are themselves a function of how soci-ety is organized in regard to economic structure, politicaland ideological expectations, and the institutions throughwhich activities within society are regulated, social values are met, and potential resources are converted into actualresources. Consequently, this conceptual framework identi-fies undernutrition as a subject for political debate and anissue of immediate concern to any national development strategies. Finally, it is important to recognize from this framework that a household or nation being food secure is not in itselfsufficient to ensure the good nutritional status of children and others within that household or nation. It is possible tohave poor nutritional outcomes without being food insecure.Food security is concerned with physical and economic access to food of sufficient quality and quantity. However, one mayhave reliable access to the components of a healthy diet, butbecause of poor health or care (such as poor infant-feedingpractices), ignorance, or personal preferences, one may notbe able or may choose not to use the nutrients to which onehas access. In parallel to food security, one can speak of nutri- tion security. Nutrition security is achieved for a household when secure access to food is coupled with a sanitary envi-ronment, adequate health services, and knowledgeable care.

Outcome Indicators Table 8.2 provides a summary of the principal measures of both individual and aggregate nutritional status. Ofthese, the most commonly employed are the anthropo- metric measures of child nutritional status\u2014stunting, underweight, and wasting. Children with abnormally lowgrowth are identified by comparison with the growth characteristics of children of a similar age, disaggregatedby sex, in a standard, nutritionally secure population.Children whose growth is more than two standard devia-tions (Z-scores) below the mean physical characteristics forthe nutritionally secure reference population are consideredundernourished. 1 Of the other indicators of aggregate nutritional status, infant and under-five mortality and low birthweight preva- lence are important proxy measures of nutrition security. Low birthweight reflects fetal growth retardation due to thepoor health and nutrition of the mother and also serves as an indicator of risk of infant mortality and future poorhealth. From a life cycle perspective on nutrition and theintergenerational transmission of poverty within society, aspresented in figure 8.2, low birthweight is a critical measure.Finally, measures of micronutrient deficiency are critical for assessing undernutrition in Africa. The burden of disease attributed to micronutrient deficiencies is often referred toas \"hidden hunger\": The clear link between a lack of suffi-cient food to eat and a poor physical state that one sees with a lack of carbohydrate, protein, and fat in the diet is not asreadily seen when considering micronutrient deficiency.Subclinical levels of deficiency can have serious andirreparable consequences on health, mortality, and eco-nomic productivity. There are four principal micronutrientdeficiencies of public health concern in Africa\u2014vitamin A,iron, zinc, and iodine. Table 8.3 shows their principalsources and the health effects of deficiency. Input Indicators The three underlying determinants of child undernutrition are household food security; quality of care; resources forhealth, including access to health services; and a healthyenvironment (figure 8.1). These three inputs to the processdetermine nutritional outcomes both for individuals and for populations as a whole. It is important to recognize thatbalance is required across these factors if undernutrition isto be sustainably reduced. Food availability, access to food, and diet quality are various dimensions of food security that can be measured.Among the most common measures of access to food at the national level is the Food and Agriculture Organization ofthe United Nations (FAO) undernourishment measure,which takes into account food availability from productionand trade and, using the distribution of consumption levels across the population, estimates what proportion of thepopulation is unable to meet its daily energy requirements.Similar assessments can be made using detailed house-hold consumption surveys. Dietary quality assessments canbe made using information from both commodity-disaggregated national food balance sheets and householdsurveys. Although these estimates are by nature imprecise,and there are many valid critiques of them, in the absence ofbetter indicators they are used extensively to monitor food security status. Direct measurement of quality of care is more problem- atic, requiring the use of proxy measures. Female educationand literacy levels are important elements in this regard.There is considerable evidence that the nutritional status ofchildren varies directly with the level of education of their parents, and in particular, their mothers. Women who have more education are better able to understand important nutritional care practices and to follow them with the chil- dren in their care. An additional contribution to nutritionalcare is the availability of public health services, particularlyfor prenatal care and infant health and growth monitoring.

Finally, proxy measures for therelative control that women are able to exercise over their own and their household's income and other resources have also been shown analytically to be significantly correlatedwith the nutritional status of children in the household(Smith et al. 2003). The more control women have over suchresources, the more likely it is that those resources will beused to provide proper nutritional care to children in thehousehold. A broad range of measures can be used to assess the degree to which good nutrition is assured by available health services and a healthy environment. These includeaccess to health facilities and health professionals, the bur-den of disease that health systems must bear, immunizationcoverage, the percentage of mothers receiving prenatal care,the use of safe drinking water and sanitation facilities, andso on. Finally, general and household welfare measures\u2014 income, assets, and poverty\u2014are also important in account- ing for the nutritional status of children. Within theconceptual framework, these cut across the underlyingdeterminants considered in the previous paragraphs\u2014for example, increased income will increase access to food, tohealth care, and to child care resources\u2014and emerge, inpart, from the basic determinants beneath the underlyingdeterminants of the framework. Moreover, as was noted ear- lier, improved nutrition is itself an important determinantof economic growth and improved welfare\u2014the relation-ship between these welfare measures and child nutritionalstatus is neither linear nor one way. Nevertheless, they areimportant, relatively nonspecific inputs into the nutritionalprocess. Data Sources The principal data sources for nutritional outcome indica- tors for Sub-Saharan Africa come from DHS surveys carriedout by national statistical offices. These surveys also containconsiderable information on nutritional caring practices.The World Health Organization (WHO) has compiled child undernutrition data from these and other surveys into aglobal database on child growth and malnutrition (WHO2003). Other data sources for nutrition-related indicatorsinclude national population and agricultural censuses fordemographic and agricultural production information,household economic surveys for welfare and consumptionmeasures, and facilities surveys for access to social services. 92| Todd Benson and Meera ShekarMicronutrient Principal dietary sourcesa Health effects of deficiencyTable 8.3 Effects of Deficiency of Micronutrients and Principal Dietary Sources Source: Compiled by authors. a.

Underlying cause of iodine deficiency is a deficiency of iodine in the local soil on which vegetation grows, animals graze, and cropsare cultivated. This results in a shortage of iodine in local food-stuffs. Iodine fortification is the principal source of iodine, usuallythrough iodized salt.In deficient populations, improvements in vitamin A status are associated with a 23 percent overall reduction in mortality amongunder-five children.

Iodine deficiency is linked toreduced economic productivity.STATUS AND TRENDS IN CHILD UNDERNUTRITION Although poor nutrition and hunger affects all ages, the long-term development and welfare implications are espe-cially important for young children because most undernu-trition happens in the womb or in the first two years of life.Much of this early damage\u2014both physical growth and brain development\u2014is irreversible (SCN 2004, p. 40). Moreover,as the nutritional status of these children when in the wombis an important determinant of their developmental poten-tial, maternal undernutrition is of equal concern. Figure 8.2shows how undernutrition can be perpetuated across gener-ations from mother to child in a spiral of poverty anddespair. Consequently, sustainably enhancing the nutri-tional status of young children and their mothers is the keyintervention in breaking this cycle to enable each succeeding generation to aspire to an increasingly healthy life. In most of Sub-Saharan Africa increased levels of under- nutrition are strongly associated with the age of the child. The decline in nutritional status from birth is astonishinglyswift as newborns in many African households face achallenging health environment and, in many cases, receivesuboptimal feeding, that is, lack of exclusive breastfeedingand inappropriate or untimely complementary feeding.Although the average nutritional status of newborns inthese countries is similar to that of the well-nourished refer-ence population, by about the age of 12 to 15 months abouthalf of the children are underweight (weight-for-age Z-score less than /H110022.0) with very little improvement thereafter. This growth retardation experienced in the first year of life is very difficult to overcome in the later years of childhood. Globally, progress is being made in reducing undernutri- tion. The prevalence of child undernutrition has declinedsignificantly over the past 25 years. Rates of stunting (lowheight-for-age) among children age six months to five yearsin all developing countries dropped almost 20 percentagepoints from 49 to 30 percent between 1980 and 2000, where-as underweight (low weight for age) rates dropped from 38to 25 percent (de Onis et al. 2004). Taken as a whole, how-ever, Africa is an unfortunate exception to these trends. Overthe period 1980 to 2000, stunting rates declined by less than4 percentage points in Africa, so that, with populationgrowth, the actual number of stunted children actuallyincreased by more than 12 million to 48.5 million. Bothrelative and absolute numbers of underweight children inAfrica increased over the same period. National and broader regional patterns can be seen in the map portraying the national prevalence of stunted childrenin figure 8.3. In contrast to North Africa, where child undernutrition appears to be addressed relatively effectively,in Sub-Saharan Africa the pattern is less encouraging andsomewhat more complex. Coastal West Africa, centralAfrica, and southern Africa have lower rates of stunting. Landlocked countries and others with a large proportion oftheir population in the interior tend to have higher rates.General perceptions that developed in the 1980s of poorlynourished populations in the Sahel and Ethiopia remain rel-atively accurate today. The grouping of countries with thehighest prevalence of stunting, however, is found in south-ern and eastern Africa, reflecting a complex set of challengesthat include civil conflict, economic downturns due tomacroeconomic mismanagement or commodity priceshocks, and droughts and floods, or the legacies of suchevents. The prevalence of undernutrition can also be assessed at a subnational level. Using data from a range of DHS surveys, the Center for International Earth Science InformationNetwork (CIESIN) developed a series of maps describingthe prevalence of undernutrition at this scale across the con-tinent. Two of these are shown in figure 8.4. The map on theleft of the figure is comparable in form to the map shown infigure 8.3 but shows underweight prevalence, instead ofstunting, and subnational spatial units.

By taking into account the area density of the population fromwhich the estimates of underweight are being made, themap provides an indication of the spatial intensity of theproblem of underweight children\u2014\"hotspots\" of undernu- trition.

It is important to notethat in many of these hunger hotspots, food production isnot the limiting factor. One such example is the Iringaregion in Tanzania, where over 70 percent of the children arestunted in their growth, even though it is a food basket for Tanzania. Place of residence\u2014rural or urban\u2014can yield another important evaluation of the spatial pattern of child under-nutrition in Africa. Figure 8.5 shows stunting prevalencefor children under five, disaggregated by urban or ruralresidence. In all 17 countries, undernourished children aremore prevalent in rural areas than in urban centers.Although food is produced on farms in rural areas, this doesnot mean that rural children are better nourished. Equallyimportant, safe water and adequate sanitation, health services, and the information needed by mothers or othercaregivers to provide children with effective care are relative-ly less accessible in rural areas. It is not correct, however, toargue that undernourished children are primarily a rural phenomenon. In most of the countries examined in fig-ure 8.5, at least one out of five urban preschoolers is stunted. Child undernutrition in Africa can also be examined from the dimensions of the gender and the age of the child.In contrast to South Asia, for example, differences in theprevalence of child undernutrition according to gender arenot strong. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the tendency is for boysto have a somewhat higher probability of being undernour-ished than girls (Svedberg 1990). For example, in an assess- ment of stunting rates for children age 6 to 36 months in28 African countries during the period 1987 to 2002, theaverage difference in stunting rates between boys and girlswas 2.6 percentage points, with stunting rates being higheramong boys in all but four of these countries. Y et another interesting dimension of undernutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa is reflected in figure 8.6, which showsthat although undernutrition rates in these countries arehigher among the poorer households, rates remain relatively 94| Todd Benson and Meera ShekarATLANTIC OCEANINDIAN OCEANMediterranean Sea Red Sea ATLANTIC 10 10 - 2020 - 30 30 - 40 40 - 50 more than 50 no data international boundariesIBRD 34520 MARCH 2006 less than 0.5 0.5 - 11- 5 5 - 10 10 - 25 more than 25 no data international boundariesThis map was produced by the Map Design Unit of The World Bank.

In many countries in the region, more than 15 percent of the children in the highest wealthquintile are underweight. Given the significant proportionof nonpoor children that are undernourished, we shouldrecognize that improved household welfare in itself is not sufficient to eliminate undernutrition. The higher level ofnutritional resources available to wealthier households mustbe used effectively through proper care if undernutrition isto be eliminated in such households.

The simplest and most sustainable way to eliminate micronu-trient deficiencies is to make sure that individuals and households know the importance of a balanced diet and have access to what is required to consume such diets.However, in spite of the progress made in combating this\"hidden hunger,\" many Africans still consume insufficient amounts of the relatively small quantities of these nutrients that they require or, due to poor health, are unable to useeffectively that which they do consume and continue to suf-fer from micronutrient deficiencies. High levels of anemiaresult in serious cognitive and productivity losses, reducingthe ability of women to work and provide adequate carefor their children and making pregnancy and childbirth much more risky for them than would otherwise be the case.Between 15,000 and 20,000 African women die each yearowing to severe iron deficiency anemia. The high prevalenceof goiter in school-age children points to hundreds of thou-sands of children in Africa who have lowered intellectualcapacity as a result of iodine deficiency. Vitamin A deficien-cies in children are common across the continent, reducingtheir ability to resist infection and contributing to the deathsof more than half a million African children annually(UNICEF and MI 2004). Child undernutrition is closely correlated with under-five mortality. For the countries south of the Sahara, most recent estimates of under-five mortality are about 170 deaths in thefirst five years of life for every 1,000 live births (UNICEF2003). Figure 8.7b shows that, although many countriesare making progress in reducing child deaths, some coun-tries are failing to maintain effective past efforts and areexperiencing a decline in the rate of progress against under- five mortality. In spite of the high levels of under-five mor-tality in Africa, only a handful of African countries show accelerating declines in levels of under-five mortality. The scatter plot in figure 8.8 demonstrates the intertwining ofnutritional and health concerns and highlights the scope ofthe linked problems of undernutrition and consequent under-five mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa. If one uses an underweight prevalence of 20 percent and an under-fivemortality rate of 50 per 1,000 live births (bold gridlines infigure 8.8) as thresholds above which these issues should beseen as critical public health problems requiring urgentaction, under-five mortality remains a pressing issue in allcountries, and in more than two-thirds, undernutrition is a critical concern. As noted, approximately 55 percent of all child deaths in developing countries can be attributed in part to undernu- trition through its exacerbation of the effects of disease on achild's health (Pelletier et al. 1994). For example, 61 percentof diarrhea deaths and 57 percent of malaria deaths wouldnot occur if it were not for the underlying undernutrition.Even mildly underweight children have nearly double therisk of death of their well-nourished counterparts. Thisrisk increases to five- to eightfold in moderately to severely 96| Todd Benson and Meera Shekar20 Source: Data from UNICEF Note: Countries with underweight prevalence below 20 percent: Botswana, Rep. of Congo, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Lesotho, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Zimbabwe.

Further, as noted earlier, Pelletier and Frongillo (2003) haveshown that had the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa reducedundernutrition rates during 1975 to 1995 at the samemodest rates as other regions of the world, the region would have experienced under-five mortality rates 28 percentlower than those achieved. What Accounts for the Patterns of Undernutrition Observed? Two-thirds of Africans reside in rural areas, with the major- ity engaged in crop and livestock production for both theirown use and market sale. Higher production on their own farm or from their own herds enhances the food security for such households. For food purchasers, higher productiongenerally means lower food prices and access to a greaterquantity of food in the market for a given income level. Elsewhere around the globe other underlying determinants of nutritional status, such as women's education and itsimpact on the quality of care provided or the availability ofhealth resources, are of greater importance, but in Africathe relatively low food availability has been shown to beamong the most important underlying determinants ofthe high levels of child undernutrition (Smith and Haddad 2000, p. 84). Nevertheless, as mentioned earlier,many regions of Africa that are notable for their relativelyhigh level of food production also suffer from high levels ofundernutrition.The two maps in figure 8.9 provide some indication of current availability of food in Africa based on total dietary supply (from food balance sheet data) and an index of foodproduction. The trends are not encouraging. A moribundfood crop sector is found in combination with insufficientfood in quite a few countries, particularly in eastern and central Africa. In such countries, it is likely that many ruralhouseholds are unable to produce as much food as theyrequire from their own land and cannot afford to go to themarket to make up any deficiencies. Chronic food insecurity results. Any future negative shock to a household's well-being likely will propel it into deepening undernutrition andill health. Since most undernutrition happens in the first two years of age, when food security is less of an issue than are caring practices, such as exclusive breastfeeding and appropriatecomplementary feeding (and whether women have enoughtime within their household and other economic duties toprovide such care), caring practices play a key role in under-nutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, the high under- nutrition rates found among the nonpoor suggest that evenwhen access to food is not constrained and caring practicesmight be expected to be relatively good, other factors, suchas an unhygienic environment or poor health services, alsomay underlie poor nutrition outcomes.

Although several countries have made admirable strides in ensuring that their citizens live in a hygienic envi- ronment, most countries must continue their efforts. Bycomparing these maps with those in figure 8.9, one canidentify several countries\u2014Benin and Namibia, among others\u2014where one should find reasonable access to food but where improved water and sanitation is clearly neededif sustainable reductions in child undernutrition are to beachieved. Closely linked to a hygienic environment is the health status of the population more generally. Individuals suffer- ing from illness are unable to properly use the nutrients in the food to which they have access. Consequently, lack ofaccess to health services\u2014both preventive and curative\u2014isa central cause of undernutrition. A broad range of indica-tors can be used to assess this factor in Africa. In figure 8.11two indicators of access to health care\u2014number of doctorsper 100,000 people and percentage of pregnant womenreceiving prenatal health care\u2014are presented, together witha map showing the prevalence of human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV) infection, an important challenge to Africanhealth care systems. Figure 8.11a, which shows the numberof medical doctors per 100,000 persons, largely reflects thepattern of wealth across the continent. Access to doctors and secondary and tertiary medical care facilities is as much aquestion of resources as it is of medical need. Poorer coun-tries tend to have fewer doctors per capita. The map ofprenatal care, however, is arguably the more useful for our purposes here. Prenatal care services are mainly providedas a component of primary health care programs. Theseprograms are also the a principal means of providing directnutrition services to the population. Indeed, an importantcomponent of prenatal care is proper nutrition to preventlow birthweight. Overall, the picture across Africa concern-ing the provision of these health care services is encourag-ing. Still, although there is room for expansion\u2014large num-bers of pregnant women still are receiving no attention\u2014 and likely the quality of the care provided can be enhanced,a foundation upon which to build is in place in manycountries. Over the past two decades, HIV infection has added an almost overwhelming additional burden to Africa's health care services. As shown in figure 8.11c, countries in south-ern and eastern Africa are currently facing the most severelevels of infection, but all countries must put in place mech-anisms to effectively control the disease and care for thoseinfected. Existing health services are and will be extremelystretched, and without significant additional resources, the 98| Todd Benson and Meera ShekarFigure 8.10 Access to Safe Water and Adequate Sanitation, by Country ATLANTIC OCEAN INDIAN OCEANMediterranean Sea Red Se a ATLANTIC OCEAN INDIAN OCEANMediterranean 70 45 - 70 less than 45 no data international boundariesThis map was produced by the Map Design Unit of The World Bank.

Moreover, HIV has exacerbat-ing effects on undernutrition far beyond its impact onhealth services. HIV infection reduces household foodproduction both now and in the future, restricts the accessto available food and necessary health care that the house-hold had before a member or members became infectedwith HIV , and lowers the quality of nutritional care received Trends and Issues in Child Undernutrition | 99Figure 8.11 Health Services, by Country ATLANTIC OCEAN INDIAN OCEANMediterranean Sea Red Sea ATLANTIC OCEAN INDIAN OCEANMediterranean Sea Red Sea ATLANTIC OCEAN INDIAN OCEANMediterranean Sea Re 30 less than 10 no data international boundariesIBRD 34524 MARCH 2006 more than 75 50 - 75less than 50 no data international boundaries less than 5 5- 1 5 more than 15 no data international boundariesThis map was produced by the Map Design Unit of The World Bank.

The final underlying determinant of child nutritional status to consider is that of the quality of care children receive. It was highlighted earlier that an important proxy for this determinant is the educational attainment and liter-acy levels of women, as mothers with more education aremore knowledgeable about the care their children need. Twomeasures of this are provided in figure 8.12. The first, femaleadult literacy, reflects past broad knowledge building. The second, the net enrollment rate for girls in primary school,reflects the degree to which knowledge, both general andmore nutrition-focused knowledge, is being gained toenhance the nutritional status of future generations. Where one finds low literacy and low enrollment of girls in school,one should also expect relatively higher levels of undernu- trition now and in the future, all things being equal. The patterns seen across Sub-Saharan Africa are mixed. Encouraging levels for both measures are seen in many countries of eastern and central Africa. If the educationalcurriculum in these countries provides basic nutritionaland child care principles, we should expect that poor-qualitycare will not be a critical factor contributing to undernutri-tion. Many children in the Sahelian countries in particular,however, cannot be expected to enjoy nutrition security, in part because of the lower-quality care they receive fromtheir relatively less-well-educated mothers. In spite of theincreases in food production shown for the countries ofthe Sahel in figure 8.9, without knowledgeable care, sus- tained reduction in child undernutrition there cannotbe ensured. Similarly, we can also examine actual child care practices, in particular whether mothers practice exclusive breastfeed-ing in the first four to six months of life of their children.Exclusive breastfeeding limits the exposure of children todisease while providing all the nutrients an infant requiresfor normal growth. As presented in figure 8.13, a mixed pic-ture is seen on the degree to which exclusive breastfeeding is practiced across the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.Certainly the fact that so many infants in Sub-SaharanAfrica are not exclusively breastfed in their early infancyaccounts for a significant portion of the high levels ofundernutrition and under-five mortality observed in theregion, as well as for the speed with which infants becomeundernourished after birth. Finally, economic growth, income, and poverty levels provide important insights into understanding the levelsof undernutrition seen in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Consequently, income levels remain stagnant and pur- chasing power will likely decline. The low GDP per capita and the meager existence experienced by significant seg- ments of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa, are unlikelyto change for some time to come. The impact of this onlevels of undernutrition is obvious. Stagnant incomes implyno increased access to the food required for a healthy diet.Necessary public services for improved child nutrition\u2014public and curative health services, educational systems,support to agriculture, and infrastructure for marketing andtrade\u2014will receive insufficient resources. The prospects aregloomy for sharp reductions in child undernutrition within the context of stagnant economies and pervasive poverty. DISCUSSION The conceptual framework of child undernutrition pre- sented in figure 8.1 highlights the multisectoral nature ofthe nutrition problem. It is usually not possible to point to asingle factor to account for high levels of undernutrition.However, the high levels of undernutrition seen in those nations in Africa that have experienced conflict and theabsence of an effective central government in recent years isnot surprising. Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo,Liberia, Somalia, and Sierra Leone, when assessed based onthose nutritional measures for which data exist, are consis-tently ranked among the worst on the continent. Conflict exacerbates poverty and poor governance. These govern-ments have been unable to provide basic public goods,which results in a consequent lack of access to food, care,health services, and a healthy environment for their citizens. Although in several of these countries, encouraging signshave been seen since the early years of the twenty-first cen-tury, it will take several years of such positive trends beforechildren in these countries can be brought up in conditions that will result in their enjoying a healthy and active life. It is more challenging to account for why most countries in Africa are exhibiting only poor to fair progress in ensur-ing the nutritional well-being of their children. The majorityof Africans live in these countries. Assessing their perform-ance in light of the various factors that determine childundernutrition in order to judge what changes they mightmake can only be done case by case. In those countries in which food availability is deficient, food production must be enhanced at the same time as tradepolicies must be reexamined to allow a more reliable supplyof food from the global market. Other countries may exhibitquite high levels of food available at an aggregate level butstill have crippling rates of undernutrition. In these coun-tries, attention should be directed to issues of access to food(the distribution of resources and consumption levels acrosssociety and within households) and to the context withinwhich the food is used (sanitation, health services, level of knowledgeable care, and the broad range of related issuesoutlined earlier). Where HIV rates are high, the linksbetween HIV and nutrition must be addressed. Moreover,the quality of policy making and the effective and responsi-ble implementation of those policies are important basicdeterminants of the degree to which undernutrition is effec-tively addressed in any country in Africa, as elsewhere. Actions Needed to Eliminate Undernutrition The challenge of child undernutrition in Africa is immense. Of all the developing regions of the world, it is only in Sub-Saharan Africa that large increases in the number of under-nourished are anticipated\u2014worse, in some regions of thecontinent increases in the prevalence of undernourished children are also expected. These patterns are further exac-erbated by the continuing spread of HIV infection. Recentpatterns of action by governments in Africa and their devel-opment partners in addressing undernutrition must bechanged if the realization of these grim projections is to beavoided. It is quite evident that efforts to date are not suffi-cient to meet the challenge. Trends and Issues in Child Undernutrition | 101Source: Data from ORC/Macro 2004, DHS survey.

They have a responsibility to establish the conditions and institutions necessary to enable children and their caregivers to access the basicrequirements for improved nutrition outcomes. Sustained and broadly based economic growth is needed. T o end hunger in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2050, it is esti-mated that the region must attain an annual 3.5 percent average growth rate in per capita GDP (Runge et al. 2003). In the past decade, however, only half a dozencountries had growth rates above 2.5 percent. Although it has been shown that income growth will improve nutrition, the process is relatively slow. Consequently, we cannot expect that income growth alone will be sufficient to improve nutrition outcomes at the rates that are required to achieve one of the targetsof the first Millennium Development Goal of cutting theprevalence of underweight children in half by 2015.Studies for Tanzania show that even under an optimistic scenario of 5.0 percent per capita GDP growth and usinga 0.51 elasticity between income and nutrition outcomes,income growth alone will take up to 2026 to achieve theMDG. For this MDG target to be achieved in Tanzaniathrough income growth alone, a per capita growth of5.0 percent and an elasticity of 0.85 would be needed,a scenario that is totally unrealistic for any country inAfrica. With more realistic income growth estimates, thepotential for achieving the MDG are even further in thetime horizon. However, the results of simulations under-taken for Kagera region in Tanzania that are presented in table 8.4 show that if income growth is combined with direct nutrition interventions, the chances of achievingthe MDG become real.Significant increases in the resources allocated to preven- tive public health interventions directed to young chil-dren and their mothers are necessary. Since the window of opportunity for nutrition interventions is small, these efforts must be directed during this brief time\u2014from the mother's pregnancy through the child's first two yearsof life. In addition, basic preventive and curative healthservices need to be made more available to enable youngchildren in Africa to cope better with the heavy disease burdens they face\u2014a disease burden that can be seen as both an outcome and a cause of their poor nutritionalstatus. The health sector is usually responsible for coordinat- ing and leading direct nutrition intervention programs. Such interventions, particularly those that addressmicronutrient undernutrition and broad child survivalconcerns, have proved effective and efficient in improv-ing the nutritional status of, in particular, preschool chil-dren and women of childbearing age. In assessing howbest to address undernutrition, it is crucial not to under-estimate the impact of such direct nutritional interven-tions. These programs are important investments forimproved human welfare and economic productivity. Their benefits can be seen most dramatically in efforts to reduce the prevalence of low birthweight babies. Behrman, Alderman, and Hoddinott (2004) present the results of a cost-benefit analysis of programs of varioussorts that seek to improve fetal nutrition and increaseinfant birthweight\u2014prenatal care, in the broadest sense.The direct costs of the programs that they examinedranged from US$14 to US$100 per low birthweight birthaverted. They calculated the present discounted value ofthe benefits that accrue from averting a low birthweightbirth to amount to more than US$550. The benefits from 102 | Todd Benson and Meera ShekarTable 8.4 Projected Impact of Economic Growth and Direct Large-Scale Nutrition Intervention Programs on Stunting and Poverty, Kagera Region, Tanzania, 2015 (percent) Projected per capita Reduction in prevalence of stunted children income growth Reduction in No large-scale Intervention covering Intervention covering Intervention covering (1993-2015) income poverty nutrition intervention 10% of population 50% of population all of population 0.0 0 0 2 22 49 1.0 44 5 8 28 54 2.0 67 11 14 32 58 3.0 84 17 17 36 61 Source: Alderman et al. 2005. Note: Italicized values meet the MDG targets. Other factors contributing to reduced malnutrition include non-farm income greater than 25 percent of total income: 2 percent; passable roads throughout the year in every village: 5 percent; additional year of education to every father: 8 percent.improved fetal nutrition accrue from a range of sources, including reduced costs of health care and productivity gains from the increased physical and mental abilities of the child through his or her life. The most importantof these benefits is simply from the increased economicproductivity potential of the child. Through suchinterventions, the health sector has played an important role in the gains that have been achieved in addressing undernutrition for human development in Sub-SaharanAfrica. However, these efforts must be duplicated manytimes over to successfully fight child undernutrition. In addressing child undernutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa, agriculture cannot be ignored. Growth in foodsupplies has the dual effect of increasing the income of the farming household and reducing the prices house- holds must pay to acquire food in the marketplace, both of which contribute to better nutrition. Education is a critical input to good nutritional status, particularly for girls. The nutrition education messagesthat need to be learned are relatively simple\u2014the com- ponents of a balanced diet and information on how locally available foods can be used to build balanceddiets, the value of exclusive breastfeeding and appropriateand timely complementary feeding for infants, the importance of prenatal care and regular monitoring of child growth, sanitation and maintaining a healthy envi-ronment, and the control of infant and childhood ill-nesses, in particular. Although it is not an obvious element of nutrition strategies, ensuring that girls are able to go to school and attain their full educational potential is a critical compo- nent of any longer-term effort to enhance nutrition inAfrica. A close link exists between successful improvements in child nutrition and increasing women's social access toresources they can use to improve care and increase thediversity and quantity of food provided the children undertheir care. Consequently, improving the level of equity between men and women is good for child nutrition. Regarding institutional and policy issues, it is important to consider the particular characteristics of nutrition as asubject for policy making and program implementationby national government institutions. Nutrition is usuallyneglected in the formulation of government and sectoral policies and strategies and in the allocation of govern-ment resources. As already emphasized, addressing childundernutrition requires action across sectors. Withno one sectoral ministry responsible for nutrition and,consequently, no strong sectoral advocates responsiblefor seeing that attention is paid, human resources are made available, or adequate funds are allocated to nutri-tion, it can easily be ignored or addressed only in anuncoordinated, piecemeal fashion. However, the issue ofimproving child nutrition is not unique in this regard.Although the cross-sectoral barriers to effectivelyaddressing undernutrition may be particularly salient,most development issues ultimately require coordinatedcross-sectoral action. Such coordination is fostered bypolitical leaders exercising political will. Child undernu-trition is a high-priority development challenge in mostAfrican countries. Individual sectors can make importantcontributions to facilitating the access of households towhat they require to ensure the nutrition of their chil-dren. Ultimately, however, the responsibility for imple-menting activities across sectors lies with the politicalleaders. These leaders must be champions for improvingnutrition within their countries, and this commitmentmust be sustained over time. Scale and Commitment Ultimately, the outcome of all efforts to improve child nutri- tion must be realized at the level of the individual child. Asis clear from the UNICEF framework on the determinantsof nutritional status, however, many, if not most, of thedeterminants of nutritional status operate on much broader geographic scales than that of the individual. What does thisimply for policy making and planning, resource allocation,and program implementation to reduce food and nutritioninsecurity? Several issues must be kept in mind. First, at the broader scales, heterogeneity exists in the key constraints to improved child nutrition. Consequently, although broadstrategies to enhance child nutrition can be developed,these strategies must be context specific in their implementation. Second, and emerging in part from the first point, efforts aimed at sustainably reducing child undernutrition that involve strong central government planning and control areunlikely to succeed, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, wheredecentralization is taking root. Locally conceived and imple-mented action is the primary manner in which the barriersand constraints to such security can be removed. The roleof the central government should be much broader andlooser, consisting of giving broad general direction to localefforts and facilitating those efforts by allocating resources,providing needed expertise, offering institutional support,and the like. Although many African countries face severe Trends and Issues in Child Undernutrition | 103capacity constraints at local levels, such a locally derived approach to address undernutrition should serve as the model for such efforts. Finally, policy making and program planning have always been guided by those whose voices are heard within the policy-making arena. Over the past 10 years, democraticpolitical frameworks have increased in number across Sub-Saharan Africa. The possible increase in attention paid tothe \"will of the people\" and the new political calculationsrequired of politicians within these new competitive systemsmay either improve the attention given to or draw attentionaway from nutritional considerations in policy making.Consequently, community-level political leaders and otherswho seek government support for nutrition-related inter- ventions are unlikely to succeed without strategically engag-ing in the political processes of which they are a part. Increasing attention to significantly reduce child under- nutrition requires dedicated efforts to gain more commit- ment at all policy levels\u2014decentralized, national, andglobal\u2014and as an issue of broad public concern. T o com-pete successfully within a democratic political arena, theissue must be communicated effectively and understoodwidely, its significance for the welfare of all members ofsociety recognized, and action catalyzed around proposedsolutions. Dedicated and sustained commitment is required. Ultimately, the effort should be to seek to establish the polit-ical will and commitment to devote the necessary resourcesto reduce child undernutrition. Although these childrenhave a basic human right to be properly nourished, effortsto make sure that they are must still be evaluated and findsupport within the arena of politics. Policies and Resources Needed to Support These Actions If we agree that policy, when developed in a democratic and transparent manner, defines the common good and servesas a statement of how government will prioritize its actions and its expenditures, then eliminating child undernutrition must be central to government policies across Africa.Although the broad trends in the prevalence of stunting areslightly downward, the aggregate continental trend is not reflected consistently at the individual country level as eco- nomic, food, and social sector policies change or are notgiven consistent support, conflict shatters any progress thathas been made, or emergency food crises are not effectivelymanaged. Clarity in purpose and proper allocation ofresources in line with appropriate policies is a necessaryelement in any efforts to sharply reduce undernutrition. Thus, it is critical that the poverty reduction strategy papersthat many African nations have developed in the past five years and that serve as master development plans for many are explicit on the importance of investing in nutrition toreduce poverty and generate sustained economic growth. Similarly, for governments in Africa to address problems of undernutrition effectively, cross-sectoral action isrequired. It is unlikely that sustainable reductions in thenumber of African children who are undernourished willbe achieved if undernutrition is seen as a problem for thehealth sector or the agricultural sector alone to address.Sectoral plans and strategies should be oriented towardobjectives that result in improved nutrition, along with theirother long-standing objectives. Advocates for improvednutrition must engage in the higher-level policy processesguiding the revisions of the poverty reduction strategypapers and sectoral strategy documents. The key messageshould be that the arrow of cause and effect betweenimproved child nutrition and income and broader and sus-tained economic growth runs both ways. Just as incomegrowth enhances nutrition, healthy, active, well-nourishedchildren are an important precondition for sustained futuregrowth in income. Nutrition concerns must be among theprimary components of such strategies. Moreover, regional and global policy initiatives can be drawn upon in support of advocacy for improved nutrition. Increasing food supplies and reducing hunger are centralobjectives of the Comprehensive Africa AgricultureDevelopment Programme of the New Partnership forAfrica's Development (NEPAD 2002). Although nutritionsecurity requires more than increased food supplies, thisNEPAD initiative does commit African governments toaddressing undernutrition. The Millennium Development Goals also imply the need for strong resource allocations to reducing child undernu- trition. The prevalence of underweight children is one of theindicators being used to track progress toward attaining theMDG target of halving between 1990 and 2015 the propor- tion of people who suffer from hunger. Recent assessments show that only 6 of the almost 50 countries in Sub-SaharanAfrica will meet this target. In 13 countries, prevalence ratesin 2015 relative to 1990 are expected to have increased(Chhabra and Rokx 2004). The trends in the prevalence ofunderweight children, shown in figure 8.14, points to justhow large the gap from the goal will be if current patternsare maintained in all regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. Clearly,current levels of attention to undernutrition among chil-dren are grossly inadequate. The commitment to allocateresources to attain the MDGs was made by African govern- ments in the support they gave the United Nations 104 | Todd Benson and Meera ShekarMillennium Declaration of 2000. Promoters of improved nutrition in Africa must now hold the governmentsaccountable to their pledge. Similarly, budgetary allocations by central governments should reflect the importance that improved nutrition has for the welfare of all people and the immense economicbenefits it provides for relatively little cost. In this regard,the donor funding that supports the vast majority of directnutrition programs in Sub-Saharan Africa should be viewedas a secondary resource to complement government's own.African governments should make expenditure on nutritionprograms a core element of their annual budgets. All African countries can eliminate child undernutrition. What is needed is commitment to this goal, identification of the right mix of strategies, dedicated efforts to marshal thehuman, institutional, and material resources necessary forthe task, followed by the application of the political will toundertake the actions at a scale necessary to achieve it. NOTE 1. The three measures indicate different nutritional processes. Children who are wasted have suffered acute nutritional deprivation in the recent past, such as occurs during famine. In contrast, stunted children have experienced cumulative retardation in their physical growth due to any ofa range of factors, diet-related or otherwise. The nutritional processesexperienced by underweight children are nonspecific, possibly resultingboth from chronic and from acute undernutrition. The prevalence ofunderweight children is one of the indicators being used to track progress toward attaining the target of halving between 1990 and 2015 the propor- tion of people who suffer from hunger under the first MDG of eradicatingextreme poverty and hunger.

Although mortality rates among these children have declined globally from 146 per 1,000 in 1970 to79 per 1,000 in 2003 (WHO 2005), the situation in Africa isstrikingly different. As compared with other regions of the world, the African region shows the smallest reductions in mortality rates and the most marked slowing down trend(figure 9.1). The under-five mortality rate in the Africanregion is seven times higher than that in the European region.In 1980 this difference was equal to 4.3 times (WHO 2005). During the 1990s, the decline of under-five mortality rates in 29 countries of the world stagnated, and in 14 coun- tries rates went down but then increased again. Most ofthese countries are from the African region (WHO 2005). Afactor that may contribute to this situation is the humanimmunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiencysyndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic in the region, but anunderlying weakness of the implementation capacity of thehealth system is also likely to blame (Walker, Schwartl\u00e4nder,and Bryce 2002).Similarly to all-cause mortality, global estimates of the number of deaths due to diarrhea have shown a steady decline, from 4.6 million in the 1980s (Snyder and Merson1982) to 3.3 million in the 1990s (Bern et al. 1992) to2.5 million in the year 2000 (Kosek, Bern, and Guerrant 2003). However, diarrheal diseases continue to be an impor-tant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, anddespite all advances in health technology, improved man-agement, and increased use of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) in the past decades, they remain among the fivemajor killers of children under five years of age. In contrast to mortality trends, morbidity due to diar- rhea has not shown a parallel decline, and global estimatesremain between two and three episodes of diarrhea per child under five per year. Kosek, Bern, and Guerrant (2003)estimated a global median incidence of diarrhea to be 3.2episodes per child-year in the year 2000, similar to thosefound in previous reviews by Snyder and Merson (1982)and by Bern and colleagues (1992) as well as to thosereported in the first edition of Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries (Jamison et al. 1993).Chapter9 Diarrheal Diseases Cynthia Boschi-Pinto, Claudio F. Lanata, Walter Mendoza, and Demissie HabteThis chapter reviews available information published since the 1980s on the morbidity and mortality burden of diarrheal diseases in children under five years of age in theWHO African region. METHODS Reliable and comparable estimates of morbidity and mor-tality are difficult to obtain because of variations in method-ology, failure to standardize case definitions of diarrhea,and seasonal nature of the disease, among other factors.Nevertheless, such estimates, mainly based on the available studies in the literature, are provided here. HIV infection has added considerably to the burden of diarrheal diseases among adults and children. This is of par-ticular importance in African countries that show high HIVprevalence. However, the scarcity of data makes it difficult toquantify comorbidity and its contribution to the mortalityburden. Because of the probable influence of HIV/AIDS,especially in the mortality due to diarrheal disease, we havefollowed the WHO's division of the African region into two subregions, which takes into account mortality levels:the AFR D subregion (high child and high adult mortality)and the AFR E subregion (high child and very high adultmortality). Stratum E includes the countries in Sub-SaharanAfrica where HIV/AIDS has had a substantial impact(Mathers et al. 2002). Specific estimates have been providedfor each subregion whenever available data permitted. Countries included in each subregion are listed in appendixtable 9A.1. DATA SOURCES AND LITERATURE REVIEW: MORBIDITY The usual sources of diarrhea morbidity data are either national surveys, such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS, conducted from1996 to 2000; http://www.childinfo.org/MICS2/Gj99306k. htm, accessed April 12, 2003), or the published literature. The main limitation of using currently available national survey data to estimate diarrhea morbidity is the cross-sectional nature of data collection. The informationobtained from these surveys is of diarrhea prevalence in thetwo weeks previous to the survey, which does not account forseasonality. Therefore, data are not comparable either acrosssites or over time. Moreover, there is a potential for impor-tant recall bias in such morbidity surveys (Boerma et al. 1991; Snow et al. 1993). Some of the major limitations oflongitudinal studies are lack of representativeness, possiblesite bias, low frequency of surveillance visits, and recall bias. Most reviews carried out so far (Bern et al. 1992; Kosek, Bern, and Guerrant 2003; Snyder and Merson 1982) have relied on published studies to estimate the incidence orprevalence of diarrheal disease. Some of the limitations ofthis type of study are the small number of data points andthe lack of representativeness, given the specific sites wheremost studies are carried out. The most recent morbidity review (Kosek, Bern, and Guerrant 2003) included five prospective studies from African countries, carried out between 1987 and 1990: twostudies were from the AFR D subregion (Guinea-Bissau andNigeria) and three from the AFR E subregion (DemocraticRepublic of Congo, Kenya, and Zimbabwe). These studies are listed in appendix table 9A.2. DATA SOURCES AND LITERATURE REVIEW: MORTALITY Nationally representative surveys such as the DHS do not usually report causes of death, but the number of diarrhea-associated deaths can be obtained from either vital statistics registration systems or from special study populations. 108 | Cynthia Boschi-Pinto, Claudio F. Lanata, Walter Mendoza, and Demissie Habte1970 Source: Adapted from WHO 2005.0100200mortality rate of children under 5 250 150 50 1980 1990 2000 2003 year Africa Eastern Mediterranean World Southeast Asia Southeast Asia without IndiaWestern Pacific Western Pacific without China Americas EuropeFigure 9.1 Slowing Progress in Child Mortality (per 1,000 births)From each of these sources, the proportion of deaths attrib- uted to diarrhea can be estimated as well as diarrhea mortality rates. However, the representativeness and accu- racy of the data vary according to the type of source and var-ious study design features. The main limitations of vital registration systems are underreporting of the number of deaths and miscoding ofthe causes of death. Most of the limitations described for theuse of longitudinal studies for estimating morbidity alsoapply to mortality estimation, such as lack of representative-ness, possible site bias, and misclassification of the causes ofdeath. The only countries in the African region for which there is some reported vital registration (VR) coverage are Mauritius, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. The coverage forMauritius was reported to be 100 percent in the year 2000.Only 1.4 percent of all deaths among children under fivewere due to diarrhea in this country. The latest informa-tion available for South Africa and Zimbabwe (1996 and1990, respectively) reported estimated coverage rates of lessthan 50 percent (http://www.who.int/whosis/mort/table4).Therefore, in the African region, most information oncause-specific mortality relies on special studies available inthe literature. The studies included in our review were identified by a systematic search of the scientific literature publishedsince 1980, performed through the WHO's library onMedline/Pubmed using the following terms: Africa, mortal-ity, different spellings of \"diarrhea,\" and all terms combined.No restriction was placed on publication language. Thereference sections of these studies were then reviewed toidentify additional studies. The review performed by Kirkwood (1991) for the previ- ous edition of Disease and Mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa included data from cross-sectional studies and fromnational diarrhea programs. In the current review we haveconsidered only longitudinal studies. Inclusion criteria werethe following: studies carried out in countries from Sub-Saharan Africa, studies published from 1980 on, studiescontaining diarrhea-specific mortality data, studies contain-ing a minimum of 25 total deaths, community-based stud-ies with at least one year of follow-up, and a follow-up timemultiple of 12 months to minimize seasonal effects. Twenty-four studies were identified that met the above criteria and were therefore included in this review (appendix table 9A.3). They were carried out in 15 (33 percent) of the46 countries of the African region: seven were carried outin countries from AFR D, and eight from AFR E. Figure 9.2illustrates the countries and the sites in each country for which studies were available. The 24 longitudinal studies identified in the current literature represent an important increase in information when compared with the 7 available studies included inthe previous review (Kirkwood 1991). There has been morethan a threefold increase in the available literature of longitu-dinal studies reporting diarrhea mortality in Sub-SaharanAfrica. This increase in the number of publications fromSub-Saharan Africa resulted in a doubled number of Africancountries for which diarrhea mortality data were available,thus adding to the precision of the current estimates. DATA SOURCE AND LITERATURE REVIEW: ETIOLOGY Similarly to what was described for morbidity and mortality estimates, the main data source to estimate diarrhealetiology is the published literature. We conducted a search ofpapers published since 1990, using Medline/Pubmed; theterms used were as follows: Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, diarrhea, etiology, epidemiology, and children. Differentspellings as well as combinations of terms were also Diarrheal Diseases | 109ATLANTIC OCEAN INDIAN diarrhea mortality data international boundaries This map was produced by the Map Design Unit of The World Bank.

In addition, we considered keywords for specific etiologies known to cause diarrhea in children. Articles pub-lished in languages other than English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and French that did not have an English abstract were not included. Further sources were identified fromcross-references, consultation with experts in the field, anduse of the \"related articles\" link in PubMed. We used the following inclusion criteria: studies carried out at community level, among outpatient and inpatient health services; studies that covered at least 12 months ofsurveillance; and studies in which one or more causes ofdiarrhea were identified through the use of standard labora-tory procedures. Exclusion criteria were studies reportingdiarrhea outbreaks, studies carried out among children with HIV/AIDS, studies reporting nosocomial infections, andstudies carried out in day-care centers. Thirty-four studies were identified that met the above cri- teria, covering 12 African countries, 6 from each of the two African subregions. These are listed in appendix table 9A.4. REVIEWS AND ESTIMATIONS In the 1980s Snyder and Merson (1982) reviewed 24 pub- lished studies in order to estimate morbidity and mortalityfrom diarrheal disease. Three of these studies, carried out in the African region (Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria), reported the annual number of episodes of diarrhea per child by agegroup. In an attempt to update these estimates, Bern and colleagues (1992) reviewed articles published between 1980 and 1990. There were seven studies available for the Africanregions, covering three countries: The Gambia, Ghana, andNigeria. Kosek, Bern, and Guerrant (2003) included four studies from the African region in their review, which had beencarried out in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea- Bissau, Kenya, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe (appendix table 9A.2).Table 9.1 summarizes the results from these studies. Unlikemortality, estimates of morbidity due to diarrhea do not show a decline over time, according to the reviews carriedout. Estimates remain consistent for all age groups for which data are available. However, the number of observations,varying from three to five, is low for all three studies, and theuncertainty that prevails because of this low number and thedifferent sites where the studies were carried out shouldbe taken into account when interpreting these data. Because some of the mortality studies were carried out in more than one country or more than one point in time, theyprovided a total of 27 data points to be included in the analysis. More than 50 percent of these 27 data pointsshowed proportions of diarrhea mortality between 12 per-cent and 17 percent; 19 out of the 27 data points (70 per-cent) had proportions between 12 percent and 19 percent;and only 8 data points provided proportions greater than20 percent. Because of the skewness of the frequency distri-butions, we chose to use medians rather than means tocalculate diarrhea proportional mortality for each Africansubregion. We have used two different approaches to estimate the numbers and proportions of diarrhea deaths for Sub- Saharan Africa in the year 2000: calculation of simplemedians for each African subregion and extrapolation fromthe regression of medians of diarrhea proportional mortalityagainst time. Simple Medians of Diarrhea Proportional Mortality As a first approach to estimating the number of deaths dueto diarrhea among children younger than five years of age inthe African region for the year 2000, we applied the medianof the proportions of diarrhea deaths to the total number ofdeaths among children under five in each of the two African subregions. These medians were similar for the two subre-gions: 17.7 percent (interquartile intervals [IQI] 12.7-24.5percent) in AFR D and 17.6 percent (IQI 12.9-19.3 percent) 110 | Cynthia Boschi-Pinto, Claudio F.

The WHO estimates that approximately 4.3 mil- lion children under five died in Africa in the year 2000: 2.0 million in AFR D and 2.3 million in AFR E (WHO, unpublished data). Applying the proportion of diarrheadeaths estimated to have occurred among children underfive in Sub-Saharan Africa in the year 2000 to the totalnumber of deaths in these children in that same year yields an approximate total of 760,000 diarrheal deaths. Proportions over Time It has been suggested that at least for some countries diar- rhea mortality has been declining over the past years, mostlydue to the spread of ORT use (Baltazar, Nadera, and al. 1996; Victora et al. 2000). We thus examined the medians of the proportions for studies carried out in Sub-Saharan Africa in different time periods. Because there were only two observations in the late 1970s, we disregarded data from this time period and exam- ined the following time periods: 1980-84, 1985-89, and1990-94. Figure 9.3 shows that there were virtually nochanges in diarrhea proportional mortality ( /H9252/H11005/H11002 0.055) in the African region over the years 1980-95. Indeed, the medians of the proportion of diarrhea deaths were equal to 16.6 percent in the early 1980s, 17.7 percent in the late1980s, and 16.1 percent in the early 1990s. If the situationremains the same and no major changes have occurredduring more recent years, for which no data were available,the proportion of diarrhea deaths in the year 2000 could beestimated to be equal to 16.2 percent. This corresponds toan estimated total of 700,000 deaths, similar to the estimateobtained with the simple median calculation.When comparing the median data points observed in the African region with those from other developing regions of the world (figure 9.4), we note that although there was asteep decline in the proportions of diarrhea mortality inthe other regions ( /H9252/H11005/H11002 0.78), virtually no decline was observed in Sub-Saharan Africa. These observations corre- spond to an approximately 33 percent decline in the propor- tion of diarrheal deaths between 1980 and 1995 in the otherdeveloping regions of the world and basically no changes inthe African region. Comparison of Estimates from Recent Reviews of the Burden of Diarrhea Mortality Kosek, Bern, and Guerrant (2003) recently reviewed 30 studies from all developing regions of the world that hadavailable data on diarrhea proportional mortality for chil-dren under five years of age and that were published in the1990s. T en of these studies were from the African region and covered seven different countries (five from AFR D and twofrom AFR E). The medians of the diarrhea proportionalmortality were 23.2 percent in AFR D and 14.2 percent inAFR E. By applying these medians to the total number ofdeaths among children under five estimated by the WHO ineach of the two subregions in the year 2000, estimates of454,000 deaths for AFR D and 329,000 deaths for AFR Ewere obtained. These correspond to a total 783,000 deathsfor the whole region. Morris, Black, and T omaskovic (2003) have also recently reviewed the literature on causes of death among children under five and used a metaregression model with someselected covariates to estimate the proportional distribution Diarrheal Diseases | 1111980 Source: Authors, from studies listed in appendix table 9A.3.020% regionFigure 9.4 Medians of Diarrheal Proportional Mortality among Children under Five in the African Region and Other Developing Regions, 1980-95 1980020% diarrhea deaths40 30 10 1985 1990 1995 2000 yeary/H11005/H11002 0.055 x/H11001 126.1 Source: Note: /H11005 extrapolation.Figure 9.3 Medians of Diarrheal Proportional Mortality among Children under Five in the African Region, 1980-95of under-five deaths by cause in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The authors predicted that 21.9 percent (95 per-cent CI, 15.5-28.2 percent) of all deaths of children up tofour years of age in Sub-Saharan Africa in the year 2000were due to diarrhea, corresponding to a total of 935,000 deaths attributable to diarrhea. Table 9.2 summarizes the estimates obtained from the main approaches used in this review and from the recentwork performed by Kosek, Bern, and Guerrant (2003) andMorris, Black, and T omaskovic (2003) as well as from theWHO's most recent mean estimates for the period 2000-03(WHO 2005). Given the uncertainty of the estimates due tothe scarcity and limited representativeness of data, a reason-able and plausible range for the numbers and proportions of deaths due to diarrhea among children under five in Africacan be provided by summarizing different approaches fromvarious methodologies and their respective results. The twoestimates provided for AFR D were 354,000 (18 percent)and 454,000 deaths (23 percent) and those provided forAFR E were 329,000 (14 percent) and 405,000 deaths(18 percent). By reviewing the five available estimates for thetotal African region, we might conclude that approximately750,000 deaths that occurred among children under five inthe year 2000 were due to diarrhea, with a range of estimatesthat varied between 700,000 (WHO 2005) and 935,000 deaths (Morris, Black, and T omaskovic 2003). Our estimates are similar to the 741,000 deaths estimated by WHO for theAfrican region, and recently published in TheWorld Health Report (WHO 2005). Our estimates of deaths from diarrhea among children in Sub-Saharan Africa relied on published epidemiologicalstudies using mostly verbal autopsy methods and thus havelimitations inherent in the type of data used, such as lack ofrepresentativeness and site bias, observations over time,misclassification of the causes of death, and comparabilityof data from different studies.The locations of these studies were rarely representative of the entire country population, as they were usually con- ducted in populations that are either easy to access or have atypical mortality rates. Furthermore, using studies from a few countries to predict distributions for many countries ora region would require empirical external validation, whichwe were not able to perform because of the unavailability of other sources of data, such as vital registration data for Sub- Saharan Africa or nationally representative surveys thatincluded causes of death. However, we have tried to stratifycountries according to their mortality patterns, especially inwhat concerns mortality due to HIV/AIDS, to minimize dis-crepancies between them. Although the observations overtime should be interpreted with caution because of the dif- ferent sites where the studies were conducted, this problemwas minimized by including a reasonable number of studiesfrom different sites for each of the three time periods underobservation, which should provide an average of the distri-bution of mortality in these sites. Also, it should be kept inmind that these estimates were summarized as one single observation over time for all of Sub-Saharan Africa, based on a few sites from some countries (figure 9.2). As countries often vary widely in many important socioeconomic andhealth aspects, summarizing data across countries of aregion may obscure important differences. Some studies of childhood deaths in developing coun- tries have shown that causes of death established usingverbal autopsy methods are not always consistent withdiagnoses based on more complete clinical data (Kalter,Gray, and Black 1990; Mobley et al. 1996; Snow et al. 1992).However, the estimates of the cause-specific mortalityfraction (proportions of deaths attributable to one cause)resulting from verbal autopsy studies may not necessarily beinaccurate, if misclassification is random. Finally, the studies reviewed used different case defini- tions of diarrhea as a cause of death and different methods 112 | Cynthia Boschi-Pinto, Claudio F.

Any review that attempts to compile and summarize datafrom the published literature, especially those data that useboth standard and nonstandard verbal autopsy as the meansof ascertaining cause of death, faces these limitations. However, the thorough literature search and the restrictiveinclusion criteria used in this review, such as population-based studies with follow-up time a multiple of 12 monthsand studies with at least 25 total deaths, ensured that thestudies used for the current estimates consisted of the mostvalid information available. Enteropathogens, such as rotavirus, (EAEC), and Escherichia coli (ETEC), have been identified as important pathogens in diarrheal diseases, and rotavirus, which causes severe complications of diarrhea, has been found to be themost prominent cause of death in the world (Bern and Glass1994; Bishop 1994; Haffejee 1995). The severity of the etiological agent can be assessed by the setting in which it was most frequently isolated (com-munity, inpatients, or outpatients). Less severe agents wouldbe more frequently found in community settings, whereasmore severe ones should be more common in either outpa-tients or (mainly) inpatients. Median proportions of diar-rheal episodes attributable to each major cause of diarrheafrom community studies could therefore be applied to esti- mates of diarrhea morbidity to obtain episodes of diarrhealdiseases by cause, and median proportions from inpatientstudies could be applied to estimates of diarrhea mortalityto calculate the number of diarrheal deaths by etiology.However, because of the scarcity of data available for the African region we did not pursue these calculations. The studies included in the estimates of etiology by setting are listed in more detail in appendix table 9A.4. Table 9.3 shows the countries for which data on etiology were avail-able by setting (community, inpatients, or outpatients).

In our review, Giardia lamblia was more frequently isolated among children with diarrhea in the community studies, whereas EAEC was mainly seen amongoutpatients. Rotavirus was the etiological agent mostfrequently isolated in both inpatient and outpatient health services. Therefore, it is likely that rotavirus is the leadingcause of mortality due to diarrhea in Africa, as has beenobserved in other parts of the world. Coinfection of variousagents was reported in 16 percent and 7 percent ofcommunity-level studies in AFR D and AFR E, respectively.Because our review did not include publications of diarrheaoutbreaks, the magnitude of Vibrio cholerae, and Shigella dysenteriae type 1 is underrepresented in this review. Our estimates of the distribution of diarrhea etiology among children in Sub-Saharan Africa relied on published epidemiological studies. The same limitations reported forthe morbidity and mortality estimates therefore apply tothese etiological estimates. Moreover, very few studies wereidentified through the literature search for the Africanregion, and of those, not all have attempted to identify thewhole set of etiological agents. THE ROLE OF RISK FACTORS FOR DIARRHEAL DISEASE IN THE AFRICAN REGION Broadly recognized risk factors for diarrheal diseases include little or no access to safe water and sanitation, aswell as poor hygiene and feces disposal practices at home(Daniels et al. 1990; Haggerty et al. 1994; LaFond 1995; MacDougall and McGahey 2003). These and many otherfactors, such as poor housing and crowding, are intrinsical-ly associated with poverty. Furthermore, poverty usually limits access to health care and restricts appropriate and bal-anced diets. Inequities in exposure and resistance add up toinequities in coverage of available preventive interventions,access to an appropriate health provider, and care, makingpoor children more likely to become sick than the better-offchildren (Victora et al. 2003). Some studies have identified a few family characteristics as protective factors. These are monogamy of the father, defined residential area (Vaahtera et al. 2000), having a private kitchen, and being cared for by the mother (Oni, Schumann, and Oke 1991). These factors are of special importance inSub-Saharan Africa, where the AIDS epidemic has led to an unprecedented number of orphans (about 12 million by theend of 2001) that is likely to more than double during thisdecade (Dabis and Ekpini 2002). A WHO report on global water supply provides worri- some figures of current and future scenarios for Africa(WHO 2000). Of all the regions in the world, the Africanregion was the only one showing a decline in the proportionof the population that had access to sanitation between 1990and the year 2000 (figure 9.5). Approximately 50 percent (300 million individuals) of the African population have no access to safe water, and 66 percent (400 million individuals) lack access to hygienicsanitation. It is expected that by the year 2020 these figureswill rise to 400 million and 500 million, respectively.Table 9.6 gives data on feces disposal practices at home in urban and rural regions of four African countries. Such prac- tices have provided the rationale for more preventive inter-ventions and are likely to explain the higher prevalence ofdiarrheal disease in rural areas.As in most developing regions of the world, African countries' poorest populations live inrural areas. Table 9.7 presents the medians of the prevalenceof diarrheal disease according to urban and rural areas. SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS There is an increasing concern that gender disparities might influence the distribution of ill-health and treatment,particularly in under-five girls. Some evidence suggests thatgirls in developing countries are prone to higher mortalityand poorer nutritional status than boys (Helen Keller International 1994; Sundary 1986). In Sub-Saharan Africa,few prospective studies lasting at least one year report sexdifferences at the community level (Perch et al. 2001). Someprospective studies conducted in health facilities on outpa-tients (Gomwalk 1993; et al. 1995; Steele et al.1998) show that boys are more likely than girls to be takento the facility because of diarrhea (boy-girl ratios are 2 to 1 and 4 to 1, respectively). However, nationally representativestudies, such as the DHSs, conducted from 1987 to 2001 inseveral Sub-Saharan African countries show no significantsex differences for health care-seeking behavior and treat-ment received, whether it is given at home or at a healthfacility. Findings are summarized in table 9.8. The African region has been a target of diarrheal epidemic outbreaks for several decades. One of the most dramatic manifestations of these outbreaks occurred in July1994 among Rwandan refugees in Goma, DemocraticRepublic of Congo (formerly Zaire), when almost 50,000refugees died during a diarrhea epidemic. The African region has replaced the Indian subcontinent as the new home of V. c h o l e ra e . The seventh cholera pandemic that originated in Asia reached Africa in the early 1970s. In 2001 there were more than 170,000 reported casesof cholera, which represented 94 percent of the globallyreported cases. From these, 2,590 people died. Nearly allcountries in Sub-Saharan Africa now regularly report casesof cholera. Table 9.9 shows the reported number of casesand deaths from cholera in the world and in the African region between 1996 and 2001. These figures, however, needto be interpreted with caution, since countries that haveendemic cholera appear not to have notified the WHO ofany cases of cholera.

S. dysenteriae serotype 1 has also been doc- umented to cause outbreaks of dysenteric diarrhea in sev- eral African countries (Birmingham et al. 1997; Guerinet al. 2003; Malakooti et al. 1997), including in refugee camps (Paquet et al. 1995). These organisms are important causes of morbidity and mortality in diarrhea outbreaksamong stable communities and more so in displaced pop-ulations or those affected by catastrophic events. The wide-spread use of antibiotics across all regions has increased theprevalence of antibiotic resistance in most bacterial entero-pathogens, increasing the risk in the region of an outbreak ofS. dysenteriae serotype 1 with multiresistant strains.

These interventions are exclu-sive breastfeeding, complementary feeding, safe water,good sanitation and hygiene, zinc and vitamin A supplementation, ORT, and antibiotics for dysentery. It is estimated that these interventions could prevent 22 per-cent of deaths due to diarrhea (Jones et al. 2003). Most of these interventions are feasible for implementation in low-income countries such as those in the African region; how-ever, the capacity to deliver these important interventionseffectively should be strengthened (Bryce et al. 2003). Theavailability of safe and effective rotavirus vaccines (Ruiz-Palacios et al. 2006; Vesikari et al. 2006), introduced in several countries in Latin America in 2005 are likely tocomplement these interventions, if effectively delivered.However, the stability of diarrhea rates observed in allreviews done since the 1980s shows that despite the reduc-tion of diarrhea mortality, most likely through better casemanagement, very little has been done to prevent thetransmission of diarrheal diseases. The progress towardbetter water and sanitation observed in other regions hasnot yielded a reduction of diarrhea morbidity, suggestingDiarrheal Diseases | 117that poor hygiene practices (Y eager et al. 1999) and the ingestion of contaminated food (Lanata 2003) may be the most important factors and where preventive interven- tions, like handwashing (Curtis and Cairncross 2003),should be promoted. CONCLUSION Despite data limitations in estimating accurate numbers of diarrhea cases and deaths, it becomes clear from the resultsof this and other reviews that diarrheal disease remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality among children under five years of age in the African region. Asopposed to the declining trends in the proportion of diar-rhea mortality in other developing regions of the world, vir- tually no decline has been observed in the African region since the early 1980s. Diarrheal diseases remain one of themajor killers of children under five, being responsible forabout 750,000 of a total of 4.3 million deaths of Africanchildren up to four years of age. More important than the precision in the numbers and in the exact contribution of each pathogen to diarrhea morbidity and mortality are the patterns and trends shownin this review. The fact that almost 40 percent of all diarrheadeaths in children under five worldwide occur in the Africanregion is striking. The diarrhea mortality burden amongchildren under five in Sub-Saharan Africa reveals the per-sistent magnitude of this preventable and treatable diseasein the region. The efficacy of existing interventions to prevent or treat diarrheal diseases and to thereby reduce diarrhea mortalityhas been proved. Large reductions in child mortality could be achieved with their implementation. Therefore, carefulplanning and evaluation of interventions to control casesand deaths due to diarrhea will be important if under-fivemortality is to be reduced and goal four of the Millennium Development Goals\u2014to reduce under-five mortality by two-thirds by 2015, from the base year 1990 (United Nations 2000)\u2014is to be achieved in the African region.

Because ofthe variable nature, extent, and timing of the disordersin the developing nervous system their clinical expression varies enormously from one individual to another, both in severity and in relative effect on the different areas of func-tion. Because developmental disabilities are a composite ofa large number of different health conditions, primary andsecondary prevention strategies vary for each of the compo-nent conditions, whereas tertiary prevention strategies,which address later effects on capacities in broad areas of function, are largely shared across disorders. These disabili-ties are likely to continue indefinitely and to result in sub-stantial limitations on many life activities, such as affectedindividuals' ability to care for themselves, express and re-ceive language, learn, be mobile, and live independent andeconomically self-sufficient lives.MEDICAL AND SOCIAL MODELS OF DISABILITY The definition just given has its origins in the medical model of disability, which views disability as a problem of the per- son, directly caused by disease, trauma, or other health con-dition and requiring individual medical care from health orrehabilitation professionals. Management of the disability is aimed at cure or, more realistically, at producing personaladjustment or behavior change by the individual inresponse to the disability. In contrast, the social model sees the issue mainly as a socially created problem attributable to environmental and contextual factors, such as lack of aware-ness or social stigma in the broader society and deficientsocial policies and legislation. These factors together createan environment for people with disabilities that limits activ-ity and restricts participation. In the medical model inter- vention usually means the prevention and early treatment ofhealth conditions in the individual (primary and secondaryprevention), whereas in the social model it means the pro-motion of functional capacity and the achievement of fullChapter10 Developmental Disabilities Geoff Solarsh and Karen J. Hofmanparticipation in the physical and social environment (terti- ary prevention). In this chapter an attempt is made to inte-grate these perspectives. The International Classification of Functioning In 1980 the World Health Organization (WHO) publishedtheInternational Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps (WHO 1980) as a companion classification to the International Classification of Diseases to document the consequences of congenital or acquired illnesses with nonfatal outcomes (figure 10.1). These consequences wereevident in impairments , defined as abnormalities of body or organ structures and functions; disabilities , defined as reduction of a person's ability to perform basic and everyday tasks; and handicaps , defined as a person's disadvantage in fulfilling social roles. This framework suggested a hierarchi- cal and linear relation between these three dimensions thatentailed a problem-solving sequence in which interventionsat one level have the potential to modify succeeding ele- ments (Fryers 1992). Two of the most important criticisms of this classifica- tion that are particularly relevant for this review are its fail-ure to adequately cover disabilities affecting children and itslimited utility for public health applications. A closely relat-ed criticism has been its failure to take into account the per-vasive role of the environment in exacerbating or reducingthe nature and extent of disablement. In its revised International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health the WHO (2001) has sought to address some of these criticisms and, in particular, to unify the apparent polarities in the medical and social models of disability (figure 10.2). In the International Classification of Functioning a person's functioning and disability is con- ceived as a dynamic interaction between health conditions (diseases, disorders, injuries, and trauma) and the effect ofcontextual and environmental factors in limiting activityand restricting participation. The Effect of Poverty In developing countries serious developmental disabilities represent only a proportion of the poor developmentaloutcomes of children and young adults. The neurological and developmental deficits that have their primary origin inadverse social and environmental conditions, such aspoverty, poor nutrition, and social deprivation, during thecritical years of early brain growth and development usuallypresent later in childhood as cognitive impairments andpoor performance at school. This group of at-risk infantsand children is likely to exceed by many times the numberof children with readily identifiable developmental disabili-ties. Because the contribution of this group to the burden ofdevelopmental disabilities is difficult to measure and theinterventions are more closely linked to broad communitydevelopment and poverty alleviation strategies, they will notbe considered, except in passing, in this chapter. This in noway implies that they have any less a priority in policies andprograms that address developmental disabilities in low-income countries. THE CHANGING BURDEN OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD Developmental disabilities and their prevention have not had much prominence on the public health agenda in devel-oping countries over the past three or four decades. Steadyshifts in the patterns of mortality and morbidity over thisperiod are now beginning to challenge these traditional public health priorities. The Health Transition Infant and child mortality has steadily declined in Sub- Saharan Africa countries during the second half of the twen-tieth century (Ahmad, Lopez, and Inoue 2000; Hill et al. 126 | Geoff Solarsh and Karen J. HofmanDisease or InjuryImpairment Source: WHO 1980.Handicap DisabilityFigure 10.1 Relationship between Impairment, Disability, and Handicap (ICIDH) Body functions and structuresActivities Participation Environmental factorsPersonal factorsHealth condition (disorder or disease) Source: Authors.Figure 10.2 Relationship between Body Functions, Activities, and Participation (ICF)1999) along with an accompanying fall in fertility (Cleland, Onuoha, and Timaeus 1994; Cohen 1993). This is a result of a complex process of social and economic change in these countries coupled with sustained implementation of familyplanning programs (United Nations Population Division1998) and primary health care interventions (Fauveau et al.1990; Grant 1992; Velema et al. 1991) that specifically target preventable diseases in infancy and childhood. This \"demographic and epidemiological transition\" has occurred at varying rates in different African countries. Infant mortality trends during the health transition in developed countries have shown large absolute decreases in postneonatal mortality accompanied by increases in theproportional contribution of neonatal mortality to overall infant mortality (MacFarlane and Mugford 1984). Theseshifts in the ratio of neonatal to postneonatal mortalityhave also occurred in countries in Sub-Saharan Africa withthe lowest infant mortality rates. Neonatal mortality nowaccounts for 45 percent of all infant deaths in South Africa(SADHS 1998, 7). These demographic changes suggest thata higher priority should be given to programs that addressperinatal conditions. They also signify a need to move awayfrom an exclusive preoccupation with child survival strate-gies to those that aim to improve the quality of survival inthe 92 to 95 percent of children now surviving beyond fiveyears in many African countries. Pointing to pregnancy and the neonatal period targets high-risk groups not only forresidual infant mortality but also for developmental disabil-ities, because many of the most important causes of thesedisabilities are addressed by interventions during thisperiod. The Impact of HIV Arguments for the assignment of a higher priority to research and programs that address developmental disabili-ties in low-income countries are regularly based on evidence for the health transition in these countries. These transi- tions, however, are generally uneven both between andwithin countries, and this is particularly true of the Africansubcontinent. The \"unfinished agenda\" of infectious dis- eases and malnutrition continues to make a variable contri- bution to postneonatal mortality and morbidity in the dif-ferent countries and their subpopulations, depending onsocial, economic, and political conditions and the coverageand quality of primary health care services. Many Africancountries are now reporting rising postneonatal mortalitywith patterns of disease often indistinguishable from those in the previous decade (Ahmad et al. 2000), and in manycases, the increase is attributed to the human immunodefi- ciency virus (HIV) epidemic (Nicoll et al. 1994; United Nations Population Division 1999). Recent evidence sug-gests that the proportion of under-five mortality attributa-ble to HIV and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome(AIDS) in Sub-Saharan Africa is quite variable (0.1 to42.4 percent) and that it is highest in some of the countrieswith the steepest reductions in postneonatal mortality in thepast two decades (Walker, Schwartlander, and Bryce 2002). These data suggest that programs to tackle developmen- tal disabilities may have a greater claim on national resourcesin some Sub-Saharan Africa countries than in others duringthis complex health transition. But even in countries withhigh under-five mortality and HIV seroprevalence rates, 8 or 9 out of every 10 children will survive beyond five years. Many of them will continue to be at risk for developmentaldisabilities because of preventable biological factors and thelack of services and programs to identify, treat, and amelio-rate the impact of these disabilities. Additionally, as will bediscussed later, children with HIV infection may be at specialrisk for developmental disabilities. Measuring the Burden of Developmental Disabilities Developmental disabilities, because of their early onset and lifelong requirement for support and care, impose enor-mous social and economic burdens on affected individuals,their families, and their communities. Calculation of the lossof disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) is now the method widely used to capture and compare the combined effect onthe global burden of disease (GBD) of premature mortalityand decreased functional capacity resulting from designatedhealth conditions (Murray 1994). An important obstacle tothe measurement of the burden of developmental disabili-ties in low-income countries is the lack of good qualityprevalence data. An additional concern stems from the char-acteristics and applications of the measurement itself. In burden-of-disease calculations the years of life lost for each death are estimated and assigned a relative value based on the age at death (age weighting). Age weighting isintended to reflect differential productivity of an individualat different stages of his or her life cycle and, thereby, assignsa different social value to lives lived at different ages. A yearlived at age 2 counts for only 20 percent of a year lived at 25,when the age-weighting function is at a maximum. The effectof this is to reduce the DALYs lost by premature death of chil-dren with developmental disabilities and to potentially lowerthe relative importance of these conditions in decisionsabout resource allocations (Anand and Hanson 1997). Developmental Disabilities | 127T o measure the additional contribution of disability, the number of years of healthy life lost is estimated by multiply- ing the expected duration of the condition (to remission or death) by a disability weighting (0-1). Disability weightingdoes not take into account the way that individual and socialresources can compensate for the level of disability experi-enced. The failure to factor in these compensatory mecha- nisms distorts burden-of-death estimates and undervalues the therapeutic and rehabilitation benefits offered by reha-bilitation professionals and programs (Jelsma, De Weerdt,and De Kock 2002). Developmental disabilities incorporate many different disease entities with their different causes; time of onset;natural histories; amenability to primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention; and the relative risk of premature mor-tality and functional limitation. Since the burden-of-diseasemethodology is based on calculations for individual diseaseentities, each of these would need to be addressed separatelyin order to arrive at a burden-of-disease estimate for devel-opmental disabilities as a whole. Without this information,more pressing and immediate issues, such as HIV/AIDS andmalaria, will dominate the health agenda and displacedevelopmental disabilities from consideration for resourceallocation. PREVALENCE AND INCIDENCE In low-income countries estimates of the frequency of devel- opmental disabilities invariably come from cross-sectionalsurveys, which measure prevalence, or the number of existing cases in the population. Although data on incidence, or the number of newly occurring cases, provide a better measure of true frequency in populations, repeat assessments of thesame children over shorter periods of time are not cost- effective in most low-income countries. Two-Phase Childhood Disability Surveys The best available standard for the measurement of the prevalence of developmental disabilities in population-based surveys is the two-phase survey method, which has been validated in many different population settings in the developing world (Durkin et al. 1994; Thorburn, Desai,and Davidson 1992; Zaman et al. 1990). The first phaseconsists of a survey of all households in a drawn sample or target population in which all children are screened using the \"ten questions\" questionnaire. In the second phaseall children screening positive and a random 10 percentsample of those screening negative undergo a detailed medical and psychological examination from which an eti-ological diagnosis is made and disability rated (none, mild,moderate, and severe) in each of the following areas: grossmotor, fine motor, vision, hearing, cognition, speech, and seizures. Two-phase surveys of this kind have been shown to have a high sensitivity but a low positive predictive value. They are, therefore, ideally suited to serve as screening instru-ments but completely inappropriate as case-finding tools forepidemiological studies or as the basis for referring childrenwith disabilities for rehabilitation services. Using the ten-question screen as the only basis for determining prevalenceof disabilities has been shown to overestimate prevalence byup to 300 percent (Durkin, Hasan, and Hasan 1995). Many clinical researchers have set the ethical requirement that all children screening positive in a target population should be included in the second phase so that they can bereferred to medical and rehabilitation services. Although nosimilar imperative applies to those screening negative, theinclusion of negatives is necessary (thus the minimal sampleof 10 percent) because, using this method, the prevalenceestimate for the total population is obtained as a weightedaverage of the rates in those screening positive versus thosescreening negative (Shrout and Newman 1989). Disability Prevalence Data in Sub-Saharan Africa Reliable data based on the criteria set above on the preva- lence of developmental disabilities is scarce in the Africansubcontinent. An initial Medline search was combined with a search of two major specialist disability journals, Disability and Rehabilitation and The International Journal of Rehabilitation Research, for the years 1995 to 2004 and a detailed review of all peer-reviewed publications within which the two-phase methodology is employed to measurethe prevalence of developmental disabilities in developingcountries. In the relatively few studies identified in Sub-Saharan Africa, not a single one fulfilled the methodologicalcriteria laid out above for two-phase disability studies. Most of the identified studies were conducted in South Africa. The prevalence rates for all categories of develop- mental disability in these studies varied from 11 to 60 per1,000 children (Cornielje et al. surveys were used in most studies, thephase 1 screening questionnaires were not standardized inall cases and were not validated for use in African popula-tions in any of the studies (table 10.1). 128 | Geoff Solarsh and Karen J. HofmanA more serious limitation is the variation in the methods or content of the evaluation in the second phase. These clin- ical assessments were not standardized, and they varied from repeat questionnaires by fieldworkers to assessments by rehabilitation assistants, rehabilitation professionals, andneurodevelopmental pediatricians. Additionally, for validcalculations of prevalence in two-phase studies a 10 percent sample of individuals screening negative should be included in the second phase. This did not occur in any of the citedstudies, nor was it always clear from the description of themethods how prevalence rates were derived. A final concernis the lack of a standardized approach in most studies to thegrading of severity of disability. Since it is clear from care-fully conducted studies elsewhere that the ratio between severe and mild disabilities may be very high, comparisonsbetween studies that include children of differing severitymay lead to erroneous conclusions about the true size andnature of the problem in different areas.A tabulation of some of the two-phase studies cond- ucted elsewhere in the developing world is provided as table 10.2 for comparison and similarly shows wide varia-tions in prevalence rates for all categories of disability inchildhood from different studies (Durkin et al. 1994; Durkin, Hasan, and Hasan 1995; Islam, Durkin, andZaman 2001; Zaman et al. 1990). The studies in Bangladesh,Jamaica, and Pakistan that provided the range in preva-lence of from 8.1 to 31.0 per 1,000 children were based onidentical and established methodologies, used the same setof instruments, and relied on identical rating systems forseverity. These rates in all likelihood reflect true differ-ences in the prevalence of developmental disabilities in these three countries and provide a strong platform onwhich to begin to look at types, determinants, and causesof disability and on which to build a rational approach tointervention.

Severe mental retardation (MR), defined as a decreased general intelligence quotient of less than or equal to 55, accompa- nied by significant limitations in adaptive capability, is con-sistently found to be in the range of 3 to 5 per 1,000 personsin developed countries. In the few available studies fromlow-income countries, rates are significantly higher andrange from 6 per 1,000 and 22 per 1,000 for severe MR and14.5 per 1,000 and 65.3 per 1,000 for mild MR inBangladesh (Islam, Durkin, and Zaman 1993) and Pakistan(Durkin, Hasan, and Hasan 1998), respectively. The onlyequivalent figures from well-designed population-baseddisability surveys come from Zambia (Stein, Belmont, and Durkin 1987), where rates of 5 per 1,000 were recorded forsevere MR and 30 per 1,000 for mild MR, and in a recent study from rural South Africa (Christianson et al. 2002), where similar rates of 6.4 per 1,000 were noted for severeMR and 29.1 per 1,000 for mild MR. These figures are a littlelower than suggested averages for severe MR in developingcountries (9.3 per 1,000) but similar to suggested averages for mild MR (29.8 per 1,000; Roeleveld, Zielhuis, and Gabreels 1997). The failure to ascertain a specific biologicalcause in many of these children suggests that many cognitivedisabilities may have their origins in maternal and infantmalnutrition and impoverished environments, which havepervasive adverse effects on growth and psychological development. 130 | Geoff Solarsh and Karen J.

Onereport, which lacked a detailed second-phase medicalevaluation and did not include children screening negative, set the prevalence at 28 per 1,000 in a rural South Africandistrict (Couper 2002). A comparative rate of 19.5 per 1,000for severe motor disabilities and 52.5 per 1,000 for mildmotor disabilities was reported from Pakistan. There is aclear and immediate need for studies to document inde-pendent prevalence rates for motor disabilities, given itscommon association with severe cognitive disabilities andthe observation from studies elsewhere that it is animportant and common functional limitation in children with developmental disabilities (Durkin, Hasan, and Hasan1995). Vision Disabilities There are estimated to be 1.5 million blind children world- wide (WHO 1992). The prevalence of blindness in childrenin European countries varies from 0.2 to 0.4 per 1,000 chil-dren and in African countries from 0.5 to 1.1 per 1,000(Gilbert et al. 1999). Several studies have estimated that as much as 47 percent of blindness or severe visual impairmentin developing countries is preventable or curable (Adeoye1996; Nwosu 1998; Silver et al. 1995). Data from studiesdone in schools for the blind in East, central, and WestAfrican countries show that the most common causes ofblindness in children are acquired diseases, such as vitaminA deficiency (29 percent) and measles (27 percent) (Gilbertet al. 1993; Gilbert et al. 1995). Quite variable rates might be expected in countries at dif- ferent stages in the health transition. A recent study on the prevalence of blindness in South African schools for theblind supports this view (O'Sullivan, Gilbert, and Foster 1997). An overall estimate of blindness prevalence was 0.35to 0.6 per 1,000 children. Although 39 percent of causes ofblindness or severe visual impairment were found to be pre-ventable, only 5 percent of the affected children had condi-tions amenable to primary preventive measures, such asvitamin A deficiency or measles. Almost a quarter of thechildren (23 percent) had inherited conditions, intrauterineinfections, or retinopathy of prematurity; the majority of these problems were potentially preventable through geneticcounseling and improved antenatal and neonatal care.The remaining 11 percent needed sophisticated surgeryfor such conditions as cataracts of unknown origin andglaucoma. Hearing Disabilities Estimates of hearing loss and profound deafness in devel- oped countries are on the order of 1 per 1,000, comparedwith 1.4 to 4.0 in developing countries. The WHO estimatesthat there are 120 million people worldwide with hearingimpairment, and 78 million of those affected are in devel- oping countries (WHO 1995b). As in other domains, thereare few prevalence data on hearing disabilities in Sub-Saharan Africa. Where data are available, it is often difficultto separate methodological limitations from true differ-ences in prevalence between these studies (WHO 1995b).Reported rates of profound hearing loss range from 2.1 per1,000 (sensorineural loss) in Swaziland (Swart et al. 1995)to in (Seely et al. 1995; seetable 10.3). Chronic otitis media has been demonstrated to be the most frequent cause of hearing impairment in manydeveloping countries (Smith et al. 1996). Estimates suggestthat as much as 50 to 66 percent of all hearing impairmentin the developing world is preventable (Smith and Hatcher1992).

The definition specifically excludes learning problems that are primarilythe result of visual, hearing, or motor disabilities and thoseresulting from mental retardation or emotional disturbance.In Sub-Saharan Africa it may be difficult to distinguishbetween traditional learning disabilities and the conse-quences of adverse social and environmental conditions. No studies could be found that described the prevalence of learning disabilities in Sub-Saharan Africa. A Cape T ownstudy in a population not typical of most of the rest of the subcontinent found that the origin of 45 percent of learningdisabilities was prenatal, 17 percent was perinatal, 9 percentwas postnatal, and about 25 percent was unknown (Moltenoand Lachman 1996). The distribution between these etio-logical categories varied by ethnic group; children fromwhite and mixed race families had relatively high prenatalcontributions (55 percent) compared with children fromblack African families (23 percent). These relative contribu-tions were reversed in the perinatal category; black Africanchildren contributed 37 percent, and children from mixedrace groups, 8 percent. Similar distributions were found in an earlier Zimbabwean study but with a much higher pro- portion being of unknown cause (Axton and Levy 1974).Forty percent of all cases were considered to be preventable.Many of the children in these studies had other major dis-abilities, including motor, cognitive, and sensory deficits,raising doubts as to whether they fit the traditional defini-tion for this disorder. As developing countries go through the health transition, it seems likely that learning disabilities will become anincreasingly important concern as the countries begin tomake more qualitative investments in the future humanpotential and productivity of their populations. In a coun-try like South Africa, where economic development andrapid political change have coincided, the great demand foraccess to educational opportunities has highlighted thelearning deficits and, in some cases, the disabilities of manychildren. DETERMINANTS AND RISK FACTORS Developmental disabilities have a wide range of origins, occurring from the time of conception through an extendedperiod of rapid brain growth and development during pregnancy, infancy, and childhood. They may have theirearly beginnings in the genetic makeup of the parents, in thenutritional status of the mother throughout her life cycle, inmaternal health conditions and environmental exposureduring pregnancy, or in an early or abnormal birth process.They may be the consequence of adaptation difficulties soonafter birth; infections, poor nutrition, and injuries in infancyand childhood; or the complex and pervasive effects ofadverse social and environmental conditions in impover-ished communities (figure 10.3). These factors may actsingly or in combination and may make contributions ofvarying magnitude, depending on background infant andunder-five mortality rates, the quality of health services, andspecial risk factors that may apply in individual locationsor subpopulations. These factors may also vary in theiramenability to intervention. An understanding of these factors and their population- attributable risk is a critical preamble to the development of strategies for primary and secondary prevention. This sec-tion highlights risk factors for developmental disabilities forwhich evidence exists from Sub-Saharan Africa or otherdeveloping countries of high prevalence or public health and economic impacts, or both, and viable, if unrealized,potential for prevention. Congenital Disorders Congenital disorders are defined here as any potentially dis- abling condition arising before birth and including those caused by environmental, genetic, and unknown factors, whether they are evident at birth or become manifest later in life. It does not include congenital infections or nutri-tional factors influencing intrauterine growth, which will bediscussed later. The frequency of congenital disorders is best described in terms of birth prevalence, that is, affected births per 1,000 in the absence of a prevention program. Since there are noprevalence data from developing countries, projections arebased on data from developed countries; adjustmentsare made for regional differences in the prevalence ofhemoglobin disorders (WHO 1994), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (Luzzato and Mehta 1989), andthe effect of customary consanguineous marriage (Alwanand Modell 1997), all of which have their greatest burden inless-developed parts of the world (table 10.4). The estimatedrate of 61 per 1,000 in Sub-Saharan Africa, which approxi-mates or exceeds infant mortality in some Sub-SaharanAfrican countries, is inflated by the inclusion of fetal losses, 132 | Geoff Solarsh and Karen J.

In West Africa 2 to 3 percent of all children have a serious hemoglobinopathy (sickle-cell anemia, thalassemia) (Adeoye 1973; Obama et al. 1994). These children are at riskfor nervous system complications, the frequency of whichmay be as high as 12.8 percent. Complications of sickle-celldisease in children include mental changes, cerebrovascularaccidents, cranial nerve palsies, dural sinus salmo-nella and pneumococcal meningitis. A recent study in theUnited States revealed that 33 percent of children observedwith sickle-cell disease had mild mental retardation (Steen et al. 1999). Down syndrome has until quite recently been regarded as rare in black African populations. Reports of a birth preva-lence of 1.16 (Adeyokunnu 1982) and 2.09 (Venter et al.1995) per 1,000 from Nigeria and South Africa, respectively,suggest that it may be more common than previouslythought. These figures may also underrepresent the trueprevalence, because evidence suggests that the syndromein some of these children may go unrecognized or unde-clared in rural black communities (Christianson andKromberg 1996). The prevalence is likely to be higher in Sub-Saharan Africa countries that have high fertility rates,where effective family planning programs and prenatalscreening programs are often lacking and where 11 to15 percent of births occur to mothers over the age of35 years (Drugan et al. 1999). The reported incidence of neural tube defects varies from country to country, from region to region within the samecountry, and from time to time (Windham and Edmonds1982). A reported prevalence for neural tube defects of 7 per1,000 children in Nigeria may have overestimated the inci-dence, because the study was based at a tertiary referral hos-pital (Windham and Edmonds 1982). The only availablepopulation-based estimate of 3.35 per 1,000 comes from apreviously cited study in rural South Africa. Although consanguineous marriages are considered to be an important cause of congenital abnormalities in manyparts of the world, having particularly high prevalence inparts of South Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa, thecontribution of such marriages to the burden of develop-mental disabilities appears to be relatively small in mostparts of Sub-Saharan Africa. It has been extrapolated fromthe birth incidence of single gene disorders in developedcountries that the equivalent birth incidence in Sub-SaharanAfrica is likely to be on the order of 25 per 1,000 (table 10.4). The collective impact is significant, but none of the individ-ual disorders is a public health problem with sufficiently high population-attributable risk to currently merit target- ed intervention. Perinatal and Neonatal Conditions Perinatal events, such as preterm delivery, low birthweight, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), and birth asphyxiaor injury, are commonly associated with an elevated risk of early neonatal death and, in those who survive, of impaired physical, sensory, or mental development in infancy andchildhood. Many factors, acting singly or in combination,contribute to the elevated frequency of these events in low- income countries. These include the effect on the growing and developing fetus of maternal macro- and micronutrientdeficiencies before and during pregnancy; the direct andindirect effects of maternal systemic and genital tract infec-tions, such as syphilis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and malar-ia; and the neurological effects of low blood glucose, hypox-ia, bilirubin toxicity, and acquired infections in the first few days of life. Many of these risks may be aggravated or ame-liorated, depending on the availability and quality of ante-natal, delivery, and postnatal services. In areas in which maternal and neonatal services are poor and birth asphyxia is an important cause of developmentaldisabilities, operational research to develop and evaluatealternative approaches to the delivery of these servicesshould be a first priority. In settings in which adequatematernal and neonatal services are available, research isurgently needed on the etiology and prevention of adverseperinatal outcomes, such as low birthweight, preterm birth,and IUGR; on the causal pathways between these factors and developmental disabilities; and on the differentialimpact of their prevention on the prevalence of neurodevel-opmental disabilities in low-income countries. In undertak-ing this research it will be important to define IUGR andits subtypes (Goldenberg et al. 1989); distinguish betweenIUGR and its antecedents, many of which are independentrisk factors for poor neurodevelopmental outcome (Breartand Poisson-Salomon 1988); control for poor social andenvironmental and thatmay modify neurodevelopmental outcomes (Breart andPoisson-Salomon 1988); select a set of outcomes that aresufficiently prevalent, well defined, and stable over time sothat they can be measured with precision at defined timepoints; and use reasonable sample sizes. 134 | Geoff Solarsh and Karen J. HofmanINFECTION Numerous prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal infections can damage the developing nervous system or sensory pathwaysand cause long-term disabilities in children and youngadults. The relative contribution of these infections to theburden of developmental disabilities is likely to vary from country to country, influenced by overall infant mortality,postneonatal contribution to infant mortality, and regionaldifferences in the distribution of the infections known to beassociated with neurological sequelae during these differentperiods in the early life cycle. Congenital Rubella Congenital rubella is a major global cause of preventable hearing impairment, blindness, and intellectual disability.Mathematical modeling has yielded a global disease burdenestimate for congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) of 110,000to 300,000 new cases per year (Cutts and Vynnycky 1999). The incidence of CRS has been variably set at 0.5 to 2.2 per1,000 live births in developing countries during epidemics,which occur every four to seven years (Cutts et al. 1997).Although many developed countries have set eliminationgoals, only 28 percent of developing countries routinely vac-cinate against rubella (Robertson et al. 1997). No countriesin Sub-Saharan Africa include rubella in their nationalimmunization program, and rubella serology, which isessential for surveillance, is unavailable in much of the sub- continent (Robertson 2000). It is recommended that countries wishing to undertake prevention programs for CRS should either mount vaccina-tion programs for adolescent girls or women of reproduc-tive age or offer universal vaccination in infancy as part ofroutine childhood immunizations, accompanied by serolog-ical surveillance of women of reproductive age. These pro-grams should be undertaken only if the current expandedprograms of immunization are already achieving coverageof 80 percent or more. Coverage of less than 80 percent mayresult in reduced transmission in childhood but leave a largenumber of women susceptible when they reach reproduc-tive age. A recent cost-benefit analysis of universal rubellavaccination indicates economic benefits comparable toHaemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines (Hinman et al. 2002). Congenital Syphilis Congenital syphilis is a common and important cause of diverse clinical manifestations in the newborn infant thatinclude deafness, interstitial keratitis, and mental retarda- tion. It is largely preventable through screening and ade-quate treatment in pregnancy of the 4 to 15 percent ofwomen known to be affected in Sub-Saharan Africa (Schulz,Cates, and O'Mara 1987). In spite of the availability of an established and highly cost-effective intervention, it was found, in a recent surveyof 22 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, that only 38 percent of women attending antenatal clinics were being screenedand treated for syphilis (Gloyd, Chai, and Mercer 2001). Ithas been roughly estimated that every year up to 600,000opportunities are missed to reduce adverse fetal and infant outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although reductions in fetal wastage and neonatal mortality may be the main bene-fits, more effective antenatal treatment will also reducedefined risks for developmental disabilities in thesechildren. Other congenital infections such as cytomegalovirus, tox- oplasmosis, and herpes infections are also responsible for important neurological sequelae, but because they occur lessfrequently and are less amenable to primary or secondaryprevention, they are given less weight in this review. HIV Infection HIV infection is known to have an adverse effect on the developing central nervous system and could potentiallymake a substantial contribution to the burden of develop- mental disabilities in populations with high HIV seropreva- lence. HIV infection causes damage to the central nervoussystem through direct cytopathic effects such as occursin HIV-associated encephalopathy (Brustle et al. 1992), or as a result of vasculopathy or immune-mediated factors. Secondary complications of immunodeficiency, such asopportunistic infections, malignancy, and intracranial hem-orrhage, may lead to brain damage. Thrombocytopenia,from direct damage to the bone marrow or as an indirectconsequence of opportunistic infections, predisposes HIV-infected children to intracranial hemorrhages and strokes (Mueller 1994). These children are also at higher risk foropportunistic infections of the central nervous system, suchas toxoplasmosis or cryptococcal meningitis (Aylward et al.1992; Mueller 1994), although such infections occur less fre-quently in children than in adults. Neurological problems inHIV-infected children have been described with varyingfrequency from different parts of the world. In a natural his-tory study from South Africa, neurological abnormalitieswere found in approximately 50 percent of children fol-lowed to 18 months of age (Bobat et al. 1998). In Rwanda, Developmental Disabilities | 13515 to 40 percent of HIV-infected infants were found to have abnormalities by 6 months of age (Msellati et al. 1993). The developmental trajectory of such infected children is confounded by maternal, social, and biological risk factors during pregnancy and early childhood. Maternal substanceand drug abuse, more common in HIV-infected women, isknown to have an independent adverse effect on brain growth and neurodevelopmental outcome. Low birthweight and prematurity, poverty, protein calorie malnutrition, andmicronutrient deficiencies, more frequently seen in HIV-infected children, particularly in developing countries, may similarly compromise early child development (Brouwers et al. 1996). Children who are persistently ill lose a sense ofmastery motivation and hence fail to practice new develop- ment skills, especially during the first two years of life (Tradet al. 1994). Maternal-child interaction is affected as HIVdisease progresses and as maternal emotional availabilitydecreases, resulting in irregular attachment. The observa-tion has been made that HIV-uninfected children of HIV-positive mothers are also at higher risk for cognitive aca-demic and language delays than the general population(Condini et al. 1991). This may be similarly mediatedthrough the social, economic, and environmental conse-quences of the infection on other household members(Faithfull 1997; Kotchik 1997; Miles et al. 1997). Malaria Malaria is the leading cause of childhood mortality and morbidity in large tracts of the subcontinent. Because cere-bral malaria is a well-known and not infrequent complica- tion and may result in neurological sequelae in survivors, malaria has the potential to make a significant contributionto the burden of developmental disabilities in Sub-SaharanAfrica. The neuropathology of cerebral malaria stems from a series of complex mechanisms, which may operate inde- pendently or in combination to adversely affect thedeveloping brain. These include hypoglycemia, multipleseizures, reduced cerebral perfusion associated with raisedintracranial pressure, hypoxia associated with microvascu-lar obstruction, and tissue damage following induction of cytokine cascades (Marsh 1995). The sequelae reportedin order of frequency were hemiplegia or hemiparesis,speech disorders, blindness, hearing impairment, cerebralpalsy, and epilepsy. Because children often have multipleneurological sequelae it is not possible to disaggre-gate these data to provide absolute rates for each type ofsequelae.In a pooled analysis from five recent studies with similar definitions of cerebral malaria and comparable methodolo- gies and diagnostic criteria, a neurological sequelae rate insurvivors of 16 percent was reported (Snow et al. 1999). A range in reported incidence of neurological sequelaefrom 9 percent (Molyneux et al. 1989) to 23 percent(van Hensbroek et al. 1997) reflects differences in what areconsidered to be significant deficits on discharge and thosethat resolve over subsequent periods of observation. Theoverall rate of persisting neurological sequelae in studiesthat lasted at least six months was 5.6 percent and providesa better estimate of true incidence. Assuming that only chil-dren with cerebral malaria who reach hospitals are likely tosurvive, that even these children have a case-fatality rate of16.7 percent, and that only 5.6 percent of survivors havepersistent neurological sequelae after six months, it has been estimated that the annual risk of neurological sequelae forcerebral malaria is 0.03 per 1,000 in children zero to fouryears of age and 0.006 per 1,000 in children five to nine yearsof age (van Hensbroek et al. 1997). This amounts to 2,443and 402 annual neurological sequelae events in these twoage groups, respectively. Because the underlying assump-tions for these estimates are quite conservative, it is likelythat the burden of sequelae is higher than the figure pre-sented. These assumptions, if correct, also suggest that pri-mary prevention of malaria may have differential impact onmalaria-specific mortality and disability. Bacterial Meningitis A recent survey of mostly hospital-based epidemiological studies throughout Sub-Saharan Africa provides an initialbasis for calculating incidence rates for bacterial meningitis and its most common pathogens in the subcontinent (Peltola 2001). These studies also provide important infor-mation on overall and pathogen-specific case-fatality andneurological sequelae rates in African children. In the absence of prospective population-based studies, the few incidence data available for all causes of bacterial meningitis permit a tentative estimate of annual incidence atabout 25 per 100,000, or 180,000 cases for the subcontinentas a whole. On the basis of published epidemiological andlaboratory data, 50 percent of cases can be assumed to becaused by Hib, giving an estimate of about 90,000 cases of Hib meningitis per year. Because the vast majority of casesoccurred in children under the age of five years, the incidencein this age group is estimated to be 74 cases per 100,000.This calculation tallies quite well with data in the same agegroup from five African countries. Annual incidence rates of 136 | Geoff Solarsh and Karen J. HofmanHib meningitis (per 100,000 children under the age of five years) was 72 in Senegal (Cadoz, Denis, and Mar 1981), 62 in Burkina Faso (Tall et al. 1994), 60 in The Gambia (Bijlmer and van Alphen 1992), 53 in Niger (Campagne et al.1999), and 51 among black children in South Africa (Husseyet al. 1994). Although meningococcal meningitis predomi-nates in the meningitis belt, it has its greatest impact on adults, and overall, Hib and Streptococcus pneumoniae pre- dominate as causes of meningitis in young children in the subcontinent as a whole. On the basis of data from several studies evaluating neu- rological sequelae of bacterial meningitis according to etiol-ogy, it is estimated that about 40 percent of those survivingHib meningitis, 50 percent of those surviving pneumococ- cal meningitis, and 10 percent of those surviving meningo-coccal meningitis had long-term sequelae. Measles For the vast majority of children with measles infection the main risk is death rather than nonintact survival. A notableexception, as has been mentioned earlier, is the occurrence of blindness in measles survivors, which has been cited as one of the most important preventable causes of blindnessin the populations of Sub-Saharan Africa. Measles immu-nization has long been accepted as one of the most cost- effective interventions in child health. The main challenge will be to replicate more widely the high vaccination cover-age and virtual elimination of measles that has beenachieved in many countries on the subcontinent. Tetanus Neonatal tetanus (NNT) remains an important cause of infant mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa, where it has beenestimated that 150,000 neonates suffer from NNT each year (Galazka and Gasse 1995). The full extent of the problem may be much larger than this, and the WHO has suggestedthat in some areas as many as 95 percent of cases may gounrecognized (WHO 1997). Since high case-fatality rates of up to 90 percent have been reported for NNT, the main end point of interest in most studies has been neonatal deathrather than neurological sequelae. In early studies it wasthought that no permanent neurological damage occurredin survivors of NNT (Gadoth et al. 1981; Sharma et al.1976). However, frequent uncontrolled spasms associatedwith prolonged apnea and drops in oxygen saturation may lead to hypoxic brain damage. Later long-term studies fromIndia and Turkey have suggested that 13 to 37.5 percent ofsurvivors had significant impairments (Anlar, Y alaz, and Dizmen 1989; Gadoth et al. 1981). In a recent study in Kenyasignificant reductions in head circumference were noted inNNT survivors (Barlow et al. 2001). These children also hadmore problems with hand-eye coordination, lower develop-mental scores, more mild neurological abnormalities, andmore frequently reported behavioral problems. The main intervention to prevent NNT is the provision of three doses of tetanus toxoid (TT) to women in their first pregnancy and a single booster dose in each of the subse-quent pregnancies, in addition to following safe hygienicpractices at birth and in the postnatal period. In a globalend-of-decade assessment of TT coverage, 71.3 percent ofpregnant women were reported to have received at least twodoses of TT in their previous pregnancy (UNICEF 1999). Ithas been shown in tetanus seroprevalence surveys in Sub-Saharan Africa that estimates of TT coverage significantlyunder measure protection against NNT (Deming et al.2002) and that many countries may be approaching WorldSummit of Children year 2000 goals of 90 percent TT cov-erage. This is reflected in a dramatic decline in the number of clinical cases in some parts of the subcontinent (Jeena,Wesley, and Coovadia 1999). Given that vaccination coverage is reasonably high and serological protection even higher, and that high mortality rates in unvaccinated populations result in high neonatalmortality, we speculate that NNT makes a very modest con-tribution to burdens of developmental disability in Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. It may represent a more signifi-cant problem in selected countries, where the main thrust must be to improve TT coverage. NUTRITION There is now evidence linking many nutritional deficienciesto deficits in cognition, motor performance, and behavior.There is substantial evidence that protein-energy malnutri-tion and deficiencies in iron and iodine, all of which havebeen and continue to be prevalent in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, are associated with long-term deficits in cognitionand school performance. However, this relationship is com-plex and affected by the severity and duration of the defi-ciency, the stage of the child's development, the coexistenceof other biological conditions, and a number of sociocultu-ral factors. It is difficult to establish that the association iscausal, as there have been few randomized controlled treat-ment trials with long-term follow-up. The evidence foran association between common nutrient deficiencies in Developmental Disabilities | 137Sub-Saharan Africa and later development is briefly reviewed below. Iodine Deficiency Iodine deficiency has multiple and serious adverse effects,including impaired cognitive function, and it is consideredto be the leading cause of preventable mental retardation and brain damage worldwide. A 1999 review of data on the status of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) demonstrated that IDD is a public health problem in 44 out of 46 coun-tries in Sub-Saharan Africa and that an estimated 295 mil-lion people living in these countries are potentially at riskfor iodine deficiency (WHO, UNICEF, and ICCIDD 1999).Its well-known effect on mental development has played animportant role in mobilizing political, public health, andnutritional activists in support of national and internationalprevention programs. Efforts at prevention and controlfocus mainly on the iodization of salt, and as a result of con- certed public health prevention efforts, salt iodization wasreported, by 1999, to have reached 63 percent of householdsin Sub-Saharan Africa. In a recent study of seven Africancountries one year following the introduction of salt iodiza-tion, increases in median urinary iodine to above levels con-sidered to constitute iodine deficiency was observed in allcountries (Delange, de Benoist, and Alnwick 1999). Progress toward the elimination of IDD through universal salt iodization, with its anticipated impact on cognitive impair-ment, appears to be one of the most significant successes inthe field of noncommunicable diseases. However, the chal-lenge still remains to ensure that salt iodization reaches allpopulations. Recent studies in South Africa and Lesothoshowed that, in spite of compulsory iodization of salt,iodine deficiency remains a significant problem in primaryschool children in more remote areas of the country (Sebotsa et al. 2003; van Stuijvenberg et al. 1999). Vitamin A Deficiency Vitamin A is an essential micronutrient for normal growth, for normal functioning of the visual system, for the mainte-nance of normal epithelial integrity and immune function, and for normal reproduction. Consequently, vitamin A deficiency (V AD) results in increased severity of certaininfections and an increased risk of disease and death inyoung children. More severe vitamin A depletion leads to night blindness, which can evolve to irreversible partial or total blindness if the depletion continues (Sommer andWest 1996; WHO 1996). Evidence for the contribution of V AD to the burden of visual impairment in Sub-SaharanAfrica is the main interest in this review and has been pre-sented earlier. There is evidence to suggest that there hasbeen a decrease in clinical V AD (ACC/SCN 1997), manifest as eye lesions, largely as a result of more effective vitamin Asupplementation programs in many developing countries,including Sub-Saharan Africa. However, recent estimates forclinical V AD and subclinical V AD still range between 2.8 million and 3.3 million and 140 million to 251 millionpreschool children, respectively (UNICEF and TulaneUniversity 1998; WHO 1995a). It, therefore, continues to bea major public health problem for which there are relativelysimple and cost-effective interventions. Iron Deficiency The WHO has estimated that about 40 percent of the world's population suffer from anemia and that a substan-tial proportion of that burden is attributable to iron defi-ciency. There is a particularly high prevalence of anemia inpregnant women (50 percent), children in the first two years of life (40 percent), and schoolchildren (40 percent)(WHO 2000). With regard to preschool children, anemiaprevalence is the highest in Africa (42 to 53 percent) andAsia of all WHO regions (WHO 1998). An associationbetween hemoglobin concentration and psychomotor per-formance has been demonstrated at all stages of life.Although there is a good biological basis for claiming that adeficiency of iron might impair mental and motor develop-ment, an Expert Group, in weighing up the available evi- dence (Idjradinata and Pollitt 1993), concluded that onlyanemia, and not iron deficiency without anemia, impairsthe behavior and development of infants (Draper 1997).There now appears to be sufficient evidence to show thatiron supplementation of anemic children over two years ofage improves development but that this effect is less conclu-sive in children under the age of two years (Grantham-McGregor and Ani 2001). Poverty and Protein-Energy Malnutrition Although there is evidence that the levels of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) in Sub-Saharan populations haveimproved and the spectrum of these deficiencies haschanged over the past 30 to 40 years, there is still a substan-tial burden of PEM in many populations in the subregion. For many reasons it has been difficult to establish a causal 138 | Geoff Solarsh and Karen J. Hofmanrelationship between undernutrition and behavioral and cognitive development in these children. The main classifi- cation of malnutrition used in these studies defines a mixture of clinical signs that are a product of coexistentinfections and many other deficiencies, such as zinc, magne-sium, copper, and iron, as well as protein and energy, each ofwhich may have an independent and different effect on developmental outcomes (Grantham-McGregor 1995). Malnourished children usually come from families whosuffer from numerous disadvantages. These include poorsocial, economic, and environmental living conditions and unstable family units with large numbers of closely spaced children. The parents are often unwell, poorly nourished,and depressed; young with low intelligence and levels of education; either unemployed or in low-skilled occupations;and likely to have low social and media contacts. Few toys orbooks can be found in the homes of these families, and par-ents participate little in play activities; thus there is littlestimulation. The best evidence for a causal effect of undernutrition on cognition and behavior is likely to come from randomizedcontrolled trials. It has been considered unethical to con-duct randomized controlled trials to study the effects ofmalnutrition on behavior and development. It has thereforebeen necessary to rely on less satisfactory epidemiologicalstudy designs, such as case-control studies, which have been unable to control for the wide-ranging nature of thesechildren's disadvantages. There is also some uncertainty about whether cognitive impairment is an inevitable consequence of severe earlymalnutrition and what form it is likely to take. Animal experimentation initially suggested that early malnutrition significantly reduced brain growth and left it permanently smaller in size (Winick and Noble 1966). More recent workhas shown that many of these dramatic anatomic alterationsare reversible. It also shows that parallel alterations in neu-rotransmitter and receptor characteristics are evident,resulting in subtler neurodevelopmental deficits in motiva-tion, emotional reactivity, and cognitive flexibility ratherthan in frank reductions in intelligence (Levitsky andStrupp 1995). In spite of all these limitations and uncertainties evidence suggests that previously malnourished children show adeficit in tests of cognitive function or intelligence. Thiseffect is particularly strong if the undernutrition is chronicand if they return to poor environments. The effect is lessclear in children exposed to acute episodes of malnutritionwho do not return to impoverished social conditions(Grantham-McGregor 1995). In unraveling the complex relationship between malnutrition and cognition, severalquestions remain unanswered\u2014these include questions about the duration of the cognitive deficits, the specific types of cognitive functions that are affected, the relativeeffect of malnutrition at different points in early childhood,whether complete recovery can occur following placement in enriched environments, and the relative contribution of individual nutrients to cognitive deficits. ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS Alcohol Fetal alcohol syndrome is the most common single prevent- able cause of mental retardation worldwide (Viljoen 1999), and the overall rate for the developed world, where the vast majority of prevalence studies have been based, has been placed at 0.97 per 1,000 children (Abel 1995). It has its high- est rates in subgroups of the population characterized bylow socioeconomic status and confounded by race. Forexample, in American Indians and African Americans, ratesof 8 per 1,000 children (May et al. 1983) and 2.29 per 1,000have been found, considerably in excess of rates in the U.S.population as a whole. The only published studies or reports on fetal alcohol syndrome in Sub-Saharan Africa are confined to a subgroup of the \"coloured,\" or mixed race, community in the Western Cape of South Africa, where a prevalence rate of 40.5 to46.4 per 1,000 children age five to nine years has recentlybeen measured (May et al. 2000). This is the highest rate forfetal alcohol syndrome ever recorded anywhere in the worldand appears to be attributable to very high alcohol intake inthis South African subpopulation as a consequence of a spe-cial set of historical and social conditions. The principal effect of alcohol teratogenicity is brain damage with consequent lowering of intelligence (meanintelligence quotient 65), behavioral abnormalities (atten-tion deficit, hyperactivity, aggressiveness), and poor lan- guage assimilation. The syndrome also presents with a rec- ognizable cluster of facial features and a maternal history ofheavy alcohol intake in pregnancy, often imbibed in a pat-tern of binge drinking. There is no reason to believe that theoverall prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa is particularlyhigh, but it may occur in other subpopulations with lowsocioeconomic status and histories of high alcohol intake. Inthese subpopulations, interventions to prevent or reducealcohol ingestion should assume high priority. Developmental Disabilities | 139Other Toxins Other toxins, such as drugs, nicotine, and heavy metals, may result in cognitive and developmental deficits in young chil-dren. No information could be found on the prevalence ofdisabilities attributable to these toxins in Sub-SaharanAfrica, although there is clear evidence of exposure to lead, for example, and every reason to expect that some contribu-tion, albeit small, is made by these and other toxins to theburden of disabilities in this subregion. ACCIDENTS AND INJURIES For children in Africa who survive the first four years of life, head injury becomes the most likely cause of disability ordeath, and this remains true until the fourth decade of life(Kibel, Joubert, and Bradshaw 1990). Insofar as these acci-dents and injuries result in significant damage to the devel- oping central nervous systems, they can be said to make acontribution to the burden of developmental disabilities inyoung children in the subcontinent. In 1990, DALY ratesattributable to injuries and noncommunicable diseases,taken together, among children age five to fourteen yearshad already exceeded those attributable to infectious, peri-natal, and nutritional conditions (Deen et al. 1999). DALYrates attributable to injuries were highest in Sub-SaharanAfrica and India, were higher for boys than for girls and for children zero to four years than for children five to nineyears of age. Road traffic accidents, falls, burns, and acci-dental poisoning are the most common categories of child-hood accidents and unintentional injuries. The largest num-ber of intentional injuries was caused by war. Hundreds ofthousands of children are permanently disabled in Africaevery year as a consequence of war injuries and poor traumacare (Bickler and Rode 2002). During 2000 a total of 11major wars were being fought in Africa, involving 20 percentof the population on the subcontinent. It is estimated that120,000 to 200,000 child soldiers age five to sixteen years areparticipating in such conflicts, some of whom sustain bulletand shrapnel wounds as well as burns and land mineinjuries. No figures are available for intentional injuries, butthese figures may significantly increase the total burden ofinjuries in some populations. In a community-based survey of injury-related disability in Ghana, children zero to five and five to fourteen years ofage accounted for 14 percent and 10 percent, respectively,of all disability in urban populations and 2.8 percent and12.3 percent, respectively, of injuries in rural populations(Mock et al. 1999). The majority of these injuries in the zero to four age group were due to falls or burns in both urban and rural populations. INTERVENTIONS Given the large and continued contribution of infectious, perinatal, and nutritional conditions to under-five mortalityin many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, the goal and measure of success of most public child-health interventions in Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be an improvement inchild survival. We argued earlier that since the majority ofthese children (90 to 95 percent) are likely to survive beyond early childhood, some consideration should be given to the reduction of developmental disabilities as a parallel endpoint for child health programs in the subcontinent. We alsoargued that given the increasing focus on pregnant womenand neonates as the target groups for these interventionsand shared causal pathways for mortality and disability inearly childhood, these parallel end points, namely, reduc- tions in mortality and developmental disabilities, make pro-grammatic sense. The effect of existing interventions that reduce child mortality on the prevalence and incidence of childhood dis- abilities is likely to be complex. In the absence of any data onthis relationship in developing countries, it seems reason-able to speculate that effective primary prevention of manyof the conditions covered in this review, such as vaccine-preventable diseases, is likely to have parallel effects inreducing burdens of both mortality and disability in Sub-Saharan Africa, although the extent of disability reductionmay be quite modest. It has been suggested that this groupof children in developing countries may have a dispropor-tionately high mortality rate later in childhood as a conse-quence of ongoing limitations in their access to high-qualitymedical and social care (Durkin 2002). Secondary prevention is likely to have, if anything, the opposite effect; intervention at the point where disease is already present may prevent death at the expense of nonin-tact survival. Interestingly, although cerebral palsy preva-lence increased during the early 1970s and 1980s in devel-oped countries (Bhushan, Paneth, and Kiely 1993; Stanleyand Watson 1992), cerebral palsy rates in the 1980s and1990s, presumably as a consequence of improvements inneonatal intensive care and increased survival of infantswith antenatal and postnatal brain damage, have been eitherstable (Colver al. 2000; Hagberg et al. 1996) or decreas-ing (Grether and Nelson 1997; O'Shea, Klinepeter, and 140 | Solarsh and Karen J. HofmanDillard T opp, Uldall, and Langhoff-Roos 1997) as sur- vival rates continue to increase. It has been suggested that changing rates of postnatal brain damage are the more like- ly explanation for the secular trends in cerebral palsy preva-lence in developed countries over the last three decades(O'Shea 2002). These trends are confounded by variationsin case definitions, ascertainment strategies, and study methods between studies and over time. These issues, par- ticularly in the area of secondary prevention, will be equallyif not more problematic for the measurement of trends indevelopmental disability prevalence in developing countries and particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Primary Prevention Population-based interventions aimed at primary preven- tion of diseases the risk of which is attributable to highpopulation offer the most attractive approach to tackling developmental disabilities in Sub-Saharan Africa. A general conceptual framework that has been proposed to guide thedevelopment and evaluation of all public health interven-tions (de Zoysa et al. 1998) has potential applications for interventions in the field of developmental disabilities (figure 10.4). The starting point in this framework is a detailed descrip- tion of the prevalence, types, severity, and distribution ofdevelopmental disabilities in methodologically sound two-phase population-based surveys. The case for good des-criptive epidemiological data on developmental disabilities in Sub-Saharan Africa has already been made. Given theexpense and effort in mounting these surveys, these descrip-tions have often been combined in previous studies with thenext steps in the research framework, namely, the determi-nation of biological risk factors and social determinants fordevelopmental disabilities. T ogether these data providethe necessary information to formulate potentially viableinterventions and to set up efficacy trials to test them.Subsequent steps, of less immediate relevance to this chap- ter, involve the refinement of these interventions basedon trial findings and their application and evaluation in\"real-world\" settings. Secondary Prevention Neonatal screening programs for congenital disorders, the identification of high-risk newborns for early multidiscipli-nary intervention programs, or screening in infancy for developmental delays at primary health care clinics have all been proposed as secondary prevention strategies to mini-mize the effect of neurological disorders once they havealready occurred. In some Sub-Saharan countries, such as South Africa, that have high attendance for antenatal care, supervised deliveries, postnatal care, and \"well-baby\" servic-es in the first year of life, these strategies provide the possi-bility of early intervention within established health facilitynetworks at strategic points during the neonatal and post-neonatal periods. Once screening has occurred, they permitdefinitive assessments and the institution of appropriate programs of management for identified children. The feasi-bility and relative benefit of these access strategies and earlyintervention programs need to be carefully weighed againstprimary and tertiary prevention in different populationsettings. A full consideration of the available primary and second- ary interventions and their relative cost-effectiveness is beyond the scope of this chapter. An exercise of this kind isunder way and will be the subject of a chapter in a separatemonograph ( Disease Control Priorities in Developing Developmental Disabilities | 141Step 1 Describe the problemStep 2 Identify biological and behavioral risk factorsStep 3 Explore context and identify determinantsStep 4 Formulate possible interventionsStep 5 Test interventions in rigorous efficacy trials Step 6 Formulate public health interventionsStep 7 Assess the efficacy of public health interventionsStep 8 Assess the effectiveness of public health interventions Source: De Zoysa et al. 1998.Step 9 Monitor impact of intervention at scaleFigure 10.4 Causal Pathways for Developmental DisabilitiesCountries, 2nd ed.) Because tertiary prevention is concerned with ameliorating the impact of established developmental disabilities and has been an important, if not the main, thrust in Sub-Saharan Africa, it merits special attention. Tertiary Prevention T ertiary prevention programs are needed for all children with established disabilities and this is particularly true forSub-Saharan Africa, where a large burden of established disability already exists as a result of past failures in primary and secondary prevention of the many conditions discussedearlier in this chapter. As the focus turns from mortality todisability as a public health end point, a better understand- ing is needed of the dynamic interplay between existing child survival strategies and interventions to specifically reduce orameliorate developmental disabilities in developing coun-tries, in general, and in Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular. For the majority of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, service provision to people with established disabilities willbe the starting point and, for some time, the dominant approach in addressing the needs of people with develop-mental disabilities. The concern in these programs is lesswith underlying causes than with improvement offunctional capacity of affected individuals and the enhance-ment of their participation in all aspects of community life.Their aim will be to combine direct and indirect therapeu-tic inputs by health and rehabilitation workers with supportand training for families and caregivers and societal inter-ventions to limit stigma and equalize opportunities in allwalks of life. In all these processes people with disabilitiesand their immediate family members will be expected totake a leading role with support and guidance, but not direc- tion, from health and rehabilitation professionals. For health and rehabilitation professionals in developing countries faced with the large number of children and adults with established disability, tertiary prevention contin-ues to remain an important priority. The failure to meet therehabilitation needs of the majority of people with disabili-ties through existing services and growing concerns aboutthe inherent limitations of institutional rehabilitation gaverise to an alternative approach to care for the disabled indeveloping countries, called community-based rehabilita-tion (CBR). Community-Based Rehabilitation The concept of CBR has been defined by the WHO as a community development strategy focusing on equalizationof opportunities and social integration of people with disabilities (WHO, UNESCO, and ILO 1994). CBR activitiesare holistic in nature and, in attempting to integrate socialand medical models of disability, include all or some of thefollowing: awareness raising in communities; advocacy forthe rights of people with disabilities; development of par-ents' and caregivers' groups; income generation; networkingwith educational, social, and employment authorities; andprovision of rehabilitation and health services. The focalperson in the CBR program is the person with disabilities,and the main goals, in addition to providing access to reha-bilitation services, are to ensure that people with disabilitieshave rights to self-determination; enjoy the full benefits offamily membership; are active and responsible communitymembers; have equal access to education, skills training,work, and recreation; play a significant role in the CBR pro-gram itself; participate in organizations that cater to peoplewith disabilities; and act as lobbyists for the disabled andtheir families. CBR programs vary in their content, but most include some of the following services: a decentralized approach to service delivery with the primary focus and integration of these services at dis-trict level within established models of primary healthcare training and support for general-purpose mid-level reha-bilitation workers who operate at household and com-munity level screening and early identification of children with devel-opmental disabilities home-based support and training for activities of dailyliving promotion of inclusive education in pre- and primaryschools provision of vocational training at secondary schools referral to specialist rehabilitation services reorientation of the roles of rehabilitation professionals,where available, to support, train, and manage rehabilita-tion teams and CBR programs in addition to directlyproviding rehabilitation services. Defining the sequence and level of input at each of these levels may vary from country to country and from program to program but will be facilitated in all cases by the existenceof national health systems based on primary health care andnational rehabilitation strategies at all tiers of the healthsystem. 142 | Geoff Solarsh and Karen J. HofmanEVALUATION AND COST-BENEFIT ANALYSES Research and evaluation has not been a prominent feature of the CBR movement. These programs occur in resource-constrained environments, where the need for service pro-vision is preeminent and the necessary motivation,resources, and skills for research have often been lacking. However, many questions remain about CBR, and thefield is criticized for having poor indicators with which tomeasure success (Wirz and Thomas 2002). Divergentviews about the primary goals and end points of CBRprograms have to some extent impeded the developmentof a clear set of indicators. Although some believe thatstandard end points, such as measures of functionalimprovement of specific disabilities, are required, othersare more concerned with measuring shifts in attitudes of community members toward people with disabilities orthe extent of inclusion of the disabled in institutional orcommunity life. Those who see CBR as a communitydevelopment activity are interested in the direct participa-tion of people with disabilities in CBR program activitiesor income-generating activities as key measures ofoutcome. Most practitioners, however, see all of these out-comes as important. An approach to evaluation thatintegrates medical and social models is needed, and therecently revised WHO International Classification of Functioning , discussed earlier in this chapter, may provide useful and more standardized guidelines for future approaches of this kind. A review of the literature confirms that there is a dearth of rigorous evaluations of CBR programs. This is probablyas much a reflection of the lack of well-designed programsas it is of the lack of well-designed evaluations, because thetwo processes often go hand-in-hand. There appears to bean urgent need for the delineation of an evaluation frame-work that lays out the goals of CBR programs and clearlycharacterizes the possible inputs, outputs, and expectedoutcomes of these programs in order both to inform futureprogram design and to guide subsequent programevaluation. Given that tertiary prevention will continue to be an important intervention for developmental disabilities, irre-spective of the successes of primary and secondary preven-tion, and that CBR programs are likely to continue to be thestrategy of choice in developing countries, there is an urgentneed for credible evaluations that show an advantageouscost-benefit relationship. Without this it will be increasinglydifficult to obtain the ongoing support of policy makers andexternal funders for these programs.CONCLUSION There is an extreme dearth of good-quality data on the prevalence, types, and causes of developmental disabilitiesin Sub-Saharan Africa. Although a fair number of facility- based and population-based studies do provide some epi- demiological descriptions of the conditions that togethergive rise to the childhood burden of disability, these datavary in quality and there is insufficient understanding of their relative and population-attributable risks for disability. This makes it difficult to quantify disability burdens for chil-dren on the subcontinent with accuracy and to interveneeffectively in these conditions or to advocate on behalf ofchildren with developmental disabilities. Studies areurgently needed that provide these data and, as the healthtransition deepens in certain countries, that focus on dis- ability rather than mortality as an end point. Developmental disabilities bring together clinicians from medical, nursing, and rehabilitation backgrounds; scientistswith biomedical, population, and social science perspec-tives; and researchers, service providers, and people withdisabilities with quite different worldviews. T ogether theymust tackle this public health problem through balancedapproaches to primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. The immediate challenge in countries with large compet- ing health needs and severe resource constraints may be to \"start at the end.\" Many underserved populations in these countries carry large and unaddressed burdens of estab- lished disabilities. The provision of services and programsthat aim to improve the function of affected children andimprove their participation in these societies is their rightand our obligation, and this goal must be pursued in paral-lel with strategies to tackle primary and secondary preven-tion of the many conditions that contribute to the burdenof disabilities in the subcontinent. The diverse and func-tional needs of these children in these constrained environ-ments must be analyzed, and appropriate programs thatrealistically address these needs and constraints must bedeveloped and carefully evaluated. For many children theseneeds, unlike their basic health needs, are simply not beingmet. Without demonstrating care for the affected, healthworkers may lack the credibility to advocate for preventionof disabilities in the unaffected. REFERENCES Abel, E.

Developmental Disabilities | 147149Acute respiratory infections (ARI), particularly lower respi- ratory tract infections (LRTI), are the leading cause of deathamong children under five years of age and are estimated to be responsible for between 1.9 million and 2.2 million child- hood deaths globally. Forty-two percent of these ARI-associated deaths occur in Africa (Williams 2002). Despiteits importance in regard to morbidity as well as childhood mortality, the epidemiology and pathogenesis of LRTI, par- ticularly in Africa, remains understudied and consequentlyunderappreciated. Although structured management pro-grams coordinated by the World Health Organization(WHO) made some strides during the 1980s and early1990s toward reducing childhood mortality from LRTI(Sazawal and Black 2003; WHO 1990), the HIV epidemic in many countries of Sub-Saharan Africa has reversed many ofthese gains (Walker, Schwartlander, and Bryce 2002). Thereduction of morbidity and mortality in Sub-Saharan Africarequires a multifaceted approach that includes addressingrisk factors associated with increased susceptibility to LRTIamong children. These factors include lack of access to basicamenities, such as adequate housing, electricity, and run-ning tap water. Availability of these amenities would helpto reduce exposure to such risk factors as indoor smokepollution and overcrowding in households. Reducing these risk factors may take some time, but recent advances inmedical science hold promise in regard to preventing mor-bidity and possibly mortality from the most common per-ceived causes of severe LRTI\u2014those due to bacteria, such as Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus 2005; Klugman et al. 2003; Mulholland et al. 1997). Despite these advances, the chal-lenge remains to address the inequity in health care accessi- bility and affordability of new-generation vaccines that havebeen found to be effective in preventing disease caused by these bacteria in developed and developing countries.Furthermore, a priority for most countries in Sub-SaharanAfrica in dealing with the reversal of gains that occurred during the late 1980s and early 1990s is to work to preventthe transmission of HIV to children through effective HIVmother-to-child transmission prevention programs. THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF ARI AND LRTI Despite the recognition of LRTI as the leading cause of childhood mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa (Williams 2002),Chapter11 Acute Respiratory Infections Shabir A. Madhi and Keith P . Klugmandata on the epidemiology of LRTI in these countries are sparse. The most recent community- and hospital-based longitudinal studies aimed at measuring the burden of LRTI in African countries were conducted during the mid-1980s(Bale 1990; Selwyn 1990), prior to the HIV epidemic thathas engulfed most of these countries (Asamoah-Odel et al.2003). These studies were supported as part of an effort by the Board of Science and T echnology for International Development (BOSTID) of the U.S. National ResearchCouncil to define the burden of LRTI among developingcountries (Bale 1990; Selwyn 1990). Based on an estimate of ARI, it was concluded that approximately 4 million deaths from ARI occurred annually (Leowski 1986). In addition tothe African studies sponsored by BOSTID, namely, rural Kenya and urban Nigeria (Oyejide and Osinusi 1990; Wafulaet al. 1990), the only other areas from which there are reli-able estimates of the burden of LRTI are rural areas in TheGambia and Ghana (Afari 1991; Campbell et al. 1989). The literature published between 1966 and 2000 on the incidence of LRTI (including that in Sub-Saharan Africa) has recently been reviewed by Rudan and colleagues, whoestimated the median incidence of LRTI in developingcountries at 44 episodes per 100 child-years, equalto approximately 150.7 million new cases each year, 7 to13 percent of which were severe enough to warrant hospi- talization (Rudan et al. 2004). They estimate that there were approximately 33.7 million cases of LRTI annually inAfrican children, with an incidence rate of 31 to 33 per 100child-years, which was higher than the overall average for alldeveloping countries (23 per 100 child-years) (Rudan et al.2004). These estimates were, however, exclusive of theimpact that the HIV epidemic may have had on the inci-dence of LRTI. Rudan and colleagues (2004) also found thatthe burden of LRTI, albeit from studies outside of Africa,was greatest among children less than one year old, and, rel-ative to an incidence of 1.0 in the first year of life, the meanratios for the subsequent four years of life were 0.58 (year 2),0.48 (year 3), 0.31 (year 4), and 0.19 (year 5). Although the few published studies allow an analysis of the burden of LRTI mainly during the mid-1980s and early1990s, a major pitfall in the studies was the differences inthe methodology, not only of diagnostic tests, but also of theclinical definitions used in the studies, all of which mayhave a bearing on the measured incidence rates as well as thedescribed etiology of LRTI. Although the studies sponsoredby BOSTID aimed at reducing the differences in methodol-ogy between studies, the wide range of the incidence ofLRTI (0.4-8.1 per 100 child-weeks) between the studies,despite a similar incidence rate of ARI (12.7-16.1 per 100 child-weeks) in most studies, except the study fromThailand (Selwyn 1990), suggest widely varying risk factors, which may have predisposed the children to progression from upper respiratory tract infections to LRTI. Anotherpossibility is that there remain significant differences in thestudy methodology, including the implementation of differ- ent study definitions between the studies. This underlines the importance of recent initiatives by the WHO to stan-dardize the definition of pneumonia so that comparisonsmay be made between bacterial conjugate vaccines efficacytrials on the burden of LRTI in developing countries (Blacket al. 2002; 2003; Mulholland et al. 1997). The study in Kenya suggested that, in addition to the high burden of ARI and LRTI among children, on average, ARI accounted for their illness 21.7 percent of the time and LRTI0.4 percent of the time (Selwyn 1990). Studies from other non-African developing countries suggest that the burdenof disease may be even greater elsewhere, with children being affected for 40 to 60 percent and 14 percent of the yearwith ARI and LRTI, respectively (Black et al. 1982; Selwyn1990). The prolonged morbidity associated with ARI, inaddition to being associated with mortality, may also affectthe physical, emotional, and intellectual development of thechild. This situation is further compounded by the findingthat the rates of ARI are greatest during the initial years oflife (about 7.5 to 8 episodes per year among infants versusabout 4 to 6 episodes per year among children 48 to 59months of age; Selwyn 1990). Furthermore, the proportionof time that children are affected by an ARI ranged fromabout one-third of the year among infants to less than20 percent of the time among older children (Oyejide andOsinusi 1990; Wafula et al. 1990). The study from Nigeriaalso documented the benefits of measles immunization onthe incidence of LRTI, showing that children vaccinated formeasles had a 2.8-fold reduction in the incidence of LRTI(Oyejide and Osinusi 1990). The only longitudinal burden-of-disease study in Africa to have defined the incidence of radiologically confirmed pneumonia was performed in The Gambia (Campbell et al.1989). In that study the incidence of LRTI was 45 per 100child-years, and 35.5 percent of episodes were associatedwith radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Another cross-sectional study done in the Central African Republic alsofound that, although radiologically confirmed pneumoniawas present in only 41 percent of children hospitalized forLRTI, the presence on chest radiograph of the involvement 150 | Shabir A. Madhi and Keith P . Klugmanof three or more lobes was associated with a 4.6-fold greater risk of death than that of a single lobe (Demers et al. 2000). The overall mortality rate from LRTI among children in developing countries based on the longitudinal studiesreviewed by Rudan and colleagues (2004) ranged from 6.6to 14.1 percent. The high burden of LRTI among developing countries is partly related to the increased exposure of children in these countries to those poverty-linked risk factors that predis-pose them to developing LRTI. In a multivariate analysis ofdata from various studies, Rudan and colleagues (forthcom-ing) identified the risk factors most consistently associatedwith LRTI as malnutrition (relative risk [RR] 1.8), lowbirthweight (less than 2,500 grams at birth, RR 1.4), lack of exclusive breastfeeding in the first four months of life(RR 1.3), overcrowding in the household (more than fivepeople in the household, RR 1.2), and lack of measlesimmunization (RR 0.7). It was estimated that these risk fac-tors were prevalent among 27.4 percent, 14.7 percent, 54.1percent, 80.3 percent, and 52.5 percent, respectively, of theworld's 523 million children age zero to four years.Additional poverty-related factors that predispose to LRTIinclude domestic smoke and air pollution (Anderson 1978;Sofoluwe 1968). Consequently, it can be extrapolated that asignificant burden of LRTI among children in the develop- ing world is avoidable by addressing factors associated with poverty and lower socioeconomic development. THE IMPACT OF THE HIV EPIDEMIC ON THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF LRTI A further limitation of the published longitudinal studies is that they were conducted at an early stage or even prior tothe HIV epidemic. This is particularly pertinent when con- sidering that in some centers more than 80 percent of deaths from LRTI occur among children infected with the humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV), despite only 4 to 6 percentof children in the general pediatric population being so infected (Madhi, Petersen, Madhi, Khoolsal, et al. 2000; Zwi, Pettifor, and Soderlund 1999). Although a few studies havelooked at differences in the etiology of LRTI between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children, only one publishedstudy has described the impact that the HIV epidemic hashad on the relative burden of LRTI among children inAfrica. This study was limited to hospital-based surveil- lance and underestimates the overall burden of LRTI.Nevertheless, the study emphasized that despite only anestimated 4.5 percent of children in the study population being HIV infected, these children accounted for 45 percentof all LRTI-associated hospitalizations (Madhi, Petersen,Madhi, Khoolsal, et al. 2000). Although there are no longitudinal studies from Sub-Saharan Africa, including surveillance at the community-health care level, of the incidence of LRTIamong HIV-infected children, data from developed coun-tries illustrate the heightened burden of LRTI among HIV- infected children. In a recent review of 3,331 childreninfected with HIV-1 who participated in several differentclinical trials, the incidence rate of any clinically or radio-logically diagnosed pneumonia was estimated to be 11.1(95 percent confidence interval [CI], 10.3-12.0) per 100child-years (Dankner, Lindsey, and Levin 2001). The trialsincluded children who were on one to three antiretroviraldrugs, excluding protease inhibitors. The mean age of chil-dren in this study was 39 months; the oldest subject was20.9 years of age (Dankner, Lindsey, and Levin 2001). In anearlier cohort study evaluating the efficacy of intravenousimmunoglobulin prophylaxis, performed among HIV- infected children in the United States, the incidence of LRTIwas estimated to be 24 per 100 child-years (Mofenson et al.1998). This was sevenfold greater than historical incidencerates of 3 to 4.2 per 100 child-years observed among pre-school children in the United States and Finland prior to theHIV-1 epidemic (Foy et al. 1973; Murphy et al. 1981).Mofenson and colleagues (1998) described the increasedburden of LRTI among HIV-infected children but underes-timated the true burden of disease in young children,since the mean age of children recruited into the study (40 months) was greater than the ages (less than 18 monthsof age) when HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children aremost susceptible to developing and dying of pneumonia(Chintu et al. 1995; Langston et al. 2001; Mofenson et al. 1998; Pillay et al. 2001; Selwyn 1990). During the course ofthe study by Mofenson and colleagues (1998), pneumoniawas second (12 percent) only to upper respiratory tractinfections as a cause of bacterial infections among HIV- infected children. Thirty-seven percent of the children with acute pneumonia had multiple episodes of pneumonia,which was also a risk factor for mortality (odds ratio [OR],2.1; 95 percent CI, 1.3-3.4). Data from South Africa indicated that the incidence of hospitalization for LRTI among nearly 20,000 placebo recipients (who all received Hib conjugate vaccine) partici- pating in a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial, of whoman estimated 6.04 percent were infected with HIV-1, was Acute Respiratory Infections | 151approximately 6.6 times greater among HIV-infected chil- dren (16.7 cases per 100 child-years) than HIV-uninfected children (2.6 cases per 100 child-years) (Madhi et al. 2005). Although the incidence rates observed for HIV-infected chil-dren were less than the rate observed by Mofenson and col-leagues (1998) among HIV-infected children in the UnitedStates (24 per 100 child-years), the data from South Africa included only children who were hospitalized for LRTI as opposed to children who were hospitalized for LRTI andARI and those who were outpatients in the United States.Although differences in the age of children are also impor- tant, these data may illustrate the increased burden of LRTI among African HIV-infected children compared with HIV-infected children in industrial countries. Williams (2002) recently reviewed the estimates of child- hood deaths due to ARI mainly based on published data prior to the current HIV epidemic. It was estimated thatglobally ARI causes 1.9 million (95 percent CI, 1.6 million to2.2 million) deaths annually of children under five, 794,000(40 percent) of which occur in Africa (Williams 2002). Theproportion of deaths attributable to ARI was found to berelated to the under-five childhood mortality rate of thecountries. In countries where the under-five childhoodmortality rate is 50 per 1,000, as in most of Sub-SaharanAfrica (UNICEF 1996, pp. 90-98), ARI is estimated to beresponsible for 23 percent of deaths, compared with only15 percent of deaths in countries where the under-five mor-tality rate is 10 per 1,000 per year (Williams 2002). Thelower contribution of ARI as a cause of childhood deaths asunder-five mortality rates improve was further character-ized by trends in under-five mortality among black SouthAfricans that were observed between the 1960s and 1980s(Von Schirnding, Y ach, and Klein 1991). In the indigenousSouth African population of black people from 1968 to1973, a corrected estimate of 22.5 percent of the under-fivemortality of 40 per 1,000 was attributed to ARI, comparedwith 1980-85, when, with an under-five mortality rate of17.3 per 1,000, the proportion of deaths due to ARIdecreased to 17.7 percent (Von Schirnding, Y ach, and Klein1991). Similarly, ARI was linked to a high proportion (21 to24 percent) of deaths in other African countries, where theunder-five mortality rate ranged between 35 and 63 per1,000 children during the 1980s (de Francisco et al. 1993;Fantahun 1998; Greenwood et al. 1987; Mtango andNeuvians 1986; Williams 2002). Much of the improvement in under-five mortality as well as the reduction in the proportion of deaths due to ARI thathas been observed in other Sub-Saharan Africa countries,however, have possibly been reversed due to the impact that the HIV epidemic has had on childhood mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa since 1990 (Walker, Schwartlander, and Bryce 2002). In addition to the increased predisposition of HIV-infected children to bacterial- and viral-associatedLRTI, HIV-infected children (13.1 percent) have also beenfound to have a 6.5 times greater (95 percent CI, 3.5-12.1) case-fatality rate than HIV-uninfected children (2.3 per- cent) even in a country with relatively good resources, suchas South Africa (Madhi, Petersen, Madhi, Khoolsal, et al.2000). Although the case-fatality rate for children withpneumococcal bacteremic pneumonia was similar amongthose infected with HIV (18 percent) compared with thoseuninfected (11 percent, P/H110050.18), the overall higher case- fatality rate for LRTI among HIV-infected children may be explained by the poor outcome of African HIV-infectedchildren who have Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) (case-fatality rate 20 to 65 percent) (Graham et al. 2000;Madhi et al. 2002). THE ETIOLOGY OF LRTI Unfortunately, the sensitivity of current diagnostic tools in defining the etiology of LRTI is woefully suboptimal, partic-ularly for diagnosing bacterial infections, even in the coun-tries with the most resources, such as Finland and theUnited States (Heiskanen-Kosma et al. 1998; Wubbel et al. 1999). Among industrial countries, where the common res-piratory viruses, particularly respiratory syncytial virus, arethe dominant (40 to 50 percent of episodes) pathogensidentified among children with LRTI, no etiological agentwas identified among 30 to 40 percent of children withLRTI, despite the use of an array of advanced microbiologi-cal methods, including some that had not been validatedagainst \"gold standards\" (Heiskanen-Kosma et al. 1998;Wubbel et al. 1999). The case-management strategy of the WHO is based on the premise that bacteria are the leading cause of LRTI, especially as a cause of severe illness, among children indeveloping countries (WHO 1990). Nevertheless, most ofthe etiological studies performed in developing countriessuggest that respiratory viruses are as important a cause ofLRTI among these children as among those in developedcountries (Forgie al. 1991a, 1991b; Heiskanen-Kosmaet al. 1998; Selwyn 1990; Wubbel et al. 1999). The common respiratory viruses isolated among African infants hospitalized for LRTI in The Gambia include 152 | Shabir A. Madhi and Keith P . Klugmanrespiratory syncytial virus (37 percent), adenovirus (5 per- cent), parainfluenza virus (3 percent), rhinovirus (6 per- cent), and influenza virus (1 percent) (Forgie et al. 1991a, 1991b). Furthermore, more recently, a newly discovered res-piratory virus named metapneumovirus (van den Hoogenet al. 2001) has also been identified as a cause of severe LRTIamong 10 percent of HIV-uninfected and 3 percent of HIV- infected infants (Madhi et al. 2003). Bacteria were, however, proportionally as common and were identified in 30 percentof the infants, albeit using unvalidated diagnostic methods,with the dominant identified pathogens being S. pneumoniae (20 percent) and H. influenzae (11 percent) (Forgie et al. 1991a). Mixed bacterial-viral infections were identifiedamong 15 percent of infants. Although 73 percent of infants had radiological evidence of pneumonia, only 28 percenthad evidence of a lobar pneumonia( Forgie et al. 1991a).Among older children (one to four years of age) hospitalizedwith LRTI in The Gambia, identification of bacteria wasrelatively more common (75 percent) than identificationof common respiratory viruses (40 percent) (Forgie et al.1991b). Although S. pneumoniae (60.9 percent) and H. influenzae (13.8 percent) remained the most dominant bacterial isolates, other bacteria identified included Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis (6.2 percent each) (Forgie et al. 1991b). These studies, similar to othersfrom developing countries, including those that were spon-sored by BOSTID, underpin the importance of respiratorysyncytial virus as well as S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and viruses as the etiology of LRTI among children in develop- ing countries (Selwyn 1990). The spectrum of pathogens and proportional representa- tion thereof appeared to be similar between children withmoderate and severe LRTI in the BOSTID-sponsored stud- ies (Selwyn 1990). The clinical relevance of distinguishingbetween respiratory viral and bacterial infections has, how-ever, gained renewed interest with the recent observationthat pneumococcal coinfections are prevalent in at least 30to 40 percent of children with documented respiratory viralinfections (Madhi, Klugman, and Pneumococcal VaccineTrialist Group 2004). Other factors that may affect the spectrum of bacteria that causes pneumonia include environmental factors and nutri- tional status (Adegbola et al. 1994; O'Dempsey et al. 1994).Gram-negative bacteria that include Salmonella and coliforms were found to be more common than S. pneumoniae and Hib as causes of LRTI during those rainy months of the year when malaria transmission is at its greatest in a malaria-endemicarea in The Gambia (O'Dempsey et al. 1994).Advances in preventing LRTI caused by S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type b have refocused attention to meas- uring the burden of disease due to these pathogens in order to define the burden of LRTI that may be prevented throughvaccination of children with the bacterial conjugate vaccines (Black et al. 2002; Klugman et al. 2003; Mulholland et al.1997). Although fine needle aspiration of the lung is thegold standard for identifying bacterial infections of the lung,it only has a sensitivity of 70 percent and is limited to beingperformed mainly on children with clearly defined alveolarconsolidation, accessible to aspiration (Vuori-Holopainenand Peltola 2001). Because of the empirical management ofsevere LRTI with antibiotics, the use of fine needle aspiratesof the lung has waned (Vuori-Holopainen and Peltola 2001) but has recently received more attention as a diagnosticapproach in Finland (Vuori-Holopainen et al. 2002). The majority of studies that have used fine needle aspi- rates as a potential diagnostic modality have been performedin Africa (Vuori-Holopainen and Peltola 2001). The per-formance of lung aspirates is, however, associated with somerisk (less than 2 percent), such as that of pneumothoracesand hemoptysis, which may preclude its use in clinical prac-tice as well as in large-scale epidemiological studies (Vuori-Holopainen and Peltola 2001). Furthermore, the yield fromlung aspirates may be operator dependent and could also be influenced by other factors, such as preceding exposure to antibiotics, age of the study participants, and the extent oflung infiltrate. This may, at least in part, explain why the yieldranged from 17 percent to 100 percent in various studies. Onaverage, a bacterial pathogen from lung aspirates was isolatedin 52 percent (17 to 77 percent) of cases, compared with ablood isolation rate of 25 percent (2 to 45 percent) in studiesin which both procedures were done concurrently (Adegbolaet al. 1994; Garcia de Olarte et al. 1971; Vuori-Holopainen and Peltola 2001; Wall et al. 1986). Table 11.1 illustrates those studies that included only children with pneumonia who had not received antibioticsprior to having had a fine needle aspirate performed. Exceptfor a small study from South Africa, all the studies con-firmed S. pneumoniae as the leading isolate among children with pneumonia, although there was a wide range of posi- tive pneumococcal isolates (18 to 51 percent) among otherstudies performed in developing countries. A summary oflung aspirate studies performed in Africa has, however, sug-gested that S. aureus may also be an important cause of LRTI (20 percent of children) (Vuori-Holopainen et al. 2002; Mimica et al. 1971). Acute Respiratory Infections | 153Additionally, investigators in Chile and India reported that S. aureus was the dominant isolate (25 to 27 percent), whereas S. pneumoniae was isolated in only 2 to 5 percent of children, among whom 50 to 70 percent had received antibi- otics prior to the performance of the lung aspirate (Mimicaet al. 1971). In another report among children who werereceiving antibiotics (77 percent) prior to the lung aspirate, S. pneumoniae was isolated more frequently than S. aureus (11 percent as opposed to 6 percent, respectively) (Prakash et al. 1996). Silverman and colleagues (1977) showed thatalthough the yield of bacteria in Nigerian children with anill-defined infiltrate (bronchopneumonia) was similar tothat in children with lobar consolidation or empyema, thespectrum of isolates differed, with the yield of S. pneumoni- aebeing 53.6 and 15.9 percent, respectively (Silverman et al. 1977). Similarly, Mimica and colleagues (1971) in Chile showed that although a bacterium was isolated in 28 percentcompared with 45 percent of children with lobar consolida-tion and bronchopneumonia, respectively, the rates of isola-tion of S. pneumoniae were much lower among children with bronchopneumonia (1 percent versus 24 percent) (Mimica et al. 1971).Data regarding the relative risk of bacterial pneumonia as well as common respiratory viral-associated LRTI among African HIV-infected children al. 2000; Madhi, Schoub, et many studies have investigated the etiology of LRTI among African HIV-infected children (Graham et al. 2000;Nathoo et al. 1996; Zar et al. 2001), only limited data existregarding the pathogen-specific relative risk of LRTI amongHIV-infected compared with uninfected children. Table 11.2illustrates the heightened burden of pathogen-specific bac-teremic pneumonia among HIV-infected as compared withHIV-uninfected children. Significantly, although a broaderspectrum of bacteria is implicated in HIV-infected children\u2014in particular, gram-negative pathogens\u2014 S. pneumonia and Hib remained the dominant causes of pneumonia among HIV-infected children in the absence of vaccination with anyof the bacterial conjugate vaccines. In addition to the height-ened burden of bacterial pneumonia, although proportion-ately less commonly isolated, the burden of hospitalizationfor common respiratory viral infections was also found tohave increased, albeit less so than for bacterial pneumonia,among HIV-infected children (table 11.3). 154 | Shabir A.

Pneumocystis jiroveci, which is an uncommon cause of LRTI in HIV-uninfected children, except perhaps those that are malnourished or who have other immuno-suppressive underlying illness (Hughes et al. 1974; Piferet al. 1978), is commonly (10 to 45 percent of cases) identi-fied among African HIV-infected children with LRTI(Graham et al. 2000; Madhi et al. 2002). Although PCP isprevalent in various age groups according to one study inSouth Africa (Madhi et al. 2002), both the burden of the dis-ease and its poor outcome have consistently been found to be greatest among children less than six months of age. A further recent observation has been the underrecog- nized importance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a cause of acute LRTI. Three separate studies from South Africa andMalawi consistently reported that M. tuberculosis was cul- tured from 8 percent of children with acute pneumonia (Graham et al. 2000; Madhi, Petersen, Madhi, Khoolsal, et al.2000; Zar et al. 2001). This is even more alarming consider-ing that most of these studies were performed amongchildren who were mainly investigated for tuberculosis bygastric washing or induced sputum samples\u2014modalitiesthat have a sensitivity of only 25 to 40 percent for diagnos- ing pulmonary tuberculosis. Consequently, it can be postu-lated that as many as three times more children thandiagnosed by positive M. tuberculosis culture have acute pneumonia caused by this pathogen. Further investigation of these observations are required and, if verified, wouldhave profound implications for the clinical algorithms usedin diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis as well as the man-agement strategies for treating LRTI in children.THE IMPACT OF WHO MANAGEMENT STRATEGY Following the realization that LRTI is a major contributor to childhood mortality, the WHO developed a strategy aimedat allowing primary health workers to manage LRTI speedilyand effectively. The strategy, which subsequently has beenincorporated into the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) program, is based on the premises that themajority of severe LRTI in developing countries is due tobacteria, particularly S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, and that proper management of the disease needs to includeconsideration of the scarcity of health care facilities in thosecountries, which also coincidentally happen to be the mostburdened by LRTI. A meta-analysis of this strategy hasshown that it has been most effective when implemented inthose countries where the infant mortality rate was greater than 100 per 1,000 live births (Sazawal and Black 2003). Themeta-analysis found that the WHO LRTI case-managementstrategy reduced LRTI mortality by 42 percent (95 percentCI, 22-57 percent), 36 percent (95 percent CI, 20-48 per-cent), and 36 percent (95 percent CI, 20-49 percent) amongneonates, infants between one and twelve months of age,and children one to four years of age, respectively (Sazawaland Black 2003). The WHO LRTI management strategy hasmore recently also been evaluated in a program in Malawi(Enarson and Pio 2003; Pio and Enarson 2003). The infantmortality rate in the study area prior to the intervention was 138 per 1,000, and approximately 20 percent of preg- nant women were HIV infected, resulting in approximately4.5 percent of the birth cohort being HIV infected.Implementation of a strategy aimed at the training of dis-trict health care workers was associated with a 52 percentreduction in the LRTI mortality if the child survived beyond24 hours of having presented at a health care facility. Therewas, however, only a modest nonsignificant reduction(15 percent, P/H110220.05) in the deaths that occurred within 24 hours of attention at a health care center. Overall, the case-fatality rate for LRTI decreased from 18 percent at thetime of the start of the study to 8 percent 26 months later.These reductions were observed within two years of havingimplemented the training of health care workers in themanagement of LRTI in accordance with the WHO/IMCIstrategy as well as ensuring adequate access to essentialdrugs. The overall success of treating LRTI also improvedfrom 55 percent at the time of the start of the program in1999 to 82 percent 26 months later. These results, from oneof the poorest nations on earth, show that standard inpa-tient case management of severe and very severe pneumoniaHIV-1-infected HIV-1-uninfected children children Relative risk, Virus (per 100,000) (per 100,000) 95% CI RSV 1,444 Specific Viral-Associated Severe LRTI in HIV-1-Infected and HIV-1-Uninfected Children Age 2 to 23 Months156 | Shabir A. Madhi and Keith P . Klugmanby trained staff with a regular supply of antibiotics pro- duced a striking impact on the number of deaths occurring after 24 hours of hospital admission, even in the adverse conditions of Malawi, where the prevalence of HIV infectionis high, malnutrition is rife, the level of maternal literacy islow, and an efficient transport system from peripheral to dis-trict hospitals is lacking. Considering the numerous challenges to expand and maintain health care provision in resource-poor countries,prevention rather than treatment of LRTI assumes evengreater importance. Although some of the risk factors discussed earlier can be addressed only by a general improvement of socioeconomic conditions in these coun-tries, a potentially more immediate measure would be vaccination. That immunization may affect the incidence ofLRTI-associated mortality is probably best indicated by thesuccess of the measles vaccine in reducing LRTI-associateddeaths in Nigeria (Oyejide and Osinusi 1990). In theNigerian study, the under-five mortality rate due to LRTIwas twofold less common among children who had beenimmunized with measles vaccine than among children whohad not received measles vaccine. THE IMPACT OF HIB CONJUGATE VACCINES IN PREVENTING LRTI The potential of further preventing LRTI through vaccina- tion was shown in The Gambia during the course of evalu-ating the efficacy of a Hib conjugate vaccine among infants (Mulholland et al. 1997). In addition to reducing invasive Hib disease, including Hib meningitis, the vaccine was alsoshown to reduce the incidence of radiologically confirmedpneumonia by 21 percent (reduction of 1.3 cases per 1,000 children). The overall reduction in clinically diagnosed pneumonia was, however, more modest, with a non-significant reduction of 4.4 percent (95 percent CI, /H110025 to 12.9), although the study was not statistically powered tomeasure such small differences against clinically diagnosedLRTI. Interestingly, the incidence rate of clinically diagnosedLRTI requiring hospitalization in The Gambian study was only 3.6 per 1,000 children among the placebo group. The findings from The Gambia were subsequently cor- roborated by an effectiveness study in Chile, where a similar reduction in radiologically (21 percent) and clinically diag-nosed (5 percent) pneumonia was observed (Levine et al.1999). The Hib conjugate vaccine was also found to prevent2.5 cases of hospitalization for LRTI per 1,000 child-years ofobservation. Although the effectiveness of the Hib conjugatevaccine against pneumonia has not been evaluated amongHIV-infected children, data from South Africa suggest that the vaccine is less effective among HIV-infected than HIV- uninfected children, reducing invasive disease by 54 per-cent and 91 percent, respectively (Madhi et al. 2005).Consequently, it can be extrapolated that the Hib conjugatevaccine may also be less effective in preventing nonbac-teremic pneumonia among HIV-infected children thanHIV-uninfected children. In The Gambia, prior to the introduction of the Hib conjugate vaccine, H. influenzae was identified as the sec- ond most important cause of bacterial pneumonia, with75 percent of the isolates being of type b. The importance ofH. influenzae is further highlighted by lung aspirate studies in children with pneumonia who did not receive antibiotics. Here, Hib accounted for an average of 27 percent (range of14 to 45 percent) of all bacterial isolates. Indeed H. influen- zaehas been shown to be as common as S. pneumoniae (average of 27 percent; range of 12 to 88 percent) as a cause of pneumonia in some studies (Berman and McIntosh1985). The incidence of bacteremic Hib pneumonia in chil-dren less than five years of age ranged between 1 and 7 per100,000 children in developed countries, such as Finlandand Israel (Dagan et al. 1998; Takala et al. 1989), whereas itwas estimated to be 370 per 100,000 in developing countries if nonbacteremic cases were included (Peltola 2000). Priorto the introduction of the Hib conjugate vaccine in TheGambia, it was estimated that Hib resulted in a pneumonia-specific mortality rate of 40 per 100,000 in children zero to four years old (Greenwood 1992). Despite Hib conjugate vaccines being available since the late 1980s, the only Sub-Saharan African country using its own resources to introduce the Hib conjugate vaccine intoits routine childhood immunization program since June1999 was, until very recently, South Africa. The vaccine hasbeen introduced into other Sub-Saharan African countriesthrough donor support from the Global Alliance forVaccines and Immunisation (GA VI). GA VI has committeditself to financially supporting the introduction of the Hibconjugate vaccine into countries that have a gross domestic product of less than US$2,000 per capita for a period of fiveyears, following which the governments of those countrieswould be expected to assume the responsibility of continu-ing to finance the use of the Hib conjugate vaccine. Whetherthese programs are sustainable is currently being debated.Even in an African country with relatively good resources,such as South Africa, the modest price of the vaccineAcute Respiratory Infections | 157(approximately US$2 per dose) has almost quadrupled the cost of vaccine procurement for the expanded program of immunization, and its continued use is under debate by pol- icy makers. The cost of the full primary series of vaccinesadministered during the initial four months of life prior tothe introduction of the Hib conjugate vaccine was approxi-mately US$1.5. THE IMPACT OF S. PNEUMONIAE CONJUGATE VACCINES IN PREVENTING PNEUMONIA IN CHILDREN Despite S. pneumoniae having first been isolated in the 1880s and having been recognized as the leading cause of pneumonia among children, a successful vaccine aimed at preventing pneumococcal pneumonia has remained elusiveuntil 2000 (Black et al. 2002; Klugman et al. 2003). Although Riley and colleagues (1986) showed a benefit for a pneumo-coccal polysaccharide vaccine in reducing childhood mor-tality in Papua New Guinea, other studies failed to show anybenefit for the use of this vaccine, particularly among chil-dren less than 18 months of age (Broome and Breiman1991). Following the success of the Hib conjugate vaccine,the same technology was used to produce a pneumococcalserotype-specific polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine.Those serotypes that were recognized as causing the major- ity of invasive disease among children were selected forinclusion into the vaccine. The first and currently the onlylicensed such vaccine is one that includes polysaccharidefrom seven of the pneumococcal serotypes (Prevenar),based on those serotypes that were most prevalent as a causeof invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) among children inthe United States (Zangwill et al. 1996). Inclusion of theseseven serotypes was estimated to have the potential ofpreventing 90 percent of IPD among children in the UnitedStates (Zangwill et al. 1996). The vaccine was subsequentlyproved to be highly efficacious among those children and was associated with the reduction of vaccine-serotype- specific invasive disease in fully vaccinated children of97.4 percent (95 percent CI, 82.7-99.9), with an overallreduction of invasive pneumococcal disease of 89.1 percent(95 percent CI, 73.7-95.8) (Black et al. 2000). More impor-tant, however, the vaccine was shown to reduce pneumoniaassociated with any chest radiograph infiltrate by 20.5 per-cent (95 percent CI, 4.4-34.0) and any clinically diagnosedpneumonia by 4.3 percent (95 percent CI, /H110023.5-11.5 per- cent) (Black et al. 2002). The incidence rate of pneumonia,mainly ambulant cases, in the control group in the latter study was 55.9 per 1,000 person-years. The reduction in pneumonia confirmed by chest radiograph was strikinginsofar as previous epidemiological studies have shown thatbetween 25 and 35 percent of cases of pneumonia in chil-dren are due to S. pneumoniae (Heiskanen-Kosma et al. 1998; Wubbel et al. 1999), indicating that the vaccine ishighly efficacious even for this end point for which therewas no microbiologic evaluation. A different formulation of the vaccine that included two more serotypes than those included in Prevenar was subse- quently evaluated among children in South Africa and The Gambia. These additional serotypes\u2014serotypes 1 and 5\u2014 account for about 15 percent of IPD in Africa (Hausdorff,Siber, and Paradiso 2001; Madhi, Petersen, Madhi, Wasas, et al. 2000). In regard to the serotype-specific vaccine efficacy against IPD as well as radiologically confirmed pneumoniaamong HIV-uninfected children, the results from the South African study were strikingly similar to the findings in chil- dren from the United States. Among South African children,the nonavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was shownto reduce culture-confirmed IPD 83 percent and radio-logically confirmed pneumonia, irrespective of microbio-logical diagnosis, by 20 percent (Klugman et al. 2003).Impressively, the vaccine was also shown to reduce IPD by65 percent among HIV-infected children; however, there was no significant reduction in first-episode, radiologicallyconfirmed pneumonia among these children (13 percent,95 percent CI, /H110027-29) (Klugman et al. 2003). Further analy- sis of this study, however, indicated that when considering any LRTI irrespective of the chest radiograph features, thevaccine reduced LRTI by 15 percent (95 percent CI, 6-24)among HIV-infected children. This reduction in LRTItranslated into a reduction of 25.7 cases of LRTI per 1,000child-years, compared with a case reduction of 2.7 casesper 1,000 child-years in HIV-uninfected children (efficacy17 percent; 95 percent 7-26) reductions in radiologically LRTI and HIV-infected chil-dren, respectively (Madhi et al. 2005). These data suggestthat the sensitivity of radiologically diagnosed pneumonia,based on WHO criteria, detected only about one-third ofthe cases of pneumococcal pneumonia that were preventedby vaccination. Studies that aim to define the burden ofpneumonia preventable by the pneumococcal conjugatevaccine among children in other countries of Sub-SaharanAfrica need to take these factors into consideration when158 | Shabir A. Madhi and Keith P . Klugmandetermining the tools to be used in defining LRTI, including radiologically confirmed LRTI. Significantly, the data from the South African study included only children who required hospitalization for their episode of LRTI.Considering that only 7 to 13 percent of children with LRTImay have been hospitalized, the total burden of LRTI thatmay be prevented through vaccination may be much greater, especially considering that the spectrum of pathogens that cause LRTI requiring hospitalization werefound to be similar to those that caused LRTI that did notrequire hospitalization (Selwyn 1990). The nonavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine also reduced invasive pneumococcal disease (77 percent; 95 per-cent CI, 51-90) and radiologically confirmed pneumonia (37 percent; 95 percent CI, 25-48) in The Gambia, which ismuch less developed than South Africa. Impressively, inaddition to a reduction in cases of pneumonia of 16 per1,000 child-years among vaccinees in The Gambia, the non-avalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was also found toreduce all-cause hospitalization by 15 percent (95 percentCI, 7-21) and all-cause mortality by 16 percent (95 percentCI, 3-28) (Cutts et al. 2005). These data clearly indicate theurgency attendant on the introduction of this new vaccineinto developing countries. Modification of the currentlylicensed product, so as to include pneumococcal serotypes that are important in Africa serotypes (1 and 5) but whichare not included in the current seven-valent formulation ofthe vaccine, would be required to optimize the benefits ofthe introduction of such a vaccine into Sub-Saharan Africa. A challenge for other Sub-Saharan Africa countries in regard to defining the potential benefit of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination would, however, include the need to define the spectrum of serotypes that cause disease among children elsewhere, as geographic variation in serotypes thatcause IPD have been described even within continents(Hausdorff, Siber, and Paradiso 2001). Hence, the overallproportion of IPD and possibly pneumonia that may beprevented through vaccination may differ betweengeographic regions, depending on the prevalent serotypes. Despite these positive findings, and the theoretical bene- fits of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, the greatestimpending limiting factor to the introduction of the vaccineinto Sub-Saharan Africa is the cost of the vaccine. Currentlythe vaccine is priced at $48 for the public sector in theUnited States. Considering the costs of the vaccine and thatthere are no other competing pneumococcal conjugate vac-cines that are likely to be licensed any time soon, unlessthere is external funding support or major price tiering toassist in introducing the vaccine, it is likely to lag even beyond the 20 years that it has taken for the Hib conjugatevaccine to be introduced into Sub-Saharan Africa. Provisional data from the South African study indicate that the vaccine would be potentially cost-effective if it costapproximately US$4 per dose, based on health expenditurecosts in South Africa (Ginsberg et al. unpublished data). Considering that health care expenditure in other Sub- Saharan Africa countries is much lower than in SouthAfrica, the price at which the vaccine may be cost-effectivewould possibly be even lower. OTHER POTENTIAL INTERVENTION STRATEGIES IN REDUCING THE BURDEN OF LRTI The burden of LRTI may be reduced by as much as 45 per- cent in countries of Sub-Saharan Africa (Madhi, Petersen,Madhi, Wasas, et al. 2000) if effective strategies targeted at preventing HIV transmission from mother to children are implemented. Although a number of proven strategiescould reduce the vertical transmission of HIV to between 2and 13 percent, lack of infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa results in less than 5 percent of HIV-infected women being able to access health care to allow these interventions to beimplemented (United Nations General Assembly SpecialSession on HIV/AIDS, unpublished data). Nevertheless,programs aimed at the prevention of the vertical transmis-sion of HIV need to be considered a priority in reducing theoverall burden of LRTI among children in Sub-Saharan Africa. Another priority for those children who are infected with HIV is the introduction of effective strategies aimed at reducing the burden of PCP , especially considering thatP. jiroveci has been found to be the etiological agent in as many as 15 to 45 percent of African HIV-infected children with LRTI. Although no randomized trial has evaluated theefficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) inpreventing PCP among children, this strategy has had pro-found benefits when it has been implemented in developedcountries as well as in such developing countries as Thailand(Chokephaibulkit et al. 2000; Simonds et al. 1995). Although recommended by the WHO and UNAIDS, data from SouthAfrica suggest that there may be structural problems withimplementing an effective TMP-SMX prophylaxis even inareas with relatively good resources, such as South Africa(Madhi et al. 2002). Of further importance regarding thewidespread use of TMP-SMX is its potential to predisposeAcute Respiratory Infections | 159to developing strains of pneumococcus that are resistant to it as well as to other classes of antibiotics (Madhi, Petersen, Madhi, Wasas, et al. 2000). Such resistance would possibly compromise the WHO management strategy in Sub-Saharan Africa, where in many areas, TMP-SMX remainsthe mainstay of therapy for the treatment of LRTI. It is likelythat the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus, coupled with further dissemination of resistant strains, may render TMP-SMX obsolete in the empirical management ofLRTI in Sub-Saharan Africa. The importance of TMP-SMX in reducing morbidity and mortality in African HIV-infected children has recentlybeen highlighted by a study in Malawi. Chintu and col-leagues (2004) showed that TMP-SMX prophylaxis reduced mortality in African HIV-infected children, the majority ofwhom were symptomatic for AIDS, by 43 percent (hazardsratio 0.57; 95 percent CI, 0.43-0.77). OTHER POTENTIAL WAYS TO PREVENT LRTI Despite all the promise that the bacterial conjugate vaccines hold in preventing LRTI, it is sobering that the total burdenof LRTI reduced by these vaccines is relatively small, albeit important, given the overall magnitude of the burden of LRTI in Sub-Saharan Africa. In The Gambia, the Hib con-jugate vaccine prevented only 1.3 cases of hospitalizationrelated to LRTI for every 35.1 cases (about 4 percent) that occurred per 1,000 children enrolled in the study (Mulholland et al. 1997). The nonavalent pneumococcalconjugate vaccine in The Gambia reduced the overall rateof pneumonia by 18 cases per 1,000 child-years, with anincidence rate of 249 per 1,000 child-years among theplacebo group (Cutts et al. 2005). The case reduction amongSouth African HIV-uninfected children, including only hospitalized children, was 2.7 per 1,000 child-years withthe incidence in the placebo group being 15.7 cases of LRTIper 1,000 child-years (Madhi et al. 2005). These dataindicate that although the most severe causes of pneumoniamay have been prevented with modest to good success, thereremains a large burden of LRTI that even the expensive newgeneration of vaccines is not able to prevent. Efforts aimedat developing vaccines against respiratory syncytial virusholds the promise that greater inroads may be made inreducing the overall LRTI morbidity even in Sub-SaharanAfrica countries. Furthermore, there is a need to continue support for developing more effective vaccines againstM. tuberculosis that are effective in preventing not onlydisseminated tuberculosis but also pulmonary tuberculosis, which may be responsible for 25 percent of LRTI casesrequiring hospitalization. CONCLUSION Although the LRTI management strategies of the WHO have the potential of reducing the burden of death fromLRTI among countries where under-five mortality is greaterthan 100 per 1,000 live births, further advances in reducingchildhood morbidity and possibly mortality depend on the effective use of bacterial conjugate vaccines in those coun-tries that require them, but where, unjustly for the children,they are least affordable. Furthermore, the reversal of gainsin reducing childhood mortality currently being experi-enced in Sub-Saharan Africa, largely a result of the HIVepidemic, has been associated with almost a doubling of theburden of LRTI in those countries that are heavily burdenedby the epidemic. An effective approach to reducing LRTI-associated childhood mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa requires a concerted effort to prevent the vertical transmis-sion of HIV infection, timely and effective rollout of bacte-rial conjugate vaccines, as well as addressing predominantlypoverty-linked, predisposing factors that heighten the riskof children to develop severe and often fatal LRTI.

Over the last 40 years, the use of smallpox, measles, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, andpoliomyelitis vaccines have eradicated smallpox and elimi-nated disease in those populations that have achieved and sustained programs with high implementation rates. Although there are numerous licensed vaccines that couldpotentially benefit the African population, only thoseroutinely used and potential vaccines with broad applica-tion on the horizon are covered in this chapter. HISTORY OF VACCINATION IN AFRICA The eradication of smallpox was an outstanding display of concerted global action in a war against microbial invaders.The progress in expanding poliomyelitis and measles vacci- nation efforts and their elimination from many regions further demonstrates that vaccines are among the mostpowerful public health tools. National vaccination programs,which grew out of the smallpox eradication initiative, have developed in many countries through the administrative,technical, and financial support of the United NationsChildren's Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization(WHO), and many bilateral or multilateral partner agencies (figure 12.1) (WHO and UNICEF 1996). In its 1993 World Development Report, the World Bank classified vaccination as one of the most cost-effective public health interventions(World Bank 1993). In addition, vaccination programs havebeen cited as providing one of the most equitable of publichealth programs, providing protection to the entire popula-tion when successfully implemented. The WHO created the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in 1974 as a means to continue the great success that had been achieved earlier with the eradi- cation of smallpox. At that time less than 5 percent of theworld's children in the developing world were receivingimmunizations. The six diseases chosen to be tackled underthis new initiative were tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, and measles. It was not until 1988 that theWHO recommended that yellow fever vaccine be added tothe national immunization programs of those countriesChapter12 Vaccine-Preventable Diseases Mark A. Miller and John T. Sentz with endemic disease (WHO and UNICEF 1996). Later, in 1992, the World Health Assembly recommended hepatitis Bvaccination for all infants. Most recently the WHO has recommended that the Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) conjugate vaccines be implemented into national immu- nization programs unless epidemiological evidence exists oflow disease burden, lack of benefit, or overwhelming obsta- cles to implementation (WHO 2006). THE VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASE BURDEN The WHO-estimated disease burdens from vaccine- preventable diseases are shown for 2002 by incidence ofdeath and disability-adjusted life years (DALYS) in table 12.1. As the WHO does not necessarily classify disease based on what may be prevented by a specific vaccine, the tableincludes those syndromes that may be partially mitigatedby vaccines (for example, acute lower respiratory tract infec- tion, meningitis, or conditions associated with hepatitis B infections). As most vaccine-preventable diseases are underreported in many countries, estimates of disease burden are made by a variety of methodologies that account for the susceptiblefraction of the population, as calculated from naturalimmunity from presumed historical infections, historical immunization coverage rates, and vaccine effectiveness.Disease burden estimates also integrate rates of infectivity,specific sequelae, and local case fatality. Life expectancies ona national level can help to account for causes of competing mortality, allowing the assessment of health outcomes asdeaths, years of life lost, or other measures (for example, DALYs). Estimates of disease burden have evolved over theyears from simplistic models incorporating reported rates ofdisease and a reporting efficiency profile to the more com-plex Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR)-type models thatcan additionally account for local population-based cover-age data and other deterministic data, such as socioeconomic factors and characteristics of the heterogeneity of popula- tions throughout the region. Models are based on numerousassumptions, and their degree of accuracy is only as good asthe data that support the many assumptions. Althoughdisease burden is frequently indicated as point estimates,it is more appropriate to indicate the burden by a range ofvalues to reflect uncertainty, sometimes by an order ofmagnitude or more for certain diseases. Polio Poliovirus is most often transmitted fecal-orally among persons living in unsanitary and crowded conditions. Acuteinfections are caused by any one of three serotypes of 164 | Mark A.

Exposure to poliovirus predominantly results in asympto- matic infections. It has been estimated that 24 percent of infections result in minor illness characterized by a few daysof varying symptoms, including fever, malaise, drowsiness,headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and sore throat(Gelfand et al. 1957). In fewer cases (4 percent), infection leads to nonparalytic polio or aseptic meningitis, which manifests as fever, vomiting, malaise, and sore throat;meningeal irritation occurs one to two days later, character-ized by soreness and stiffness of the neck, back, limbs, and severe headache (Horstmann 1955). These symptoms can last up to 10 days, but recovery is usually rapid and com-plete. Paralytic polio, which affects less than 1 percent of those infected, is the most serious manifestation of the dis-ease (Sabin 1951). This form of the disease presents initiallyas a minor fever with rapid progression to paralysis within amatter of days. Paralysis may affect the major musclesinvolved in respiration and therefore cause death if there isno appropriate rapid intervention. Global efforts toward polio eradication have included vaccination campaigns and active surveillance. The annual incidence of paralytic polio was reduced from an estimated350,000 in 1988 to about 1,000 from 2001 to 2004 (WHO2004). Africa and South Asia are the last regions in the worldwhere poliomyelitis is still endemic. False accusations oftainted vaccines by local leaders have led to a local resur-gence of poliomyelitis cases and consequent spread to otherparts of Africa (Heymann and Aylward 2004). Two different poliomyelitis vaccines are currently used to protect against disease. Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) is alive attenuated vaccine containing all three serotypes of the poliovirus and induces protection as high as 95 percent in individuals who receive three doses. Additional boosterdoses are necessary to achieve nearly 100 percent protection.Currently the WHO recommends that OPV be given atbirth, 6, 10, and 14 weeks in polio endemic or recentlyendemic countries (Sutter and Kew 2004). In many devel-oped countries this vaccine is now delivered in a series ofnational or subnational campaigns several times a year. Themajority of developing countries throughout the world relyon OPV for vaccinating their population, a combined birthcohort of 127 million people (Sutter and Kew 2004). Because OPV is a live viral vaccine that can revert to a transmissible pathogenic virus, recipients or those in con- tact with them can be at increased risk of vaccine-associatedparalytic poliomyelitis (V APP) due to shedding of live virusinto the environment. V APP occurs in less than one personper 3.3 million doses administered (Sutter and Kew 2004). Viral shedding can be chronic and occur for years. Recentpolio outbreaks have been blamed on continuous transmis- sion of polioviruses derived from vaccine strains, most notably in areas with low immunization coverage rates(Kew et al. 2004). An assumption of the WHO eradicationprogram is that countries would be able to stop vaccination after wild poliovirus ceases transmission; however, the pos- sible threat of a resurgence because of the continued likelycirculation of oral poliovirus vaccine would seriously chal-lenge that strategy (Miller, Barrett, and Henderson 2006). Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) is another vaccine, composed of three types of inactivated polioviruses. WhenIPV is administered to infants as the primary vaccine, the first two or three doses should be administered in the firstsix months of life, followed by a booster during the second year. It is also recommended that, when feasible, a secondbooster be given to children before they enter school. IPV efficacy rates have been estimated between 80 and 90 per-cent against paralytic polio (Plotkin and Vidor 2004). An increasing number of countries are transitioning fromOPV to IPV because of the risk intolerance associated withvaccine-derived paralysis. Financial and operational barrierscurrently prevent many developing countries from doingthe same, although costs and the ease of IPV use throughcombination vaccines may allow their greater use in thefuture. Measles Measles is an acute, highly infectious viral disease that is transmitted from person to person through large respira-tory droplets. In the absence of vaccination, measles is esti-mated to infect virtually the entire population with theexception of isolated communities (Black 1976). Most chil- dren born to immune mothers are protected from the virusfor the first six months of their lives from acquired maternalantibodies. More than 90 percent of infections are associ-ated with clinical disease, which includes a range of symp-toms, including fever, rhinorrhea, cough, and conjunctivitis.A rash commonly appears within three to four days afteronset. Complications associated with measles include pneu-monia, diarrhea, encephalitis, and blindness. The case-fatalityrates in recent years have been estimated at 0.1 to 3 percent in many developing nations (Strebel, Papania, and Halsey2004). The number of deaths due to measles has been a subject of considerable controversy for the past several years, mostly Vaccine-Preventable Diseases | 165because of the inability to specify accurately the cause of death in children afflicted with measles and other, similar conditions. Many models have been constructed that demonstrate a substantial reduction of measles deaths fromthe long-stated global number of 1 million deaths per yearreported by the WHO prior to 1997. Large-scale urban andnationwide vaccination campaigns over the last few years have reduced measles mortality to 250,000-500,000 deaths per year, most of which still occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.Measles can coexist with several comorbid conditions thatcan cause death, so attribution to any one cause is somewhat arbitrary, rendering specific accounting difficult. It is likely, however, that recent implementation of mass vaccinationcampaigns throughout many regions, and in areas previ- ously associated with high mortality, has dramaticallyreduced deaths due to measles. However, given the hightransmission rate of measles virus, this reduction in mortal-ity could only be maintained with continuous high cover-age. Measles mortality can be estimated from the suscepti-bility profile of the population based on historical immu-nization coverage rates and natural immunity (Miller 2000).Transmission can be blocked if population-based immunityexceeds approximately 93 percent, limiting cases only toimportations. Control in many urban parts of Africa may bedifficult, given that transmission is higher in densely popu- lated environments with low levels of hygiene (Miller 2000). The measles vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine that can be administered by itself, combined with rubella vaccine, or with mumps and rubella vaccines. Nearly 95 percent of chil-dren vaccinated with at least one combination of the vaccinedevelop immunity. Most individuals who fail to developimmunity with one dose will do so upon receiving a seconddose. Vaccination is believed to induce lifelong immunity.The first dose should be given on or after the first birthday.A second dose is given to children when they are about fourto six years old but can be given as soon as one month afterthe first dose. Adverse reactions following immunization,such as fever, rash, or lowered platelet counts, have beenobserved in 5 to 15 percent of vaccine recipients. Manydeveloping countries are now delivering measles vaccines incampaign style, similar to that used to deliver poliovirusvaccination. Measles vaccination rates are sensitive indicators of func- tional public health systems. One to two doses of a US$0.14vaccine could prevent a disease that practically affects100 percent of the population with an approximate case-fatality rate of 3 to 6 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa. Giventhat measles vaccine is one of the most cost-effective andlow-cost health interventions, low coverage rates of the vac- cine in the 1990s is indicative of the poor state of public health infrastructures in various Sub-Saharan Africa popu-lations (figure 12.2). Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis are frequently cited together given that these three diseases are frequently con-trolled with a single vaccine. Each of these diseases will becovered in turn. Diphtheria. Diphtheria is caused by toxin-producing strains of the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which can be transmitted from person to person via respi- ratory droplets. The bacterium often affects the tonsils,pharynx, nasal mucosa, inner ear, vagina, or skin. Respi-ratory diphtheria presents as a sore throat often accompa-nying a mild fever. Death can result from severe cases inwhich swelling from pharyngeal and tracheal exudates obstruct the airway. Myocarditis and neuritis are two othercomplications associated with respiratory diphtheria.Cutaneous diphtheria presents as skin lesions and causes farfewer complications and deaths among those infected. 166 | Mark A.

In The Gambia, an annual incidence rate of six cases per 1,000 persons under the age of five years was reported(Heyworth and Ropp 1973). Incidence data in Africa islimited to case series and hospital-based surveillance stud-ies, where underreporting is likely, given that diphtheria is frequently reported as nonspecific upper respiratory infec- tions (Rodrigues 1991). The EPI has traditionally recommended three doses of the combined diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine in the first year of life (in conjunction with polio vaccine).Most developed countries give subsequent booster doses inchildhood and diphtheria-tetanus boosters in adulthood. There is growing concern that adolescents and adult popu-lations are becoming more susceptible to diphtheria becauserepeated doses of diphtheria toxoid are needed to maintainimmunity in these populations. Once a child is immunized,the immunity wanes relatively rapidly without exposureto natural C. diphtheriae and Oblapenko 1995; Geldermalsen and Wenning 1993). However, in Africa, the need for boost-ers is offset by the natural immunity provided by the pres-ence of C. diphtheriae in skin ulcers as well as asymptomatic carriage in the throat, which spreads the organism through- out the population. Carrier rates in Africa have been esti-mated to be as high as 9.3 percent in children in the generalpopulation (Geldermalsen and Wenning 1993). The risk of diphtheria epidemics is heightened among communities with an immunity gap in adults and a large number of susceptible children and adolescents (Galazka and Robertson 1996). As a means of controlling potential diphtheria outbreaks, immunization coverage rates should be increased among at-risk groups, cases should bepromptly detected and managed, and close contacts shouldbe recognized quickly to prevent secondary infections(Galazka, Robertson, and Oblapenko 1995). For these rea-sons effective vaccine and surveillance must be maintainedin Sub-Saharan Africa in order to keep the prevalence ofdiphtheria at relatively low levels and to prevent possibleepidemics. In addition, the use of booster doses should beconsidered, especially as immunity wanes in those popula-tions with increasing hygiene and the consequent decreaseto natural reexposure. Pertussis. Pertussis, or whooping cough, is a highly conta- gious disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, which is transmitted through respiratory excretions.Pertussis is characterized as spasms (paroxysms) of cough- ing followed by inspiratory \"whooping.\" The paroxysms canvary in length and severity but may become so severe, espe- cially among infants, that respiration is compromised, resulting in hypoxia. In some cases this can cause neurolog- ical damage. Pneumonia can also be a complication of per- tussis infection. In a study conducted in Canada, pneumo- nia occurred in 2 percent of patients younger than 30 years old and in 5 to 9 percent of older participants (De Serreset al. 2000). Severe coughing in older persons can causeserious complications, ranging from rib fractures to pneu-mo-thorax, inguinal herniated lumbar disks(De Serres et al. 2000; Postels-Multani et al. 1995). In more developed countries transmission from adults to young infants is common. Girls tend to have higher inci- dence rates of the disease than boys (Dragsted et al. 2004; Mahieu et al. 1978; Preziosi et al. 2002). Pertussis is highlycontagious in its early stages and has a secondary attack rate in other household members as high as 90 percent(Rodrigues 1991). Reported incidence rates of pertussis inSenegal prior to any immunization campaigns were esti-mated to be 183 per 1,000 child-years at risk under age fiveyears, with a 2.8 percent case-fatality rate (Preziosi 2002).Similar studies have shown incidence rates in Africa to benearly 1,000 per 100,000 inhabitants (Galazka 1992). Each year there are an estimated 20 million to 40 million cases of pertussis and another 200,000 to 400,000 deaths attributed to the disease, 90 percent of which occur inthe developing world (WHO 1999b). The WHO believesthat only 1 to 2 percent of cases are reported worldwide.Pertussis diagnosis is difficult for several reasons. Paroxysmsamong adults are less severe and often misdiagnosed asother respiratory illnesses. Misdiagnosis is common in areaswithout adequately trained personnel or technology. In astudy of 3,096 patients, B. pertussis was found in 496 indi- viduals; 208 (42 percent) were diagnosed by polymerasechain reaction (PCR) alone, whereas 17 (3 percent) werediagnosed by culture alone (Dragsted et al. 2004). Rapiddiagnosis of pertussis using PCR techniques together withserological assays can enhance diagnosis as well as surveil-lance of pertussis (Fry et al. 2004). Clinical diagnosis of per-tussis by a trained physician has also proved to be a reliablediagnostic tool (Granstrom, Wretlind, and Granstrom 1991)and is often characterized by a cough that lasts at least14 days (Patriarca et al. 1988). These are important implica-tions when considering diagnosis of pertussis in remoteareas with limited laboratory resources and few trainedhealth professionals. Vaccine-Preventable Diseases | 167The incidence rate of pertussis has declined drastically over the past half-century primarily because of the admin- istration of the inactivated whole-cell pertussis vaccines. Due to neurological reactions associated with the whole-cell vaccines, new acellular vaccines have been developed.Either of these vaccines is usually administered with thediphtheria and tetanus toxoids (TTs). The whole-cell vac- cine is cheaper than the acellular vaccine and is produced in many developing countries (WHO 1999b). A herd effectof vaccination not only protects immunized infants butdecreases transmission rates to protect unvaccinated infants (Miller and Gay 1997). The introduction of pertus- sis vaccines through the EPI in Senegal has resulted insteady and dramatic decreases in the incidence of the dis- ease, especially among infants under six months old(Preziosi et al. 2002). T etanus. T etanus is the only EPI vaccine-preventable dis- ease that is not communicable but acquired through environmental contamination. The bacterium Clostridium tetani, which can grow in dirty flesh wounds, produces a neurotoxin causing convulsions and eventual death.Neonatal tetanus (NNT), the most common form oftetanus in the developing world, is the result of contamina-tion of the umbilical stump either by the use of nonsterileinstruments after delivery or the application of animaldung to the cut cord, a custom in many cultures, especiallyamong groups in Sub-Saharan Africa (Elmore-Meeganet al. 2001). Symptoms can appear 3 to 14 days after birth following a period of normal feeding. Infected infants will gradually lose the ability to nurse properly followedby a period of convulsions, which increase in intensity andfrequency. Mortality rates of infants can range from 25 to90 percent with care, 95 percent without (http://www.who.int/vaccines/en/neotetanus.shtml). NNT, which causes an estimated 450,000 infant deaths, is defined as tetanus in the first month of life. Another 40,000maternal deaths are estimated to occur from tetanusacquired during delivery (WHO 1999a). NNT remains aglobal problem, but the greatest burden occurs in Africa(table 12.1) (Anita-Obong, Y percent the global burden from NNT is from 28 coun-tries. Of these, 16 are located in Africa (Angola, BurkinaFaso, Cameroon, Chad, C\u00f4te Mali,Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal).Additionally, 11 of the 12 countries reporting NNTmortality rates greater than 5 per 1,000 live births are in Africa (WHO 1999c). The WHO estimates that approximately 3 percent of NNT cases are reported each year; this figure includes those reported from countries considered to have well-developed surveillance systems (WHO 1999b). Because death mayoccur within the first week of birth, it often is unreported inofficial mortality records and therefore is referred to as \"thesilent killer\" (CVI 1994). Community surveys conducted invarious states of Nigeria between 1990 and 1993 found thatmortality rates from NNT ranged between 9 and 20 per1,000 live births (Babaniyi and Parakoyi 1991). It was esti-mated in 1999 that nearly 46,000 cases of NNT occurred inNigeria, representing 36 percent of all the NNT cases in the African region, although only 1,529 of the cases were actu-ally reported. This problem of underreporting has seriousimplications for the control of the disease. The World Health Assembly in 1989 set the goal for elim- ination (defined as incidence of less than 1 case per 1,000 live births) of NNT by 1995. This date was later delayed until2005 because of operational constraints from the expandedscope of including maternal tetanus. By 1999 only 104 ofthe 161 developing countries in the world had eliminatedneonatal tetanus. Sixteen of the 57 nations that have yet toreach this target are located in the African region (fig- ure 12.3) (Idema et al. 2002). Included in this plan for elim-ination is the use of TT to protect pregnant women and theuse of supplemental immunization activities, clean birthingpractices, and active surveillance systems for women ofchildbearing age (WHO 2001b). DTP V accines. Inactivated diphtheria and TTs can be com- bined with whole-cell or acellular pertussis vaccines, such as DTwP or DTaP , respectively, and administered as a singleinjection. In most of Africa, the national EPI schedule ofvaccination is at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of life. Although mostdeveloped countries administer booster doses, this does notroutinely occur in Africa. Pertussis vaccine efficacy is 70to 90 percent of fully vaccinated children (Edwards andDecker 2004); however, continuous protection requiresbooster doses. Three doses of tetanus or diphtheria toxoidsare associated with greater than 95 percent protectionagainst disease (Cherry and Harrison 2004; Feigin,Stechenberg, and Hertel 2004; Wharton and Vitek 2004);however, periodic boosting is necessary to ensure lifelongprotection. DTP vaccine has been associated with adverseeffects, such as local swelling and tenderness, fever,febrile seizures, anaphylaxis, hyporesponsive episodes, and 168 | Mark A. Miller and John T. Sentzencephalopathy (Edwards and Decker 2004). The more expensive acellular pertussis vaccines have greatly reducedthese reactions. The TT, given to immunize pregnant women to prevent neonatal and maternal tetanus, induces antibodies that canbe passed from the mother to the fetus. In addition to being an effective vaccine, it is relatively cheap at about US$0.07per dose (CVI 1994). Studies have shown that when 80 per-cent of women in an area have been vaccinated againsttetanus with two doses, the level of seroprotection coupledwith health education is adequate to eliminate tetanus(CVI 1994). Some of the lowest coverage rates of TT are found in Africa. The EPI coverage rates among pregnant women withtwo doses had stagnated between 30 and 40 percent in mostAfrican nations by 1999. One of the objectives of the EPI isto increase coverage of three doses of DTP vaccine to 80 percent in all districts in the region. It is estimated that53 percent of children under the age of one living in Sub-Saharan Africa have received three doses of the DTP vaccine(figure 12.4) (World Bank 2003). Tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Transmitted through respira- tory droplets, tuberculosis is highly contagious, with studiesshowing a 25 to 50 percent infection rate of those in closecontact with infected individuals (Smith and Starke 2004). TB presents clinically with a wide range of symptoms,depending upon the age of the individual. Infants and ado-lescents are most likely to have significant clinical manifes-tations compared with older children. Most infants willpresent with a nonproductive cough, shortness of breath, Vaccine-Preventable Diseases | 1691980 Source: WHO and UNICEF 2003.02050percent8090100 70 60 40 30 10 2002 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 year global industrial countries South Asia Latin America and the Caribbean Central Europe East Asia and Pacific Middle East and North Africa Sub-Saharan AfricaFigure 12.4 Global and Regional Immunization Coverage, Three Doses DTP , 1980-2001ATLANTIC of districtsMNT eliminated from over 50 - 90% of districts MNT eliminated from less than 50% of districts no datainternational boundaries This map was produced by the Map Design Unit of The World Bank.

Other common symptoms include night sweats, malaise, irritability, fatigue, and weight loss. TB is often misdiagnosed as other illnesses, such as bronchitis, until it progresses to more advanced stages. TB can alsopresent as meningitis in infants or cause a chronic infectiousprocess almost anywhere throughout the body. The timebetween preclinical infection and the onset of disease can be several weeks to many decades. Adults who are able to sup- press acute infections often carry the bacterium latently,which results in reactivation of the disease later in life.Accurate diagnosis of TB is a critical component for better understanding the burden of disease as well as the effective- ness of interventions. In resource-poor areas of the world inwhich mycobacterial cultures and radiography are not accessible, microscopy is most commonly used to identifythe organism and thus diagnose the disease. TB is blamed for nearly 2 million to 3 million deaths annually, and it is believed that another 8 million people areinfected with the bacterium each year. Nearly one-third ofthe world's population is currently infected with TB (WHO2001a). In much of the world the TB incidence rates contin-ue to grow, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, despite thewidespread use of the bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and TB have led toincreases in the incidence rate of TB by approximately 20 percent (Smith and Starke 2004). BCG is a live attenuated bacterial vaccine most commonly administered intradermally at birth to prevent tuberculosis.The effectiveness of the BCG vaccine against TB has beendebated, with a range estimated from 0 to 80 percent (Fine 2001). Most proponents claim that it is effective against TB meningitis, but it is not commonly believed to prevent TB in adults nor its transmission. The real impact of BCG mayhave been confounded by many other improvements inpublic health that could have contributed to the decrease indisease burden associated with tuberculosis (Smith andStarke 2004). Yellow Fever Y ellow fever is an acute viral infection transmitted by mos- quito, primarily the Aedes aegypti . Symptoms of the infec- tion can vary, making diagnosis difficult and leading to theunderestimation of morbidity (Monath 2004). After anincubation period of three to six days, onset of symptoms\u2014 rigors, headache, nausea, joint pain, jaundice, and myalgia\u2014is rapid. In approximately 15 to 20 percent of cases, severedisease causes multiple organ failure.Y ellow fever is endemic to parts of South America as well as Sub-Saharan Africa in areas bordering jungles (figure 12.5). Between 1986 and 1995, reported incidence ofyellow fever dramatically increased from previous reportingintervals, likely because of cessation of vaccinations. InAfrica alone, 22,952 cases were reported, accounting for 89 percent of the total global cases during that period(Monath 2004). A case-fatality rate of 23 percent (5,357deaths) was reported throughout Africa. The yellow fever vaccine is a live attenuated viral vaccine recommended for anyone nine years or older living or trav-eling to endemic regions of South America and Africa. Asingle dose of the vaccine has shown to be effective for 30 to35 years and most likely for the duration of the vaccinerecipient's life (Monath 2004). Adverse effects from the vac- cine have ranged from mild symptoms of headache, malaise,or low-grade fever to rare, more serious complications. Hepatitis B Many viral agents cause hepatitis; vaccine can counteracttwo of them\u2014hepatitis A virus (HA V) and hepatitis B virus(HBV). Although a licensed vaccine against HA V is used indeveloped countries, it is currently not considered to becost-effective for Africa.

Persons infected as infants have a 70 to 90 percent chance of becoming a chronic carrier of the virus and can then either infect otherpersons or develop severe sequelae at a later stage in life. National serosurveys for antibodies and antigenic mark- ers for carrier states of HBV are available for almost allnations at various stages of resolutions due to blood-banking practices. The overall carriage rate for Sub-SaharanAfrica is 12 percent. These data allow for estimations of dis-ease burden based on a certain percentage of chronicallyinfected persons progressing to hepatoma, fulminant hepa-titis, or cirrhosis at later stages of life (Miller and McCann2000). For Sub-Saharan Africa, this would translate into more than 500,000 deaths per year in each birth cohort ata mean age of 40 to 45 years. As life expectancy in Sub-Saharan Africa is currently declining from the HIV epi-demic, actual death from hepatitis is likely to be lower. Three doses of HBV vaccine, the first given at birth, could effectively prevent a child from becoming infected and from becoming a chronic carrier of the virus. Vaccine ef-fectiveness is approximately 95 percent with three doses.Therefore, HBV vaccine could exert a powerful herd effecton the population by eliminating the long latency periodduring which persons could be infectious to others. Despite the benefits of implementing HBV into national vaccination campaigns, a minority of African nations are doing so(figure 12.6). The WHO endorses several immunizationschedules so that HBV vaccine can be administered withother vaccines. The vaccine does not have any known seri-ous effects and can be combined with other vaccines,including DTP and Hib. As HBV is transmitted in a way similar to that of HIV , the uptake and use of this vaccine is a good proxy for the poten-tial use of vaccines against HIV and the acquired immunedeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Haemophilus Influenzae type B Hib is a bacterium transmitted through respiratory excre- tions and may be carried in the nasopharynx of about15 percent of nonimmunized children (WHO 1998). Themost common forms of invasive disease are meningitis,epiglottitis, pneumonia, arthritis, and cellulitis. Epiglottitis is characterized by swelling of the epiglottis, the tissue in thethroat covering the larynx. The disease burden of Hib ishighest among children between four and eighteen months,rarely occurring in infants younger than three months andafter the age of six years. Hib meningitis could cause severemental retardation in patients who recover from the acute form of the disease. As it is difficult to culture this organism, disease burden estimates are made through a variety of modeling studies integrating data from geographic representational popula-tions and similar socioeconomic stratification (Miller 1998;Miller and McCann 2000). In a Hib vaccine trial in TheGambia (Mulholland et al. 1997), the vaccinated group had21 percent fewer occurrences of severe pneumonia thanthe control group, indicating that up to 21 percent of casesof severe pneumonia may be due to this organism.Extrapolation to the rest of the region would indicate thatthis vaccine could potentially prevent 90,000 to 123,000 deaths due to bacterial pneumonia or meningitis. Since 1988, safe and effective vaccines have been devel- oped to prevent Hib. A conjugate vaccine can tered with DTP , IPV , and HBV vaccine. A full course of vaccine confers more than 95 percent protection against invasive Hib disease and results in a herd effect (Wenger andWard 2004). This vaccine may be given in combination withDTP . In countries that have introduced a three- to four-doseregimen, Hib disease has almost been eliminated. The rela-tively high cost of the Hib vaccine has hindered many low-income countries from integrating the vaccine into routinevaccine schedules. Research has been conducted to explain Vaccine-Preventable Diseases | 171ATLANTIC OCEAN INDIAN OCEANMediterranean international boundaries This map was produced by the Map Design Unit of The World Bank.

It has been estimated that from 257,000 to 317,000 deaths could be averted each year through theroutine use of Hib vaccine (Miller and McCann 2000).Although Hib vaccination would be a cost-effective inter-vention in low-income countries, its use in Africa has been limited. Meningococcal Disease Neisseria meningitides is a bacterium that causes menin- gitis, frequently with devastating neurological sequelae (Heymann et al. 1998; Merlin et al. 1996) and a death rate often exceeding 30 percent, even with optimal treatment (Campagne et al. 1999). Infections have also resulted in limb loss. Given its acute sporadic onset and devastating impact on young healthy individuals, mostly less than 30 years of age, meningococcal disease is one of the most feared infec-tious diseases. Although meningococcal disease is rare ininfants up to three months of age, the incidence graduallyincreases to a peak at about one year of age and declinesthereafter. Although there are five serogroups (A, B, C, Y, and W135), serogroup A has caused annual epidemics in the African meningitis belt, an area stretching from Senegal toEthiopia (Greenwood 1987; Greenwood et al. 1984;Lapeyssonnie 1963). Annual incidence rates in this portionof the African continent have exceeded 1,000 cases per100,000 population in some instances (Granoff, Feavers,and Borrow 2004). In 1996 the largest recorded meningitisoutbreak occurred in Africa, resulting in more than 250,000cases and 25,000 deaths (Tikhomirov, Santamaria, andEsteves 1997). A polysaccharide vaccine containing polysaccharides from serotypes A, C, Y, and W135 that is approximately 85 percent effective has been licensed but has been used only in response to outbreaks triggered by a weekly incidence of10 to 15 cases per 100,000 persons in a geographicallydefined region. Frequently, surveillance and logistical diffi-culties to timely identification of outbreaks and delivery ofvaccines in these instances have had a limited impact on epi-demics. The 1996 outbreak and the continuous suboptimalimplementation of emergency immunization campaignsled to a reevaluation of meningococcal disease-preventionstrategies in this area (Miller and Shahab 2005). Robbinsand colleagues (1997) called for immediate mass immu-nization, followed by a routine immunization program offour doses of polysaccharide vaccine given during the first five years of life. Others (WHO 1997) have suggested rou-tine immunization of schoolchildren or improvement of theimplementation of the current strategy of emergencyresponse with mass immunization. T o date, these vaccinesare not used routinely in Sub-Saharan Africa. A conjugatemeningococcal serogroup A vaccine currently being devel-oped could routinely be administered to infants in Africa(LaForce 2004). FUTURE VACCINES Parallel to the successful delivery of vaccines, great advances have been made in the field of vaccine development. Sincethe 1985 U.S. Institute of Medicine report established prior- ities for vaccine development (IOM 1986), many new vac- cines with the potential to dramatically reduce morbidityand mortality have been developed. Within the last 20 yearsnew safe and effective vaccines have been developed and licensed to protect populations against HBV and Hib. Great research strides in immunology have begun to pay divi-dends with the more recent licensure of rotavirus vaccinesagainst diarrhea, human papillomavirus vaccine againstgenital warts and possible cervical cancer, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) vaccine against pneumonia. Although these vaccines are currently licensed, they are presently not routinely used in Africa. VACCINATION PROGRAMS The WHO objectives of the EPI in Africa are to strengthen the delivery of sustainable immunization services and toaccelerate efforts to achieve polio eradication, measles control, neonatal tetanus elimination, and yellow fever con- trol. Country strategic plans are prepared for the districtlevel, with the goal of administering three doses of DTP toat least 80 percent of the target population in all districts and ensure increasing government funding for the EPI. EPI programs are strengthening health systems throughoutAfrica as well as implementing the use of new vaccines andtechnologies. Prior to the implementation of immunization programs, vaccine-preventable diseases were highly endemic through-out Sub-Saharan Africa. During the 1990s the global immu- nization coverage exceeded 70 percent (figure 12.1); how-ever, reported rates between regions and nations had great 172 | Mark A. Miller and John T. Sentzdisparities. In Sub-Saharan Africa, reported immunization rates peaked in 1990 at 55 percent and remained steady throughout the decade. Immunization rates have decreased over the last 10 years in many low-income countries, partic-ularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. For example, vaccination ratesof all three doses of DTP (DTP3) in the Central AfricanRepublic decreased from 82 percent in 1990 to 29 percent in 2000. Similarly, the coverage rates with three doses of DTP vaccine dropped in the Democratic Republic of Congo from79 percent in 1990 to 33 percent in 2000. These declineshave been attributed to civil unrest and lack of political will among the national governments. As a result, millions of children have been left unvaccinated and vulnerable todisease. The success of vaccination programs applied at the global level has had few parallels in public health. Immunizations remain one of the most cost-effective health interventions toprevent death and disability caused by infectious diseases.Despite great strides forward in vaccination developmentand administration throughout parts of the world, manycountries, usually the poorest, struggle with vaccinatingtheir children. This gap in immunization coverage resultsfrom many compounding problems, such as low politicalcommitment on behalf of national and local governments,weak health service delivery systems, civil unrest, andunderfunding and poor management. These problems arefurther compounded by relatively low levels of research anddevelopment of new vaccines to combat the predominantdiseases in the developing world. There are many possible reasons why routine vaccination has declined in Africa. Over the past decade, the budget ofthe WHO vaccine program has been heavily skewed toward the Poliomyelitis Eradication Initiative. Although this has led to high coverage rates against poliomyelitis virus, it likelyhas strained other vaccination services (Taylor, Cutts, andTaylor 1997). Additionally, throughout the 1990s, donorsand the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) empha-sized that countries should pay for vaccine out of their ownnational budget rather than finance the cost throughdonors. The push toward self-reliance was made with goodintentions, but fixed budgets within national economiesmay have simply moved funds from vaccine administrationto vaccine purchase, with resultant declines in services. An additional deterrent to vaccination adherence in much of the world is the threat of unsafe injections. It has been estimated that nearly 8 billion to 12 billion injectionsare administered in various health care settings throughoutthe world each year; 50 percent of these injections arebelieved to be unsafe and pose the risk of transmitting hepatitis, HIV , and other blood-borne pathogens (Millerand Pisani 1999). In many circumstances, especially in developing countries, disposable syringes are used multiple times, which increases the risk of disease transmission.Immunization rates drop dramatically when unsafe injec-tion practices are publicized, whether they even are a part of vaccine campaigns. Recognizing these factors, the WHO has recently been promoting the expansion and performance monitoring of services to local levels, with the goal of reaching routine cov-erage of at least 80 percent. This may rectify the maldistribu-tion of vaccine delivery services within countries to increasethe equity of benefits, especially to the populations on the margins, those likely to have the greatest disease burden. ADOPTION OF NEW VACCINES The traditional EPI-targeted program has been challenged by the development of new vaccines that promise to reducethe disease burden further if they can be adopted intonational programs. Since the development of nationalvaccine programs, there has been a widening gap in the number of vaccines used in developing and developedcountries (figure 12.7). Vaccine-Preventable Diseases | 173Figure 12.7 Number of Childhood Vaccines Routinely Used in Developing and Established-Market Countries 1975 Source: WHO and UNICEF 2003. a.

However, despite the availability of these publichealth tools, countries have been slow to adopt them. Forexample, despite the World Health Assembly's recommen-dation to add HBV vaccine to all member nations' vaccina- tion programs by 1997 (WHA 1992), less than one-half the global infant birth cohort receives this vaccine. Likewise,many African countries have yet to adopt the highly effica-cious Hib vaccine. Given the array of new vaccines on the horizon, and potential vaccines against HIV , malaria, and tuberculosis, what is the likelihood of their adoption, espe-cially in those countries that have the highest mortality from those diseases? Factors such as national infrastructure to deliver vaccines and the cost of novel vaccines relative to national income in addition to an inadequate appreciation of the disease bur-den have prevented the adoption of newer vaccines. TheGlobal Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GA VI) hassought to address some of these factors through the cre-ation of vaccine purchase funds and the direct allocation offinancial resources to strengthen infrastructures at the locallevel. It is still too early to judge the success of these tacticsand sustainability in the most resource-constrained areassuch as Africa. Development agencies will have limitedinfluence on per capita gross domestic product, but they canwork with manufacturers to influence the vaccine cost to thecountry (either by offering financial support for vaccine purchase or guaranteeing volume purchase to lower vaccineprices) and strengthen vaccination services. VACCINATION: PROBLEMS AND BARRIERS The barriers to vaccine adoption are presumed to be multi- ple. If there is poor recognition of disease burden and costs,insufficient finances, or an ineffective vaccine delivery system, the introduction of a new vaccine is unlikely. How- ever, methodological analyses can help focus deliberationsand assist countries to overcome hurdles such as these.Demonstration of a country's disease burden as well as its associated economic burden may encourage the appropriate allocation of financial resources by clarifying the value ofprevention through vaccination. Economics has frequently been sited as a barrier to the use of newer vaccines. T o address this, an analysis of thehealth and economic implications of new vaccine introduc-tion was conducted to help national policy makers (Millerand McCann 2000). Disease burden, vaccine program costs, and the potential reduction of disease from vaccinationwere assessed for four vaccines that have not been adoptedin many countries. Without vaccination, HBV , Hib, SP , and rotavirus con- tribute to more than 1 million deaths in each successivebirth cohort in Africa (Miller and McCann 2000). Routinescheduled use of HBV , Hib, SP , and rotavirus vaccines couldpotentially prevent most of these deaths (table 12.2). Incor-poration of these vaccines into routine vaccination pro-grams was estimated to cost between US$29 and US$150per life year saved (Miller and McCann 2000). Based on these evaluations, HBV and Hib should be considered forintegration into all national immunization programs. SPand rotavirus vaccines, with the given assumptions, wouldalso be cost-effective. Proactive analysis of the epidemio-logic and economic impact of these vaccines can hastentheir introduction into national vaccination schedules. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS, GAVI, AND THE VACCINE FUND GAVI is a public-private partnership devoted to the promo- tion and strengthening of vaccine programs in low-incomecountries. Through the Vaccine Fund, which is the funding arm of GA VI, financial resources are provided for eligible countries to purchase vaccines and to fund the operationalcosts of managing immunization campaigns. GA VI providesfunding to national governments based on national income (countries with gross national income per capita below US$1,000). Approximately half of the 75 countries eligiblefor funding through GA VI are located in Sub-SaharanAfrica. In order for an eligible country to receive fundingit must demonstrate that a well-functioning national mech-anism is in place to coordinate immunization activitiesamong the various partners within the country. The immu- nization program must have received a comprehensive 174 | Mark A. Miller and John T.

Currently theGAVI's Vaccine Fund is providing financial support to gov-ernments in order to improve health services; distribute safeinjection materials; and acquire the HBV , Hib, and yellow fever vaccines. In an attempt to ensure the sustainability of immu- nization campaigns, GA VI requires countries that receive funding to create financial sustainability plans. Financial sustainability of immunization campaigns is vital in order to reach any long-term immunization goals. These financialsustainability plans are meant to be long-term plans that can improve the countries' immunization programs and serve asa foundation to expand support from other sources, namely,their own national budgets. Initiatives by bilateral partner and health agencies empha- size the need for nations to strengthen health system infra- structures and assume responsibility for the provision of basicservices, including childhood immunizations. Concurrentwith these structural changes within nations are pricing andtechnology changes in vaccines. The six basic EPI vaccines arecurrently estimated to cost approximately US$0.50 per capita.New vaccines are appreciably more costly than traditionalvaccines but far less expensive than the treatment costs of thediseases they prevent. The poorer developing countries,which often have the greatest disease burden, may be inclinedto reject the adoption of these vaccines without full recogni- tion of their true value. A determination of the value of prevented disease is not a panacea for a shortage of financial resources. However, itcan support the more efficient allocation of limited resources. Indeed, many new financial resources, mostnotably from the World Bank and the Bill & Melinda GatesFoundation, are expanding the number of potentialresources available to help finance vaccination activities.There is concurrently an expanded role for medical associ-ations on the national, regional, and global level to highlightthe value of prevention through use of some of the besttools in public health. CONCLUSION Traditional vaccines are among the most cost-effective inter- ventions there are and can potentially be used to achieveseveral Millennium Development Goals; however, continu-ous vaccination must be sustainable.In many parts of Africa, vaccine infrastructure has been suboptimal, especially for routine vaccination. Immuniza- tion campaigns versus routine services appear to be domi-nating given logistical and operational hurdles in Sub-Saharan Africa In Africa, new vaccines have been slow to be adopted into national EPI programs; likely reasons have been the lack ofsupport for routine delivery throughout the continent.Logistical and operational factors are probable barriers thatrequire substantial continuous investments in human capi-tal, equipment, and financing.

Vaccine-Preventable Diseases | 177179About 9 million people around the world developed tuber- culosis (TB) for the first time in 2004, and nearly 2 millionpeople died with or from the disease. Globally, TB is cur-rently responsible for more years of healthy life lost (2.5 per-cent of all disability-adjusted life years, or DALYs) than any other infectious disease, bar AIDS and malaria (Corbettet al. 2003; WHO 2002; WHO 2006). Only AIDS is respon-sible for more deaths. The full cost of the worldwide TBepidemic is rarely appreciated. The direct monetary costs ofdiagnosis and treatment are borne by health services and bypatients and their families. Added to these are the indirectcosts of lost income and production, incurred when TBpatients are too sick to work and when young adults\u2014oftenparents and householders\u2014die prematurely (WHO 2000). Beyond these losses, baldly expressed in DALYs and dollars,enormous psychological and social costs are associated withTB. These extra costs are less easily quantified, but they arenonetheless real. A decade ago the problem of TB in Africa attracted little attention, not even meriting a chapter in the first edition ofDisease and Mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa . Part of the reason was that TB incidence was low and falling in mostparts of the continent (Cauthen, Pio, and ten Dam 2002). The burden of TB in Sub-Saharan Africa is far greater today.Continuing poverty and political instability in parts of thecontinent has inhibited progress in implementing effectiveTB control measures. But the principal reason for the resur- gence of TB in Africa is not the deterioration of controlprograms. Rather, it is the link between TB and the humanimmunodeficiency virus and the acquired immune defi-ciency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). People who are latentlyinfected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis\u2014 about one-third of the inhabitants of Sub-Saharan Africa (Dye et al. 1999)\u2014 are at hugely greater risk of developing active TB if they arealso immunologically weakened by a concurrent HIV infec-tion. HIV-positive people are also more likely to develop TB when newly infected or reinfected with M. tuberculosis. Over the past decade, the TB caseload has increased by a factor of five or more in those countries of eastern and southernAfrica that are most affected by HIV . Incidence rates inthese countries are now comparable with those recordedin Europe half a century ago, before the introduction ofantituberculosis drugs.Chapter13 Tuberculosis Christopher Dye, Anthony D. Harries, Dermot Maher, S. Mehran Hosseini, Wilfred Nkhoma, and Felix M. SalaniponiMICROBIOLOGY, TRANSMISSION, AND PATHOGENESIS M. tuberculosis bacilli transmitted on airborne droplets cause, most importantly, a lung disease that will kill about half of all untreated patients. Microbiology The M. tuberculosis complex includes five species: M. tuber- culosis, M. bovis (and bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin), M. canetti, M. africanum, and M. microti. Within the species complex, most human disease is due to M. tuberculosis sensu stricto. The variants within the species complex differ from the type strain biochemically and in culture. However, these differ-ences have no known bearing on management or prognosis.The principal exception is M. bovis, which accounts for a small fraction of human TB cases, but which is naturally resistant to the drug pyrazinamide (which should not there-fore be used in treatment). Human disease can also be caused by species of mycobac- teria other than M. tuberculosis (MOTT), also known as atypical mycobacteria. These organisms are widespread in nature and have been isolated from a variety of sources,including soil, dust, water, milk, animals, and birds. Inhumans, MOTT are low-grade pathogens and usually causedisease only in patients with preexisting lung disease orimmunodeficiency. MOTT are still a rare cause of disease inSub-Saharan Africa. The large majority of patients in Africawho are diagnosed and treated for TB, even those infectedwith HIV , have disease caused by M. tuberculosis (Nunn, Elliott, and McAdam 1994). Mycobacteria are acid and alcohol fast, meaning that once stained by an aniline dye, such as carbolfuchsin, they resist decolorization with acid and alcohol. Mycobacteria are therefore often called \"acid-fast bacilli\" (AFB). In virtuallyall other bacteria the dye is removed by the acid-alcoholwash, and the ability of mycobacteria to retain the anilinedye despite acid and alcohol is probably due to their thickcell wall. This property allows the detection of AFB inspecimens by using the simple Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stainingtechnique, widely used in Sub-Saharan Africa. Mycobacteria grow slowly, with generation times mea- sured in hours rather than minutes. This means that the normal methods of obtaining cultures from clinical speci-mens are difficult because of overgrowth by other bacteria. Fortunately, the thick cell wall of mycobacteria also enablesthem to resist alkalis and detergents, and this property ismade use of in culture techniques that use alkalis and special media to reduce contamination. Transmission and Risk of Infection People infected with M. tuberculosis carry live tubercle bacilli, but the bacilli may be present in small numbers and dormant (latent), in which case there may be no apparent disease. Disease occurs when the bacteria multiply, over- come immune defenses, and become numerous enough tocause damage to tissues. Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) are the most important source of infection. Infection occurs by inhaling droplet nuclei, infectious particles of respiratory secretionsusually less than 5 micrometers, which contain tuberclebacilli. These are spread into the air by coughing, sneezing,talking, spitting, and singing, and they can remain suspendedin the air for long periods of time. A single cough canproduce 3,000 infectious droplet nuclei. Direct sunlight kills tubercle bacilli in minutes, but they can survive in dark,unventilated environments for longer periods of time.Droplet nuclei are so small that they avoid the defenses ofthe bronchi and penetrate into the terminal alveoli of thelungs, where multiplication and infection begins. The risk of infection is determined by the infectiousness of the source case (that is, how many tubercle bacilli are being coughed into the air), the closeness of contact, light and humidity, and the immune status of the host (Rieder1999). Patients with sputum smear-positive pulmonarydisease (tubercle bacilli visible under the microscope when appropriate stains are used) are much more infectious than those with smear-negative sputum (Styblo 1991). Followinginfection, the tubercle bacilli multiply in the lungs, spread tothe local lymph nodes, and then to the rest of the body.About six weeks after this primary infection, the body devel- ops an immune response to the tubercle bacilli calleddelayed hypersensitivity. In the majority of cases, theimmune response stops the further multiplication of thetubercle bacilli, and the only evidence of infection is apositive response to an immunological test, of which themost commonly used is the tuberculin skin test (Ewer et al.2003; Mazurek and Villarino 2003; Von Pirquet 1909). The proportion of any population infected depends on the rate and duration of exposure, and this varies from onegroup of people to another. There are, however, somecommon patterns. Because infection can remain dormantfor many years, or because the immunological consequencesof infection are long-lasting, infection rates are always 180 | Christopher Dye, Anthony D. Harries, Dermot Maher, S. Mehran Hosseini, Wilfred Nkhoma, and Felix M. Salaniponiobserved to increase monotonically with age. Although the infection rates in boys and girls are usually indistinguish- able, adult men typically show higher infection rates than adult women. Men probably suffer more from TB thanwomen, not because they are more susceptible to disease,but because they are more exposed to infection. Pathogenesis The size of the infecting dose of tubercle bacilli and the immune status of the host determine the risk of progressionfrom infection to disease. When infection progresses to disease, it is manifest as infiltrates and lesions within the lung tissue, enlarged lymph nodes within the chest, pleuraleffusion, or disease disseminated in other parts of the body.The immune response of the patient results in a pathological lesion, which is characteristically localized, often with ex- tensive tissue destruction and cavitation. These cavitatinglesions occur most commonly in the lungs and containmany actively dividing bacilli. Sputum from patients withthese lesions is usually smear positive. If the primary infection resolves, small numbers of tubercle bacilli can remain dormant in scarred areas of the body for many years. Postprimary TB may then occur by theprocess of endogenous reactivation, and it may arise in anyother organ system to which the tubercle bacilli were seededduring the primary infection. Active disease can also followfrom secondary or exogenous reinfection in a person whoalready has a latent infection. Without HIV coinfection, the average lifetime risk of infected individuals' developing tuberculosis is 5 to 10 per- cent, the highest risk being within the first five years ofinfection (Comstock, Livesay, and following infec- tion also changes with age. Infants and young children up tothe age of five years who are infected with M. tuberculosis are at relatively high risk, particularly of severe forms (mainlymiliary TB and TB meningitis), because of their immatureimmune systems. Children between the ages of five andfifteen years are relatively resistant to TB. The risk then risesagain through adolescence, remains approximately stableduring adulthood, but increases again in the elderly. Other factors that enhance the risk of developing TB following infection include undernutrition, toxins (tobacco, alcohol, andother diseases (diabetes mellitus, silicosis, leukemia, measles,and whooping cough in children), but none is as importantas HIV (Crofton, Horne, and Miller 1999; Rieder 1999).CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS Clinical diagnoses of tuberculosis distinguish between pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease, the former beingof much greater importance epidemiologically. Pulmonary Tuberculosis Patients with pulmonary TB present with a chronic produc-tive cough, fever, and weight loss. Cough occurs in a varietyof circumstances, notably in acute upper and lower respira-tory infections. However, these acute infections often resolvewithin three weeks. Therefore a patient with a cough longer than three weeks, which persists after a course of antibiotics,should be investigated for PTB. The diagnosis of PTB in most hospitals in African countries is based on sputum smear microscopy and chestradiography. Most countries have a reference laboratorywhere M. tuberculosis can be cultured from clinical speci- mens, such as sputum. Because M. tuberculosis is a slow- growing organism taking two to three months to becomevisible on culture medium, cultures are not usually helpful in making an individual diagnosis. Mycobacterial culturesare commonly used for monitoring drug-sensitivity pat-terns in patients with recurrent TB and for monitoring thecommunity prevalence of drug-resistant TB. Taking sputum specimens (three per suspect) for smear microscopy of AFB is a cheap and simple way to screen for PTB. However, sputum smears may be negative in pul-monary TB patients for three reasons. First, the patient hasgenuine smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis, that is,expectorating small numbers of AFB. AFB can be detectedon microscopy only if there are 10,000 organisms or more per milliliter of sputum. Second, the clinical diagnosis ofTB is incorrect and the patient has another condition, suchas left ventricular failure, asthma, bacterial pneumonia,Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, or pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma. Third, the result is a false negative resulting from technical inadequacies (poor sputum sample, faultysmear preparation, inadequate time spent examining thesmear) or administrative failures (incorrect labeling ofspecimens). If sputum smear examination shows no AFB, patients suspected of having PTB should be referred for chest radi-ography. Classical patterns of TB with upper lobe disease,bilateral disease, and cavitations are more common in HIV-negative patients and in HIV-positive patients who haverelatively well preserved immune function. However, no Tuberculosis | 181chest radiographic pattern is absolutely diagnostic of TB (Hargreaves et al. 2001). Extrapulmonary TB The Patients usually present with constitutional symptoms and local features related tothe site of disease. EPTB is found in a higher proportion of female TB patients than male patients. If patients cough forlonger than three weeks, sputum smear examination andchest radiography are often carried out, because patientsmay have coexisting pulmonary disease. Definitive diagno-sis of EPTB depends on having diagnostic tools, such asradiographs, ultrasound scans, procedures to obtain andanalyze fluid samples, and procedures for tissue biopsies andhistological analysis. This degree of diagnostic sophistica-tion is often unavailable in district hospitals in Africa. For example, in one study in Tanzania only 18 percent ofpatients diagnosed with EPTB had laboratory confirmationof the diagnosis (Richter et al. 1991). Childhood TB Children are most commonly infected with M. tuberculosis as a result of transmission from an adult (often a family member) with smear-positive disease. Most children remain asymptomatic, and a positive tuberculin test may be the only evidence of infection. For those who do progress todisease, PTB is the most common manifestation in bothHIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children, although extra- pulmonary disease is more frequent in those who are HIV positive. The patterns of EPTB in children and the diagnosticproblems encountered are similar to those described foradults, although meningitis makes up a higher proportionof EPTB cases in young children. The diagnosis of childhood PTB has always been difficult because children rarely produce sputum for smear examina- tion. Diagnosis therefore usually requires a combination ofclinical features, history of contact with a sputum-positivecase, growth faltering, chest X-ray, and tuberculin skin test.Chest X-ray findings on their own are nonspecific, as areclinical features, but the most important symptoms areweight loss and poor appetite. Gastric aspiration, inducedsputum, and nasopharyngeal aspiration show promise asalternative diagnostic techniques but are not practical underroutine clinical conditions in Africa.Given the problems with diagnosis and the low frequency of routine childhood screening, the real burden of child-hood TB in Sub-Saharan Africa is not known. One nation-wide study in Malawi found that 12 percent of all registeredTB cases were children less than 15 years of age (Harries,Hargreaves, Graham et al. 2001). Such investigations are auseful starting point for much-needed, population-basedstudies of the burden of TB in children. Consequences of HIV Coinfection Untreated HIV infection causes a progressive decline in the number of CD4+T lymphocytes and progressive dysfunc- tion of those lymphocytes that survive. CD4+cells play a major role in the body's defense against tubercle bacilli, and it is therefore not surprising that HIV infection is the most powerful known risk factor for progression to active diseasein those with a latent M. tuberculosis infection. In HIV- positive people infected with M. tuberculosis the annual risk of developing active disease is 5 to 15 percent, with a lifetime risk of 50 percent or higher (Lienhardt and Rodrigues 1997;Raviglione et al. 1997; Rieder et al. 1989). HIV-infectedpeople are also more susceptible to new tuberculous infec-tions (Di Perri et al. 1989) and to reinfection, and theyprogress more frequently and more quickly to overt disease(Sonnenberg et al. 2001). After the end of a primary episode,HIV increases the likelihood that TB will recur (Fitzgerald, Desvarieux et al. 2000), either by reactivation (true relapse)or reinfection (Daley 1993). People who are coinfected with M. tuberculosis and HIV can develop TB across a wide spectrum of immunodeficiency(Ackah et al. 1995; Mukadi et al. 1993), but the risk of devel-oping active disease increases as the CD4 +cell count declines (figure 13.1). HIV-positive patients with moderate to severe immunosuppression show atypical forms of TB, which complicates radiographic diagnosis. Some HIV- TB patients have normal chest radiographs andnegative sputum smears, and the diagnosis may therefore bemissed unless there are pronounced clinical signs or symp- toms. Among children, the highest rates of HIV infection are observed in those age one to four years, and the accuratediagnosis of TB has become especially difficult in this agegroup (Graham, Coulter, and Gilks 2001). In children andadults who are infected with M. tuberculosis and who are also HIV positive, immunosuppression frequently leads tonegative tuberculin skin tests. The presentation of HIV-related EPTB is generally no different from that of HIV-negative EPTB, although there are sometimes complications. The enlargement of TB 182 | Christopher Dye, Anthony D. Harries, Dermot Maher, S. Mehran Hosseini, Wilfred Nkhoma, and Felix M. Salaniponilymph nodes in HIV-positive patients can occasionally be rapid and resemble an acute abscess. It is possible that adiagnosis of miliary or disseminated TB is regularly missed.Diagnosis is often more difficult in patients who are severelyimmunosuppressed. For example, disseminated TB was diagnosed only after death in 44 percent of patients withHIV wasting syndrome in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire; TB was not recog-nized during life (Lucas et al. 1994).EPIDEMIOLOGY About one-third of the population of Sub-Saharan Africa is infected with M. tuberculosis (Dye et al. 1999). In the year 2000, an estimated 17 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa were infected with both M. tuberculosis and HIV\u201470 per- cent of all people co-infected worldwide (Corbett et al. 2003). As more people have become infected and coinfectedwith HIV , especially in eastern and southern Africa, theincidence of TB has been driven upward, as reflected in estimates derived from population-based surveys and from routine TB surveillance data (figures 13.2 and 13.3) (WHO2002, 2006). In 2004, the incidence rate of TB in the WHOAfrican region was growing at approximately 3 percent peryear (table 13.1), and at 4 percent per year in eastern andsouthern Africa (the areas most affected by HIV), faster than on any other continent, and considerably faster than the1 percent per year global increase (WHO 2006). In severalAfrican countries, including those with well-organizedcontrol programs (Harries et al. 1996; Kenyon et al. 1999),annual TB case-notification rates have risen more than five-fold since the mid-1980s, reaching more than 400 cases per100,000 people (WHO 2006). HIV infection is the mostimportant single predictor of TB incidence across theAfrican continent (figure 13.4). Despite the emphasis placed Tuberculosis | 183Source: Williams and Dye 2003.

Although there are uncertainties aboutdiagnosis, these data conform with the expectation thatthere will be more smear-negative TB where there is more HIV . Because HIV infection rates are higher in women than men, more TB cases are also being reported among women,especially those between the ages of 15 and 24 years. TB casereports are typically male-biased (WHO 2006), but inseveral African countries with high rates of HIV infection,the majority of notified TB cases are now women.The increase in HIV prevalence has also been accompa- nied by a rise in the TB case-fatality rate, and hence the TB death rate in the general population. One recent estimateput the fraction of AIDS deaths due to TB at 12 percent inthe WHO African region in 2000 (Corbett et al. 2003), although this fraction could be higher. In an autopsy studyin Abidjan, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, TB was found to be the causeof death of 54 percent of patients with HIV infection orAIDS (Lucas et al. 1993). Malawi has reported high earlydeath rates of HIV-infected TB patients during the firstone to two months of treatment (Harries, Hargreaves, Gausiet al. 2001). Whether this reflects late presentation and con-sequently severe TB disease or severe HIV-related illness,Surveys coordinated by the WHO and the International Union against TB and Lung Disease (IUATLD) between 1996 and 2002 yielded data on anti-TB drug resistance among new and previously treated cases from sites in 10countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (Espinal et al. 2001; WHO2004a). This limited number of surveys suggests thatMDR-TB is not a widespread problem in the region. Low resistance rates (MDR-TB prevalence typically less than 3 percent among patients suffering a first episode of TB)could be explained by the recent introduction of rifampicinin Africa, by the use of rifampicin-free treatment regimens in the continuation phase (during months three to eight), by the growing use of directly observed treatment as recom-mended under the directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS) strategy, and by the use of fixed-dose combinationtablets in a few countries (Espinal et al. 2001). Implementation of the DOTS Strategy for Tuberculosis Control Population Coverage, Case Detection, and Treatment Outcome. The key components of the WHO Stop TB Strategy are listed in box 13.1. The new strategy builds on the foundations laid by DOTS, and the main aim is still toprevent illness, transmission, and death by curing active TB cases (Raviglione and Uplekar, forthcoming; WHO 2006).With respect to the implementation of DOTS, the primarygoals of national TB programs are to detect 70 percent ofnew smear-positive cases arising each year and to success-fully treat 85 percent of these. The target year was set byWHO to be 2005, but the achievements made by 2005will not be fully known until the end of 2006. With thecorrect application of antituberculosis drugs (short-coursechemotherapy), it is possible to cure over 90 percent of new smear-positive TB patients who are neither resistant to first-line drugs nor infected with HIV . Before the spread of HIV ,countries that met these two targets could expect to see adecline in TB incidence rates of 5 to 10 percent per year ormore (Dye et al. 1998). By the end of 2004, the core DOTS strategy was available in principle to 84 percent of people living in the WHOAfrican region (WHO 2006). The estimated case detectionrate by DOTS programs was 48 percent, somewhat belowthe global average of 53 percent, and not increasing asquickly as the global average (figure 13.6). However, much uncertainty surrounds this assessment of case detection. First, for countries that have estimates of the true TB inci-dence rate based on population surveys, these are typically Tuberculosis | 185Source: Corbett et al. 2003. Note: Each point represents a different African population in which HIV prevalence was measured both in TB patients and in the adult population. The fitted line estimates the incidence-rate ratio to be 5.8 (95 percent CL, 5.2-6.5), that is, the ratio of TB incidence rates HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected populations.0HIV prevalence in TB cases0.8 0.60.4 0.2 0.15 0.35 0.1 0.3 0.05 0.25 0.2 HIV prevalenceFigure 13.5 Prevalence of HIV in TB Cases (All Forms) in Relation to HIV Prevalence in Adults Age 15 to 49 such as bacteremia or cryptococcal meningitis, is not known. The precise cause of death in patients with HIV-related TB has been difficult to determine because therehave been so few autopsy studies. Although the ratio of TB incidence rates in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals is expected to vary during the course of the HIV epidemic (as the average level ofimmunocompetence declines), recent studies have shownthat this incidence-rate ratio takes an average value of aboutsix (figure 13.5) (WHO 2002). Knowing both the incidence-rate ratio and the HIV infection rate in the general pop-ulation, we can calculate the proportion of people newlydiagnosed with TB who are infected with HIV . Estimatesvary widely between countries, from less than 1 percent on some African islands (for example, Comoros, Mauritius) toover 50 percent in some countries, including Botswana,Malawi, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Overall,about one-third (34 percent) of all adults who had TB inSub-Saharan Africa were infected with HIV in 2004. Resistance to Antituberculosis Drugs Drug resistance, and eventually multidrug resistance (MDR- TB; that is, resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin), isexpected to occur whenever patients fail a course of anti-TBchemotherapy. An assessment of the number and distribu-tion of drug-resistant TB cases is important for planning TB control, because the treatment of resistant cases is morecostly and more complex if second-line drugs are used, andfailures and deaths are more frequent.186 | Christopher Dye, Anthony D.

Few countries havesurveyed the prevalence of infection during the last decade,the exceptions being Kenya (Odhiambo et al. 1999) and Tanzania (Tanzanian Tuberculin Survey Collaboration2001). There are no recent national surveys in Africa of theprevalence of active TB. For the many African countries thathave no survey data at all, the estimate of case detection islittle more than an expert guess, based on what is known(mostly qualitatively) about the method of surveillance.Second, the apparent upward trend in case detection couldbe explained partly by improved case finding and partly bythe real rise in incidence due to HIV . In sum, the data describing incidence rates and their trends, and, hence, case-detection rates, are poor for most African countries. The outcome of treatment in the African region is some- what clearer. The treatment success rate for more than480,000 smear-positive patients enrolled under DOTS in2003 was 72 percent (WHO 2006). Treatment success underDOTS in Africa was low in part because the death rate was7 percent, higher than in any other region of the world.More important was the large proportion of patients forwhom the outcome of treatment was not known: 20 percentof patients defaulted from treatment, were transferred toother treatment centers without follow-up, or were simplynot evaluated. It is highly likely that death was the outcomefor some patients recorded as defaulters or transfers.Although the high reported death rates might be attributableto HIV coinfection in some countries, the failure to recordtreatment outcomes is evidently a problem of programmanagement. It would be extremely useful to have compre-hensive and reliable data on TB deaths and their trends inAfrican populations, but no country in Sub-Saharan Africa,except South Africa, has a national system for recording andreporting deaths by cause. Treatment of TB Patients Infected with HIV . HIV- positive TB patients suffer significant HIV-related morbidity during the course of TB treatment. Adversereactions to anti-TB drugs are more frequent and lead totreatment interruptions and fatalities (Raviglione et al. 1997). Several studies in Africa have reported an increase inrecurrent TB in HIV-positive patients (Korenromp et al. 2003), and national programs with good registration sys-tems routinely record high rates of recurrent disease. HIV-positive TB patients have a much higher mortality rate during and after anti-TB treatment than HIV-negative patients (Mukadi, Maher, and Harries 2001). This maychange with wider use of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, butclinical studies have shown that, without ARV therapy, 20 to30 percent of HIV-positive and smear-positive PTB patients die before the end of treatment, and about 25 percent of those who survive die during the following 12 months. Theimmune status of a patient is an important predictor ofdeath: lower CD4 /H11001cell counts at the time of diagnosis in HIV-positive and smear-positive patients are associated with higher mortality rates (Graham, Coulter, and Gilks 2001). HIV-positive patients who present with smear-negative PTB have higher case-fatality rates during treatment than thosewho present with smear-positive PTB, probably becausethey are typically more immunosuppressed. HIV-infected patients given drug regimens with no rifampicin have higher case-fatality rates, and higher relapse rates, than those given regimens with rifampicin(Korenromp et al. 2003). Rifampicin-containing regimensimprove survival, possibly because they act more stronglyagainst M. tuberculosis and, through the broad spectrum antibiotic activity of rifampicin, they may prevent other bacterial infections. Notwithstanding the problems of implementation, DOTS has made a bigger contribution to the managementof TB in Africa than any other strategy (for example, bacil-lus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin [BCG] vaccination). DOTS has beenenlarged as the new Stop TB Strategy, in part to confront thecomplexities that HIV adds to TB epidemiology (Raviglioneand Uplekar, forthcoming; box 13.1).

The Global Planto Stop TB 2006-2015 (Stop TB Partnership and WHO2006) is a blueprint for the implementation of the Stop TBStrategy in all regions of the world, including Africa.Implementation of this wider strategy should complementefforts to improve the basic tools for TB control, such as amore efficacious vaccine (http://www.aeras.org; Y oung andDye forthcoming), more accurate diagnostic tests (http:// www.finddiagnostics.org.), and better drugs for preventionand treatment (http://www.tballiance.org). Intensified TB Case Finding. DOTS has traditionally relied on passive case detection. It is possible that more cases could be found by searching more actively among certainpopulation groups, although the evidence that active casefinding can yield more cases at acceptable cost remainsweak. Groups that might be targeted in Africa for improvedcase finding include people with respiratory symptomsattending general hospitals (outpatients and inpatients); health service providers and health care workers in the pub-lic, private, and nongovernmental organization (NGO) sec-tors (Harries, Maher, and Nunn 1997); people attendingcenters for HIV testing and voluntary counseling ( Aisu et al.1995); prisoners (Coninx et al. 2000); and household con-tacts of those with infectious TB, including patients andcontacts known to be HIV positive (Nunn et al. 1994). Thescreening of child contacts, often neglected, can be animportant benefit to individual children, although, becausechildren with TB are usually not infective to others, it willnot decrease transmission (T opley, Maher, and Nyong'onyaMbewe 1996). TB Preventive Treatment. Individuals at high risk of developing TB can benefit from preventive treatment, usu- ally six months of isoniazid. Isoniazid preventive treatment(IPT) is recommended for children who are householdcontacts of an infectious case of TB and who, after screen-ing, are found not to have active TB themselves (Harriesand Maher 2004). Up to 15 percent of tuberculin-positive,HIV-positive adults will develop TB each year (WHO 1999),and IPT can reduce the short-term risk of TB in this group by about 60 percent, although there is little improvementin survival (Quigley et al. 2001). IPT may also be valuablefor HIV-infected individuals even without tuberculintesting. IPT probably protects HIV-positive people from active TB by reducing the risk of progression from recent and latent infection. Where the transmission rate of M. tubercu- losis is relatively high, repeated exposure to infection proba- bly accounts for the limited duration of benefit of up to2.5 years (Quigley et al. 2001) following completion of a six-month course of IPT. Not surprisingly, the duration of pro-tection depends on the duration of preventive treatment(Fitzgerald, Morse et al. 2000). Although cheap, IPT is at present used mostly for the protection of individuals, rather than to prevent transmis- sion. This is because children rarely develop infectious TB,and because it is hard to administer IPT to healthy adults ona large scale. Because IPT requires consumption of the drugdaily for at least six months, a process that is difficult forhealth services and patients alike, many people who couldbenefit from treatment drop out before completion. The proportion of HIV-infected people who do complete a course of IPT is typically small. For IPT to be effective inpreventing a large number of TB cases associated with HIV ,it will be necessary to find ways of minimizing the dropoutrate and to expand the provision of voluntary counselingservices for HIV-positive patients (Hawken and Muhindi1999). IPT can also prevent TB from recurring in patients who have already suffered one episode. Studies by Perriens and colleagues (1995) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) and by Fitzgerald, Desvarieux, and col-leagues (2000) in Haiti showed a higher rate of recurrentTB in HIV-infected individuals than in non-HIV-infectedindividuals treated with a six-month regimen containingrifampicin throughout (the regimen used in the study inthe Democratic Republic of Congo had a four-drug initialphase and that in Haiti had a three-drug initial phase). Inboth studies, posttreatment prophylaxis (isoniazid andrifampicin in the study in the Democratic Republic ofCongo and isoniazid in the study in Haiti) decreased thenumber of TB recurrences in HIV-positive patients but didnot prolong survival. Based on these successes, further stud-ies are needed before posttreatment prophylaxis can be usedmore widely; they must confirm the benefits, establish opti-mum regimens (drugs and duration), and assess operationalfeasibility. 188 | Christopher Dye, Anthony D. Harries, Dermot Maher, S. Mehran Hosseini, Wilfred Nkhoma, and Felix M. SalaniponiBCG Immunization. Most of the 75 percent of infants in Africa who were vaccinated with BCG in 2003 (WHO 2004b) will be protected against disseminated and severe TB (for example, meningeal and miliary TB) for the first few yearsof their lives (WHO 1995). The efficacy of BCG againstsevere forms of TB in children is 70 to 80 percent, but ittakes about 3,400 inoculations to prevent one case of meningitis and 9,300 to prevent one case of miliary TB (Bourdin Trunz, Fine, and Dye forthcoming).However, most people who are vaccinated as children inAfrica will not be protected against pulmonary TB as adults, because the vaccine is unlikely to protect for longer than 15 years and, in many populations, has low efficacy againstadult pulmonary disease. Even though BCG is not expected to have any significant impact in reducing transmission andincidence, the WHO recommends vaccination for allneonates in Africa, except those with symptoms of HIV dis-ease or AIDS (WHO 1996). Interventions against HIV . In pilot projects, controlled trials, and national programs in less-developed countries, all of the following interventions have been shown to be effec-tive in preventing HIV infection: increased condom use,treatment of sexually transmitted infections, reduction inthe number of sexual partners, safe injections, and drugs toprevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV (Merson, Dayton, and O'Reilly 2000). If HIV control programs canencourage the use of, or provide greater access to, theseinterventions, we can expect concomitant reductions in theburden of HIV-related TB. However, in a comparative mod-eling analysis of DOTS and various other strategies to con-trol TB and HIV-related TB, incidence and death rates werefar more sensitive to improvements in TB case detection andcure than to the introduction of TB preventive therapy andARV therapy, even when rates of HIV infection are high(figure 13.7) (Currie et al. 2003). Although ARV therapy can prevent TB by preserving or restoring immunity, early therapy plus high levels of cover- age and compliance will be needed to avert a significantfraction of TB cases (figure 13.8). The reason is that TBemerges as an AIDS-related illness at a median CD4 /H11001cell count of about 250 per micrometer (Williams and Dye 2003). Beginning ARV therapy at 200 per microliter in the absence of an AIDS-related illness (WHO 2003) means that a high proportion of HIV-infected people that are destinedto develop TB will progress to active disease before they areoffered ARV therapy. Nonetheless, ARV therapy could greatly extend the lives of HIV-infected TB patients, and thediagnosis of TB could provide an important entry point for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Besides efficacy, we must also consider affordability and value for money. DOTS was known to be a relatively low- cost and cost-effective strategy to improve health before the emergence of HIV/AIDS (Murray et al. 1991). Amongthe diversity of interventions available under the Stop TBStrategy, the detection and treatment of active TB cases isstill the most cost-effective approach to TB control in Africa(Currie et al. 2005).

Even with 90 percent effective coverage, we can expect no more than a 20 percent reduction in incidence ifpatients begin therapy at 200 CD4+ cells per microliter (lower point, at base of arrow). Beginning at 500 CD4+ cells per microliter would prevent 40 to 60 percent of TB cases (upper point, at tip of arrow).

Prophylaxis against common intercurrent infections (for example, bacterial causes of pneumonia and diarrhea and their complications) is another way to decrease the morbidity and mortality rates of HIV- infected TB patients. Two studies in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire haveshown a beneficial effect of cotrimoxazole. One found thatthe drug reduced deaths of HIV-infected TB patients by 48 percent; the other showed a significant reduction in mor- bidity, but not mortality (Anglaret et al. 1999; Wiktor al.1999). As a result, prophylaxis has been pro-visionally recommended for HIV-infected individuals inAfrica as part of the minimum package of care (UNAIDS2001). In Malawi, voluntary counseling and HIV testingfor TB patients, with treatment including cotrimoxazole, reduced case-fatality rates by almost 20 percent comparedwith a control group (Zachariah et al. 2003). Further studiesin other sites are necessary to confirm and evaluate thebenefits and the duration of effectiveness, and the feasibilityof using cotrimoxazole under routine conditions. CONCLUSION Before HIV infection and AIDS emerged and spread in Africa, TB incidence rates were typically under 100 per100,000 persons per year and falling. HIV has turned a slow decline into a rapid resurgence, especially in eastern and southern Africa. However, the worst HIV epidemics are nowalmost certainly decelerating, and even turning downward insome countries (UNAIDS and WHO 2005). Because the interval between HIV infection and the onset of TB is four to six years, we can expect TB incidence rates to continueincreasing for some years in some African countries. But weare now, at least, in a position to evaluate the maximum sizeof the TB problem created by HIV in Africa. Beyond peak TB 190 | Christopher Dye, Anthony D. Harries, Dermot Maher, S. Mehran Hosseini, Wilfred Nkhoma, and Felix M. Salaniponiincidence rates, the future of TB in Africa will remain unpre- dictable as long as the direction of HIV epidemics is alsounknown. Will the significant reduction in HIV infection documented in Uganda (Parkhurst 2002) be replicated across eastern and southern Africa? Or can we expect HIV infectionrates in other countries to stabilize at close to peak levels? As the spread of HIV infection and AIDS adds to the com- plexity of health care, studies that can identify the limitingfactors in TB control will have great value. The national TBprogram managers of some African countries haveattempted to identify the main constraints to improvingtheir program's performance (WHO 2006), but the list inbox 13.2 needs to be refined, quantified, and customized fordifferent countries. More money is needed for TB control, as set out in the Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015 (Stop TBPartnership and WHO 2006) but money is not the onlyessential commodity. The mechanisms to identify other nec-essary materials and processes will include better analyses ofthe abundant surveillance data that have already been col-lected by national TB programs. Good operational research,which need not be costly or complex, will also suggest waysto improve the performance of the programs. For example,following investigations in several African countries, it isnow clear that community-based care can give, under a widerange of circumstances, satisfactory treatment results atlower cost (Floyd et al. 2003; Moalosi et al. et al. 2003; Sinanovic 2003). Pragmatic fieldstudies must continue to explore better ways of using thecurrent tools for TB control as new vaccines, drugs, anddiagnostics begin to emerge from laboratories. Whatever the impact of HIV on TB in the next few years, African countries will continue to need vigorous TB control programs that fully implement the new Stop TB Strategy,founded on DOTS. Even with high rates of HIV infection,DOTS implementation is relatively cheap and cost-effective.Box 13.2 Main Constraints to Improving TB Control, as Identified by National Program Managers in Africa Most important constraints Insufficient number of qualified staff Inadequate preparation for decentralization as part of health system reform Failure to engage all health care providers in DOTS implementation Insufficient political commitmentOther constraints Inadequate financing Limited access to TB diagnosis and treatment Inadequate laboratory network HIV/AIDS Limited public awareness of TB Deficiencies in drug supply Source: WHO (2006) and preceding annual reports in the same series.Other methods for the prevention and treatment of HIV and AIDS will be needed too, but they should be introduced in ways that will be complementary to DOTS. Tuberculosis and HIV control programs now clearly have mutual con-cerns: the prevention of HIV infection and the treatment ofAIDS should be components of TB control, and TB careand prevention should be priorities in the management of HIV/AIDS. Until recently, TB programs and HIV/AIDS pro- grams have pursued separate courses. They can no longerafford to do so. REFERENCES Ackah, A. N., D. Coulibaly, H. Digbeu, K. Diallo, K. M.Vetter, I. M.

Tuberculosis | 193195Plasmodium falciparum is the most common of the four human malaria parasites across much of Sub-Saharan Africa. (The other three parasites are P. v ivax ,P. malariae, and P. ovale .) The distribution of P. v ivax is concentrated in the Horn of Africa, covering Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan. P. falciparum accounts for almost all the malaria mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa, and it is often stated that the continent bears over 90 percent of the globalP. falciparum burden. Recent bioinformatics analysis of changes in human ecology suggest that about 6,000 yearsago, P. falciparum populations expanded rapidly in Africa and spread worldwide, coincident with human populationgrowth and subsequent diasporas facilitated by the dawn ofagriculture (Joy et al. 2003). This parasite has exacted a heavy mortality toll on Africa's population, evidenced by theselection for several human survival mechanisms, such asthe genetic polymorphisms associated with red cell struc-ture and function (Hill 1992). Malaria infection is common in Sub-Saharan Africa, but death directly attributed to the parasite is comparativelyrare, largely because of acquired functional immunity.Unlike the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and theacquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or tubercu-losis, infection with the malaria parasite is almost always universal in a population, and the presence of the pathogenis not a sufficient marker of disease. Individuals who diefrom malaria represent the public health costs of develop-ing immunity at a population level. These deaths are concentrated among those with poorly developed immuni-ty, and, generally, young children bear the brunt of themortality burden. Individuals born into areas of stableP. falciparum transmission frequently acquire and clear infections without becoming ill, but most will, at some stage in their lives, develop an overt clinical response to infection, often manifested as fever. These clinical eventsmay lead to severe complications, which may resolve natu-rally, require medical intervention, or result in death. Figure 14.1 shows a typical age-structured series of risks ofinfection, mild clinical disease, severe disease, and deathdue to P. falciparum for a population living on the Kenyan coast (Snow and Gilles 2002). Many individuals naturally acquire functional immune responses to severe disease anddeath early in life; immunity to the milder consequencesof infection occurs later in childhood, but the ability tosterilize blood-stage infection probably does not occuruntil adulthood.Chapter14 Malaria Robert W. Snow and Judy A. OmumboThe relation between the frequency of parasite exposure and disease outcome is complex. The speed with which a population acquires functional immunity to the severe con-sequences of P. falciparum infection depends on the fre- quency of parasite exposure from birth as measured by the intensity of parasite transmission in a given locality (seeSnow and Marsh 2002). The shape of the severe disease andmortality curves shown in figure 14.1 may therefore beshifted to the right for areas where parasite transmission isof low, stable intensity and to the left for areas where trans-mission is of high, stable intensity. Where infection is rarethe risk of mortality is likely to be directly related to the riskof infection, because acquired functional immunity isunlikely to affect health outcomes. Understanding this relationship is important for defining the age-specificmortality burdens in Sub-Saharan Africa, an area able to support infection rates ranging from one infection everythree years to hundreds of new infections per year (Hayet al. 2000). In addition to the morbidity and mortality directly attributed to P. falciparum, other consequential and indirect effects are linked to each step of the infection and disease process. Chronic, subclinical infections cause anemia ormay encourage undernutrition, which in turn may increasesusceptibility to severe clinical outcomes of subsequent malarial or other pathogenetic infection. During pregnancy,asymptomatic infection of the placenta significantly reducesbirthweights and infant survival rates. Patients who survivesevere disease may be left with debilitating sequelae, such asspasticity or epilepsy. Subtler consequences include behav-ioral disturbances or cognitive impairment (Holding and Snow 2001; Holding and Wekulo 2004). These combined effects are summarized in figure 14.2. In the absence ofmeasures aimed at reducing the risk of infection, the risksshown in figure 14.2 largely depend on extrinsic factors,such as those that determine the speed with which a popu-lation develops acquired immunity and the access to effec-tive case management, and on intrinsic factors, such as hostgenetics.

It also considers the evidence for consequential and indirect mortality and describes P. falciparum as a risk factor for rather than a cause of pediatric mortality. The chapter concludes with a description of the relationship betweenpoverty and malaria and recent trends in malaria mortalityin Sub-Saharan Africa to provide some context for current international efforts to halve the malaria burden by the year 2010 (Nabarro and Taylor 1998). PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM DISTRIBUTION IN AFRICA Climate, local ecology, and active control affect the ability of malaria parasites and their anopheline mosquito vectors tocoexist long enough to enable transmission. The frequency of transmission, or endemicity, depends on the density and infectivity of anopheline vectors. These features depend ona range of climatic, physical, and population characteristics,for example, rainfall, location of human settlements near or at rivers or other mosquito larval breeding sites, and the density of human populations in a village. The most signif-icant determinant of the intensity of parasite transmission isclimate. Climate Determinants of P . falciparum Transmission in Africa The development of both the vector and parasite is temper- ature dependent. The optimum temperature range for par-asite development in the female Anopheles (sporogony) is between 25\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C, and development ceases below 16\u00b0C. Intermittent low temperatures delay sporogony, and the period immediately after the infective bite by the mos-quito on an infected human host is the most sensitive todrops in temperature. Above 35\u00b0C sporogony slows downconsiderably. Extremely high temperatures are associatedwith the development of smaller and less fecund adult mos-quitoes. Thermal death of mosquitoes occurs at 40\u00b0C to42\u00b0C. Altitude and temperature are strongly correlated: withevery 100-meter increase in altitude, the temperature dropsby 0.5\u00b0C. Overall, the use of altitude as a marker of endemic- ity or disease risk is vague, yet there is a tendency within theliterature to refer to highland malaria in East Africa and the Horn of Africa. Numerous studies have demonstrated the association between Anopheles gambiae sensus lato (the most important vector of P. falciparum in Africa) abundance and rainfall. Without surface water the female Anopheles cannot lay eggs.Rainfall is also related to humidity and saturation deficit,both affecting mosquito survival (adult vector longevityincreases with humidities over 60 percent). Mapping Malaria Risks Using the climatic determinants of transmission identified above, the Mapping Malaria in Africa Project (http://www.mara.co.za) developed a series of risk maps for stableP. falciparum transmission across the continent (Craig, Snow, and le Sueur 1999). In brief, the project used long- term mean monthly temperature and rainfall data to definethe limits of distribution of stable endemic malaria acrossAfrica. T emperature and rainfall profiles in sample areas,where malaria endemicity was known, were translated intoa model of \"climate suitability.\" The temperature limits wererelated to the requirements for the extrinsic parasite devel-opment cycle. The model made the following assumptions:(a) the optimal temperature range was 18\u00b0C to 22\u00b0C;(b) optimal rainfall values were greater than or equal to 80 millimeters; (c) conditions of rainfall and temperaturehad to coincide on a month-to-month basis for at least fiveconsecutive months (three months for the northern fringesof Sub-Saharan Africa); and finally, (d) a frost factor (meanmonthly minimum temperature of less than 5\u00b0C for any onemonth) was used to eliminate transmission at any point.The model provided fuzzy climate suitability (FCS) values,ranging from zero (unsuitable, hence malaria absent) to one(very suitable, malaria endemic). During earlier attempts to describe the malaria burden in Sub-Saharan Africa the climate suitability maps for P. falci- parum transmission were combined with interpolated maps of population distribution (Deichmann 1996; Snow et al.1999). The population data were initially constructed usingpopulation totals from the last available censuses for admin-istrative units (communities, towns, or districts). These datawere then converted into a regular raster grid of populationtotals, and auxiliary information was used to distribute thepopulation within the administrative unit across its rastergrid cells. The process heuristically incorporated informa-tion on where people tend to live: in or close to towns andcities, close to transportation infrastructure, around pro-tected areas, near water bodies, and not at very high eleva-tions. Using the Geographical Information System (GIS)-based information on the location and size of towns andcities, roads, railroads, navigable rivers, and uninhabitableareas, population density was weighted, a high value imply-ing a high density and a low or zero value implying low Malaria | 197or no population. These weights were then used to proportionately distribute population to grid cells. The dig- ital map extracted population distributions according to each cell in a regular raster grid with a resolution of 5 kilo-meters at the equator. It was then combined with the mapsof malaria risk to provide simple population totals of thoseexposed to stable, unstable, or no malaria risk. The P. falciparum risk-to-population distribution for Africa has subsequently been refined through use of animproved link between mortality data and transmissionintensity (Snow et al. 2003). New criteria were adopted fol- lowing an improved understanding of the variations in dis- ease outcomes and risks congruent with variations in stableP. falciparum transmission. The relation between the exact number of new infections a population is exposed to each year (annual entomological inoculation rates, or EIR) andparasite prevalence is nonlinear, but quartiles of the preva-lence of infection have been shown to approximate loga-rithmic increases in the EIR (Beier, Killeen, and Githure1999). This principle has been used previously to categorizepediatric malaria and all-cause mortality according to para-site prevalence estimates from childhood cross-sectionalsurveys (Snow, Korenromp, and Gouws 2004; Snow andMarsh, 2002). When infection prevalence quartiles (lessthan 25 percent, 25 to 49 percent, 50 to 74 percent, and 75 percent and greater) are used, mortality indicators satu-rate at the highest two classes of endemicity and rise sharplyfrom the x-y intercept within the first class. Analysis of 217independent parasitological surveys among children inKenya suggests that most areas (81 percent) with a FCSvalue of less than 0.75 are represented by communities sup-porting parasite prevalence rates of less than 25 percent(Omumbo et al. 2004). It seems appropriate, therefore, todistribute the population of Sub-Saharan Africa into areasof no risk, unstable transmission risk, low stable risk, andmoderate to high stable endemic risk. The fuzzy membership model developed by Craig, Snow, and le Sueur (1999) was used to delineate four ecologically distinct areas of Africa (figure 14.3). First, there are areaswith no human settlement, or FCS values of zero (class 1).Some countries have minimal and only very localized risksof malaria transmission, with over 90 percent of their pop-ulation residing in class 1 areas, the western Sahara region(Algeria, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Lesotho, Libya,Morocco, and Tunisia). It is assumed that these countrieshave a negligible malaria burden; thus, they are excludedfrom the Sub-Saharan Africa malaria burden estimations.Second, areas with marginal risks of malaria transmissionare represented by a FCS greater than zero but less than 0.25(class 2). Parasite prevalence rates are likely to be extremelylow or zero; however, these populations often border areasof higher infection risk and may be subject to aberrations inclimate that lead to localized transmission. Third, in someareas populations are exposed to a FCS value between 0.25and 0.75 (class 3). Communities living in these areas arelikely to support cross-sectional parasite prevalence esti-mates in childhood of less than 25 percent, and transmissionis likely to be acutely seasonal with a tendency toward epi-demics. In practice it would be hard to distinguish betweenclasses 2 and 3 in many areas of Sub-Saharan Africa outsideof southern Africa, and therefore they are grouped togetherhere. Finally, some areas of the continent have stable endem-ic malaria transmission (FCS greater than or equal to 0.75),which may still vary seasonally, but support parasite preva-lence rates greater than or equal to 25 percent (class 4). Insouthern Africa (Botswana, Namibia, South Africa,Swaziland, and Zimbabwe) a different approach was taken,because classes 2 and 3 represent the historical extents oftransmission and do not reflect contemporary distributionsof risk (M. Craig, personal communication). Class 4 areasare the only areas where malaria still poses a risk, and itsextent and transmission potential are determined by 198 | Robert W. Snow and Judy A.

The combined malaria-risk and population models were used to estimate populations resi-dent in each malaria-risk class by using country-level dataavailable from the World Population Prospects PopulationDatabase (United Nations Population Division 2001). The summed extractions for the continent are shown intable 14.1. The current distribution maps of P. falciparum depend entirely on the biotic effects of climate on transmission. They fail to capture the more localized yet marked effects,such as urbanization and localized control. The Anopheles gambiae complex is less prolific in urban areas because there are fewer appropriate breeding sites. People living in urban areas are on average 10 times less likely to receive an infective bite than their rural counterparts (Hay et al. 2000;Robert et al. 2003; Trape et al. 1992). In 2000, 38 percent ofAfrica's population were urban dwellers (United NationsPopulation Division 2001). The current estimations ofpopulations at risk under different endemicity conditions(table 14.1) will overrepresent those in the higher-riskclasses. New satellite imagery makes it possible to map theextent of land use, land cover, and urbanization, a refine-ment important for subsequent iterations of the diseaseburden models for Sub-Saharan Africa (Hay et al. 2005). Several aggressive, and highly successful, vector control programs in Africa have had significant effects upon trans- mission (Bradley 1991; Le Sueur, Sharp, and Appleton1993). More recently, such countries as South Africa andMozambique have successfully reduced or eliminatedtransmission in areas that are currently classified as prone totransmission (Barnes and Folb 2003; LSDI 2001). It will never be possible to account for all local vector controlactivities on a continent-wide map, but it is important to recognize that because current estimations of disease bur- den will be overestimated. Other important factors that determine localized trans- mission intensity are currently not captured in the climate- driven models shown in figure 14.3. These include wide-spread use of insecticide-treated bednets, leading to adecrease in local parasite transmission in only a few areas ofSub-Saharan Africa; drug resistance, leading to increasedparasite transmission carriage; population displacementdue to conflict or resettlement, altering transmission char-acteristics of newly settled areas; man-made ecological changes, such as deforestation; and agricultural practices,such as rice-field cultivation, that change the breeding siteavailability for local mosquito vector populations. Moredetailed models of malaria risk in Mali and Kenya haveincluded some of these factors on more recent maps(Kleinschmidt et al. 2001; Snow et al. 1998). However, atpresent these more complex models are not available at acontinental scale. Finally, because population estimates in the United Nations Population Division's figures are based on estima-tions incorporating assumptions about fertility and mortal-ity in a country, these totals may differ from the total popu-lations in each administrative unit reported by the country.More refined microcensus data or models of populationprojections below the national level are required for futuremapping of disease burdens.

The database also provided the estimated proportion of the population age less than 5 years, 5-14 years, and 15 years or older and the crude birth rate (CBR). The CBR was used to estimat e the approximate number of live births in 2000. The residents of Comoros, R\u00e9union, and the Seychelles are assumed to be at negligible malaria risk and during the burden estima tions formed part of the excluded Sub-Saharan Africa populations. Conversely it seems reasonable to assume that the islands of Cape Verde and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe are subject to stable transmi ssion; however, they have proved difficult to characterize at effective resolutions using the GIS malaria risk models, and their small contribution to populations at risk (less than 0.5 million peopl e) have not been included.Table 14.1 Populations at Risk During 2000 (thousands)DIRECT MALARIA MORTALITY Malaria is often difficult to diagnose on a purely clinical basis. Fever is common to almost every infectious disease,and the severe pathology caused by P. falciparum, such as aci- dosis, anemia, and altered consciousness, are alsocomplications of other infections. When a person is ill, demonstrating the presence of malaria infection increasesthe likelihood that symptoms are directly due to the infec-tion, but the high prevalence of asymptomatic infections makes it difficult to exclude other diagnoses. Our earlier understanding of the pathophysiology of malaria derivedfrom clinical descriptions among adults in Southeast Asiaand only recently have the mechanisms of death been moreprecisely defined for pediatric African populations (Marshet al. 1995; Warrell 2002). Several detailed clinical studies in African hospital settings have described the principal, some-times overlapping, routes to a fatal outcome. These includecerebral involvement from sequestered infection in the vas-culature of the brain, metabolic disturbances, respiratorydistress, and severe anemia. For epidemiological purposes itis convenient to define two major syndromes, cerebralmalaria (CM) and severe malarial anemia (SMA). CM is acondition in which patients present in coma with severalunderlying causes, ranging from a primarily neurologicalcondition to a systemic metabolic disturbance (Marsh andSnow 1999; Newton and Krishna 1998). Severe anemia is a pathology of life-threatening malaria with a complex etiolo- gy combining rapid hemolysis during acute infection or aslow insidious process compounded by antimalarial drugresistance. SMA is a life-threatening condition in young chil-dren and often warrants blood transfusion. Measuring Malaria-Specific Mortality Africa presents an epidemiological challenge, because although it has high mortality rates, existing vital registra-tion systems are not reliable or comprehensive. Most deathsoccur outside the formal health service, and national gov-ernment systems of civil registration in Sub-Saharan Africa are incomplete. Epidemiologists interested in definingmalaria-specific mortality have established demographicsurveillance systems (DSS) of large populations (between20,000 and 100,000 people) to prospectively monitor popu-lation migration, births, and deaths (INDEPTH Network2002; Smith and Morrow 1996). The attribution of causes of death during DSS surveys is often performed through a verbal autopsy (V A) interviewwith bereaved relatives about symptoms and signs associatedwith the terminal illness. The V A details are either reviewed by a panel of clinicians or subjected to diagnostic algo- rithms. The sensitivity and specificity of V A diagnosis formalaria as a cause of death have been estimated in sevenhospital-based validation studies in Africa. There is consid-erable variation in both the specificity (77 to 100 percent)and the sensitivity (45 to 75 percent) (Korenromp et al.2003). The sensitivity of verbal autopsies for malaria willdepend on the intensity of malaria transmission: in high- transmission areas, severe malaria is more likely to present as SMA than as CM (Snow et al. 1997a). SMA in a young childis often difficult to distinguish from acute respiratory infec-tions (ARI), although CM among older children is lessambiguous. Similarly, the sensitivity and specificity of verbal autopsies for malaria will vary with the local spectrum of other diseases. ARI, acute gastroenteritis, and meningitis allshare common clinical features with malaria, includingcough, difficulties in breathing, diarrhea, or cerebral dys-function. Despite these limitations, the V A-diagnosed risksof malaria mortality represent our only source of contem-porary information on the direct, fatal consequences ofinfection in areas with stable transmission in Africa. The data presented in this chapter derive largely from the Burden of Malaria in Africa (BOMA) project, supported by the Wellcome Trust, United Kingdom, and the Bill &Melinda Gates Foundation. The BOMA project began in1998 and has completed a comprehensive search for pub-lished and unpublished empirical measures of malaria mor-bidity, disability, and death. The data include historicalaccounts of mortality from colonial administration recordsand detailed descriptions of recent DSS surveys. Details ofthe search methods and applications of the data arepresented elsewhere (Snow, Korenromp, and Gouws 2004;Snow and Marsh 2002; Snow, Trape, and Marsh 2001). The estimates of malaria-specific mortality in childhood outsideof southern Africa use only mortality reports based on a V Awithin a DSS framework after 1989. This time restrictionwas made because of recent temporal changes in pediatric risks of mortality from malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa (see\"Trends in Malaria Mortality\" section). Where DSS and V Amethods were used during community or household ran-domized intervention trials, only control communities were included. In order to structure risks according to transmis- sion classes shown in table 14.1, DSS surveys of malaria-specific mortality were also limited only to those in whichthere was a congruent estimation of malaria transmissionintensity. Adult malaria-specific mortality data from DSS sites are rare, and V A methods have not been well developed nor 200 | Robert W. Snow and Judy A. Omumbowidely validated for the description of malaria deaths in this group. At Kilifi, Kenya, in the absence of obvious signs of respiratory disease an algorithm was used based on detailed exclusion criteria (for example, well-defined deaths orhospital-diagnosed conditions) involving an acute febrileevent (R. W. Snow, unpublished data). In Tanzania a similarapproach was used (Y. Hemed, personal communication). Both approaches are likely to overestimate the number of adult deaths from malaria in endemic areas. Owing to thepaucity of empirical data in this age group, these two con-temporary estimates have been included with other sources of historical data on adult malaria mortality from detailed, preindependence civil registration systems when causes ofdeath were investigated by medical personnel from circum- scribed, censused populations. It seems reasonable toassume that under stable transmission conditions adultmortality from malaria is unlikely to have changed muchover time, as deaths would normally occur in individualswho, for some ill-defined reasons, failed to acquire func-tional immunity in childhood or lost their functionalimmune response. The intention has been to attempt, wherepossible, to fill an important data gap using imperfect data,and therefore the risks reported must be interpreted withcaution. Civil and vital registration systems in southern Africa are more comprehensive than those in other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. Data from southern Africa, however, also underreport events and must be viewed as minimum esti-mates. Data have been extracted from reports provided dur-ing subregional malaria control program meetings andmalaria deaths (reported only for all age groups combined) and expressed per projected population estimates foradministrative areas of known malaria risk (figure 14.3).Data were available for the three areas of KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa, seven areas of Botswana, fourareas of Namibia, and eight areas of Zimbabwe. The spatial coordinates of the study location were used to identify a time and location-specific estimate of infectionprevalence for the geographical areas covered by the mortality data. Data were identified primarily through the MARA/ARMA database (http://www.MARA/ARMA.or.za) or correspondence with authors of original data on thedisease burden. The estimates of malaria risk have been usedto provide empirical ecological categorization for eachdata point in accordance with the cartography of riskdescribed in figure 14.3 and table 14.1. Median andinterquartile ranges (IQR) have been used to describe therisk data per malaria risk class (table 14.2), and theestimated numbers of deaths directly attributed to P. falciparum in 2000 are shown in table 14.3 according to populations at various continental risk classes shown intable 14.1.

For southern Africa, the figures in the first column include all age groups.Table 14.2 Median and Interquartile Ranges of Malaria-Specific Mortality Estimates per 1,000 People per YearEmpirical Estimates of Malaria-Specific Mortality by Age Twelve independent estimates of malaria mortality among children under five years living under conditions of stabletransmission were used from DSS sites in Burundi, TheGambia, Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Tanzania.The median malaria-specific mortality rate among these communities was 9.33 per 1,000 children per year and rep-resented 28.2 percent of all mortality among children underfive. Under similar transmission conditions the medianmalaria-specific mortality among older children, age 5 to14 years, was 1.58 per 1,000 per year (from 10 study sites),representing 52.2 percent of all deaths in this age group.Among adult populations surveyed as part of colonialadministration civil registration systems or recent DSS sitesin stable endemic areas, the median malaria mortality rates were 0.6 per 1,000 per year (15 reports), or 6 percent of alldeaths among populations age 15 years or older. There are few DSS or colonial administration civil regis- tration data from low, stable endemic or epidemic condi-tions (parasite rate less than 25 percent; classes 2 and 3) out-side southern Africa. Approximations to the DSS from thepopulations of a tea estate in the highlands of Kenya(Shanks and Snow, unpublished data) and a settled refugeecamp in Sudan (Charlwood et al. 2001) provided data onmalaria-specific mortality rates among censused childhoodpopulations at low risk of malaria infection. In addition, theone true DSS site at Hai district in Tanzania provided a V Aestimate of malaria mortality (Government of Tanzania1997). All three studies covered periods after 1990. Only theKenyan and Tanzanian studies provided information onolder children and adults. Rather than being used to providea median estimate from the limited data, the combinedperson-years of observation (PYO) and malaria deaths havebeen used to define direct risks of death from malariaunder these transmission conditions. For children underfive years the overall mortality rate was 2.62 per 1,000 peryear (three studies); for children age 5 to 14 years themortality rate was 0.94 per 1,000 per year (two studies); and for adults age 15 years and over the rate was 0.71 per 1,000per year (two studies). An ongoing rural DSS site at Agincourt, South Africa (Kahn et al. 1999), located at the fringes of malaria risk (Brink 1958), also provided additional data. A malaria-specific mortality rate of 0.065 per 1,000 per year (2 out of216 deaths) was measured among children under five yearsbetween 1992 and 1995. Of the 785 deaths recorded in thepopulation older than five years of age, only one was attrib-uted to malaria. This single estimate is an inadequate rep-resentation of the malaria mortality across southern Africa.The civil registration data in malaria-risk districts of south-ern Africa suggest that the median estimate of malaria- specific mortality among the entire population in theseareas was 0.13 per 1,000 per year. Although these estimatesrepresent minimal approximations of the true mortalityburden, they fall within the ranges of mortality describedfor the single DSS site (Kahn et al. 1999) and those sitesdescribed in the more detailed analysis of malaria mortali-ty data from civil registers in two districts of KwaZulu-Natal Province between 1996 and 1999: 0.02 to 0.52 per1,000 people per year (Tsoka, Sharp, and Kleinschmidt2002). Overall malaria-specific mortality in children is approxi- mately 3.5 times higher in areas of stable endemic transmis- sion than in areas of low intensity, stable, or epidemic-pronemalaria in Sub-Saharan Africa, excluding southern Africa.Mortality declines rapidly with increasing age, and this isespecially striking under conditions of stable endemic trans-mission. The mortality rates for all ages from P. falciparum in southern Africa are considerably lower than those describedfor the rest of Africa, reflecting a low risk of infection com-bined with effective control. Even with the use of all the toolsdescribed earlier in this chapter, approximately 1.14 millionpeople might have died in Sub-Saharan Africa as a directconsequence of infection with P. falciparum in 2000. 202 | Robert W.

Nonintervention-related consequences of clinical events also include the short- and long-termresidual impairments resulting from cerebral malaria. Adverse Drug Reactions to Commonly Used Antimalarial Drugs Drugs used to manage malarial fevers have adverse effects. We can assume that most of the severe adverse drug-relatedevents are described as direct mortality during DSS V Astudies, as they are likely to occur close to the febrile event.They are mentioned here, however, to emphasize that fevers are common in Africa and the use of antimalarial drugs isprolific. Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are likely to increasewith the greater use of new, more complex drug combina-tions and agents, although the increase of ADR will proba-bly never surpass the alternative of using ineffective drugs.There have been too few epidemiological studies of thehuman toxicity of many antimalarial drugs among Africanpopulations repeatedly exposed to these compounds. Mostdata derive from an examination of chemoprophylactic drug use among nonimmune travelers (Philips-Howardand Bjorkman 1990; Philips-Howard and West 1990). Themajority of adverse reactions due to sulfonamides and4-aminoquinolines are idiosyncratic. Severe adverse reac-tions to the commonly available antimalarial drugs inAfrica, when used as recommended, include severe cuta-neous reactions (Stevens-Johnson It has been estimated that 2,350 deathswere probably caused by treatment rather than the diseaseitself in a single year among the children outside of south-ern Africa (Snow et al. 2003). Anemia, Transfusion, and HIV Severe anemia is a common feature of children hospitalized with complicated malaria. Transfusion is a common pedi-atric practice in Africa and adherence to guidelines for trans-fusion are often poor (English et al. 2004; Lackritz et al.1992). Greenberg and colleagues (1988) examined the HIVand malaria status of 167 admissions of children to an emer- gency ward at the Mama Y emo Hospital in Kinshasa, theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. The authors propose anunadjusted odds ratio for acquired HIV infection of 3.5 formalaria patients between 1 month and 12 years of age trans-fused once, 21.5 for those transfused twice, and 43.0 for those transfused three times during a single admission. In a study of transfusion practices in 1994 at six government hospitalsin Kenya, Moore and colleagues (2001) calculated a 2 percentrisk of transmission of HIV antibody positive blood fromscreened donations through blood transfusion to HIV- negative patients. This study did not include the risk from pre-seroconversion donations, nor did it allow for the sensi-tivity of test kits or the use of unscreened blood. The proba-bility that an HIV antibody negative unit of blood is HIVinfected has been estimated to be between 0.5 and 1.1 percent(Savarit et al. 1992). The probability of seroconversion fol-lowing HIV-contaminated blood is assumed to be 96 percent(Colebunders et al. 1991). From estimates of hospitalizedpatients with severe malaria anemia, transfusion rates, andrelative risks of seroconversion from HIV-infected blooddonation, it has been estimated that between 5,000 and 8,000children might become infected with HIV each year as aconsequence of poor management of their malaria in thehospital (Snow et al. 2003). Neurological Disability Associated with Severe Malaria The case-fatality rate of cerebral malaria in most hospital settings is high, often over 30 percent (Newton and Krishna1998). Prolonged coma and seizures are associated withneurological impairment in survivors. The immediate andprolonged sequelae associated with CM among African chil- dren includes hemiparesis, quadriparesis or severe deficit,hearing and visual impairments, speech and language and nonverbal construction difficulties, behavioral problems,and epilepsy (Mung'ala-Odera, Snow, and Newton 2004).These impairments are estimated to occur in about 4,000children each year in Sub-Saharan Africa. Those with severe deficits have a higher mortality risk soon after the disease event. For less dramatic impairments,such as epilepsy, increased mortality rates have been described (Coleman, Loppy, and Walraven 2002; Jillek-Alland Rwiza 1992; Snow, Mung'ala, et al. 1994). In Westerncountries, the risk of premature mortality could be as highas two to three times that described in age-comparablegroups without epilepsy (Cockerell et al. 1994; Hauser,Annegers, and Elveback 1980; Zielinski 1974), but in Africathe risk could be as high as nine times (Coleman, Loppy, and Walraven 2002). This is likely to be caused by poorly man- aged epilepsy resulting in status epilepticus or accidents, such as drowning or burns. INDIRECT MORTALITY Indirect consequences of P. falciparum infection include anemia (unless anemia is linked to acute high-density parasitemia as a direct cause), low birthweight, growth retardation, or undernutrition. In addition, malaria infec-tion can increase the severity of other comorbid infectious diseases through immune suppression or enhanced invasivecapacities across physical barriers to infection (for example,blood and tissue). Previous approaches to the global burdenof disease have assumed that each death must be attributedto a single cause and can be fitted into the fixed disease-mixmatrix of all causes (Murray and Lopez 1997). During randomized controlled intervention trials aimed at reducing the incidence of infection (but not 100 percent protective), the all-cause mortality of children is often reduced more than would be attributed by V A diagnosis ofmalaria. For example, in Kilifi the proportion of deaths ofchildren under five years attributed to malaria by V A was 34percent (R. W. Snow, unpublished data). During a random-ized controlled trial of insecticide-treated bednets in thesame area, the incidence of malaria infection was reduced by50 percent (Snow et al. 1996), which was sufficient to reduceall-cause mortality by 33 percent (Nevill et al. 1996). Moredramatically, in The Gambia, insecticide-treated bednetsreduced all-cause mortality by over 60 percent, and yet theV A-diagnosed contribution of malaria to all-cause mortali- ty among control populations was only 16 percent (Alonsoet al. 1993). This has led some to speculate that malariainfection is a contributor to broad causes of mortalitybeyond the direct fatal consequences of infection(Molineaux 1997). Attempts have been made to distinguish between factors that affect the direct outcomes of malaria infection and the effects of malaria infection on the outcome of other healthburdens. This is particularly important when the interactionbetween malaria and HIV or undernutrition is considered.Especially important is the role malaria infection plays as arisk for the extended, indirect consequences of infectionon the public health burden posed by P. falciparum .A recent model relates infection prevalence to all-cause pedi-atric mortality outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa (Snow,Korenromp, and Gouws 2004). The model regards P. falci- parum infection as a risk factor for all-cause mortality rather than attempting to directly estimate malaria's contribution to all-cause mortality (one cause, one death). Malaria during Pregnancy Despite a poor understanding of the precise mechanisms of pathology (Menendez 1995), the morbid outcomes of malaria infection during pregnancy have been well described (Brabin 1983; Guyatt 1996; Steketee et al. 2001). In endemic settings in Africa, pregnant women expe-rience relatively little malaria-specific morbidity (for exam-ple, fever) but do have increased risk of infection and higherdensity parasitemia leading to anemia and placental seques-tration of the parasite. These effects operate across a broaderrange of endemicities used to describe morbid and fatalrisks among nonpregnant populations (that is, areas cov-ered by classes 3 and 4 shown in figure 14.1). Maternalanemia has been shown to be an important contributor to maternal mortality with a relative risk for mortality of 1.35for moderate anemia and 3.51 for severe anemia (Brabin,Hakimi, and Pelletier 2001). Brabin and colleagues furtherestimate that malaria contributes to maternal anemia andthat 9 percent of anemia-associated maternal mortality canbe attributed to malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa; this figurepredicts approximately 5,300 maternal deaths annuallyfrom malaria anemia in areas of Sub-Saharan Africa outsideof southern Africa classified as classes 3 and 4. Prematurity and low birthweight (less than 2,500 grams) are associated with maternal malaria, including the contri- bution from both malaria-associated maternal anemia andplacental infection. The contribution of malaria duringpregnancy to low birthweight and subsequent mortality inthe first year of life has been estimated to range from 3 to8 percent of infant mortality (Greenwood et al. 1992;Steketee, Wirima, Hightower et al. 1996; Steketee et al.2001). If this range had been applied to the expected num-bers of live births in 2000 among populations in lowendemic, epidemic prone, and endemic malaria areas ofSub-Saharan Africa outside of southern Africa, there mayhave been between 71,000 and 190,000 infant deaths indi-rectly attributable to malaria in pregnancy. In very low endemic settings or areas where malaria is epidemic prone and in southern Africa, malaria in nonim-mune pregnant women can be devastating and lead tomaternal death and abortion. For example, in urban 204 | Robert W. Snow and Judy A. OmumboMalaria | 205Mozambique, 15.5 percent of all maternal deaths in one hospital over a five-year period were attributed directly to malaria (Granja et al. 1998). In an epidemic-prone setting of Ethiopia, maternal malaria carried an approximately eight-fold increased risk of abortion (R. Newman, unpublisheddata). Similarly, in a low-endemicity setting in SoutheastAsia even single malaria infections were associated with increased risk of low birthweight (Luxemburger et al. 2001). Malaria and Anemia Anemia among African children is a hematological state determined by combinations of nutritional deficiencies(iron, folic acid, other micronutrients, and protein-calorie malnutrition), iron loss through helminth infection, red cell destruction, red cell production decreased by infectious dis- eases, and the genetic constitution of red cell hemoglobin (Menendez, Fleming, and Alonso 2000; Nussenblatt and Semba 2002). Malaria has long been recognized as a majorcontributor to anemia in children, reducing hemoglobinconcentrations through several mechanisms. The primarymechanism increases rates of destruction and removal of redblood cells and decreases the rate of erythrocyte productionin the bone marrow. Other mechanisms are associated withacute clinical states (for example, hemolysis or cytokine dis- turbances), whereas chronic or repeated infections are morelikely to involve dyserythropoiesis (Menendez, Fleming andAlonso 2000). Data from randomized controlled trials ofmalaria-specific interventions to reduce the incidence of newinfections through insecticide-treated bednets or the preva-lence of blood-stage chemoprophylaxisor intermittent presumptive treatment suggest a halving ofanemia risks through intervention (Korenromp et al. 2004).This substantial reduction in the risks of anemia demon-strates the importance of P. falciparum in maintaining the poor hematological health of children. This finding, howev- er, cannot be extrapolated to subsequent morbid or fatal con-sequences, because few detailed prospective studies focus ondescribing the effects of reduced hemoglobin concentrationson health outcomes. Malaria and Undernutrition It has been postulated that nutritional status is related to the threats posed by infection and disease and to the role ofinfectious disease in perpetuating undernutrition (Pelletier, Frongillo, and Habicht 1993; Pelletier et al. 1995). Most studies have generally focused on severe malnutrition andspecific nutrient deficiency, and only a few have examined the role of malaria. One striking feature of the global distri-bution of anthropometric markers of undernutrition is itscongruence with the distribution of endemic malaria.Although P. falciparum malaria and malnutrition are both highly prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa, the existence of asynergistic interaction has not been well established.Evidence from intervention trials aimed at reducing the fre-quency of new infections suggests that malaria infectionmight have some indirect effects upon the generalized nutri-tional status of African children. A study in Nigeria on theuse of chemoprophylaxis in the treatment of malaria in chil-dren showed a reduction in the incidence of infection andclinical attacks that was accompanied by a reduction in theincidence of malnutrition (Bradley-Moore et al. 1985).Improved growth among young children has more recentlybeen demonstrated in The Gambia and Kenya in studiescomparing those protected by insecticide-treated bednetswith those left unprotected (D'Allessando et al. 1995; Snowet al. 1997b; T er Kuile et al. 2003). Despite the biologicalplausibility of synergism between infection and growth, theprecise relationship between undernutrition and severemalaria continues to be difficult to quantify empiricallywithin disease burden frameworks. Malaria and HIV Interactions In Sub-Saharan Africa the HIV epidemic has been superim- posed on the long-standing malaria pandemic. The widegeographical overlap and the concurrent high prevalence ofboth HIV and malaria mean that even modest interactionscould substantially affect public health among populations exposed to both (Chandromohan and Greenwood 1998).Studies during the 1990s observed that malaria infectionwas more common and of higher parasite density in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative pregnant women in a range ofmalaria endemic settings, and in women of all gravidity, andthat those who have had multiple pregnancies were mostaffected (Parise et al. 1998; p. 405;van Eijk et al. 2001; Verhoeff et al. 1999). Additionally, two longitudinal cohort studies in Uganda and Kenya and onehospital-based case-control study in Uganda have demon-strated that HIV-infection approximately doubles the risk ofmalaria parasitemia and clinical malaria in nonpregnantadults, and isassociated with 2001; Whitworth et al. 2000). Thus,206 | Robert W. Snow and Judy A. Omumbosome evidence shows that HIV infection increases the inci- dence and severity of clinical malaria in adults. In order to define the indirect consequences of P. falci- parum it is important to know whether the high intensity of exposure to malaria infections increases the rate of pro- gression of HIV disease in Africa. In a recent study inMalawi, HIV blood viral levels were found to be seventimes higher in HIV-infected adults with acute uncompli-cated malaria than in HIV-infected blood donors withoutmalaria (Hoffman et al. 1999). As with other acute infec-tions, the increased viral burden was reversed by effectivemalaria therapy (Hoffman et al. 1999). These findings areconsistent with in vitro laboratory studies in which HIV-1replication was increased 10-fold to 100-fold in peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to soluble malaria anti-gens or malaria pigment (Xiao et al. 1998). The evidence on the potentiation of malaria by HIV or HIV by malaria is currently insufficient to quantify the specific HIV-malaria interaction risks for inclusion inmalaria burden estimates. The Combined Indirect Effects of Malaria on All-Cause Mortality The effects of malaria infection on low birthweight seem conclusive; the overall role of malaria infection on anemia isclear, but its extrapolation to indirect mortality is difficult; the effects of infection on undernutrition and HIV is at present less conclusive and impossible to enumerate. Itseems reasonable to assume that these additional conse-quential or indirect risks contribute to all-cause mortality beyond that described from estimates of the causes of death directly attributed to malaria. T o examine these conclusions and assumptions further, data on all-cause mortality of children under five from DSSstudies undertaken across a broad range of malaria transmis-sion settings in Sub-Saharan Africa were analyzed against theprevalence of P. falciparum infection at each site. Weighted least-squares regression was used to model the contiguous relationships between all-cause mortality and parasite preva-lence rates, allowing for the square of parasite prevalence (forpossible saturation of parasite prevalence), timing, location,and the sampling precision of each study (Snow, Korenromp,and Gouws 2004). The unadjusted median all-cause childmortality rate for low prevalence areas of childhood infection(less than 25 percent) was 10.9 per year per 1,000 childrenunder five (IQR 7.8-17.6). This rose dramatically to 39.1 peryear per 1,000 children (IQR 32.8-52.2) among populationsexposed to childhood parasite prevalence risks greater thanor equal to 25 percent. In the regression model, mortalityincreased significantly with parasite prevalence, but thiseffect leveled off at higher prevalence rates. The model sug-gested that, in rural DSS sites throughout Sub-SaharanAfrica, all-cause mortality increases by more than twofold (25-30 deaths per 1,000 children under five years old) overthe prevalences of malaria infection covered by the DSS sites,and parasite prevalence explained 64 percent of the variation between sites in all-cause under-five mortality. By contrast,the direct estimation of malaria-specific mortality presentedearlier for children living under stable endemic conditionswas only 28.2 percent. These comparisons of direct versus indirect contribu- tions of malaria infection to child survival must be viewed with some caution. Ecological analyses are constrained bymultiple confounders, notably, influences of socioeconomic status, access to and effectiveness of health services, preva-lence of HIV , exposure to other parasitic diseases, nutrition,and the genetic makeup of the population. Still, such anapproach to estimating malaria's contribution to child mor-tality in Sub-Saharan Africa suggests that the influence of P. falciparum infection is greater than that described by the direct, single-cause attribution of childhood deaths. Theeffects of malaria during pregnancy on low birthweight andto a lesser extent the nutritional and hematological influ-ences of malaria infection may explain the differencebetween direct and indirect estimates. MALARIA AND POVERTY Recent global, cross-country regression analysis of malariarisk and gross domestic product have found the disease to bea significant influence on long-term economic growth. Asmuch as half the gross domestic product is lost in highly endemic areas over 25 years as a direct result of malaria (Gallup and Sachs 2001; McCarthy and Wu 2000). Althoughpersuasive to international donors, such a macroeconomicanalysis fails to identify the mechanisms of these economiclosses (Malaney, Speilman, and Sachs 2004). It seems reason-able to assume that national levels of economic loss are acomposite of economic burdens at the household level.Shepard and colleagues (1991) estimated the household costof malaria in Burkina Faso, Chad, the Republic of Congo, andRwanda. The authors concluded that a case of malaria in Africa cost US$9.84 in 1987, of which US$1.83 was direct andUS$8.01 was accrued indirectly as a result of forgone incomeassociated with malaria morbidity and mortality. The totalestimated cost of US$0.8 billion represents 0.6 percent of theMalaria | 207gross domestic product of the economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, microeconomic analyses of household eco- nomic burden posed by malaria are only a fraction of macro- economic analyses of national economic loss. Malaney,Speilman, and Sachs (2004) suggest that this difference mightarise either because of inadequate methodologies or becausethe macroeconomic national burden encompasses house- hold financial costs and ill-defined financial \"externalities,\" such as trade, tourism, and investment. Whether malaria drives household or national poverty requires better definition. However, the converse is irrefutable: poor people are less able to prevent infection orafford effective disease management. In Africa, malaria islargely a disease of the rural populations, and often these communities are home to some of the poorest of the poorin Africa. There is increasing evidence that strategies pro-moted to prevent infection, such as insecticide-treated bed-nets, are not reaching the poor when cost-retrieval is part ofthe strategy. The recent Kenyan Demographic and HealthSurvey showed that less than 7 percent of children describedas living in households at the lowest wealth index quartilesleep under an insecticide-treated bednet compared with 35percent of children in the top wealth quartile households(http://www.measuredhs.org/). Similar findings have beenreported for Uganda (Mugisha and Arinatwe 2003). InTanzania, poor children were less likely to receive antimalar-ials when febrile than children from wealthier families(Schellenberg et al. 2003). A household survey in Malawifocused on low-income households whose mean annualincome was US$115 and where the costs of malaria preven-tion and treatment represented about 20 percent of annualincome (Ettling et al. 1994). TRENDS IN MALARIA MORTALITY One of the earlier applications of the BOMA project was to examine long-term changes in the estimates of malaria mor-tality in Sub-Saharan Africa (Snow, Trape, and Marsh 2001).A comparison of preindependence malaria-specific and all-cause childhood mortality data derived from circumscribed colonial medical records and civil registration with earlyDSS data before 1990 and contemporary DSS data post-1990 is shown in figure 14.4. The period 1960-89 was char-acterized by a median malaria-specific mortality of 7.8 per1,000 children under five per year, a decline of 18 percentfrom the estimates recorded before 1960 (9.5 per 1,000 chil-dren under five per year). However, the 11 studies of child-hood malaria-specific mortality during the 1990s provideda median estimate of 10.2 per 1,000 children under five per year, similar to that described in the preindependence sur-veillance data (figure 14.4a). In contrast, the annualized risks of all-cause mortality recorded at the same sites demonstrate a continued decline over the three time periods(figure 14.4b), and overall childhood mortality during theearly 1990s was 34 percent lower than the median estimatesof all-cause mortality recorded during the preindependencesurveys. The net result has been a rise in the proportion ofall deaths attributed to malaria: 18 percent before 1960,12 percent between 1960 and 1989, rising to 30 percentduring the 1990s.20a.

All-Cause Mortality Estimates per Year for Children under Five (per 1,000)temperature do not support a trend in favor of increased malaria transmission (Hay et al. 2002). For many years chloroquine provided a cheap, effective, and easily available treatment. The past 20 years have seen a precipitous declinein the efficacy of chloroquine across Africa (EANMAT 2003;Talisuna, Bloland, and D'Alessandro 2004), and this repre-sents the most likely factor contributing to the change in malaria-specific childhood mortality. Such an explanation would also be entirely consistent with observations ofincreased hospitalization and morbidity in other parts ofAfrica (Asindi et al. 1993; Greenberg et al. 1989; Shanks et al. 2000) and the sharp rises in malaria morbidity associated with declining first-line therapy in KwaZulu-Natal Provinceof South Africa and its reversal following the introduction of effective artemisinin-based combination therapies (Barnesand Folb 2003). CONCLUSION During 2000 approximately 1.14 million people may have died as a direct result of infection with P. falciparum . Eighty- eight percent of these deaths would have occurred in areas of stable endemic malaria and the majority of these wouldhave been among young children. The empirical evidence for indirect or consequential mortality may explain an addi-tional 10 percent of mortality directly attributed to malariainfection. This would be consistent with observations madeduring randomized controlled trials that suggest that reduc-ing the risks of infection in a community has an impactbeyond what might readily be described by verbal autopsy asdirect malaria mortality. Recent ecological analyses of all-cause pediatric mortality suggest that the difference betweendirect and indirect attribution of malaria as cause of death might be substantially higher than 10 percent. The Roll Back Malaria movement proposes to halve malaria mortality by the year 2010 (http://www.rbm.int). This goal has been set even though existing, affordable ther-apeutics are rapidly failing, health service provision is break-ing down, there are no immediate prospects of widespreadvaccination, and poverty continues to afflict most endemiccountries. There are strong reasons to believe that over thepast 15 years malaria-specific mortality has risen and nowaccounts for an increasing proportion of overall childhoodmortality. The starting point for new efforts to \"roll back malaria\" is not a level playing field but a mortality burdenthat has returned to levels described before Africa gainedindependence. 208 | Robert W. Snow and Judy A. OmumboThe BOMA data were reanalyzed to define more precisely the recent trends in malaria-specific mortality estimates from DSS sites among children under five years, allowing for variation in the V A performance, malaria endemicity, andregion (Korenromp et al. 2003). In West African DSS sites,malaria mortality was on average 7.8 per 1,000 child-yearsthroughout the 1980s and 1990s without a significant change over time. Although conclusive evidence of tempo- ral increases in malaria-specific mortality was observedwithin a series of DSS sites in Senegal (Trape et al. 1998). InEast and southern African DSS sites the estimated malaria mortality increased from 6.5 per 1,000 child-years between 1982 and 1990 to 11.9 per 1,000 child-years between 1990and 1998. Nonmalaria mortality, in contrast, decreased over time in both regions. Figure 14.5 summarizes the combinedSub-Saharan Africa data for 1982-98, allowing for parame-ters of region, parasite prevalence, and V A performance. There are several possible explanations for the observed trends in malaria mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa over the last 20 years, such as declining household wealth linked to achanging health sector based on cost retrieval and the gen-eral deterioration in the quality of clinical care. Althoughaccess to and quality of health care is undoubtedly subopti-mal in many areas, this has not had a similar impact on non-malaria childhood mortality. Global warming has been debated as a general cause of expanding malaria risk and thereby increasing malaria-specific mortality in several partsof Africa. However, this seems an unlikely explanation forthe areas included in figures 14.4a and 14.5, as long-term data for areas likely to be affected by changes in ambient p/H11005 0.0022 10 02030405060 malaria Source: Adapted from Korenromp et al. 2003.

How much furtherforward are we in estimating malaria's contribution to the mortality burden in Sub-Saharan Africa? The estimates pro- vided in this chapter continue to be driven by informedapproximations, in part because of the paucity of reliableand accurate data, but also due to the inherent difficulties of unique diagnosis. The estimates, however, have been made from empirical epidemiological measures of mortality risks,structured according to age and malaria transmission. The method is similar to one previously used to define themalaria burden in Sub-Saharan Africa (Snow et al. 1999)but takes into account new data, refined endemicityclassifications, broader health consequences, and the tempo-ral effects associated with changing antimalarial drug sensi-tivity. This data-driven method allows for a more transpar-ent review of the evidence. Such reviews of available evidence reveal as much about what we do know as about what we do not know. Many aspects of the malaria burden in Sub-Saharan Africarequire further empirical investigation or modeling. In thecontinued absence of wide-area, reliable coverage of cause-specific mortality data there is a need for increased researchto help in an understanding of the spatial determinants ofrisk. The assumption that urban versus rural, East versus West African, or poor versus affluent populations experi-ence similar risks of poor health outcomes from malaria infection is clearly an oversimplification of complex inter- actions. The precise cartography of risk requires improved population distribution maps. This is now being addressedat a global scale through a new initiative, the Malaria AtlasProject, funded by the Wellcome Trust, United Kingdom(http://www.map.ox.ac.uk). The emphasis within the liter-ature on measuring childhood risks of disease and deathfrom malaria would seem justified from the current under-standing of immunity, but there is comparative ignoranceabout the true public health consequences of malariaamong older children and adults. The impact of infectionand disease on undernutrition, anemia, and HIV remain atbest speculative and require further investigation beforethese composite risks can be defined. The most significantchallenge facing the malaria epidemiologist today is todescribe malaria health outcomes in Africa and how theserisks change from birth through adulthood according tothe dependent factors of infection, immunity, and control.NOTE This review was made possible because of a large contribu- tion over the years from malaria epidemiology colleagues,notably Marlies Craig, Uwe Deichmann, Simon Hay, ElineKorenromp, Claire CharlesNewton, Dennis Shanks, Rick Steketee, and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Trape.

In total, 30 countries areinfested, ranging from Senegal across to Ethiopia in thenorth and as far south as Angola and Malawi. TRANSMISSION Onchocerciasis is caused by worms, Onchocerca volvulus. The adult worms measure nearly a meter long and live incoiled mating pairs in nodules under the skin. Reproducingadult females spawn about 2,000 immature worms everyday. These tiny juvenile worms migrate throughout the skin and eyes, causing the various symptoms of the disease.Although they are damaging, these immature worms cannotmature to adulthood without being transmitted by a black-fly of the genus Simulium. This fly breeds in rapidly flowing streams and rivers, and thus the name \"river blindness.\" Themost important vector is Simulium damnosum sensus lato, which has a wide range throughout Africa and the MiddleEast. In East Africa, S. neavei also transmits onchocerciasis.There are many vectors in the Western butS. ochraceum, S. metallicum, S. oyapockense, S. guianense,andS. exiguum are among the most important. In the island of Bioko, the vector is S. yahense, Bioko form. Blackflies serve as the intermediate host of the parasite. Flies ingest immature worms when they bite infected people. As the worms live in the fly, they mature sexuallyover the course of a week. Then, should the fly bite a person, the maturing worm will grow to adulthood inside thehuman body. Upon finding mating partners, the adultsbecome encapsulated and produce more immature worms,completing the full transmission cycle. THE DISEASE BURDEN The most severe consequences of onchocerciasis is blind-ness, which may affect one-third of the adult population ofthe most highly affected communities. The prevention of blindness was the main clinical reason for initiating the Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP) in West Africain 1974 (Benton severalChapter15 Zour\u00e9, and Azodoga Seketelisymptoms, including itching, physical scars from constant scratching, de-pigmentation and thickeningof the skin, impaired vision, and complete blindness. Important pioneering studies in the last decade, spon- sored by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO) Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR), have shown thatonchocercal skin disease (OSD) is associated with a greaterdegree of morbidity than was hitherto appreciated. Thesestudies demonstrated that severe OSD causes suffering to millions of people, particularly to those in the forest zone, where the blinding form of the disease is less prevalent(Amazigo 1993; WHO 1995b). OSD not only causes also has a demonstrably negative socioeconomicimpact on the productivity of farmers, breastfeeding, andschool attendance (Amazigo et al. 1997; Vlassoff et al. 2000). The relative contributions of both ocular and dermal symptoms to the burden of onchocercal disease and theirsocioeconomic consequences are substantial (Kale 1998).The unbearable itching and blindness that accompany thedisease hinder the ability of individuals to contribute totheir own well-being, and they undermine the emotionaland economic health of the household and the commu-nity. Consequently, onchocerciasis, which predominantlyaffects poor people in remote areas, can be directly linkedto poverty. THE SOCIOECONOMIC TOLL In the 1970s, when investigations of onchocerciasis in the endemic villages and districts of West Africa began, scien-tists made astonishing and disturbing discoveries. Morethan 60 percent of the savanna population carried the para-site; 10 percent of the adult population and half of the males over 40 years of age were blind, 30 percent of the peoplewere visually impaired, and early signs of onchocerciasiswere common among children (WHO 1973, 1987, 1995a). Scientists revealed the huge socioeconomic consequences of the high infection rates they had found.As village blindness reached epidemic proportions, it left too few able-bodiedpeople to tend fields. Food shortages and economic collapseforced residents to abandon homelands in fertile river val-leys. Moving to hardscrabble highlands and forested areasoffered some protection from further infection, but then farmers struggled with poor soil and water shortages on overcrowded lands. Onchocerciasis often ultimately sent aprosperous community into poverty. Armed with this newknowledge about the economic impact, and with manyfertile lands and water sources off-limits because of endemiconchocerciasis, development agencies made the disease apriority. RAPID EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MAPPING OF ONCHOCERCIASIS Continued research has led to the development of Rapid Epidemiological Mapping of Onchocerciasis (REMO), a tool that provides data on the distribution and prevalence of the disease. REMO is a simple, noninvasive, and practicableprocess that is easy to apply over a wide range of bioecolog- ical zones, with no sociocultural or religious restrictions.This tool was vital to rapid mapping and accelerating thescaling-up process of identifying endemic villages for masstreatment with ivermectin in control areas. Integration ofREMO data into the Geographical Information System(GIS) allowed delineation of zones of different levels ofendemicity, which is an important step in the planningprocess for onchocerciasis control. Zones, and communitiesin these zones, are included or excluded from the community- directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI), depending onwhether their levels of onchocercal endemicity reach thethreshold set by the control program. Prevalence rates ofinfection in the OCP areas prior to control activities werehigh in all the countries. POPULATION AT RISK AND POPULATION INFECTED In 1995 it was estimated that 18 million persons were in- fected, of whom 270,000 were blind and about 500,000 per-sons severely visually impaired (WHO 1995a). However, the large-scale REMO that was undertaken by the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC), coveringthe 19 remaining endemic countries in Africa, providesrecent and more accurate estimates. From the REMO results it was estimated in 2004 that about 87 million persons were at high risk of contracting onchocerciasis in APOC coun-tries. This figure is higher than the number at risk (about58 million persons) reported two years earlier by Noma and 216 | Uche Amazigo, Mounkaila countrywide mapping of the dis- ease had not been carried out in Angola and Burundi and had been implemented (only partially) in very few areas in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan. The results of REMO, also used to determine the number of infected persons in the APOC countries, showed that the mean infection rate was 38.2 percent, or approximately37 million people. This represents almost three times thenumber estimated (13.7 million people) at the planningphase of the APOC program, when only partial data wereavailable for few countries. ONCHOCERCIASIS CONTROL PROGRAMS In 1970, funded by the UNDP , a team of WHO scientists and consultants began to lay the technical groundwork for amajor regional initiative to defeat river blindness. By 1972the international development community mobilized fundsto aid in the control of the disease. In 1974 the affected countries and four agencies (the World Bank, the WHO,the Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO], and theUNDP) launched an unprecedented partnership. The \"riverblindness partnership\" has had two distinct phases: the OCPbetween 1974 and 2002 and APOC between 1996 and 2010.The OCP had a dual mandate: to eliminate river blindnessas a public heath problem and as an obstacle to socioeco-nomic development. The APOC mandate in East Africa andcentral Africa does not express the same socioeconomic development needs as did the OCP mandate in West Africa.This is because the strain of parasite prevalent outside thesavanna belt is less likely to cause blindness. Instead, it exactsits toll in greater skin disease. The stigma and disability fromthese dermatologic effects are difficult to quantify, andhumanitarian reasons alone were more than sufficient tojustify the expense of control. Partnership of the Control Programs The onchocerciasis control programs in Sub-Saharan Africa\u2014the OCP and, in particular, APOC\u2014developed aunique partnership structure. More than 80 partners areinvolved in this rich coalition, including 26 donors;30 African countries; a major pharmaceutical firm, Merck & Co.; and 12 major nongovernmental development organiza-tions (NGDOs) over 120,000 local communities within theOCP and APOC ambit of operations. This broad coalition iscomplex to maintain but has created synergies that haveyielded enormous advantages, including rapid expansion of ivermectin distribution to remote communities. The part-ners have ably demonstrated how to deliver medicines toreach those who need them most, the poorest. With lessonsfrom the OCP , the partners of APOC are making efforts tomentor national or local nongovernmental organizations(NGOs) in different countries to play major roles in sus-taining ivermectin distribution by supporting the healthsystem, especially after the withdrawal of external support. Vector Control Onchocerciasis control is complicated by the long life of the adult worms, which remain fertile throughout most of their10- to 15-year lifespan. The immature worms live in the skinfor about two years, but their numbers are continuallyrefreshed as long as adults are alive in the body. This means that even with instant and complete transmission control, the disease would not die out naturally for 15 years; hence,control attempts must last at least the life span of the adult worm. The control program in West Africa, the OCP , initiallyattacked the disease by killing the larvae of the flies thattransmit the worms. It depended on killing these larvae overa long enough time that the adult worms would all die out.Then, when fly control stopped, biting flies would no longeringest any parasites, and the transmission cycle would be broken. The key to this approach lies in reducing the flypopulation sufficiently to stop transmission and thensustaining the effort for two decades or more. The principal strategy of the OCP from its inception was vector control. Covering Burkina Faso and six neighboring countries, the control began in 1974 in West Africa as a largeregional project. Vector control, treating the breeding sites ofdisease-transmitting flies with larvicides, was the only avail-able approach. Prior control attempts dating back to the 1950s had shown that the disease is transmitted on a regional scale. The first projects were small, and the savanna was consis-tently reinfested. Accordingly, the OCP was established as alarge program to cover entire endemic zones. Even thisambitious start was not sufficient; in 1986 the program dou-bled in size and was expanded to cover 11 countries in all. Since blackflies migrate across international borders, the affected governments and international experts were con- vinced that only a regional program could control riverblindness. Thus, the OCP targeted seven West African coun-tries (Benin, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali,Niger, and T figure 15.1). With the collaboration and Onchocerciasis | 217political commitment of these nations, control operations were planned. As the primary method of control, aircraftwould spray environmentally safe larvicides around fast- flowing rivers\u2014the breeding grounds of the intermediate host of the disease, the blackfly. Initially, operations covered 660,000 square kilometers in seven countries, an area believed to be large enough to contain the blackfly vector (WHO 1995a). However, in1975, after three initial months of successful operations,many migrant blackflies from untreated watercourses reap-peared, threatening to reintroduce the disease into the pro-gram area. Scientists found that the flies were coming fromup to 600 kilometers away from the area being treated(Le Berre et al. 1990; WHO 1995a). In response, the pro- gram extended operations to another four West Africancountries (Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, and SierraLeone; figure 15.1). The program area increased geographiccoverage from 780,000 square kilometers to 1.3 millionsquare kilometers, enabling the campaign to increase thenumber of people protected from 10 million to 30 million. Ivermectin Treatment and Approaches to Disease Control The advent of ivermectin (Mectizan) and its donation by Merck & Co. in 1987, for as long as needed, provided asecond string to OCP's control operations. The first exten-sive field studies on the suitability of the drug for use on amass scale were conducted by the OCP (Awadzi et al. 1985).The favorable results of these studies led to the OCP's adopting mass distribution of Mectizan as an adjunct tovector control. In 1990 the program began full-scale distri-bution in extension areas\u2014to the south and west of theoriginal core area in West Africa\u2014using mobile teams injeeps plus local health staff support. In this first step toward scaling up, OCP-paid local health professionals called communities to a central location for dosing. In more than 30 river basins, therapeutic coverageaveraged about 65 percent in 1987, improving to more than70 percent by 1995. However, it was expensive to use trainedhealth staff at the local level. In light of high, recurring costs, the program considered various cost-recovery schemes to no avail. The answer to the high cost of mobile teams arrivedindirectly. Invariably, when drugs were distributed, somevillagers were away, either hunting, working, or traveling. Inresponse, the program authorized the mobile teams to leavedoses upon departure for absent community members, onceit became clear that ivermectin's safety profile allowed unsu-pervised dosing. In the second step toward scaling up,national health services combined with local health staff todistribute the drug, forming a community-based distribu-tion approach. In some areas the OCP used ivermectin alone (Awadzi et al. 1985; Dadzie 1990, Remme et al. 1989, Whitworth et al. 1991,1992) and effectively so. Ivermectin iseffective against only the juvenile parasites, killing 95 per-cent with one dose. Even when a patient takes ivermectin,the adult worms continue to live, churning out offspring.However, because the juvenile parasites cause the disease,ivermectin relieves the symptoms and allows the body tobegin healing itself. Treatment with ivermectin is required only once per year but must be taken for as long as anyadults are still alive, up to 15 years. By killing almost all theimmature worms, ivermectin also dramatically lowers thechance of parasite ingestion by biting flies. The application of the two strategies by the OCP has led to the virtual elimination of onchocerciasis as a public health problem and as an obstacle to socioeconomic devel-opment in 10 of the 11 countries in which the program wascarried out (figure 15.2), leading to the recognition of OCP as one of the most successful programs in the history ofdevelopment assistance (Kim and Benton 1995). Figure 15.3shows the other health interventions implemented usingthe CDTI network in APOC countries in 2004. By the end ofthe OCP , the program had covered 11 countries, protecting40 million persons at risk and 1.3 million square kilometers of land. By the end of APOC in 2010, the program's two 218 | Uche Amazigo, 1974 and Gradual Expansion, 1977-92 Source: Onchocerciasis Coordination Unit, World Bank.

By 1995 the group needed consid- erably more resources than they could generate on their own for a significant expansion in the scope of their activi-ties. Furthermore, the various NGDOs and programs usedmobile teams and the clinic-based and community-basedtreatment with ivermectin in the distribution of the drug. These methods were proved inappropriate or not cost- effective for large-scale sustainable distribution of the drugfor several years. In 1995 the Task Force on OnchocerciasisOperational Research of the UNDP , World Bank, and WHO Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, in collaboration with the OCP , addressed the prob-lem in a multicountry research study (WHO 1995b). The study concluded that community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) was feasible and effective in a wide range of geographical and cultural settings in Africa, andlikely to be replicable in other endemic communities inAfrica. It recommended that this approach become a princi-pal method for onchocerciasis control in Africa. (WHO1996). The scaling up to community-directed treatmentwas a major turning point for the onchocerciasis controlprograms. Two successful regional programs, APOC and the Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas (OEPA), were introduced to distribute ivermectin (Remme 1995; Richards et al. 2001). APOC was launched in 1995 tocover 19 countries in the remainder of infested Africa. In1997 the program adopted the CDTI as its principal strate- gy for ivermectin distribution. In 2001, 42 million tabletsof ivermectin donated by Merck & Co. were used in the 28 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa for onchocerciasis con- trol. Ivermectin is distributed by community workers, trained and supported by the external partners. In 1996 APOC had approved four CDTI projects, and by the end of 2003 the Programme totaled 107 projects to be implemented (table 15.1), of which 97 were CDTI projects.Sixty-two projects delivered more than 32 million treat-ments in 2003 alone (table 15.1). By 2010 the total treat-ments are expected to reach 90 million people. The distri-bution network is also being tested to deliver other healthinterventions. This enticing possibility opens the door tofurther scaling up to help control other diseases and pres-ents the opportunity to deliver other basic health interven-tions in the river-blindness areas, all of which are remote,rural, and poor. Most are not reached by other programs,and some are not reached by the national governmentsthemselves.

The initial efforts at mass distribution of ivermectin out- side OCP were made by NGDOs. The first of the NGDO-facilitated ivermectin distribution programs in Africa was established in Nigeria in 1989 (Duke and Dadzie 1993). Manyof the pioneering NGDOs were already well known throughtheir activities in prevention of blindness and were alreadywith the WHO Prevention of Blindness Programme. The NGDOs soon recognized the need to coordinate their separate and independent efforts if they were toachieve their common goal. Therefore, in 1992 they cameIn 2003, through community-directed treatment, APOC countries achieved ivermectin therapeutic coverage of 68.1 percent on average in the targeted communities. It augmented these distribution efforts with a strong commit- ment to increasing capacity. The introduction of ivermectin presented challenges and opportunities that became a catalyst for scaling up on all levels. It transformed onchocerciasis control from a techno-logically driven categorical health initiative to a community-directed process of treatment and empowerment ofcommunities. This grassroots approach contributed, asshown in table 15.1, to high coverage of the population andempowered communities to take charge of their own health.It also planted the seeds for sustainability\u2014absolutely vital for a disease that must be treated for at least 15 years tointerrupt transmission. Systematic assessments of 48 CDTIprojects in 10 countries (Cameroon, Chad, the DemocraticRepublic of Congo, Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, the Republicof Congo, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda) at four levels\u2014namely, the central level (the state, regional, and provinciallevels of the different health systems in Sub-Saharan Africa),the district and local government authorities level, thesubdistrict and frontline health facility level, and the com-munity level\u2014were undertaken between 2002 and 2004.These sustainability assessments were carried out with out-side technical assistance. A total of 304 district and localgovernment authorities and 468 communities were evalu-ated. The performance of health care service providersand community workers was assessed using quality-of-implementation indicators designed for the multicountryevaluation of CDTI. The results of these in-depth evalua-tions show that 35 (73 percent) of the 48 projects aremaking satisfactory progress toward sustainability, and 13(27 percent) are not.Benefits of the Onchocerciasis Control Programs The 20 percent economic rate of return of OCP from the inception of phase 1 in 1975 to 2002 compares well withother development projects, including those outside thehealth sector (Kim and Benton 1995). In the study by Kimand Benton (1995) the benefits taken into account were an increase in the labor force due to prevention of blindness(25 percent of benefits) and increased land use (75 percentof benefits). By 2010 the total budget for the OCP and APOC will amount to approximately US$735 million in donorfinancing; these funds were allocated primarily to larvicid-ing and entomological evaluation. Other costs were foradministration, including extensive meetings aimed atensuring transparency within the wide-ranging partnership; ivermectin delivery; training; and research and develop-ment. The cost of protection from OCP operations perperson per year was well under US$1. The target cost pertreatment is about US$0.15 for APOC. Normally, a 10 percent rate of return for World Bank projects in the \"productive sector\" (excluding social proj-ects, such as education and health) is considered a success.By 2010, the economic rate of return for APOC is expectedto reach 18 percent. Moreover, every U.S. dollar invested inAPOC activities is expected to add 27 labor-productive daysbetween 1996 and 2017. CONCLUSION Over the last 30 years a large international partnership has successfully attacked onchocerciasis. This partnership hasdefeated the disease in 10 of the 11 countries in West Africaand is making progress in the remaining endemic countries 220 | Uche Amazigo, Mounkaila Noma, Zour\u00e9, and Azodoga Seketeli1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Total Projects approved (including CDTI, 4 25 16 12 6 6 11 27 107 Vector Elimination, and National Onchocerciasis Task Forces HQ support) Annual treatments n.a. 1.5 14.1 16.9 20.4 24.6 29.0 32.2 138.7 Geographic coverage (percent) a n.a. 36.6 Geographic coverage is the percentage of communities treated per total communities at high risk. b.

The program, spanning 30 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa, encompasses more than 107 projects to create a comprehensive approach to eliminating the disease as a public health problem. Theonchocerciasis control programs have yielded the followingresults: 1989-90\u201460,000 people treated in 11 countries 1994\u20142 million people treated 2002 (end of phase 1)\u201440 million people protected in 11 countries; 600,000 cases of blindness prevented;18 million children spared the risk of onchocerciasis 2003\u201433 million people treated in 69,641 communitiesin the APOC countries; more than 162,000 communitydistributors and 18,000 health workers trained or retrained 2010\u2014a projected 102 million people and about 100,000 communities protected in 16 countries and a projected150 million people protected in 30 countries. Prior to 2002, when the OCP closed, 25 million hectares of relatively fertile land in the river valleys were freed for resettlement and for agriculture; the socioeconomic impactof OCP is considered to be enormous. More than 40 millionpeople in the 11 countries were considered free from infec-tion and eye lesions. Sixteen million children born after1974, when OCP activities began, are free of onchocerciasis;more than 1.5 million people originally infected are nolonger so; and more than 200,000 cases of blindness havebeen prevented. The second phase of the studies to determine the impact of APOC are under way, but the program is considered to be highly cost-effective. The cost per disability-adjusted lifeyear of APOC operations is US$6.50. A study is also beingconducted to demonstrate the feasibility and cost-benefit ofonchocerciasis elimination with ivermectin. The community-directed distribution network can get primary health care to the poorest of the poor through sim-ple, once- or twice-a-year interventions by nonmedical staff.In some areas, additional activities have been carefully testedand planned; in other areas, communities themselves took spontaneous action. Effective interventions exist, but they do not reach the people who need them most\u2014the poor.Prior to the launching of APOC, not enough was knownabout what works to reach the poor, that is, what systemscan ensure that poor and very remote populations haveaccess to the benefits of health services, to available drugs,regardless of their locations.Participating countries, donors, and the partnership's governing board have all endorsed the integration ofcommunity-directed treatment into existing health systemsthrough other health interventions. Some countries, such as Uganda, have begun reorganizing their rural health servicesto use the community-based network as a national strategy.Some communities within the 30 African countries, alongwith NGDOs, such as Helen Keller International and TheCarter Center, have begun distributing bednets to preventmalaria, and medications, including vitamin A, to preventmalnutrition, pediatric blindness, and death; Praziquantelto control schistosomiasis; and ivermectin albendazoleto control of lymphatic filariasis.

TheProgramme of Action of the International Conference onPopulation and Development of 1994 and the Fourth World Conference on Women of 1995 were created in an attemptto tackle these issues and drew unprecedented attentionto reproductive health and rights as well as to gender equityand equality. The scourge of the human immunodeficiencyvirus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) has ravaged the region's population and has left in itswake untold destruction in the demographic, economic,and social spheres (UN 2003). Demographic events of thelast decade are a sharp contrast to those in the 1980s, when decreasing infant, child, and adult mortality rates andmaternal mortality ratios (MMRs) were leading to steadilyincreasing life expectancy and improved health status forwomen in the region. Data sets assembled since the 1990s are the basis for the analysis of maternal mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa in thischapter. Beginning with an examination of measurementapproaches and data sources of maternal mortality, thechapter continues with a description of the levels and trends in maternal mortality in the decade 1990-2000. The causesand correlates of maternal mortality, as well as priority interventions, are examined. The last section of the chapter points to what Sub-Saharan African countries could doto meet the maternal health component of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. MEASUREMENT AND DATA SOURCES Measuring maternal mortality remains one of the more dif- ficult issues in maternal health, and yet an accurate pictureof the scope of the problem is important to implement approaches to improve maternal health care. Definitions The World Health Organization's (WHO's) 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) defines maternal mortality as \"the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 daysChapter16 Maternal Mortality Khama O. Rogo, John Oucho, and Philip Mwalaliof termination of pregnancy irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related toor aggravated by the pregnancy or its management butnot from accidental or incidental causes\" (WHO 1992).Furthermore, the ICD-10 introduced a new category, namely, late maternal death, that is defined as \"the death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric causes more than42 days but less than one year after termination of preg-nancy.\" The ICD-10 defined direct obstetric deaths as \"maternal deaths resulting from obstetric complications of the pregnant state (pregnancy, labor, and the puerperium),from interventions, omissions, incorrect treatment, or froma chain of events resulting from any of the above.\" Indirect obstetric deaths , by contrast, are \"those resulting from previ- ous existing disease or disease that developed during pregnancy and which was not due to obstetric causes, butwas aggravated by physiologic effects of pregnancy.\" Becauseaccidental deaths are excluded from the definition ofmaternal deaths, the ICD-10 introduced the termpregnancy-related death , defined as \"the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of preg-nancy, irrespective of the cause of death\" (WHO 1992). Maternal mortality is associated with neonatal mortality, but a lack of data, especially for Sub-Saharan Africa, con-strains conclusive findings. A review of the literature sug-gests that a relationship exists between maternal mortality and perinatal mortality, including stillbirths and earlyneonatal deaths, and that interventions that save the lives ofmothers are also effective in reducing neonatal mortality(Bang, Onuh andAisien 2004). Measures of Maternal Mortality Three measures of maternal mortality are commonly used. First, the maternal mortality ratio is expressed as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same period: MMR /H11005/H11003 100,000 (16.1) The MMR represents a measure of the risk of death once a woman has become pregnant. As a ratio, it is not a true risk, as it involves two different populations, pregnantwomen and live newborns. The ratio can be influenced bythe prevalence of stillbirths as well as the prevalence ofinduced abortions.No. of maternal deaths /H5007/H5007/H5007No. of live birthsSecond, the maternal mortality rate is the number of maternal deaths in a given period per 100,000 women of reproductive age during the same period: Maternal mortality rate /H11005 /H11003100,000 (16.2) The maternal mortality rate is a cause-specific mortality rate for women of reproductive age in the presence of othercauses of death. Third, the lifetime risk of maternal death is the risk a woman has of dying during her reproductive years, given current rates of fertility and the risk of maternal mortality.Given the length of the reproductive period (about 35 years),the lifetime risk is calculated as [1 /H11002(1/H11002maternal mor- tality rate) 35] (AbouZahr and Wardlaw 2003). Data Sources Estimation of maternal mortality indicators is difficult and subject to error because the data on which the estimates arebased are frequently inaccurate. In the estimates producedjointly by the WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund(UNICEF), and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) (AbouZahr and Wardlaw 2003), countries areclassified into one of the following four categories: 1. countries with complete civil registration and good cause-of-death attribution 2. those with complete or nearly complete civil registration of the number of births and deaths but with poor cause- of-death attribution 3. those without a reliable system of civil registration, where maternal deaths, like other vital events, go unrecorded 4. those with estimates of maternal mortality based on household surveys, using direct or indirect sisterhood methods. Most Sub-Saharan African countries fall into the last two categories. This implies that estimates of maternal mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa are derived from the methods men-tioned in category 4 above. When estimating maternalmortality for these countries, the WHO, UNICEF, and theUNFPA use an approach that includes adjusting countrydata to account for underreporting and misclassificationand a statistical model to generate estimates. Maternaldeaths are generally identified by medical certification whenvital registration exists; in household surveys, censuses, andNo. of maternal deaths /H5007/H5007/H5007No. of women age 15-49 224 | Khama O. Rogo, John Oucho, and Philip MwalaliReproductive Age Mortality Studies (RAMOS), a time of death definition is used, making these \"pregnancy-related deaths\" rather than \"maternal deaths.\" Several sources of data on which estimates of maternal mortality rely aredescribed briefly below. Vital Registration. This source is generally used in devel- oped countries, where maternal mortality is estimated from deaths registered by cause of death. It permits calculation ofperiod-specific maternal mortality ratios in which thenumerator is registered maternal deaths and the denomina-tor is the registered live births (see equation 16.1). Where thedegree of underreporting of maternal deaths is almostsimilar to that of live births, the resulting maternal mortality ratio will give a reasonable population-based estimate. InSub-Saharan Africa, vital registration is lacking in all coun-tries, with the exception of Mauritius. In the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa, vital registration-based maternal mortality estimates are inadequate because of the failure to register vital events, as well as the misclassification of causes ofdeath, due to the absence of medical personnel and forsocial, religious, and emotional reasons (Graham 1991). Inview of these shortcomings, the vital registration system isruled out as a reliable source of measuring maternal mor-tality in the region. Population-Based Data. In the absence of complete vital registration, the main sources of population-based data are censuses and surveys, which use one of the followingapproaches to estimate maternal mortality: RAMOS, sister-hood method, sibling-history method, and householddeaths methods. The key characteristics of each of them inthe context of Sub-Saharan Africa follow. Decennial census counts can generate both national and subnational data with questions on deaths in the household in a defined reference period (one or two years before thecensus), followed by detailed questions that permit identifi-cation of maternal deaths according to time of death relativeto pregnancy. Estimates of maternal mortality derived fromcensuses in this way are believed to be fairly accurate(Stanton et al. 2001). A problem is that censuses of Sub-Saharan African countries ask questions that are often notuseful for identification of maternal deaths, which, in addi-tion, are often not fully reported. A RAMOS study seeks to identify all deaths of females of reproductive age in a defined population by investigating allrelevant sources of information, namely, household inter-views, hospital and health center records, vital registration,or word of mouth. Generally, a team of physicians studies the information collected by the study team to determinematernal mortality (Stanton, Abderrahim, and Hill 1997). Investigation of maternal mortality by the sisterhood method, an indirect approach, entails asking respondents about ever-married sisters: how many have died, and howmany died while they were pregnant or during childbirth orsix weeks following the end of the pregnancy (Stanton,Abderrahim, and Hill 2000). This method has been usedfrequently in population-based approaches, such as house-hold surveys. Originated by W. J. Graham and W. Brass(Graham 1991) in a field trial in The Gambia in 1987, it is asimple and low-cost technique with considerable appeal inmaternal mortality studies. The method provides a retro- spective rather than a current estimate, averaging experi-ence over a lengthy time period, 35 years, with a midpointof about 12 years before the survey. The estimates havewide confidence intervals, making short-term monitoringof maternal mortality trends difficult (AbouZahr andWardlaw 2003). The direct sibling-history method has been employed by the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs), and permitsthe calculation of a maternal mortality ratio for a morerecent period of time; results are typically calculated for areference period of seven years before the survey, with a point estimate some three to four years before the survey(AbouZahr and Wardlaw 2003). The data requirements forthis method are more demanding than for the indirectapproach because respondents are asked three sets of ques-tions. First, they are asked how many children the motherhas given birth to and how many of the children were bornbefore the respondent. The second set of questions asksabout the siblings' sex, age, and survival, or how many yearsago she or he died and age at death. Finally, three questionsare asked about dead sisters to determine maternal morta-lity: whether she was pregnant when she died, whether shedied during childbirth, and whether she died within twomonths after the end of pregnancy or childbirth (Stanton,Abderrahim, and Hill 2000). The final method entails undertaking a survey of house- holds to ascertain maternal deaths. Unlike the sibling-history method, in which a sibling reports on the deaths of femalesiblings, the direct household method involves reporting byhousehold heads or any other persons volunteering suchinformation. When household information is screened,maternal and nonmaternal deaths can be distinguished.Although useful in direct estimation of maternal mortality,this type of household survey is expensive and often too Maternal Mortality | 225complex to implement in many countries because it requires large sample sizes. An alternative approach is provided by demographic surveillance systems (DSSs) that exist in selected districts in a few Sub-Saharan African countries,notably the Navrongo DSS in Ghana and the Nouna DSS inBurkina Faso (http://www.indepth-network.org/dss_site_profiles/dss_sites.htm). DSSs continually collect births and deaths in households in the populations in the sites. Unfortunately, the DSSs generally cover small areas,typically a district in a country, so that the maternal mortal-ity estimates based on them do not permit generalization; they can be treated as estimates based on case studies. Health Services Data. Hospitals generally collect data on causes of deaths, including maternal deaths. But lower-level facilities, such as clinics, dispensaries, or health posts, aresometimes omitted in inquiries about maternal mortality.As a result, health services data in Sub-Saharan Africa are often incomplete and misclassified, especially because deaths related to ectopic pregnancy and abortion arerecorded in female wards rather than maternity wards. Inaddition, deaths outside health facilities are generallyexcluded from the health services data. In Sub-SaharanAfrica, where 58 percent of deliveries take place outside ofhealth facilities, maternal mortality using health services data is underestimated (WHO 2005).LEVELS AND TRENDS IN MATERNAL MORTALITY Estimates of maternal mortality based on survey data and models have been compiled at the WHO for 1990, 1995,and 2000. Table 16.1 presents estimates of MMR and thetotal deaths relating to maternal mortality in the years 1990,1995, and 2000, but trends should be interpreted with caution, as the estimates are based on different models.Among regions, Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest MMRover the period 1990-2000. The wide margins of error (not shown in table 16.1) of the MMR estimates, and the methodological approaches employed in the three years,limit analysis of trends over the period (AbouZahr andWardlaw 2003). Table 16.2 shows maternal mortality measures (number of maternal deaths, MMR, and lifetime risk of maternal death) in Sub-Saharan Africa over the period 1990-2000.MMRs of 1,000 or more per 100,000 live births were record-ed in 16 of the Sub-Saharan Africa countries in 1990; thatlevel of MMR was recorded in 21 countries in 1995, and17 countries in 2000 (table 16.2). Many of the countrieswith civil war or unstable governments\u2014including Angola,Burundi, Central African Republic (since 1995), Chad,Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mozambique (except for 1995), Niger,Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Somalia\u2014fell into thatcategory in the 1990s.

Countries for which data are not available for two of the three years are excluded. The estimates are based on mode ls, which were specified differently for each of the years; the data are therefore not strictly comparable, and trends should be interpreted with caution.Table 16.2 Maternal Mortality Measures in Sub-Saharan Africa, by Country, 1990-2000having suffered a conflict, are notable for maintaining maternal mortality ratios above 1,000 maternal deaths per100,000 live births since 1995. Mauritius and Reunion in the Indian Ocean, and Cape Verde in the Atlantic Ocean, and the landlocked country of Botswana have low maternalmortality ratios, atypical of Sub-Saharan Africa. CAUSES AND CORRELATES OF MATERNAL MORTALITY Understanding the causes and correlates of maternal mor- tality is crucial in confronting the challenge of unyieldinghigh rates in Sub-Saharan Africa. Abraham Lilienfeld, a prominent epidemiologist, very appropriately remarked, \"the better we know about the root cause of a problem, thebetter we are in a position to address the problem,\" and in hisbook, Foundations of Epidemiology, cites Benjamin Disraeli's statement, \"The more extensive a man's knowledge of whathas been done, the greater will be his power of knowingwhat to do\" (Lilienfeld 1980). Despite the 1978 Alma AtaDeclaration and the 1987 Safe Motherhood Initiative, thereduction of maternal mortality has been minimal world-wide. The slow improvement in the MMR in the developingworld is due not only to the trend in Sub-Saharan Africa but also to stagnating declines in the regions of Latin Americaand the Caribbean and South Central Asia. In other regions,notably North Africa and Southeast Asia, the MMR is esti-mated to have declined substantially during the 1990s. Suchdivergent trends call for a closer examination of the factorscorrelated with the MMR. Different interactive factors contribute to maternal morbidity and mortality. The range is wide and includes the behavior of families and communities, social status, educa-tion, income, nutritional status, age, parity, and availabilityof health services. It is important to note that non-health sector activities, such as education, water and sanitation, roads and communication, agriculture, and internalsecurity, also influence maternal outcome. In Sub-SaharanAfrica, some of the highest MMRs have been recorded incountries that are in conflict or have large refugee popula-tions, such as Angola and Sierra Leone. Causes of Maternal Deaths About 60 percent of the maternal deaths occur during child- birth and the immediate postpartum period, with 50 percentof these deaths occurring within the first 24 hours of delivery.In a recent study in Eritrea, 16 percent of maternal deathsoccurred during pregnancy, 48 percent during childbirth, and 36 percent postpartum (Ghebrehiwot 2004). Thesefindings imply that the causes of the deaths in this criticalperiod are either the result of labor or worsened by laborand delivery. As noted earlier, the causes of maternal mortality have traditionally been classified as direct and indirect, although the distinction is not always easy to discern (bothwere grouped under pathogenic causes in the previousedition of this book). Pathogenic causes are purely medicaland therefore best determined by health professionals. Mostof the information on pathogenic causes is derived from hospital studies; thus, data from health institutions will continue to be an important source of information fordirect and indirect causes of maternal deaths. Implicit isthe need to educate health professionals on the ICD andprovide updates whenever the ICD definition changes. As anexample, the 10th revision of ICD has introduced a muchbroader definition of maternal death and has expanded onthe categorization of the causes (WHO 1992). This willmake analysis of trends increasingly more difficult becausepast data will need to be adjusted to accommodate the newdefinition in order to make them comparable with morerecent data. Availability and accuracy of data sources influence the study of causes and correlates. For instance, data from hos- pitals or health institutions are limited in that medically certified deaths at these institutions involve only a small andselective fraction of total deaths. This limitation is greatestin Sub-Saharan Africa, where a large proportion of deliver-ies take place at home (WHO 2005). The main direct causes of maternal deaths, accounting for up to 80 percent of cases in Africa, are obstetric hemorrhage, puerperal sepsis, pregnancy-induced hypertension (includ- ing eclampsia), obstructed labor and ruptured uterus, andcomplications of unsafe abortion (see figure 16.1). Threecauses\u2014hemorrhage, sepsis, and eclampsia\u2014account for avast majority of deaths, considering that even some cases ofabortion or obstructed labor eventually succumb to eitherbleeding or sepsis. Indirect causes account for 20 to 25 percent of maternal deaths and are attributable to illnesses aggravated by preg-nancy (WHO 2005). They include anemia; malaria;HIV/AIDS; diseases of the heart, lung, liver, or kidneys; and ectopic pregnancies. Physical violence and accidents are notincluded in this group. As documented by several DHS surveys, many African women enter pregnancy in a state of nutritional deficit and therefore are unprepared to cope with the extra physiological 228 | Khama O. Rogo, John Oucho, and Philip Mwalalidemands of pregnancy. In Eritrea, for example, 37.3 percent of women have a low body mass index, which is an indica-tor of chronic energy deficiency (Eritrea National Statistics and Evaluation Office and ORC Macro 2002). The nutri- tional deficit, macro- or micronutrient, predisposes thesewomen to anemia in pregnancy, among other problems.Anemia is highly prevalent in Africa, with up to three-fifths of pregnant women in Africa having some degree of anemia, and about one-third classified as having severe anemia (Isahet al. 1985; Massawe et al. 1996; Massawe et al. 1999; Van denBroek and Letsky 2000). Anemia may cause death on its ownor predispose a woman to severe postpartum hemorrhageleading to death (Harrison 1997). The growing HIV/AIDS pandemic is also having a severe impact on women's health. It is estimated that there were 5 million new HIV infections in 2003, of which 40 percentwere among women and 20 percent among children (UnitedNations 2003). In eastern and southern Africa, between 20and 30 percent of pregnant women are infected with HIV ,and available evidence indicates that HIV/AIDS currentlyaccounts for at least 18 percent of maternal deaths. Death inthis case results from opportunistic infections, puerperalsepsis, meningitis, tuberculosis, pneumonia, postabortionsepsis, encephalitis, and probably malaria (Mbaruku 2005;Pattinson et al. 2005). Unsafe abortion deserves special mention in Africa, the only region where complications of abortion are themost common cause of maternal mortality. Globally, unsafeabortion accounts for about 13 percent of maternal deathscompared with 30 to 50 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa (AGI1999; Henshaw, Singh, and Haas 1999). Of the estimated46 million induced abortions globally every year, about 20 million are considered unsafe. It is estimated that 95 per-cent of unsafe abortions occur in the developing world(Henshaw, Singh, and Haas 1999). The WHO (1998) esti-mated that there were about 5 million induced abortions inAfrica annually, whereas Rogo (1993), using the results ofseveral DHS surveys, estimated that there were 1.5 million induced abortions, most of which were unsafe. The tragedyof abortion-related mortality in Africa is that most of thevictims are teenagers. The unsafe abortion conundrum in Africa begins with unprotected sex among teenagers who are ill-informed about their sexuality; an unwanted or ill-timed pregnancyfollows. Living in countries where induced abortions arelegally restricted, the young victims resort to back streetabortionists or quacks. Crude methods used in the pregnancy termination, delay in seeking medical attention when and ifthere is a problem, and the poor quality of postabortion carelead to a significant proportion of the victims sustainingserious injuries with life-threatening complications, result-ing in either death or disability. For survivors the psycho-logical impact is immense and lifelong (Rogo 2004). Postabortal sepsis is worse in HIV/AIDS-infected women (Mbaruku 2005). Determinants of Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Available evidence indicates that there are several factors that predispose a woman to greater risk of maternal death.The common biomedical approach to the determinants ofmaternal morbidity and mortality usually divides them intodistal and proximal factors. The seminal work by McCarthy and Maine (1992) is credited with the conceptual model of analyzing determi- nants of maternal mortality that could be applied toresearch as well as programs. The concept grouped thedeterminants as: distant, or socioeconomic, factors; intermediate factors (health behavior and status, access to services, and unknown factors); outcomes (pregnancy, morbidity, and mortality). The McCarthy and Maine concept has since been modi- fied, most notably by UNICEF (1999), to facilitate strategic programming for maternal health. From the pediatricperspective, the Mosley and Chen (1984) framework for thestudy of child survival in developing countries has alsofound, with various modifications, utility in the analysis of Maternal Mortality | 229Hemorrhage 25% WHO 16.1 Major Causes of Maternal Mortality in Sub-Saharan Africadeterminants of maternal morbidity and mortality. The original model proposed three levels of determinants of child mortality (socioeconomic determinants, proximate and biological determinants, and outcomes expressed interms of growth and death), but subsequent modificationshave expanded the levels to five: household characteristics(behavioral), intermediate variables (behavioral and bio- logical), risk factors (biological), malnutrition-infection syndrome, and demographic outcome (van Norren and vanViannen 1986). The Poverty Reduction Strategy approachdeveloped by the World Bank and sector-wide approaches to the health sector have generated new interest for incorpo- rating government policies and actions, within or outsidethe health sector, that focus on health outcomes. Edwards (2001), by expanding on previous models, introduced themacroeconomic evaluation of non-health sector policiesthat influence health. These developments are relevant to maternal health and can be applied to generating a more comprehensive under- standing of determinants and correlates of maternal healthin Africa. The following modified framework is proposed asappropriate for discussing the correlates of maternalmortality in Africa: household and community characteristics (behavior, cultural-religious values, and income poverty) biological-demographic variables and risk factors malnutrition-infection syndrome (including protein-energy malnutrition [PEM], micronutrient deficiencies,anemia, malaria, and HIV/AIDS) health systems national policies and related investments (health andnonhealth). Household and Community Characteristics. Pregnancy outcome and maternal survival have strong correlations with household behavior and decision making. Enlightenedcommunities value their mothers and seek prompt attentionat the earliest indication of problems. Low status of womenin the household and society as a whole, as exemplified byinequality in education, employment, property ownership,participation, and decision making, is another importantcorrelate (Wall 1998). Gender-based violence is common in situations in which the status of women is low and legalprotection inadequate, and in turn it is correlated with highrates of maternal mortality. Harmful traditional practices and religious beliefs also adversely affect maternal health. They vary from one ethnicgroup to another and cover a wide range of activities andpractices; from the sexual or genitally linked ones, such asfemale genital cutting, to feeding and nutritional practices.In addition, a plethora of harmful beliefs and practicesaround pregnancy and childbirth affe ct health-seeking behavior during pregnancy and parturition. The dispropor- tionately low use of health facilities for delivery care is testi- mony to the strength of these beliefs (Ghebrehiwot 2004). Household poverty, allocation of resources, and the con- trol of those resources also influence maternal mortality. Delivery of infants is not free of charge in many Africancountries. Indeed, it was never without cost in traditionalsocieties either. Even in countries where delivery is declaredto be free in public facilities, the cost of accessing care, bothdirect and indirect, can be prohibitive, quality notwith-standing. The relationship to poverty is bi-directional;complications of pregnancy were cited as one of the mostcommon causes of household poverty (Borghi et al. 2003;Claeson et al. 2001). Biological-Demographic V ariables and Risk Factors. Standard biological variables, such as age, height, and parity,apply to maternal mortality in Africa as elsewhere. In manycountries of Sub-Saharan Africa, at least 50 percent ormore of women will have started childbearing by age 19.Adolescents comprise about 20 percent of maternal deaths,most of which are due to complications of unsafe abortion.Early marriage and childbearing are associated with high parity and therefore higher risk of maternal death(Ghebrehiwot 2004). Various indicators of maternal statusduring pregnancy and childbirth may also be predictors ofmaternal outcome, including edema, hypertension, andhistory of previous complications (Garenne et al. 1997).Sociodemographic factors are correlates of maternal mor- tality. Marital status, first pregnancy, and level of education are commonly cited (Garenne et al. 1997). Malnutrition-Infection Syndrome. Malaria remains a major killer of women in pregnancy and a leading indirect cause of maternal mortality. There are effective interven-tions, such as intermittent preventive treatment andinsecticide-treated bednets that are affordable but often notavailable where they are most needed. The changing com- plexities of malaria chemotherapy and the rising cost ofnewer, more effective combinations pose new challenges,including safety in pregnancy (Heymann et al. 1990;Shulman et al. 1999). 230 | Khama O. Rogo, John Oucho, and Philip MwalaliHIV/AIDS and its effect on maternal outcomes in Africa is grossly underreported. HIV is not regarded as a primary cause of death unless AIDS is diagnosed. A study in South Africa reported a 25 percent increase in seropositivity, from50 to 75 percent between 1997-99 and 2000, in maternaldeaths due to non-pregnancy-related sepsis in Pretoria(Pattinson and Moodley 2002). HIV infection in pregnancy is also associated with anemia and severe malaria infections (Antelman et al. 2000). As previously mentioned, both PEM and micronutrient deficiencies are prevalent in African women. Pregnancy aggravates the situation and increases vulnerability to anyconcurrent condition or opportunistic infection. Paul(1993), in analyzing maternal mortality in Africa from 1980 to 1987 found a strong correlation with calorie supply as apercentage of requirements. Maternal anemia, howevermild, also increases several-fold the risk of life-threateningpostpartum hemorrhage. Health Systems. Poorly financed and unaccountable health systems, including weak referral systems, are a key determinant of maternal outcome. Another determinant ispoor access to quality maternal health care services becauseof geographical terrain and poor roads. Maternal health careservices are deemed to be of poor quality if, for example, they lack skilled health providers, the providers have nega-tive attitudes, treatment guidelines and protocols are inap-propriate, and they lack essential drugs, equipment, andsupplies. A low health personnel-to-population ratio is achronic issue in Sub-Saharan Africa. For instance, the healthpersonnel-to-population ratio in Sub-Saharan Africa isreported as 1:23,540, ranging from 1:750 in South Africa to1:72,000 in Rwanda. For nurses, the Sub-Saharan Africanhealth personnel-to-population ratio is 1:3,460, rangingfrom 1:600 in Zambia to 1:5,470 in Tanzania (Howson,Harrison, and Law 1996). Given that skilled birth attendants working within a supportive health system are the most important factor in keeping women healthy and safe in pregnancy, inadequatenumbers and distribution of human resources are a majorunderlying cause of maternal mortality in Sub-SaharanAfrica. Although the use of skilled attendants at deliveryincreased significantly in the developing world as a whole,from 41 percent in 1990 to 57 percent in 2003, the greatestimprovements were in Southeast Asia and North Africaand the least in Sub-Saharan Africa (http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mi/goals_2005/goal_5.pdf). A recent WHO reportindicates an average of 42 percent in the Africa Region,implying no change from the 1990 global average (WHO2005). Although there is no specific comparative rate, in its global estimates on births attended by skilled personnel the WHO (2005) reported 46.2 percent for Africa with thelowest rates in East Africa (32.5 percent) and West Africa(39.7 percent) (http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/global_monitoring/skilled_attendant.html). Figure 16.2 shows that the higher the proportion of deliv- eries with a skilled attendant in a country, the lower the country's MMR. Furthermore, most of the Sub-SaharanAfrica countries (not labeled) are above the regression line.Lack of or poorly functioning health management informa-tion systems with an effective feedback loop as well as weaksupervision are further challenges influencing the quality ofmaternal services and MMRs. National Policies and Investments. For any program or strategy on maternal health and safe motherhood to succeed, it must have the support of the highest level ofnational authority. Such support facilitates the allocation ofadequate financial and human resources; improves theinfrastructure and communications; and puts in place effec-tive and implementable standards, policies, and protocols.Most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have not addressedpolicy issues, even where the policies have been shown tohave significant influence on maternal mortality. Romaniaprovides the best example for the developing world of theimpact of changes in policy.

In the 1950s and early 1960s,the law provided for access to abortion and was associatedwith relatively low mortality ratios. The restrictions onabortion that followed was associated with significant increase in the MMR in the 1980s. Immediately after theDecember 1989 revolution that overthrew President NicolaeCeaus \u00b8escu, restrictions on contraceptives were removed and abortion legalized. Subsequently, with the precipitous drop in abortion-related mortality, the MMR dropped. Changing the abortion policy reduced maternal mor- tality by more than half in less than 10 years. Therefore, bychanging the underlying policy-related causes, Sub-SaharanAfrican countries have the potential of achieving reduc- tions in maternal mortality. In most Sub-Saharan Africancountries, despite many international pronouncements,high-level support for maternal health and measures toreduce maternal mortality and unsafe abortion is weak ornonexistent. Inadequate financing and sustainability of the health sec- tor in general and of reproductive health in particular, areother barriers. In most African countries, health expendi-tures have not increased substantially while major problemsin allocation efficiency and inequities exist (World Bank2005). With various competing priorities for a dwindlingfinancial resource base, the health sector needs to do a bet- ter job in reclaiming its rightful share. Moreover, given theinadequate investment, the number of health personneltrained is often small, and once trained, many open privateclinics or emigrate to developed countries to earn a betterliving.REDUCING MATERNAL MORTALITY: PRIORITY INTERVENTIONS AND LESSONS Many lessons have been learned on what works in maternal health. These have led to the identification of key interven-tions for the reduction of maternal morbidity and mortalityin the developing world. Priority Interventions The past two decades have witnessed significant shifts inthinking about effective interventions for improving mater-nal outcomes in poor countries, from the Maternal andChild Health program to the Safe Motherhood Initiative,with its \"Pillars,\" and the Making Pregnancy Safer program (Starrs 1998; http://w3.whosea.org/pregnancy/chap1f.htm).More recently, the case for identifying and investing in themost effective interventions for safe motherhood has domi-nated the debates (AbouZahr, Wardlaw, and Hill 2001).There is evidence of effective clinical interventions that savelives, but less is known about the best strategies for acceler-ating reduction of maternal mortality in developing coun-tries, especially in Africa and South Asia (De findings ofthe World Bank's analysis for the decline in maternal mor-tality in Malaysia and Sri Lanka in the past 50 to 60 yearsand the magnitude of health system expenditures on mater-nal health are relevant to Africa (World Bank 2003). Malaysia and Sri Lanka have succeeded in reducing maternal mortality to levels comparable to those in indus- trial countries in the last few decades. Expanded female lit-eracy in Sri Lanka and strong economic performance byMalaysia helped promote these gains. The World Bankanalysis confirmed that maternal mortality can be halved indeveloping countries every 7 to 10 years and is affordable, regardless of income level and economic growth rate; steady,modest investment in poverty reduction and in maternalhealth services to improve access to and quality of emer-gency obstetric care are required. Removal of financial barriers to maternal care was an important step in both countries, as was increased access toskilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care.Recording and reporting of maternal deaths was a prerequi-site to addressing the challenges of reducing maternalmortality in both countries. Other important lessons werethat governments can afford to provide the critical elementsof maternal care free of charge to clients and that different 232 | Khama O.

The transition from high to low MMR passes through several phases characterized by the following: high MMR: low levels of skilled attendance and emer- gency obstetric care (EmOC) declining MMR: medium levels of skilled attendance andEmOC low MMR: high levels of skilled attendance and EmOC. Except for South Africa and Botswana, most of Sub- Saharan Africa falls in the first category, \"high MMR\u2014low levels of skilled attendance and EmOC.\" This status calls forestablishing a solid foundation for effective maternity care,increasing access to care, and ensuring appropriate use ofavailable services through community mobilization andimproved quality. Elements of the foundation to supporteffective maternal care in Malaysia and Sri Lanka includedprofessionalization of midwifery, civil registration of births,compilation of data on maternal deaths, and replication oflocal success. These elements do not always need additionalresources but require focused leadership and effective management. Improving Emergency Obstetric Care: The Three Levels of Delay It is clear from the foregoing that accelerating the decline of maternal mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa and realization ofthe Millennium Development Goals will require the provi- sion of a synergistic package of health and social services that reaches everyone, especially deprived populations. The framework model of three delays has been applied to analyze the constraints, opportunities, and systems required at different levels of a safe motherhood program (box 16.1).This framework serves as a useful planning tool for theactions required at every level of health care while empha-sizing the need to link these levels through transport andcommunication, supervision, and community outreaches.Thus, community awareness and trust and better access toand quality of emergency transport reinforce each other to improve maternal outcome. In an integrated essential healthcare package, this network enhances provision of otherservices, such as family planning and immunization, whilepromoting emphasis on skilled attendance. The model is advocated by the Regional Prevention of Maternal Mortality Network (PMMN 1995) and is rapidlygaining ground in Africa. Using a modified \"Four Levels ofDelay\" approach to analyze maternal mortality in Eritrea, Ghebrehiwot (2004) attributed the causes of death to thefollowing processes: Delay One: failure or delay in recognition of danger signs\u201433 percent of maternal deaths Delay Two: delay in deciding to seek care\u201440 percent ofthe cases Delay Three: delay in reaching appropriate care\u201419 per-cent of cases Delay Four: delay in receiving appropriate care\u201452 per-cent of cases. This simple framework appears ideal for Sub-Saharan Africa. It works well and supports local partners in finding tailor-made solutions to challenges posed in each specificsetting and making service more responsive to local com-munity needs. It can also be used to improve data collectionand use at the local level. The first level involves a primary health care bottoms-up approach with active community involvement (men and women) and focused comprehensive development pro-grams wherein reproductive health and safe motherhoodare appropriately integrated into the district health system. The second level entails expanding access to qualityservices, including functional linkages between communi-ties and health facilities in regard to transport and commu-nication. This leads to the final level, where appropriatequality of services is provided to clients on arrival at thehealth facility.

Rogo, John Oucho, and Philip MwalaliA Tanzania case study (Urassa et al. 1997) depicts a typical finding from most maternal mortality reviews in Africa. A large proportion of women die because of delayed decision making at home, lack of transport, and inappropriate care if they make it alive to a health facility. This confirms the observation that reduction of high maternal mortality demands a strong focus on each level of delay throughcreation of an effective system providing EmOC. Linksbetween the different levels of the health care system, from community through the basic health center (basic EmOC)to the referral hospital (comprehensive EmOC) are critical. CONCLUSION Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa face the challenge of iden- tifying the base MMR to be reduced by the prescribedproportion in view of the conflicting MMR statistics from country-based studies and global estimates. Because of the difficulties in assessing MMR, different methodologies havebeen used. The use of different approaches complicatesthe comparison and study of trends and causes of maternal mortality, owing to variations in coverage, reference dates, and data presentation. Two Millennium Development Goals are of direct relevance to maternal and newborn health: goal 4, to reducechild mortality, and goal 5, to improve maternal health. Thelatter goal is aimed at reducing the 1990 MMRs by 75 per-cent by 2015. The probability of reaching this goal in most Sub-Saharan Africa countries is highly questionable giventhat most countries have shown little or no change in theirMMRs and in a few countries they have even increased(World Bank 2004). Evidence from Sri Lanka and Malaysiashows that maternal mortality reduction can be acceleratedthrough joint government and community action. For Sub-Saharan Africa, this calls for the establishment of a solidfoundation for effective maternity care and increasing accessand use of services. Monitoring of maternal care servicesand audits of maternal deaths are crucial to this effort. Further exploration into maternal mortality, especially the underlying factors in Sub-Saharan Africa, is necessary, as are improved data collection systems, credibility in dissemi-nation of data, and realistic estimates where information isdeficient. Without good sources of data, Sub-Saharan Africawill continue to rely on model estimates, which could bemisleading and de-motivating. For instance, the WHO,UNICEF, and UNFPA estimates, the best and most quoted,vary significantly from those obtained from country-basedstudies (AbouZahr and Wardlaw 2003). In some countries,the estimates are double those reported from country-basedstudies, and underreporting was presented as the mainfactor. For instance, WHO, UNFPA, and UNICEF estimates reflect Kenya's MMR of 1,300 maternal deaths per 100,000live births against the 590 maternal deaths per 100,000 livebirths reported by the DHS (AbouZahr and Wardlaw 2003).Also, the WHO, UNFPA, and UNICEF estimate for Tanzaniawas 1,500 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, comparedwith the DHS estimate of 529 maternal deaths per 100,000live births (AbouZahr and Wardlaw 2003). These discrepan-cies are enormous and have significant implications inregard to the Millennium Development Goals. Increasing interest in the \"near-miss population\" pro- vides an opportunity to explore the underlying causes and correlates of maternal morbidity and mortality. Near-miss population is defined as individuals who present to the health facilities with life-threatening conditions or develop life-threatening complications while under management(Filippi et al. 2000; Kaye et al. 2003; Mantel et al. 1998). Thisis a special category of survivors, whose stories provideunique insights and valuable information on maternalmortality. In the absence of accurate and detailed informa-tion on maternal deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa, increaseduse of studies on the near-miss population could provideuseful lessons. Such studies could provide information onthe sequence of events leading to complications anddescribe critical life-saving interventions. Comparativestudies between the near misses and deaths occurring in the same institution or communities could further clarify thefactors contributing to or averting deaths.

Rogo, John Oucho, and Philip Mwalali237The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was first recognized as a disease in the early 1980s. Withinabout five years it became clear that a new epidemic of unprecedented proportions was spreading throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. Destruction of the immune system,the main characteristic of the disease, caused patients todie from a range of opportunistic infections. As the opportunistic infections that occurred reflected the prevalence of given pathogens in the afflicted population,tuberculosis was one of the most common outcomes inAfrica. Soon after the recognition of AIDS, a new groupof retroviruses, subsequently designated the humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV), was identified as theprobable cause (Barre-Sinoussi et al. 1983; Gallo et al. 1984; Kitchen et al. 1984; Popovic et al. 1984). Some peo-ple were reluctant to accept the evidence that HIV wasthe cause of AIDS, both in the West and in Africa(Duesberg 1988). Many political leaders also chose to ig-nore or deny the importance of the expanding epidemicuntil after widespread transmission of HIV had alreadyoccurred.DEVELOPMENT OF THE AIDS PANDEMIC In retrospect, it is clear that several characteristics of HIV/AIDS resulted in a serious underestimation of theimportance of the epidemic by both individuals and societies. One feature of HIV/AIDS that is highly unusual for an infectious disease is its consistently long incubationperiod combined with a high rate of disease development.Most organisms cause clinical signs or symptoms in only a fraction of those they infect. When infection occurs, as in diseases such as measles or smallpox, the inductionperiod is short. HIV/AIDS is unique in that it regularlycauses lethal disease after a prolonged induction period thatlasts several years. As a result, the vast majority of HIV-infected people are clinically asymptomatic and do notknow they are infected unless they undergo serologic test- ing. Because HIV-infected asymptomatic people can trans-mit the virus to others, the epidemic accelerates robustly. Insome settings, a significant fraction of the populationbecomes infected before disease and death have providedthe most evident lesson of the need for vigilance.Chapter17 HIV/AIDS Souleymane Mboup, Rosemary Musonda, Fred Mhalu, and Max EssexHIV/AIDS is also difficult to control because it is a sexu- ally transmitted disease. In most societies both leaders and citizens are reluctant to discuss sex. Although condoms are efficient in preventing infection, they are often not an avail-able option, for example, when couples wish to have chil-dren. The image of AIDS as a sexually transmitted diseasealso contributes to the stigmatization of infected people, which in turn may cause many to avoid testing to determine their status. The variability in clinical outcomes also contributed to the difficulty in controlling the spread of HIV , particularly during the early stages of the epidemic. Tuberculosis,Kaposi's sarcoma, and chronic diarrhea can all occur in theabsence of HIV infection. In the absence of testing for HIV , it is still possible for AIDS patients with such outcomes, andtheir families, to deny the infection and perhaps avoid someof the associated discrimination and stigma. As a societalproblem, AIDS is also devastating because it usually attacksyoung adults during their most productive years of employ-ment and parenting. Because both parents are ofteninfected, AIDS epidemics ordinarily leave large numbers oforphans behind. RATES OF HIV/AIDS IN AFRICA In its most recent projections, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has estimated thatabout 40 million people are currently infected with HIV , ofwhom about 25.8 million, or 64 percent of the total, are inSub-Saharan Africa (UNAIDS and WHO 2005). The esti- mates are that 4.9 million people became infected during2005, of whom 3.2 million, or 65 percent, were in Sub-Saharan Africa. During the same year, 77 percent of an esti-mated global burden of 3.1 million AIDS deaths were pro-jected for Sub-Saharan Africa. During recent years, the useof antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in the United States and otherdeveloped countries has dramatically reduced AIDS deathrates, but until now, only a small proportion of AIDSpatients in Sub-Saharan Africa have received treatment (see figure 17.1). Several factors account for the low fraction of AIDS patients receiving ARV treatment. One of the largest is thecost of the drugs. Until recently, all the major ARV drugswere prohibitively expensive in developing countries. Thissituation is now changing, but ARV drugs and medical careare still out of reach for the majority of AIDS patients inAfrica. The global burden of AIDS is disproportionate incountries whose gross national productivity represents a small fraction of the global economy (see figure 17.1). Wide variation in HIV prevalence rates also occurs with- in Africa (Essex and Mboup 2002). However, overall adultrates of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa are about 7.2 percent,much higher than in other regions of the world, includingother regions with large populations living in developing countries (see figure 17.2). Rates of HIV are low in NorthAfrica, although countries that span the Sahara, such asSudan, have higher rates than those countries on the north-ern coast. Within Sub-Saharan Africa, the AIDS epidemic was noticed first in central Africa (Clumeck et al. 1983). Soonafter, the epidemic was observed in East Africa, and sub-sequently in West Africa (Essex and Mboup 2002).

Six countries of southern Africa have adult prevalence rates of 20 percent or higher, and the mean prevalence rate for allof southern Africa is about 18 percent. The mean adult prevalence rate in Sub-Saharan Africa is 7.2 percent, whereas the mean rates in Asia are 0.4 percent(see table 17.1). Haiti, with a prevalence rate of 5.6 percent,has the highest outside of Africa, and Cambodia, with2.6 percent, has the highest in Asia (UNAIDS 2004). Brazil,one of the few countries outside of the West that began ARVtreatment at an early stage, has an estimated adult preva-lence rate of 0.7 percent.The overall burden that HIV/AIDS has placed on Sub- Saharan Africa is unprecedented. It is now the most common cause of death in the region (WHO 1999). It hasbeen estimated that by the year 2010 life expectancy at birthcould be decreased by at least 15 years in most of the region and by 30 years or more in five countries (Stanecki andWalker 2002). Population growth rates would fall andinfant mortality rates would increase. It has been estimatedthat mortality rates for children under five could experi-ence a fivefold increase in Botswana and Zimbabwe(Stanecki and Walker 2002). All these projections, however,assume that ARV drugs are not being used to save lives inthe region. This is an assumption that, fortunately, is no longer valid. RETROVIRUSES Prior to the AIDS epidemic and the discovery of HIV , retro- viruses were known to exist and were associated with certainleukemias of animals and people. Such \"oncoretroviruses\"were characterized by an ability to replicate without killingthe cells they infect. Lentiretroviruses, which include the HIVs, usually replicate at higher levels and kill the cells theyinfect. All retroviruses use reverse transcription of the viri-on RNA to replicate, and they produce a proviral DNA formthat can remain latent in host cell chromosomes. All retro-viruses also generate a high rate of mutations when tran-scribing the RNA, but the error rate is highest for thoseviruses that replicate to high levels, such as HIV . The high mutation rate facilitates a rapid rate of evolu- tionary change for HIVs. Another feature of the viruses that promotes rapid variation is the diploid nature of the viralRNA. With two complete copies of the genome packagedin each virus particle, recombinational events are also fre-quent, allowing progeny viruses to pick up large segmentsof somewhat different genetic information in a short periodof time. An extremely important aspect of the rate of evolution- ary variation for HIVs is the selection pressure exerted bythe host. This aspect is vividly illustrated by the rapid emer-gence of drug-resistant variations of HIV . Resistance occursrapidly in a single individual, particularly when only onedrug is used. The same type of competition occurs during host-mediated immunoselection pressure, in which viralvariants emerge to avoid control by epitope-specific hostimmune responses. The process is repeated frequently andcyclically; the dominant clone of the virus elicits a new HIV/AIDS | 239Regions and countries Prevalence (%) Dominant subtype East Africa 6.7 A (50%) Tanzania 8.8 Various Uganda 4.1 A (60%) North Africa 0.3 B (/H1102295%) Egypt, Rep. of /H110210.1 B ( /H1102295%) Morocco 02 Senegal 0.8 CRF 02 Asia 0.4 01 ( /H1102290%) China 0.1 CRF 07,08 1.5 CRF 01 ( /H1102290%) Caribbean 1.6 B (90%) Haiti 5.6 B (90%) Latin America 0.6 B (90%) Brazil 0.7 B (80%) North America 0.6 B (/H1102290%) United States 0.6 B ( /H1102290%) Western Europe 0.3 B (/H1102290%) Italy 0.5 B (70%) Source: Country-specific prevalence data from UNAIDS 2004.

Many of the mutations and recombinational events result in the emergence of genomes that are incapable of repli- cation. This occurs because viruses, to be viable, must foldtheir proteins in specific ways and retain reactive sites thatsignal key events. All HIVs, for example, must retain the ability to bind to the CD4 receptors and chemokine core- ceptors, such as CCR5 and CXCR4, on T lymphocytes andmacrophages. This in turn forces a certain level of conver-gent evolution. As progressive cycles of HIV mutant clones begin to exhaust the immune control capacity of the host, the num-ber of dying lymphocytes exceeds the capacity for cell replacement and the number of CD4 lymphocytes rapidlyfalls. As plasma viral load reaches levels of 50,000 copies permilliliter and above, and the number of CD4 lymphocytesdrops to 300 per cubic millimeter and below, the ability ofthe body to resist opportunistic infections is largely lost, andclinical AIDS develops. REGIONAL VARIATION Soon after HIV-1 was identified, other lentiretroviruses were identified in primates. These included a wide range of simi-an immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) and a second category of HIVs in people in West Africa, designated HIV-2s (Barin et al. 1985). The SIVs naturally infected large fractions ofpopulations of various species of African monkeys, appar-ently without causing disease (Kanki, Homma, et al. 1985). The SIVs did, however, cause clinical AIDS when artificially injected into Asian macaques (Daniel et al. 1985; Kanki,McLane, et al. 1985). Some of the SIVs were virtually indistinguishable from HIV-2s at the genetic level, although SIVs and HIV-2s were usually 50 to 60 percent different from HIV-1s. HIV-2s alsocause an AIDS-like disease in people, but with considerably less efficiency than HIV-1s (Marlink et al. 1994). HIV-2swere much less transmissible, both by sexual contact and bymother-to-infant transmission (Kanki, Sankale, and Mboup2002). Presumably because of this dramatic reduction intransmission efficiency, HIV-2 has been largely limited toWest Africa, and it has not caused any of the large epidemicstypical of HIV-1. Many different categories of HIV-1s have been identified, with at least six of them linked to major epidemics. The dif-ferent categories of HIV-1s are usually designated clades, orsubtypes, and viruses of one subtype differ from those ofanother subtype by an average of 20 to 30 percent in geneticsequence. Two of the six common categories of HIV-1swere found to be circulating recombinant forms (CRFs)(McCutchan 2000). The first major category of HIV-1 to be identified and categorized was subtype HIV-1B, which is responsible forthe epidemics in the Americas and Western Europe. Theseepidemics have been characterized by patterns that reflectprimary transmission via homosexual contact and injec-tion drug use. HIV-1B has also been found in other sites,such as India, South Africa, and Thailand. Even in thesesites, HIV-1B infections have not been associated with het- erosexual epidemics, although heterosexual epidemics due to other HIV subtypes have occurred concurrently in the same sites (Hudgens et al. 2002; Janssens, Buve, andNkengasong 1997). The most common HIV in the world and in Africa is HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C). HIV-1C accounts for as manyinfections as all other HIVs combined, both in the worldand in Africa (Essex 1999). It is responsible for the massiveepidemic in southern Africa, and all the countries in Africa that have the highest rates of HIV have HIV-1C epidemics.Along with an epidemic expansion that plateaued at thehighest levels, the HIV-1C epidemic in southern Africaexpanded faster than other HIV epidemics, although itstarted later (Essex and Mboup 2002). The next most important HIV virus in Africa, and in the world, is CRF 02, a recombinant form that originated from an HIV-1A and an HIV-1G. This virus accounts for about25 percent of the world's infections (Essex and Mboup 2002). It is largely responsible for the epidemics in West Africa and central Africa. Although mean prevalence rates inthese regions are only 5 percent and 6 percent, respectively,they represent some sites with large populations, such asNigeria. East Africa has had epidemics of HIV-1A andHIV-1D, often coexisting in the same populations (Rayfield et al. 1998). A few countries, such as Tanzania in the east andCameroon in the west, have a wide variety of viruses presentin the same site (Fonjungo et al. 2000; Renjifo et al. 1999). InTanzania, for example, an earlier epidemic of HIV-1A andHIV-1D fused with the northward expansion of the HIV-1Cepidemic. This apparently resulted in the generation of alarge number of recombinant viruses (Renjifo et al. 1999). Aschematic distribution of the major subtypes and CRFs inAfrica is illustrated in figure 17.3. Phenotypic distinctions between the HIV-1 subtypes and CRFs are much less apparent than the differences between 240 | Souleymane Mboup, Rosemary Musonda, Fred Mhalu, and NF KB enhancer sequences, whereas other subtypes have only two, and in the case of HIV-2s, only one (Montanoet al. 1997). This is almost certainly associated with the higher transcriptional activation rates seen for HIV-1Cs (Montano et al. 2000). It is also a possible explanation forthe higher rates of genomic variation (Novitsky et al. 1999)and the higher viral loads reported for HIV-1Cs (Neilson et al. 1999). The efficient spread of HIV-1C is also compati- ble with this subtype's preference for the CCR5 coreceptor(Ping et al. 1999; Tscherning et al. 1998). HIV-1Ds andHIV-1Bs, for example, are much more likely to use theCXCR4 coreceptor than the HIV-1Cs (Tscherning et al.1998), HIV-1D has spread to causelarge epidemics in Africa. Coinfection of individuals with two different HIVs\u2014 different subtypes; different types, such as HIV-1 and HIV-2; or different variants within a subtype\u2014can occur.These events appear to occur less often than might beexpected (Travers et al. 1995), perhaps because of some levelof cross-protection due to activation of chemokines, recep-tor competition, or specific immunity. When the same cellsare coinfected, the opportunity for generation of infectiousrecombinants is substantial.PROGRESSION OF INFECTION After initial exposure to HIV occurs, several weeks go by before the virus can be detected in blood. At least in thecase of HIV-1B infections in homosexual men, an acute, influenza-like illness then occurs in the majority of the infected. This is characterized by high levels of virusreplication reflected in the blood as viremia. Whether thesame flu-like illness occurs at the same rate in heterosexual infections of other HIV-1 subtypes is unclear. During the stage of acute viremia large numbers of T lymphocytes become infected in lymph nodes (Pantaleo et al. 1993), and patients are highly infectious to otherpotential contacts (Quinn and Chaisson 2003). The acuteviremia then falls precipitously, presumably because of aneffective immune response, albeit a response that later becomes largely ineffective as mutant variants emerge. Themagnitude of the acute viremia and the depth of the subse-quent resolution, sometimes called the set point, probablydetermine the subsequent rate of disease progression. For aminority of those infected, a rapid and well-controlled setpoint apparently results in the development of clinical AIDSonly after a very prolonged period of time. Such individualsare sometimes called \"long-term nonprogressors.\" The length of time before disease development may also be related to other factors, such as the infected individual'sgenetic background (Winkler and O'Brien 2002), nutri- tional state, and parasite burden of coinfecting microorgan- isms. Antigenic stimulation of infected cells causes DNAsynthesis, which in turn causes activation and replication oflatent HIV . The tissue damage caused by other infectionsalso stimulates the release of inflammatory cytokines, whichalso causes transcriptional activation of HIV (Montanoet al. 2000). With all these variables, however, clinical AIDSrarely occurs before 4 to 5 years after infection, and almostalways occurs within 10 to 12 years after infection. In theabsence of therapy, death usually occurs within 1 to 3 yearsafter the onset of clinical AIDS. PREVENTION Methods of preventing HIV infection can be divided into those that are currently available, such as education, andthose that are not yet available but are being pursuedthrough research, such as vaccines.

The serology tests used to determine if blood is contaminated are highly sensitive and specific, although an infectious unit of blood can occasionally be missed if the donor was infected within the two to threeweeks before donation, before antibodies had time todevelop. The use of contaminated needles or injectionequipment is sometimes an important method of transmis- sion in defined populations, but it is not nearly as important as sexual transmission, at least in Africa. Voluntary testing and counseling programs are extremely important to reduce sexual transmission. A major limitation in most countries is the reluctance of most people to gettested and thus learn their status. Such reluctance may beparticularly evident where infected individuals have few or no opportunities for treatment with ARV . In such situationsconcerns about stigma and death from the infection mayprovide disincentives for the individual to learn his or herstatus. Condoms are highly effective when used properly. Abstinence provides a guarantee against sexual infection.But neither abstinence nor condoms allow couples to havechildren. The use of ARVs for chemoprophylaxis is effective in pre- venting transmission of HIV from infected mothers to their infants. In the absence of intervention, 25 to 45 percent of infants born to HIV-positive mothers become infected. Theinfection occurs in utero, during the process of birth, andthrough breastfeeding. The use of ARVs, such as zidovudine(AZT), was shown to reduce neonatal transmission by asmuch as 67 percent in nonbreastfeeding populations ifgiven at least six to eight weeks before birth (Connor et al.1994). Even when given only at the time of labor, nevirapine(NVP) apparently reduced intrapartum transmissions byas much as 50 percent (Guay et al. 1999). The use of drugcombinations early in gestation can presumably reduce inutero and intrapartum transmission to only a few percent. Avoidance of breastfeeding can obviously eliminate post- natal infections by this route. However, in many cultures recommendations for formula feeding are not well received,in part because of the stigma associated with bottle feedingof the infant. The effectiveness of chemoprophylaxis to theinfant or the mother, or both, while breastfeeding is beingevaluated. ARV drugs can also be used to block transmission of HIV by accidental needlestick infections, such as those that might occur among medical personnel treating AIDS patients(Bouvet, Laporte, and Tarantola 2002). The same three-drugcombinations, such as AZT, lamivudine (3TC), and NVP ,that are used for treatment of AIDS, are highly effective if given within hours after the presumed exposure. The sameinterventions can be used for victims of sexual violence. VACCINES AND MICROBICIDES Effective vaccines that exist against other viral diseases arebased on the injection of either killed virus, purified viralsurface proteins, or live attenuated virus. All three types are commonly used in people. The Salk polio vaccine is killed virus, the vaccine used against hepatitis B is a purified viralsurface protein, and the Sabin oral polio vaccine is a liveattenuated virus. The killed virus and viral protein approaches can function only by inducing virus-neutralizing antibodies. The live attenuated types of vaccine often induceboth neutralizing antibodies and cytolytic T cell immunity. The use of live attenuated HIV as a vaccine was largely dismissed, even at the earliest stages, because of safety con- cerns. Killed HIV was similarly dismissed for safety concernsand because it was assumed that subunit surface proteins would work as well as killed virus without the same safetyconcerns, as was true of the hepatitis B vaccine. As a result,almost all the initial experimental vaccines were based onthe use of HIV proteins gp120 or gp160 that protrude fromthe outer surface of the virus. As HIVs grown in cultured cell lines provided the highest titers for subsequent purification, the first vaccines weremade from T-cell-line adapted gp120/160 proteins. It wassoon recognized that the neutralizing antibodies these vac-cines induced were ineffective against naturally occurringHIVs. Subsequently it was also recognized that monomeric gp120/160 proteins induced antibodies that would work only against the exact strain selected. The profoundsequence variation seen among HIVs created a situation inwhich matching the vaccine gp120 to the field challengestrain was not possible. The next wave of HIV vaccine research was based prima- rily on the development of cytolytic T cell (CTL) vaccines.Most were based on the use of nonvirulent viruses, such asvaccinia, the vaccine used for smallpox, or adenoviruses.Genes, or parts of genes, of HIV that were suspected of beingable to induce CTL responses were inserted in the \"vaccinevector viruses\" through gene splicing. HIV antigens or \"CTLepitopes\" must be delivered in this way, because for immu-nity to be effective, recognition of the immunogen must bein conjunction with cell processing to match the HIV anti-gens to the histocompatibility antigens of the recipient. 242 | Mboup, Rosemary Musonda, Fred Mhalu, and Max EssexSeveral CTL vaccines have now been evaluated in people for safety and immunogenicity. In general, they appear to be quite safe, but they do not appear to be sufficiently stimu- lating to elicit strong immune responses that are likely to beprotective. Developing CTL vaccines using other viruses asvectors is an entirely new area of vaccine science. If thesemethods can be mastered, they could probably also be extrapolated for use in combating many other diseases. A major part of the rationale for CTL vaccines was the assumption that they would be more broadly cross-reactive than gp120 vaccines. Viral core proteins are usually more genetically conserved than viral surface proteins, thus reducing antigenic variation and reducing opportunities forimmune selection in the vaccinee to evade effectiveness. Even for CTL vaccines, however, it seems prudent to use therelevant HIV-1 subtype or regional strain to increase thelikelihood of protection. T o maximize the chances that a vaccine may work, most researchers endorse the use of vaccines or vaccine combina- tions that might induce both neutralizing antibodies andCTL responses. This is ordinarily done using a\"prime-boost\"strategy of several inoculations, in which the first (prime)would allow the induction of CTL responses, and the boostwould encourage both CTL and antibody responses. Recently, research to design gp120 antigens that would induce cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies has also beguna new generation of vaccine approaches (Fouts et al. 2000).The concept is based on the stabilization of a conformation-al state of the HIV-1 gp120 at the time it interacts with theCD4 receptor or the CCR5 receptor or both. This and otherapproaches serve to illustrate that HIV vaccine research isalive and well in providing new designs, but is also unlikelyto yield a final product of high efficacy in less than 5 to10 years. Thus, the prevention of further spread of HIVwithin the next decade must be centered on other measures. THERAPY The first phase of therapy using ARV drugs was AZT. Initially it was the only drug, and when used alone it oftengave AIDS patients another six months or so in partialremission. Soon, other related drugs, nucleoside analoguereverse transcriptase stavudine (D4T), were alsoavailable. One of these drugs used with AZT clearly workedbetter than using just one drug alone. However, their useposed two significant problems. One was drug toxicities,which ranged from gastrointestinal problems and anemias to peripheral neuropathies. The other was the rapid genera-tion of drug-resistant variants of HIV , which soon grew justas well in the patient as before the drugs were first used.Using two drugs at once lowered HIV viremia even betterthan using one drug and delayed the time to development ofdrug resistance. However, even with two NRTIs, drug resist-ance often developed within a year, and resistance to one ofthe NRTIs often prompted resistance to other NRTIs of thesame class. The next class of drugs available was the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), such as nevirap- ine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV). These drugs were even eas-ier for the virus to mutate around to cause drug resistance,and this happened within weeks when one of these drugswas given alone, as \"monotherapy.\" However, when given with two or more other drugs, they could often be given forlong periods of time. The third major class of drugs, the protease inhibitors, work on an entirely different gene of HIV , so they provided an additional, separate mechanism to keep down virus repli-cation. However, unlike the NRTIs and the NNRTIs, whichcould often be made \"off patent\" or as \"generics,\" the pro-tease inhibitors are still expensive and generally not availablein developing countries. The standard drug regimen for most developing coun- tries is now a three-drug combination that includes two NRTIs, especially AZT and 3TC, and one NNRTI, such as NVP . In most cases this regimen works well, unless resist-ance to any of the drugs is already present. This happens, forexample, if women have recently been treated with AZT orNVP alone, as part of a chemoprevention strategy to blockinfection of their infant. The use of NVP alone during labor,for example, can cause resistance to the whole NNRTI classof drugs in 20 percent or more of mothers, even when onlyone dose is given (Eshleman et al. 2001). In the West, combination three-drug therapy usually begins earlier than the current recommendations projected for the developing world. In the United States, for example,drug therapy would usually be recommended by the timethe patient fell below 350 CD4 /H11001cells per cubic millimeter or a viral load of less than 25,000 RNA per milliliter. In Africa a consensus is building that the most logical time to initiate therapy is when CD4/H11001cells fall below 200, or when the patient has experienced an AIDS-defining illness. By this time, most patients have viral loads in excess of 50,000 RNA per milliliter. In early studies, disease-free one-year survival rates for patients given a three-drug combination with HIV/AIDS | 243initiation below 200 CD4/H11001cells per cubic millimeter seem to be quite good (Djomand et al. 2003). Rigorous adherence to taking the drugs is essential to increase the time to devel-opment of drug-resistant variants. Many newer drugs anddrug combinations reduce the difficulty of dosing because they are taken only once per day and have fewer gastroin-testinal side effects. Studies using several combinations of three drugs to treat AIDS patients have now been conducted in several Africancountries (Coetzee et al. 2004; Djomand 2002; Wester et al. 2005). The resultsindicate a high degree of success. Despite the initiation oftherapy at low levels of immune competence (for example,10-200 CD4 /H11001cells per cubic millimeter), responses have been good (Coetzee et al. 2004; Laurent et al. 2002; Weidle et al. 2002; Wester et al. 2005). These include survival rates of 85 percent or higher, and escalation of CD4 cell countsof 150 CD4 /H11001cells per cubic millimeter or more by a year after drug initiation. Even patients who began drug therapyat cell counts below 50 CD4 /H11001cells per cubic millimeter, most of whom would probably die within a year if leftuntreated, had surprisingly positive responses. The positive responses occurred in part because most patients showed a strong commitment to adhere to the pre- scribed regimen of drugs. Although different viral subtypesmay show different profiles of drug mutations (Quan et al.2003; Turner et al. 2004), high levels of adherence reducedrates of clinical failure due to drug resistance (Coetzee et al.2004; Laurent et al. 2002; Wester et al. 2005). It is too earlyto know whether HIV drug resistance will become a majorproblem in Africa. However, the widespread use of just oneor two drugs in perinatal chemoprophylaxis clearly resultsin high levels of genotypic resistance in mothers who may soon need the same drugs for their own therapy. Whethersuch drug-resistant variants will be transmitted by sexualcontact remains to be determined. The cost of a basic three-drug regimen, such as AZT, 3TC, and NVP , is now as low as about US$1 per day.Although this is far below the original cost for the samedrugs, it is still above a level that is possible for many in thepoorest countries. The actual cost of treatment, includingcosts of health care personnel, infrastructure, and labora-tory diagnosis and monitoring, is generally substantiallyhigher than the cost of the drugs alone. Initiation on ARV therapy should be possible in many sites in Africa, but costs will also increase as patients become resistant to any of thosedrugs used in the \"first-line\" regimen. Switching to differentregimens may require the use of protease inhibitors or otherdrugs that cost more, as do monitoring costs and theinvolvement of personnel with more specialized skills. Theuse of CD4 counts alone may be adequate for initiation, forexample, but viral load tests and drug resistance tests may benecessary if drug failure occurs. The latter tests are moreexpensive, but they may be needed to validate the efficacy ofsecond- or third-line drug regimens. CONCLUSION The epidemic of HIV/AIDS is unprecedented, having expanded from a new disease to the leading cause of deathin Sub-Saharan Africa in just over two decades. Despitesome clear examples of success, such as Senegal for preven-tion, and Uganda for control, major new measures are needed to avoid further devastation. The epidemic in Africais uneven, with the greatest burden in southern Africa,where populations are already experiencing major reduc-tions in life expectancy and a reversal of progress in themanagement of national economies. About two-thirds of the world's HIV infections are in Sub-Saharan Africa in just 10 percent of the world's popula-tion. Because HIV/AIDS in the Americas and Europe isuncommon in women and rare in children, Africa holds more than 90 percent of the world's burden on such issuesas child mortality and the care of orphans. At present, prevention strategies are largely limited to education for changes in sexual practices and the use of con-doms. Vaccines and microbicides represent an extremelyimportant area of research, but useful products are not likelyto be available in less than 5 to 10 years. ARV drug treatmentprograms have begun in Africa but are as yet very modest inimpact. Operational research to maximize the benefits ofARV use will be important to address treatment efficacy anddrug resistance, the impact on health manpower resources,and cost-effectiveness. The full devastation of AIDS inAfrica has yet to be fully appreciated. Still, an increase inawareness and willingness to act should give cause foroptimism. REFERENCES Barin, F., S. Mboup, F.

The risk factors are frequently undiagnosed or inadequatelymanaged in health services designed to treat acuteconditions. Chronic conditions are frequently incorrectly considered to have limited impact on the burden of disease in Sub-Saharan Africa, because of the known high relevance of the infectious diseases. Nevertheless, these diseases occurin younger age groups more commonly in Sub-SaharanAfrica than in the developed countries and are at least ascommon in the poor sector of society as in the moreaffluent. The current burden of chronic diseases reflects the cumulative effects of unhealthy lifestyles and the resulting risk factors over the life span of people. Some of these influ-ences are present from before a child is born.ANTENATAL INFLUENCES ON THE EMERGENCE OF RISK FACTORS FOR CHRONIC DISEASES The fetal origins of adult chronic diseases play a particularly important role in Sub-Saharan Africa countries. The ade-quacy of the mother's nutrition before and during preg-nancy is the first key component in determining the infant'sbirthweight. The latter in its own right is associated with the emergence of chronic disease risk factors in these children(Barker 1993, 1994). In The Gambia, an inverse relationshipwas found between the weight gain of women in the lasttrimester of pregnancy and the blood pressure of their chil-dren at age eight years (Margetts et al. 1991). Another critical factor during pregnancy is cigarette smoking, which results in high rates of low birthweight (LBW) babies and other complications in pregnancy. Thisassociation has been reported in some Sub-Saharan Africa countries (Odendaal, Van Schie, and De Jeu 2001; K. Steyn,unpublished data). Fortunately, smoking tobacco productsduring pregnancy or the reproductive years is not a com-mon phenomenon in African women, particularly if theystill live according to their traditional lifestyles. However,surveys of women who progressively adopt WesternChapter18 Lifestyle and Related Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases Krisela Steyn and Albertino Damascenolifestyles show that smoking during pregnancy or during the reproductive years is becoming far more common (Steyn et al. 1994; Steyn et al. 1997). LBW is common in Sub-Saharan Africa countries. For example, Kinabo, Kissawke, and Msuya (1997) reviewed the birth records of 40,595 full-term live singleton infantsand found a 15.4 In a five-year randomized control trial ofmaternal supplementation in a rural primary health caresetting in The Gambia, 15.9 percent of LBW babies wereborn in the control group. The intervention group receivedhigh-energy groundnut biscuits for about the last 20 weeksof their pregnancy, and that significantly reduced the LBWrate to 10.7 percent. These data highlight the need to ensure adequate nutrition for women in Sub-Saharan Africa duringpregnancy (Ceesay et al. 1997). Levitt, Steyn, De Wet, and colleagues (1999) showed that LBW predicted systolic blood pressure level at age five years in the children in Soweto, South Africa. The data show thatchildren who had a LBW and had gained the most weightduring the five years since birth had the highest systolicblood pressure. Those children who were of normal weightat birth and maintained a normal weight had the lowest sys-tolic blood pressure (Levitt, Steyn, De Wet, et al. 1999). Aglucose tolerance test done on these children when they were seven years old showed that LBW in conjunction withrapid childhood weight gain, especially if there was a largegain of subcutaneous fat, produced poor glucose tolerance(Crowther et al. 1998). A study by Longo-Mbenza and colleagues (1999) in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, of 2,409 school- children age 5 to 16 years also showed a significant inverse relationship between LBW (less than 2,500 grams) and blood pressure, as well as heart rate. In Cape T own, SouthAfrica, Levitt, Steyn, Lambert, and colleagues (1999) foundthe same relationship in adults age 20 years who had LBW.These young adults also had impaired glucose tolerance, aswell as increased plasma cortisol and cortisol axis activation,compared with young adults who had a birthweight of2,500 grams or more (Levitt et al. 2000; Longo-Mbenza et al. 1999). The association between poor intrauterine growth because of inadequate nutrition and smoking tobaccoduring pregnancy, resulting in LBW and increased NCD riskin children in Sub-Saharan Africa, could possibly increasein the twenty-first century. At the beginning of this centurymost of the Sub-Saharan Africa countries were in the gripof serious food shortages as well as unopposed promotionof tobacco products targeting women and youth. Thissituation led to more starvation and more smoking during pregnancy and thus to the birth of more LBW babies inthese countries. TOBACCO USE As tobacco-control activities in the developed world haveincreased, the tobacco industry has shifted its marketing tomiddle- and low-income countries. Not only do these coun- tries have fewer formal tobacco-control activities in place, but they also have a much larger population, which can pro-vide future consumers of tobacco products. In Sub-SaharanAfrica countries, most people are young and have relatively low levels of education. They rarely receive the necessary health education to allow them to critically evaluate thematerial provided by the tobacco industry promotions. The following five countries participated in the global Y outh T obacco Survey: Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, South Africa, and Zimbabwe (Global Y outh T obacco SurveyCollaborative Group 2002). The data from the five Sub- Saharan Africa countries are shown in table 18.1. Althougha significant number of youths age 13 to 15 smoked ciga-rettes, many more used other tobacco products. Relativelyfew of the youth smoked at home. These data also raise con-cern about the pattern and impact of tobacco marketing inSub-Saharan Africa. Overall, more than 10 percent of theyouth had been offered free cigarettes by the tobacco indus-try, and about 40 percent of them thought boys who smokedhad more friends. Despite the traditional taboos againstsmoking by women, about 20 percent thought that thosegirls who smoked had more friends than those who didn't. More than 60 percent of the youth had seen antismoking media messages, and between one-third and two-thirds hadbeen taught the dangers of smoking at school. Of the youthwho smoked, 74 percent and 54 percent in South Africa andZimbabwe, respectively, had tried to quit in the previousyear (Global Y outh T obacco Survey Collaborative Group2002). The impact of tobacco marketing on five-year-olds has been shown in children living in Johannesburg and Soweto in the Birth-to-T en study (Levitt, Steyn, De Wet, et al. 1999).This birth cohort comprised children who were born in1990, and by the time they were five years old the new politi-cal dispensation had been established and the country had anew South African flag. When these children were shown pictures of well-known logos of cigarettes available in SouthAfrica along with that of the new flag and the logos of otherwell-known South African brands, over 90 percent of the 248 | Krisela Steyn and Albertino Damascenochildren identified the new flag. This showed clearly that this new South African symbol had been internalized by theage of five years. Therefore, it was of great concern when it was found that between 51 and 76 percent of these children could identify the logos of popular cigarette brands. Thehighest level of recognition was for the cigarette brand ofthe company that sponsored the soccer tournament in the previous year. Seven percent of these five-year-old children had experimented with cigarettes at least once (Thea de Wet,unpublished data). Only 23 of the Sub-Saharan Africa countries had any data on cigarette-use prevalence rates available in 2000, and onlya few had data on rates based on adequate national surveys (Corrao et al. 2000). These data are shown in table 18.2. Generally, men smoke much more than women do. With the exception of women in Guinea, Kenya, and Namibia, only 20 percent or fewer of the women smoke. However,these figures probably underestimate tobacco use, as ciga-rettes are not the only form of tobacco used in Sub-Saharan Africa. A substantial number of people use hand-rolled cig- arettes or smoke a pipe, and the use of smokeless tobacco iscommon in women. In South Africa, Steyn and colleagues(2002) found that 12.6 percent of black women used snuff,a higher rate than the 5.3 percent of black women who Lifestyle and Related Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases | 249Site Blantyre, Lilongwe, Cross River South Harare, Maricaland, Students Ghana State, Nigeria 1,088 783 1,083 914 2,579 621 700 Currently smoking 4.2 2.4 6.1 7.0 17.6 10.7 10.0 cigarettes (1.7) (2.2) (1.9) (3.0) (2.5) (3.4) (3.7) Currently using other 14.5 14.7 12.9 14.0 11.8 9.5 13.2 tobacco productsa (3.4) (2.8) (2.1) (3.2) (3.4) (3.4) (4.5) Current smokers who 24.4 n.a. 30.4 22.2 18.8 25.2 26.0 usually smoke at home (14.0) (12.2) (15.3) (4.2) (12.2) (10.7) Exposed to smoke from 22.2 19.0 16.0 34.3 43.6 36.2 35.0 others in their home (3.8) (4.5) (2.3) (5.1) (4.6) (5.0) (6.0) Think boys who smoke 41.1 41.6 48.8 42.5 48.1 43.1 43.8 have more friends (5.0) (4.9) (5.2) (4.6) (6.2) (5.8) (3.7) Think girls who smoke 30.1 21.1 20.3 26.9 30.7 23.3 18.6 have more friends (5.2) (4.2) (3.4) (4.0) (4.0) (3.9) (2.8) Think smoking should be 58.2 90.1 85.1 60.2 53.4 43.2 31.6 banned from public places (8.8) (3.0) (6.8) (4.6) (9.1) (11.1) (8.1) Think ETS is harmful 41.6 83.1 81.8 35.4 57.3 45.3 31.0 to themselves (9.7) (3.6) (6.1) (5.9) (7.5) (6.2) (6.3) Reported having seen ads 52.7 57.7 55.8 59.6 76.4 76.6 64.6 for cigarettes on billboards (3.5) (9.2) (3.5) (5.7) (4.6) (5.3) (5.1) Reported having seen ads for 48.7 72.6 64.0 51.7 80.7 74.7 66.7 cigarettes in newspapers or magazines (5.3) (6.8) (3.4) (3.6) (3.9) (4.9) (4.0) Reported having seen ads for 53.4 57.1 55.1 56.7 78.3 73.1 62.2 cigarettes at sporting and other events (6.3) (4.1) (3.8) (5.2) (5.3) (5.8) (6.2) Reported having been offered free 11.0 13.3 14.4 13.7 15.2 8.7 14.5 cigarettes by tobacco company (2.1) (2.5) (2.5) (2.9) (4.4) (3.7) (3.4) Reported having seen anti-smoking 69.0 83.6 85.7 65.9 79.8 80.7 69.7 media messages (4.8) (2.7) (2.5) (4.2) (2.8) (3.6) (6.1) Reported having been taught the 57.7 68.7 68.9 42.1 38.7 34.1 51.6 dangers of smoking in class (7.0) (5.2) (2.5) (4.8) (4.8) (5.9) (5.7) Reported having discussed reasons why 32.1 44.5 50.7 28.7 29.4 26.7 34.9 people their age smoke in class at school (5.0) (8.3) (4.1) (3.0) (4.3) (5.7) (5.5) Source: Global Youth Tobacco Survey Collaborative Group 2002.

Black women in Cape T own believe that snuff has medicinal value as well as that of pain relief(Marks, Steyn, and Ratheb 2001). It is traditionally taboo for black women of Sub-Saharan Africa to smoke during their reproductive years. Marks, Steyn, and Ratheb (2001) found that Xhosa women in CapeT own manifested this attitude, as 72 percent of the womenparticipating in the survey thought it disgraceful, shameful,and taboo for them to smoke. The women who smoked didso in private settings or in secret. Almost all women whosmoked said they did not smoke in front of their elders orparents. In their promotion of tobacco products in Sub-Saharan Africa, tobacco companies target women and youth with images of \"attractive, successful, upwardly mobile blackwomen.\" They have thus overwhelmed many of the tradi-tional taboos. This was revealed by Marks, Steyn, andRatheb (2001), who found in their Cape T own study that5 percent of nonsmoking black women were found to bepro-smoking in orientation and on the verge of smoking,whereas another 53 percent were found to have only a shal-low commitment to not smoking. It has been reported from South Africa that black women start to smoke at a later age than do women elsewhere in theworld (Steyn et al. 2002). The implication is that interven-tion programs in Sub-Saharan Africa should be targetingwomen in their reproductive years to prevent the onset ofsmoking and for smoking cessation programs. Commercially manufactured cigarettes in Sub-Saharan Africa are characteristically sold singly. It has been estimatedthat in Nigeria up to 80 percent of cigarettes are sold in sin-gles. Either people cannot afford to buy packs of 20 or theysometimes supplement other forms of tobacco use withmanufactured cigarettes (Saloojee 2000). Saloojee (2000) suggests that Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest tobacco consumption rates and tobacco-related mortality in the world but that the current trend of tobacco consumption implies that it is only a matter of time beforeit succumbs to the same pattern of tobacco-related diseasesas the rest of the world. Projections suggest that the tobaccoepidemic can peak in Sub-Saharan Africa in the middle ofthis century. Saloojee emphasizes that it is extraordinary tobe able to predict an epidemic so far in the future and havethe knowledge to prevent it. Price increases are the singlemost important factor in reducing smoking rates in a coun-try. The price elasticity, defined as the degree to whichtobacco consumption decreases with increasing price, ishigher in developing countries than in richer countries. Significant price increases for cigarettes and other tobaccoproducts, therefore, would be a major step toward improvedtobacco control for Sub-Saharan Africa (Saloojee 1995).Although smuggling may account for up to 50 percent of consumption in some settings and may limit the impact ofprice increases, economic policies have been effective in lim-iting tobacco consumption. NUTRITION IN TRANSITION A diet high in fat, particularly saturated fat, low in carbohy- drates, fruit, and vegetables, along with a high salt intakeleads to the emergence of chronic risk factors. Traditional diets in Sub-Saharan Africa, which are low in fat and high in unrefined carbohydrates, protect people against chronicdiseases. The nutrition transition refers to large shifts inthe composition and structure of diets (Popkin 2001a). The dietary changes of the nutrition transition involve large increases in the consumption of fat (especially saturated fat) 250 | Krisela Steyn and Albertino DamascenoAge in Year of Total Men Women Country years survey (%) (%) (%) Benin /H1135010 1988 37 \u2014 \u2014 Botswana /H1135015 1998 21 \u2014 \u2014 Cameroon Adult 1994 37.5 \u2014 \u2014 Chad /H1135015 1994 \u2014 24.1 \u2014 Congo, Dem.

Nutrition patterns in Sub-Saharan Africa countries are influenced by many factors, including individual preference; culture, traditions, and beliefs; and price. However, avail-ability and accessibility are the principal factors that shapedietary patterns (N. P . Steyn, WHO, personal communica-tion). In the Sub-Saharan context, war and internal strife,drought and poor agricultural practices, and rapid urbani-zation are particularly influential. In addition, multinationalfood companies market their products aggressively in theregion. For example in West Africa, consumption haschanged from that of locally produced coarse grains, such as millet and sorghum, to imported wheat and rice (T eklu1996). In the black population of Cape T own, it was found that a larger proportion of life spent in the city was associated with an increased consumption of fat and a decrease in car-bohydrates (figure 18.1). This is reflected in an increased useof dairy produce, meat, fat, and nonbasic food items and adecreased intake of cereals (Bourne, Lambert, and Steyn2002). An examination of food balance sheets, based on the amount of food sold in South Africa indicates that per capita available fat consumption increased by 27 percent between 1993 and 1999 (figure 18.2). This increase wasaccompanied by a decrease in carbohydrate consumption. An enigma in the proposed relationship of a diet high in cholesterol and fat, but with little fruit and vegetables, and raised blood cholesterol levels was reported for the pastoralMasai in Tanzania. Although their traditional diet was high in cholesterol and fat from whole milk, blood, andmeat, and included little green vegetables or fruit, theymaintained low serum cholesterol levels (Gibney andBurstyn 1980). It was suggested that this unexpected rela-tionship could be explained by the cholesterol-loweringeffect of the high levels of fermented milk consumed by theMasai and the substantial amounts of saponins and pheno-lic compound in the plant dietary additives used by them(Johns et al. 1999; St-Onge, Farnworth, and Jones 2000).Unfortunately, these protective dietary practices havedeclined and new dietary changes have been observed in thepastoral Masai; consequently there has been a significantincrease in their serum total cholesterol levels (McCormickand Elmore-Meegan 1992). Not even the physically activeMasai of Sub-Saharan Africa could escape the impact of thenutrition transition. AEROBIC EXERCISE Adequate physical activity has been shown to have many health-promoting properties and has a direct, independentrole in reducing cardiovascular disease mortality (Haskell,Leon, and Caspersen 1992; McBride et al. 1992). Tradition-ally, it has been thought that a high level of physical exercise could in part explain the low levels of chronic diseases foundin Sub-Saharan Africa countries. However, the amounts ofphysical exercise have been decreasing as a result of the highdegree of urbanization that has been occurring across thecontinent.

In the cities,high crime levels prevent people from moving about freely.In the poorest periurban settings, inhabitants watch televi-sion more frequently than their rural counterparts do. Few studies on the physical activity patterns of people in Sub- Saharan Africa have been published. A study carried out in Cameroon comparing rural with urban people 15 years of age or older clearly illustrated lower rates of physical activity in the urban settings(Sobngwi et al. 2002). Similar differences were found forhealthy, elderly people in Nigeria (Ezenwaka et al. 1997). In the urban settings, 62 percent of men and 83 percent ofwomen age 55 years or older led a sedentary lifestyle, where-as this was the case for only 22 percent of men and 50 per-cent of women in the rural areas. In Nigeria it was alsofound that civil servants with high seniority had lower levelsof physical activity than their junior counterparts, suggest-ing that upward social mobility was associated with lessphysical activity (Forrest et al. 2001). Many studies across Sub-Saharan Africa have revealed the impact of a sedentary lifestyle on emerging NCD risk factors. The physical activity of the Nigerian civil servants studied by Forrest and colleagues (2001) was mostly attrib-uted to occupational activities. Low levels of physical activ-ity were correlated to weight, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, insulin levels, and total andlow-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in men. Similarly,Sobngwi and colleagues (2002) in Cameroon as well asAspray and colleagues (2000) in Tanzania concluded thatphysical inactivity was associated with obesity, diabetes, andhypertension in the people they studied in urban and ruralsettings in both Cameroon and Tanzania. A qualitative studyin Cameroon also found that the reduced physical activityaccompanying sedentary occupations in the cities explainedthe higher rate of obesity observed in people with thesesedentary occupations (Treloar et al. 1999). Levitt, Steyn,Lambert, and colleagues (1999) showed an independentassociation between low levels of physical activity and hav-ing type 2 diabetes in a poor, periurban community nearCape T own. In an interesting three-year prospective study in Senegal, researchers followed the unusually high physical activitylevel of adolescent girls between the ages of 13 and 15 years;physical activity was measured by accelerometers 2001). The girls were spending a minimum of 3.5 hours per day doing domestic duties, including collect-ing water and stomping maize. The level of physical activity was higher during the rainy season. During the dry season, some of these adolescent girls were sent to the cities to workas servants. It was found that the adolescents in the city hadan even higher physical expenditure than those who stayed at home. However, despite the heavier workload, those in the city had a better nutritional status. These healthySenegalese girls all had higher physical activity levels thanthose reported for girls in developed countries. A health and fitness survey of adolescent schoolchildren age 12 to 18 years in the Western Cape in South Africa con-ducted by Lambert and colleagues in 2000 found that a high level of fitness was inversely associated with current BMI inboth boys and girls. Inactivity, defined as watching televi- sion for more than three hours a day, was associated withcurrent BMI and a low fitness level. The use of BMI projec- tion formulas to predict future BMI suggests that 24.5 per-cent of the females and 12.8 percent of the males will be overweight at the age of 18 years (Lambert et al. 2000). Two surveys carried out seven years apart in Maputo, Mozambique, of students age 8 to 15 years in the same groupof schools, showed a significant increase of mean systolicblood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and total body fat between the 1992 and the 1999 samples for all ages and for both sexes but no changes in the mean level of cholesterol.These changes of cardiovascular risk factors were attributedto the reductions in physical activity observed concomitantlywith changes in nutrition (Damasceno and Prista 2001). One of the reasons for the small number of published studies on physical activity in Sub-Saharan Africa is the dif-ficulty of measuring it in large epidemiological studies. Forsuch studies researchers have to rely on physical activityquestionnaires that must be accurate, valid, and repro-ducible. Some efforts have been made to develop question-naires that may be useful for Sub-Saharan Africa countriesor that can be shown to be reliable in all regions of theworld. Sobngwi and colleagues (2001) clearly showed hownecessary this validation process is for the use of physicalactivity questionnaires with people in Sub-Saharan Africa,as study participants' self-ranking of their physical activitydid not match the tested quartiles of physi-cal activity (Heini et al. 1996; Sobngwi et al. 2001). Wareham (2001) emphasized that to develop internation- ally standardized questionnaires, such as the InternationalPhysical Activity Questionnaire, in all countries efforts willhave to be made to ensure that validation and reliabilitystudies take place. 252 | Krisela Steyn and Albertino DamascenoOBESITY The World Health Organization (WHO) defines obesity as a condition in which excess body fat has accumulated tosuch an extent that health may be adversely affected. Thedegree of body weight is usually expressed as BMI; this isthe ratio of weight in kilograms to the square of height in meters. The BMI is used to classify a person's body weight asunderweight (BMI less than 18.5), normal weight (BMI18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), or obese (BMIgreater than 30) (WHO 2000). In addition, it is customary to indicate the amount of abdominal fat mass. This can vary considerably among indi- viduals who have the same BMI. Abdominal fat is reportedby measuring the waist circumference or the waist-to-hipcircumference ratio. The waist circumference is thought to provide a better correlate with abdominal fat mass than thewaist-to-hip ratio. High abdominal fat mass is frequentlyreferred to as central obesity. This form of obesity has beenshown to have more morbidity than if the fat distribution ispredominantly on the hips (WHO 2000). Obesity greatly increases the risk for conditions such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, gall bladder disease, sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, and lower back pain. Ithas also been shown to be associated with coronary arterydisease and some cancers, and to reduce life expectancy.Central obesity has been shown to be associated with meta-bolic syndrome. The key features of this condition are raisedblood pressure, raised insulin and triglyceride levels,reduced high-density lipoprotein insulin resistance. The condition is strongly atherogenicand predisposes to an elevated risk of diabetes and cardio-vascular disease (Fontaine et al. 2003; Peeters et al. 2003;Solomon and Manson 1997; WHO 2000). In many Sub-Saharan Africa countries, an increased level of body fat is associated with beauty, prosperity, health, andprestige, despite its negative impact on health. Thinness, incontrast, is perceived to be a sign of ill health or poverty andis something to be feared and avoided, particularly in recentyears, when it has been associated with AIDS (Treloar et al.1999). In disadvantaged communities in South Africa, foodis highly valued because food security has not always beenensured. Researchers found it to be socially unacceptable foran individual to refuse to eat food that was offered to them(Mvo, Dick, and Steyn 1999). Brown and Konner (1987)also reported that the majority of the less developed regionshad, or still have, ideals of feminine beauty that includeplumpness, which is consistent with the hypothesis that fatstores function as a cushion against food shortages duringpregnancy and lactation. It is therefore unsurprising that studies have shown that black women in South Africa alsodo not perceive being overweight or obese as a health risk(Ndlovo and Roos 1999). Urbanization, associated with changing dietary patterns and less physical activity and a rise in socioeconomic status, is occurring across Sub-Saharan Africa countries. All these factors lead to an increase in the prevalence of overweight and obese people in the region. This phenomena is illus-trated in a study by Kruger and colleagues (2002) of thenutrition and physical activity patterns of a large sample ofpeople from the North West Province of South Africa ex-posed to all levels of urbanization. The researchers found asignificant association between household income and measures of obesity. They also saw a positive correlation between total energy intake, fat intake, and BMI. The physi- cal activity index correlated negatively with BMI and waistcircumference. Cooper and colleagues (1997) also illustrated these trends when they compared the mean BMI of urban andrural West Africans with that of Jamaicans and blacks in theUnited States. A gradual increase in mean BMI was evidentalong the historical migration path of the West African dias-pora that was attributed to a cross-cultural gradient ofdecreasing physical activity and Westernization of the diet. Table 18.3 shows the prevalence of obesity from Sub- Saharan Africa reported in recent literature. South Africa hasthe highest prevalence of obesity in black men and womenreported in Africa. Its prevalence among urban black womenof 36 percent in South Africa already exceeds that of blackwomen in the United States (Cooper et al. 1997; Puoaneet al. 2002). The prevalence of obesity in South African andurban Tanzanian men was very similar, whereas the preva-lence of obesity in South African women was almost doublethat of urban women in The Gambia and Tanzania. An analysis of the mortality patterns associated with obe- sity in American people suggests that it has less of an impact on mortality and years of life lost in African Americans thanin other Americans (Fontaine et al. 2003; Solomon andManson 1997). Although no similar data are available on theassociation between obesity and mortality in Sub-SaharanAfrica countries, it would be unwise to assume that obesityis benign for the people of this region. Reference has beenmade to the impact that obesity has on the emergence ofhypertension, diabetes, and other chronic disease risk fac-tors in Sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, high rates of LBWbabies are common in the region, and this poses a risk tothese babies in later life to develop obesity and other chronicdisease risk factors. Lifestyle and Related Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases | 253HYPERTENSION High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart attacks and strokes. It also contributes to renal disease and blind-ness. It is estimated that between 10 million and 20 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa have hypertension. It has been estimated that adequate hypertension treatment of thesepeople could prevent about 250,000 deaths (Cappuccio et al. 2000). However, hypertension in Sub-Saharan Africa is universally under diagnosed or inadequately treated, or both, with the result that extensive end-organ damage andpremature death are often seen. Furthermore, hypertensionfrequently co-exists with other NCD risk factors, such asdiabetes. Seedat (1999) summarized the pathophysiology ofhypertension and response to treatment as follows:Black hypertensive patients in Sub-Saharan Africa are prone to cerebral hemorrhage, malignant hypertension,kidney disease leading to uremia and congestive heartfailure, whereas coronary heart disease is relativelyuncommon. Responses to antihypertensive medication drugs like the beta-blockers and the angiotension-converting enzymes (ACE) inhibitors are poor unlessthese agents are combined with a thiazide diuretic. Blackpatients respond best to diuretics, vasodilators or calciumchannel blockers. Kaufman and colleagues (1996) reported that the risk of death increased by 60 percent with an increase of 20 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure in rural Nigeria. They estimatedthat the population-attributable risk or the reduction in 254 | Krisela Steyn and Albertino DamascenoHeight Weight BMI Waist Hip Waist- Obese Population n (cm) (kg) (kg/m2) (cm) (cm) hip ratio (%) Body fat (%) Men Nigeria 1,171 168.3 61.5 21.7 77.3 88.3 0.89 \u2014 169 22.9 81.8 94.2 0.9 7.5 \u2014 Cameroonb Urban 461 \u2014 \u2014 25 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Rural 308 \u2014 \u2014 21 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Zimbabwe (urban) 384 171.0 63.0 21.7 79.0 91.0 0.86 \u2014 21.1 Gambia, The Urban 1,028 \u2014 \u2014 20.8 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1.8 \u2014 Rural 1,200 \u2014 \u2014 19.8 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 0.1 \u2014 Tanzania (urban) 3,659 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 6.9 \u2014 Women Nigeria 1,338 158.3 56.6 22.6 73.9 93.5 80.9 92.6 0.87 \u2014 \u2014 South (black) 7,726 158 27.1 85.5 104.6 0.8 30.0 \u2014 Cameroonb Urban 591 \u2014 \u2014 26.0 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Rural 438 \u2014 \u2014 22.0 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Zimbabwe (urban) 391 160 67.0 21.7 82.0 101.0 0.82 \u2014 36.5 Gambia, The Urban 1,138 \u2014 \u2014 23.9 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 12.2 \u2014 Rural 2,023 \u2014 \u2014 20.5 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1.1 \u2014 Tanzania (urban) 5,654 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 17.4 \u2014 Source: Cooper et al. 1997; Puoane et al. 2002; Mbanya et al. 1998; Mufunda al. 2000; van der Sande et al.

Data from Mbanya et al. 1998.Table 18.3 Anthropometric Indicators, by Countrymortality that would have been observed if hypertension were not present was 7 percent, showing the impact of hypertension on all-cause mortality in rural Nigeria. Malignant hypertension also occurs more frequently inblack people of Sub-Saharan Africa than in other ethnicgroups. Milne and colleagues (1989) showed this in blackpatients hospitalized for hypertension. This condition is fre- quently related to severe renal disease and hypertensive encephalopathy. Data from the South African Dialyses andTransplantation Registry have shown that hypertension wasresponsible for 35 percent of end-stage renal failure in blacks and that malignant hypertension was diagnosed in 57 percent of the black patients with essential hypertension(Veriava et al. 1990). Untreated malignant hypertension has been shown to have a five-year survival as low as 1 percent. Earlier surveys showed that the lowest prevalence of hypertension occurred in the poorest Sub-Saharan Africa countries, and as affluence increased, the prevalenceincreased. The surveys also revealed that hypertension wasmore common in urban than in rural settings in the region(Nissinen et al. 1988). The elegant Kenyan Luo migrationstudy of Poulter and colleagues (1990) was the first to showthat migration of people living in traditional rural villageson the northern shores of Lake Victoria to the urban settingsof Nairobi was associated with an increase in blood pres-sure. This suggests a marked change in the diet of the newarrivals in Nairobi to a higher salt and calorie intake alongwith a reduced potassium intake due to consuming less fruitand vegetables. Studies carried out in Nigeria that compared urban and rural people's sodium and potassium excretionsobserved similar findings (Kaufman et al. 1999). Higher pulse rates in the Nairobi participants suggest that mecha- nisms related to increased autonomic nervous system activity could contribute to the higher levels of blood pres-sure observed (Poulter et al. 1985, 1990). Urban Nigeriansreported higher stress levels and lower social integrationscores than their rural counterparts. These indicators ofincreased stress in the urban setting were associated withhigher blood pressures (Kaufman et al. 1999). Socioeconomic status and urbanization are good predic- tors of hypertension. Zimbabwean women doing traditionalwork-related activities on rural communal land had lowerblood pressures than did those women who were workingfor a wage on large-scale, commercial agricultural farms.The latter group, in turn, had lower blood pressures thanwomen who earned a living in more industrial mining areas(Hunter et al. 2000). Similarly, researchers (Steyn, Fourieet al. 1996) found in the black community of Cape T own,South Africa, that the duration of urbanization independ- ently predicted the presence of hypertension. Table 18.4 shows the prevalence rate in some Sub- Saharan Africa countries from studies published since 1997. The studies reveal that although some countries still main- tain large differences between urban and rural prevalence,differences are no longer apparent in many countries. Theprevalence rates in the rural areas have increased to levelssimilar to those found only in the cities in the past. As anexample, in the early 1990s Mollentze and colleagues (1995)showed that the rural community of QwaQwa in the FreeState, South Africa, had rates of hypertension similar tothose in the periurban community of Mangaung in thesame province. The previously observed differences in hypertension prevalence between poorer and more affluentcountries have also diminished. Some dietary factors are related to hypertension, includ- ing increased salt (sodium) intake and a decrease in fruit andvegetables (potassium); a higher intake of alcohol products,particularly by men, also plays a role. The associationbetween hypertension and obesity has been well documentedin many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Zimbabwe,Mufunda and colleagues (2000) found this strong associa-tion, as did Rotimi and colleagues (1995) in populations ofWest African descent. Despite this clear association it has been suggested that the noxious effect of obesity in black people is less than in people of other ethnic groups. Most ofthe supporting evidence for this viewpoint is based on stud-ies carried out with African Americans in the United States.A small study in South Africa suggested similar findings(Walker et al. 1990). The influence of alcohol consumption,particularly heavy drinking, on increasing blood pressurelevels has also been described in Nigeria (Bunker et al. 1992;Ekpo et al. 1992). The data on the association between highsalt (sodium chloride) intake and hypertension in blackpeople from Africa has been summarized by Seedat (1996)and suggests that black people have a transport mechanismof high sodium retention and a low rennin activity. Mtabajiand colleagues (1992) found salt sensitivity, measured by theblood pressure response on salt loading, in 46.2 percent ofstudy subjects in Tanzania. A high intake of sodium is com-mon in Sub-Saharan Africa, as it is used to preserve foodor to make food tastier. For example, Cappuccio and col-leagues (2000) described the diet in Ghana as consistingmostly of unprocessed food and highly salted fish and meat.Substantial amounts of salt are added to food while cooking,and monosodium glutamate-based flavoring cubes or saltsare widely used to give food taste. In addition to a high salt Lifestyle and Related Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases | 255intake, people in Sub-Saharan Africa frequently eat little fruit and vegetables, resulting in low potassium intakes. Few intervention studies have been conducted in Sub- Saharan Africa to show that a reduction in salt and anincrease in potassium improve the blood pressure in its populations. A study done in Tanzania showed that a low-sodium diet leading to a low urinary excretion level of52 millimoles per day reduced blood pressure in normoten-sive people significantly within four to five days (Mtabaji,Nara, and Y amori 1990). A study in Kenya reported that sup-plementation with potassium in newly diagnosed patientswith hypertension reduced the blood pressure to a levelsimilar to that found in patients treated with a diuretic(Obel and Koech 1991).These data clearly suggest that many nutritional inter- ventions are required to decrease the prevalence of hyper- tension. These interventions include regulation of the amount of salt used by the food industry in Sub-Saharan Africa, the promotion of increased potassium consumptionin the form of fruit and vegetables, and the limitation ofalcohol use. Despite the many environmental factors related to hyper- tension, many studies in Sub-Saharan Africa suggest a possible genetic contribution to the origins of hypertensionin black people. Van der Sande and colleagues (2001) in TheGambia and Steyn and colleagues (unpublished data) inSouth Africa have found that high blood pressure is associ-ated with a strong family history of either hypertension or 256 | Krisela Steyn Females Equipment for blood Country Age (years) ( n) (%) ( n) (%) (%) (%) pressure measurement Nigeria Urban (adults; \u2014 581a \u2014 417a \u2014 13.9 5.0 Mercury sphygmomanometer civil servants) Urban 25-55 /H11001 1,171 14.7 Urban 25-55 /H11001 612 22.8 749 16.0 8.7 8.7 Mercury Rural 25-55 /H11001 745 14.2 722 16.3 4.7 7.4 sphygmomanometer Cameroon Urban 25-74 461 \u2014 591 \u2014 16.4 12.1 Mercury Rural 25-74 308 \u2014 438 \u2014 5.4 5.9 sphygmomanometer Tanzania Urban (Ihala) 15 /H11001 330 30.0 437 28.6 14.4 15.4 Mercury Rural (Shari) 15 /H11001 401 32.2 527 17.2 15.6 sphygmomanometer Urban 35-64 1,729 27.1 2,053 7.3Omron HEM-705-CP Rural 25.3 18.7 Olatunbosun et al. 2000; Cooper et al. 1997; Mbanya et al. 1998; Edwards et al. 2000; Bovet et al. 2002; van der Sande et al. 2 000; Mufunda et al. 2000; Steyn et al. 2001.

This could provide a cost-effective opportunity to identify people who need more detailed screening for hyper- tension. Rotimi and colleagues (1999) used computer mod- els and regression analyses to estimate the degree of heri-tability of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in Nigerianfamilies. The heritability estimate was 45 percent and 43 per-cent for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. This emphasizes interaction between environmental influ- ences and genetic factors in the etiology of hypertension. In populations of African ancestry, data from small case- control studies and a large case-control study conducted in South Africa with more than 700 cases phenotyped using24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and 700controls (G. R. Norton et al., personal communications) suggest that the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genevariant contributes little to hypertension. Nevertheless,gender-specific effects need to be excluded. In addition,angiotensinogen (AGT) gene variants that have been associ-ated with hypertension in Caucasian groups are not impli-cated in subjects of African ancestry (Tiago et al. 2002).However, an alternative functional promoter region variantof the AGT gene ( /H11002217GA) has recently been shown to be strongly associated with hypertension in a small AfricanAmerican case-control study (Jain et al. 2002), data that hasnow been confirmed in a large case-control study conduct-ed in black South Africans (G. R. Norton et al., personalcommunication). The role of the /H11002217GA AGT gene variant in contributing to the variance of blood pressurewithin families is now being assessed in a South Africanstudy. Furthermore, an additional functional AGT gene pro-moter region variant ( /H1100220AC; Zhao et al. 1999) has been shown to modify the impact of body size on blood pressure (Tiago et al. 2002), and the /H11002217GA variant's effect on the risk for hypertension (G. R. Norton et al., personal communications) in subjects of African ancestry, thussuggesting complex genotype-genotype and genotype-phenotype interactions of the AGT gene in people ofAfrican origins. Other candidate gene variants implicated in blood pressure control or hypertension in those of European orAfrican ancestry, including functional or potentially func-tional variants found within the guanosine triphosphateprotein /H92523 subunit gene (Siffert et al. 1998), the sodium epithelial channel gene (Baker et al. 1998), the /H9251-adducin gene (Cusi et al. 1997), and the /H92522 receptor gene (Svetkey et al. 1996), have been shown not to be associated withhypertension in all studies conducted in groups of Africanancestry (Candy et al. 2000; Larson, Hutchinson, andBoerwinkle 2000; Nkeh et al. 2003), or have been shown to occur with too low a frequency to contribute substantially topopulation-attributable risk (Barlassina et al. 2000). Family- based linkage studies assessing blood pressure as a continu- ous variable and using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressuremonitoring techniques are under way in South Africa to fur-ther evaluate the role for these variants as determinants of blood pressure in groups of African ancestry. Effective management of hypertension usually requires treatments with more than one drug. In Ghana, Hesse and Nuama (1997) found that only 18 percent of a group ofpatients with hypertension had one drug prescribed, where-as 60 percent had two drugs and 22 percent had three ormore drugs prescribed. The use of two or more drugs will inevitably result in a high cost for antihypertensive medica-tion, especially when newer medications are used. However,there are cheaper, older, and effective medications availablein resource-scarce settings in Sub-Saharan Africa. Hesse and Nuama (1997) also reported that between 1973 and 1993 adiuretic was the type of drug prescribed for initial treatment of patients with hypertension; diuretics were used in 90 per-cent of cases, including reserpine in 46 percent, methyldopain 31 percent, and propranolol in 30 percent. With theexception of methyldopa all these medications are inexpen-sive and suited to resource-scarce settings. The benefits of treating hypertension have been convinc- ingly shown in many parts of the world, but relatively littledata are available from Sub-Saharan Africa. One example isa study by Salako and colleagues (1999), who showed thatwhen patients with hypertension are given effective treat-ment, there is a reduction in the excretion of urinary albu-min, suggesting improved renal function in patients whopreviously had early renal impairment. After reviewing the available data, Cooper and colleagues (1998) suggested: \"Hypertension is fully treatable, but socialconditions in Africa make the implementation of bloodpressure control programs difficult. Lack of a clear strategybased on evidence has undermined these efforts.\" They alsoestimated that effective hypertension treatment wouldlead to a reduction in population-attributable risk of 2 per-cent in Africa compared with 0.15 percent in the UnitedStates. \"Number needed to treat\" analyses showed thatthe cost of drugs to prevent one death is US$1,800 in Africa,if the cheaper drugs are used, whereas it is US$14,000 to US$1 million in the United States, depending on which drugs are used. Cooper and colleagues (1998) concludedthat the treatment of hypertension should be a health prior-ity in Sub-Saharan Africa. Lifestyle and Related Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases | 257DYSLIPIDEMIA Dyslipidemia is defined as a clinically significant alteration of the naturally occurring blood lipids and lipoproteinspredisposing to cardiovascular diseases and other chronicdiseases (Berger and Marais 2000). The two commonlymeasured blood lipids are cholesterol and triglycerides. These molecules are carried in a range of lipoprotein parti-cles in the blood. The most important lipoprotein particlesthat predispose to atherosclerosis and thus cardiovasculardiseases are the chylomicrons high in triglyceride andLDL particles, which carry mainly cholesterol. The LDL par-ticle is the most atherogenic of all the lipoprotein particles.The HDL particle protects the arteries against atherosclero-sis and, consequently, against cardiovascular diseases. HDLtransports cholesterol away from the arteries to be excreted via the liver. The most recent international recommenda-tions regarding lipid levels are that a total blood cholesterollevel below 5.2 millimoles per liter is desirable; similarly, alevel of LDL cholesterol below 2.6 millimoles per liter anda triglyceride level below 1.7 millimoles per liter areconsidered optimal. Persons with blood lipids below theselevels do not carry a risk of developing atherosclerosis. AnHDL cholesterol level below 1 millimole per liter also pre-disposes to atherosclerosis development, whereas a levelabove 1.6 millimoles per liter provides protection. The ratioof HDL cholesterol to the total cholesterol level, expressed asa percentage, is frequently reported. A level of more than20 percent for men and 25 percent for women is consideredto provide protection against developing atherosclerosis(Adult Treatment Panel III 2001). A particularly atherosclerotic combination of lipid and other risk factors is referred to as the metabolic syndromeand leads to premature coronary heart disease. Thissyndrome consists of high levels of blood triglyceride, lowlevels of HDL cholesterol, and small dense LDL particles. It isalso associated with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, abdomi-nal obesity, insulin resistance, and physical inactivity.Van derSande and colleagues (2000) found significant numbers ofurban black people in Banju, the capital of The Gambia, withthe coexistence of these conditions, suggesting that the meta-bolic syndrome is common in this city. Since the level of ischemic heart disease reported in people from Africa is low, few hypertension and diabetessurveys in the region include blood lipid measurements. Theavailable studies suggest that most people of African descenthave far lower blood lipid levels than found in people ofEuropean or Indian descent in the region. These differencesamong the groups are present from a young age. InJohannesburg and Soweto, Steyn and colleagues (2000) found that the mean total cholesterol level in African andcoloured five-year-old children was 3.9 millimoles per litercompared with 4.1 millimoles per liter for Indian and4.4 millimoles per liter for white children. The correspon- ding ratios of HDL cholesterol to total cholesterol were30.6 percent, 28.9 percent, 27 percent, and 25.8 percent, respectively. These findings in children at the age of five years correspond to the blood lipid pattern found in peopleof African descent in most studies carried out across Africa.These group differences in lipid profiles tend to continueinto adolescence and adulthood. The lower total cholesteroland higher HDL cholesterol levels of persons of Africandescent indicate a protective pattern against developing atherosclerosis and, consequently, against ischemic heart disease (Steyn et al. 2000). Seftel and colleagues (1993) com- pared the lipid levels of male students between the ages of 15and 20 years from different ethnic groups in South African urban and rural settings. The mean total cholesterol levelwas 3.2 millimoles per liter for the rural and 3.7 millimolesper liter for the urban students, differences that were statis-tically significant. The rural black males age 15 to 20 had thelowest total cholesterol level of all the groups studied. Only1 percent of the rural and 2 percent of the urban black maleshad total cholesterol levels above 5.2 millimoles per liter. In 1980 Knuiman, Hermus, and Hautvast (1980) reported even lower total cholesterol levels in rural and urban boys age seven to eight years in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria.The mean total cholesterol levels in these boys ranged from2.6 millimoles per liter in rural Nigeria to 3.5 millimoles perliter in urban Ghana, and their ratio of HDL cholesterol tototal cholesterol was high, varying from 30 to 36 percent.Walker and Walker (1978) also reported high levels of HDLcholesterol in African children and adults in a populationfree of coronary heart diseases. Seftel, Raal, and Joffe (1995) reviewed the early studies on total cholesterol levels in South African adult populations. They found that the mean total cholesterol in middle-agedblack men was about 4 millimoles per liter compared with5 millimoles per liter in coloured men and 6 millimoles perliter in white men. Since the mean total cholesterol concen-trations of newborn black and white babies were almost thesame, the differences in middle-aged men were likely to beenvironmental in origin (Seftel, Raal, and Joffe 1995). The findings of some recent lipid studies in Sub-Saharan African countries are shown in table 18.5. A study of 8,581rural Tanzanians, age 15 years and older, found significantlyhigher mean total serum cholesterol levels in women thanin men (Swai et al. 1993). Only in the economically more 258 | Krisela Steyn and Albertino Damascenoadvanced region, Kilimanjaro, did the total cholesterol levels increase with age as found in all Westernized people. Thefavorable lipid profile in most of Africa may be threatened bythe march of time. Njelekela and colleagues (2001) surveyedpeople for chronic disease risk factors in three settings in Tanzania in 1987 and again in 1998. Their findings suggestthat during the decade, a significant rise occurred in the mean levels and in the prevalence of many cardiovasculardisease risk factors, including increases in total cholesterol levels and the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia.

One compared the impact of the low-salt fish and vegetable diet on the lipid profile of Tanzanians with that of the typical diets consumed by peo- ple in Brazil and Italy (Pavan et al. 1997). The Tanzanians'total blood cholesterol and their BMI were lower than thatof the other two groups. Another study compared the lipidprofiles of Tanzanian villagers who consumed a diet consist- ing predominantly of fish with those of villagers who were predominantly vegetarian (Pauletto et al. 1996). The totalblood cholesterol levels were lower (3.5 millimoles per liter)in the fish-eating community than in the vegetarian com- munity (4.1 millimoles per liter). Similarly, the blood triglyceride levels were 0.9 millimoles per liter and 1.3 mil-limoles per liter, and the lipoprotein little (a) levels were 201 milligrams per liter and 321 milligrams per liter in the fish-eating community and vegetarian community, respectively(Pauletto et al. 1996). This study suggests that fish-eatingcommunities have a more protective lipid profile than vege-tarian ones. T otal cholesterol levels can be favorably influenced by improved dietary changes; however, increased physicalactivity patterns also improved the lipid profile. Researchersin Nigeria found that patients with hypertension, exercisingthree times a week for 30 minutes per session over a 16-weekperiod, decreased their total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels slightly and increased their HDL- cholesterol levels (Iyawe, Ighoroje, and Iyawe 1996). Although high total blood cholesterol levels are uncom- mon in Sub-Saharan Africa countries, there are some excep-tions. One example is provided by the descendents of thecolonists from the Netherlands who came to the southern tip of Africa in the seventeenth century and belong to the Afrikaans-speaking white community in South Africa. The phenomenon referred to by geneticists as the \"foundereffect\" is reflected in the high concentration of familialhypercholesterolemia in this group. A small group of farm-ers from the Cape province trekked north into the interiorregions of what later became South Africa, and tended tointermarry. The background prevalence of heterozygousfamilial hypercholesterolemia across the globe is 1 to 500.However, the overall prevalence of familial hypercholes-terolemia in rural, white, Afrikaans-speaking people inSouth Africa was estimated to be 1 to 72 (Steyn, Goldberget al. 1996). The treatment of high total blood cholesterol levels with medication is most cost-effective in people who have thehighest risk of ischemic heart disease. These are people whohave had a previous heart attack or stroke or who sufferfrom familial hypercholesterolemia and those with a typicalWesternized lifestyle and who have more than one chronic disease risk factor. Although limited data are available on thetreatment status of high blood cholesterol in Sub-Saharan Africa, a survey of about 13,000 patients of general practi- tioners in private practice in South Africa revealed that highblood cholesterol is poorly treated in those who could ben-efit the most. These were 18.7 percent of men and 10.4 per- cent of women who had ischemic heart disease in the past and whose total blood cholesterol levels were found to be5.9 millimoles per liter and 6.0 millimoles per liter, respec-tively. These patients need to lower their total blood choles-terol levels significantly for protection against a recurrenceof heart disease. This is an achievable objective with the useof highly effective newer cholesterol-lowering agents (Steyn et al. 1998). HEALTH SERVICES' REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF NCD RISK FACTORS Chronic disease rates are already higher than expected in Sub-Saharan Africa countries. Consequently, these patientsare making significant demands on the health services. Appropriate planning to manage chronic diseases and their risk factors is of paramount importance in the region(Unwin et al. 2001). Most of the risk factors emerge duringmiddle age as a result of an unhealthy lifestyle that has been followed for several decades. Many patients have several risk factors. In Nigeria it was found that patients may haveas many as five chronic disease risk factors, as shown intable 18.6 (Ezenwaka et al. 1997). The risk factors have asynergistic effect on the total chronic disease risk. Healthservices planned for prevention and care must therefore take 260 | Krisela Steyn and Albertino DamascenoNumber of Total participants Men Women factors n/H11549504 n/H11549295 n/H11549209 0 29.8 31.5 13.2 Source: Ezenwaka et al. 1997. Note: Risk factors considered were smoking, alcohol intake, sedentary lifestyle, hypertension (/H11350160/95 mmHg), obesity, NCD Risk Factors in Nigerian Subjects (percent)cognizance of the burden of multiple chronic disease risk factors in the same patient. Data collected in large cohort studies conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom were used to assess the relationship between risk factors and cardiovascular dis-ease (CVD) events. The studies used were the Framingham,Massachusetts, cohort data and United Kingdom cohort data (ATP III 2001; Grundy et al. 1999; Joint Task Force, 1998). Formulas were calculated that could be used to esti-mate a patient's chronic disease risk. These formulas usuallyexpress the patient's risk of suffering from a CVD event in the next 10 years or longer period. Health services are thus able to identify those patients who are at the highest risk ofdeveloping CVD and would benefit the most by using appropriate medication. Gaziano, Steyn, and Opie (2001)have shown that such an approach is more cost-effectivethan that of using single cut-off points for single CVD riskfactors. Therefore, the total CVD risk-assessment approachclearly should be the one employed in settings with scarceresources, as is the case in Sub-Saharan Africa countries. The model of health service provision prevailing across most of Sub-Saharan Africa is one that focuses on acute ill- nesses, the immediate needs of patients, and episodic inter-action between the patient and the health services. Thismodel does not provide adequate care for patients withchronic diseases. Consequently, millions of patients withchronic diseases in the region are undiagnosed or receivinginadequate treatment. The WHO conducted a two-yearreview of health care models and best practices from aroundthe world. The findings, published in 2002, provided a com-prehensive conceptual framework for the prevention andmanagement of chronic conditions in poorly resourced set-tings (WHO 2002). The WHO report focuses on the need to move away from the acute model of care to efficiently coordinated andpatient-centered care. Such a move should facilitate anongoing relationship between provider and patient and helppatients to make full use of their own and their communi-ty's resources (Holman and Lorig 2000; Wagner 2000). Thisapproach suggests that the focus should be on the patientsin their own social settings and context and not only on thedisease of the patient. This is of particular significance inSub-Saharan Africa countries, where the patients' culturalbeliefs and practices should be understood when preventionand management of chronic conditions are introduced. Thepartnership between the patient and the health careprovider is not just a resource for understanding ill health, itis the basis for the prevention and management of chronicdiseases and their risk factors (Swartz and Dick 2002).POLICY INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE The need for preventive action to reduce or prevent the adoption of a less healthy lifestyle by people in Sub-SaharanAfrica has never been greater. Many factors contribute to thelack of chronic disease preventive programs being adoptedby governments (Y ach 2002). The global health community has taken some significant steps to support countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and else- where to promote a healthy lifestyle for the entire world. The WHO, a branch of the United Nations, spearheaded this ini- tiative by negotiations to propose a framework conventionon T obacco Control between 1999 and 2003. The memberstates of the WHO (2003) unanimously endorsed the frame-work convention of T obacco Control to the WHO's generalassembly in June 2004 for endorsement. The treaty attacks tobacco use in many ways. It expects countries to providetreatment for people who smoke, to encourage cessation, andto prevent the onset of tobacco use in the young. It requirescountries to protect the public from exposure to environ-mental tobacco smoke and expects them to ban advertising tothe extent that their constitutions allow with respect to theprotection of commercial free speech. Thirty percent of anytobacco product's packaging should contain health warningsof the danger of tobacco use.Misleading words such as\"light\"or \"mild\" should also be banned. It encourages countries toraise taxes to the point that will discourage smoking andto pass laws that hold tobacco companies accountable formedical and other costs incurred because of tobacco use(WHO 2003). With the exception of South Africa, very fewSub-Saharan Africa countries have adequate tobacco controllegislation in place to effectively protect their populationsagainst tobacco use. This treaty will encourage many coun-tries in the region to initiate such a development. In March 2003 the WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization, another branch of the United Nations, issueda scientific report reviewing the data on diet, physical activ-ity, and health. The WHO has embarked on an extensiveprocess of consultations across the globe, including Sub-Saharan Africa countries, to ensure that a global strategyprovides realistic guidelines for all countries. The strategywill include a broad series of nutrition-related recommen-dations, including dietary advice along with proposals deal-ing with the labeling and advertising of food. Collaborationwith the food industry is seen as pivotal to improving thequality of manufactured food and processed food. All these initiatives will provide countries with informa- tion to identify and act appropriately to promote a healthy Lifestyle and Related Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases | 261lifestyle. However, it is necessary to prioritize chronic disease prevention in view of all the other large health demands that face the ministries of health in Sub-Saharan Africa coun- tries. Countries with multiple burdens of disease will have todevelop priority-setting programs in order to plan how touse scarce resources most effectively. The failure of countriesto adopt the necessary steps to promote a healthy lifestyle, however difficult such a decision might be early in the twen- ty-first century, will inevitably lead to increasing levels ofobesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes in thepopulations of Sub-Saharan Africa countries. This, in turn, will be the cause of an avoidable chronic disease epidemic within a few decades. CONCLUSION On reviewing the extent of chronic diseases in the low- income and middle-income countries, the Institute ofMedicine of the United States National Academy of Sciences recommended that, in addition to the preventive actions required to reduce the risk factors, health services shoulddiagnose and control hypertension and diabetes and shouldensure access to low-cost drugs and the development of affordable clinical care algorithms. The report also empha- sized the need to build capacity to conduct research anddevelopment activities and to develop institutional frame-works that would facilitate the development of chronic dis-ease prevention activities and the transformation of thehealth care services to adequately cope with the enormous,mostly unacknowledged burden of chronic diseases in Sub- Saharan Africa (Howson et al. 1998).

Lifestyle and Related Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases | 265267The global burden of disease study of the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that about 177 millionpeople in the world had diabetes in the year 2000 (WHO2003). In the second edition of the International DiabetesFederation's Diabetes Atlas it is estimated that 194 million people had diabetes in the year 2003, and about two-thirds of these people lived in developing countries (IDF 2003). In1901 Albert Cook, a medical missionary in Uganda, reportedthat \"diabetes is rather uncommon and very fatal\" (Cook1901). Over the next 50 to 60 years diabetes continued tobe regarded as rare in Sub-Saharan Africa. Communicablediseases still make up the greatest disease burden, but by2020, noncommunicable diseases, including hypertensionand diabetes, will outstrip communicable diseases as a cause of death (Murray and Lopez 1997). Even allowing for theuncertainties of predicting future disease patterns posed bythe unfolding of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa, it is clear that the relativeimportance of noncommunicable diseases will increase(Panz and Joffe 1999). This situation is a result of demo-graphic change (populations with older age structures),increasing urbanization (WHO 1998), and associatedchanges in risk-factor levels, such as tobacco smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity (Hunter et al. 2000; Kaufmanet al. 1999; Pavan et al. 1997). Countries of Sub-Saharan Africa are in various stages of the epidemiological transi- tion with a multiple burden of diseases. The available evidence suggests that noncommunicable diseases currently contribute substantially to the burden of mortality and morbidity in adults. Age-specific levels of dia-betes and hypertension in many urban areas of Sub-SaharanAfrica are as high as, or higher than, those in most WesternEuropean countries (Aspray et al. 2000; Edwards et al. 2000;Mollentze et al. 1995). In a demographic surveillance systemin Tanzania they account for between one in six and one inthree adult deaths (Kitange et al. 1996; Setel et al. 2000; Walker et al. 2000), with age-specific death rates from non-specific, noncommunicable diseases being as high or higherthan in developed countries (Unwin et al. 1999). Diabetes mellitus can be classified into four principal types (WHO 1999). This includes type 1 diabetes, type 2diabetes, other specific types of diabetes, and gestational dia-betes mellitus. The most common types of diabetes seen inSub-Saharan Africa are type 2 and type 1 diabetes mellitus.Chapter19 Diabetes Mellitus Jean-Claude Mbanya and Kaushik RamiayaThis chapter focuses on the published data on the burden of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa. Althoughtype 1 diabetes is not caused by the adverse effects oflifestyle, as type 2 can be, the chronic complications of bothtype 1 and type 2 diabetes on the eyes, cardiovascular system, nerves, and kidneys are similar. SOURCES OF DATA The data search was limited to studies published after 1979, because data collected before 1980 may no longer reflect thecurrent prevalence of diabetes. The Medline database andthe Internet were used for the literature search, but alsodiabetes researchers and clinicians were asked to provideinformation on the burden of diabetes for their Sub- Saharan Africa country or subregion. The Medline searchwas undertaken for diabetes prevalence and for each com-plication: retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and so on.In the absence of data from any country, data were extrapo-lated from the socioeconomically, ethnically, and geograph- ically most similar country. The data obtained were from prevalence studies, hospital-based studies, registry reports,hospital statistics, government estimates, and the like. Someof the specific data sources are mentioned in table 19.1. Thesources of data for the 2003 estimates of diabetes mellitus and IGT are listed in table 19.2. There is still a dearth of published studies describing the burden of diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Clinic-based studies have serious limitations, so their gener- alizability is limited. Therefore the data presented here areonly general indicators of diabetes frequency and should beinterpreted with caution. As new and better epidemiological data become available, it will be possible to have actual rates of diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa. EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DIABETES Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease character- ized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulinsecretion, insulin action, or both. Uncontrolled chronic hyperglycemia results in long-term damage, particular dysfunction, and failure of the eyes, heart, blood vessels,nerves, and kidneys.Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells, causing the loss of insulin produc-tion. Children are usually affected by this type of diabetes,although it occurs at all ages and the clinical presentationcan vary with age. Patients with this type of diabetes requireinsulin for survival. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and abnormal insulin secretion, either of which may predomi-nate but both of which are usually present. The specificreasons for the development of these abnormalities arelargely unknown. Type 2 is the most common type ofdiabetes. Type 2 diabetes can remain asymptomatic for many years, and the diagnosis is often made from associatedcomplications or incidentally through an abnormal bloodor urine glucose test. Other specific types of diabetes include those due to genetic disorders, infections, diseases of the exocrine pan- creas, endocrinopathies, and drugs. This last type of diabetes is relatively uncommon. 270 | Jean-Claude Mbanya and Kaushik RamiayaTable 19.2 (Continued) Screening Diagnostic Sample Country Data sources method criteria size Age Nigeriab Mbanya et al. 1997 (Cameroon) and Amoah, Owusu, OGTT WHO, 1985 and 1999 6,500 24 /H11001 and Adjei 2002 (Ghana) R\u00e9union Dowse Rwandaa McLarty et al. 1989 and Aspray et al. 2000 (Tanzania) OGTT/FBG WHO, 1985 and 1999 7,781 15 /H11001 S\u00e3o Owusu, OGTT WHO, 1985 and 1999 6,500 24 /H11001 and Adjei 2002 (Ghana) Senegalb Mbanya et al. 1997 (Cameroon) and Amoah, Owusu, OGTT WHO, 1985 and 1999 6,500 24 /H11001 and Adjei 2002 (Ghana) Seychelles Dowse et (Cameroon) and Owusu, OGTT WHO, 1985 and 1999 6,500 24 /H11001 and Adjei 2002 (Ghana) Somaliaa McLarty et al. 1989 and Aspray et al. 2000 (Tanzania) OGTT/FBG WHO, 1985 and 1999 7,781 15 /H11001 South Africac Omar et al. 1993 and Levitt et al. 1993 (South Africa) OGTT WHO, 1985 1,208 15 /H11001 Swazilandc Omar et al. 1993 and Levitt et al. 1993 (South Africa) OGTT WHO, 1985 1,208 15 /H11001 Tanzaniaa McLarty et al. 1989 and Aspray et al. 2000 (Tanzania) OGTT/FBG WHO, 1985 and 1999 7,781 15 /H11001 al. 1997 (Cameroon) and Owusu, WHO, 1985 and 1999 6,500 24 /H11001 and Adjei 2002 (Ghana) Ugandaa McLarty et al. 1989 and Aspray et al. 2000 (Tanzania) OGTT/FBG WHO, 1985 and 1999 7,781 15 /H11001 Western Sahara Elbagir et al. 1996 (Sudan) 2BG WHO, 1985 1,284 25-84 Zambiaa McLarty et al. 1989 and Aspray et al. 2000 (Tanzania) OGTT/FBG WHO, 1985 and 1999 7,781 15 /H11001 Zimbabwea Omar et al. 1993 and Levitt et al. 1993 (South Africa) OGTT WHO, 1985 1,208 15 /H11001 Source: Adapted with permission from IDF 2003.

The definition applies whether insulin or only diet modification is used for treatment and whether the condition persists after pregnancy. It does not excludethe possibility that unrecognized glucose intolerance mayhave antedated or begun concomitantly with the pregnancy. Approximately 7 percent of all pregnancies are complicated by GDM. The prevalence may range from 1 to 14 percent ofall pregnancies, depending on the population studied andthe diagnostic tests employed. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is asymptomatic, and its diagnosis is confirmed by an elevated nondiabetic level of blood glucose two hours after a 75 gram oral glucosetolerance test. Impaired fasting glycemia (IFG) is an elevated nondiabetic fasting blood glucose level. Both IGTand IFG are transitional stages in the development oftype 2 diabetes. PREVALENCE AND INCIDENCE OF TYPE 1 DIABETES There is a dearth of published studies describing the inci- dence and prevalence of type 1 diabetes in Sub-SaharanAfrica. Type 1 diabetes is considerably rarer than type 2 disease, and large populations need to be surveyed. Also, to assess incidence, the population surveyed should be Diabetes Mellitus | 271Table 19.3 Data Sources for the Prevalence of Diabetes Complications, by Disease and Year Prevalence Year Data source Country Study type (%) Retinopathy 1988 Rolfe Zambia Clinic (secondary care) 34 1993 Lester Ethiopia Clinic (secondary care) 13 1995 Gill, Huddle, and Rolfe South Africa Clinic (secondary care) 521995 Moukouri et al.

Elamin and colleagues in the Sudan in 1992 reported a survey of nearly 43,000 schoolchildren (age 7 to11 years) and found a prevalence rate of 0.95 per 1,000(Elamin et al. 1992). This rate is comparable to a reportedprevalence rate of 0.3 per 1,000 in Nigeria (Afoke et al. 1992). The reported incidence is 10.1 per 100,000 children per year in Sudan (Elamin et al. 1992) and 1.5 per 100,000per year in Tanzania (Swai, Lutale, and McLarty 1993). Thediscrepancy between the Sudanese and Tanzanian studies may be explained by ethnic differences, and perhaps prob- lems related to the design of the studies. The question of whether type 1 diabetes is truly rarer in Africa than elsewhere remains unsettled, and more detailed surveys are needed. Nonetheless, it emerges from carefulclinic studies that the behavior of type 1 diabetes is differentin Sub-Saharan Africa from that in the rest of the world.Studies indicate that the age of onset in South Africa andEthiopia is later than elsewhere (Kalk, Huddle, and Raal1993; Lester 1984), and the peak age of onset of type 1 dia-betes in Sub-Saharan Africa is a decade later than in theWest (Afoke et al. 1992; Kalk, Huddle, and Raal 1993). Inaddition it afflicts more females than males. In South Africait has been reported that the peak age of onset was about13 years in the white South Africans (similar to Europeans) but about 23 years in the black South Africans (Kalk,Huddle, and Raal 1993). The reasons for this difference areobscure, although it has been suggested that prolongedbreastfeeding, which is common in Africa, may be reducingthe incidence and delaying the onset of type 1 diabetes. Earlyintroduction of cow's milk protein does seem to be a riskfactor for the later development of type 1 diabetes, possiblybecause, in neonates, bovine albumin can raise antibodiesthat mimic islet cell antibodies and attack pancreatic betacells. This is, of course, speculative, and much still remainsunknown about the pathogenesis and epidemiology oftype 1 diabetes in Africa. Genetic Factors More than 90 percent of type 1 diabetes subjects in Sub- Saharan Africa, as in the rest of the world, have one orboth human leukocyte antigens (HLA) DR3 and DR4. However, there appear to be specificities in the HLA sus- ceptibility found in certain African Recentstudies using probes fromZimbabwe, Senegal, some (Garcia-Pacheco et al. 1992; Chauffert et al. 1995). Immunological Factors The main markers of immune islet cell attack are islet cell antibodies (ICA) and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies(anti-GAD). These substances are found in most Caucasian type 1 diabetic patients at diagnosis, but levels gradually decline with time. Interpretation of ICA and anti-GADlevels in type 1 diabetes is dependent on duration of disease,and this may explain the variable results found in the limit- ed African studies so far carried out. McLarty, Kinabo, and Swai (1990) found that the prevalence of ICA antibodieswas only 8 to 11 percent in newly diagnosed Tanzanianpatients. In South Africa, Motala, Omar, and Pirie (2000)found that 44 percent of blacks with newly diagnosed type 1diabetes were positive for GAD antibody. It appears fromthese preliminary results that the genetic susceptibility and risk factors for type 1 diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa may bedifferent from those in the Western world. It can be specu-lated that non-autoimmune factors are the major determi-nants of type 1 diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa. Environmental Factors An environmental \"trigger\" factor for the onset of type 1 diabetes has long been sought. Its existence is supported bythe well-known seasonality of presentation in Europe, and viral infection (perhaps of the coxsackievirus group) is con- sidered a likely candidate. A seasonality of type 1 diabeteshas been reported in Tanzania (with most cases presentingbetween August and November) (McLarty, Yusafai, and Swai 1989). It would therefore seem likely that potential viral trig- gers operate also in the rest of Africa. PREVALENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES Before the 1990s, diabetes was considered a rare medical condition in Africa. Epidemiological studies carried out inthat decade, however, provided evidence of a trend toward increased incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes in African populations (Sobngwi et al. 2001). Indeed, Africa isexperiencing the most rapid demographic and epidemio-logical transition in world history (Mosley, Bobadilla, and Jamison 1993). It is characterized by a tremendous rise in the burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), 272 | Jean-Claude Mbanya and Kaushik Ramiayaunderlined by the increasing life expectancy and lifestyle changes resulting from the reduction in infectious diseases and increased fertility, as well as Westernization. Almost all the reports published between 1959 and 1985 showed a prevalence of diabetes below 1.4 percent, except those from South Africa, where higher prevalence wasreported. Differences in diagnostic methods and criteria,however, made comparison between countries difficult.Since then, uniform diagnostic criteria has become moreavailable, allowing comparison across countries.Epidemiological studies carried out during this period showthe rising prevalence of diabetes all over Africa (table 19.2). The prevalence of diabetes in Africa was approximately 3 million in 1994; but the region is due to experience a two- to threefold increase by the year 2010 (Amos, McCarty, andZimmet 1997). The highest prevalence is found in popula-tions of Indian origin, followed by black populations andCaucasians. Among the population of Indian origin inSouth Africa and Tanzania, the prevalence is between 12 and13 percent (Ramaiya, Swai, McLarty, and Alberti 1991). Theprevalence in blacks follows a Westernization gradient, withthat of rural Africa generally below 1 percent but that ofurban Africa between 1 and 6 percent. In general the preva-lence of type 2 diabetes is low in both rural and urban com-munities of West Africa except in urban Ghana, where a high rate of 6.3 percent was recently reported (Amoah, Owusu, and Adjei 2002). Moderate rates have been reportedfrom South Africa: 4.8 percent in a semi-urban communityin the Orange Free State, 6.0 percent in an urban commu-nity of the Orange Free State, 5.5 percent in Durban (mostlyoccupied by the Zulu tribe), and 8 percent in Cape T own(mostly occupied by the Xhosa tribe). Also, moderate rateshave been reported in studies from Tanzania (table 19.1). Estimates of the Prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes and IGT in 2003 There are marked discrepancies between the prevalence of diabetes among different communities in Sub-SaharanAfrica. The studies from Tanzania (Aspray et al. 2000; McLarty et al. 1989), showing an urban-to-rural ratio of five to one, and from Cameroon (Mbanya et al. 1997), with aratio of two to one, both confirm the urban-rural discrep-ancy in diabetes prevalence and suggest the consequent likely increases because of urban migration. The data used for the extrapolation of current prevalence rates (table 19.2)in distant and probably dissimilar countries and popula-tions indicate the great need for more epidemiologicalinvestigations in Sub-Saharan Africa. Such a need is dictated by the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes, which accountedfor 60 percent of those with diabetes in Cameroon (Mbanyaet al. 1997), 70 percent in Ghana (Amoah, Owusu, and Adjei2002), and over 80 percent in the recent study in Tanzania (Aspray et al. 2000). It would therefore appear that in Sub-Saharan Africa, for every diagnosed person with diabetes,there are one to three undiagnosed cases. The International Diabetes Federation estimated that in 2003 the number of people age 20 to 79 years with diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa was over 7 million for a population ofmore than 295 million, giving a prevalence rate of 2.4 per-cent. About 65 percent of those affected with diabetes livedin the urban areas, whereas 35 percent lived in the ruralcommunities. More than 46 percent (3.3 million) of the dia-betic population were 40 to 59 years old, whereas 28 percentand 26 percent, respectively, were 20 to 39 and 60 to 79 yearsold (table 19.4). This has serious implications for the pro-ductivity of the region, since diabetes affects the activemembers of the community. The top five countries withthe highest number of people affected by diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa are Nigeria (about 1.2 million people), SouthAfrica (841,000), the Democratic Republic of Congo(552,000), Ethiopia (550,000), and Tanzania (380,000)(table 19.4). The impact of type 2 diabetes is bound to continue if nothing is done to curb the rising prevalence of IGT, which now varies between 2.2 percent and 16.2 percent. The esti-mated prevalence rate of IGT in 2003 for Sub-SaharanAfrica is 7.3 percent with a total population of affected indi-viduals of over 21 million (table 19.5). Some 70 percent ofthese individuals are expected to develop type 2 diabetesunless something is done to reduce the risk factors associ-ated with the development of the disease. The projections of type 2 diabetes and IGT from 2003 to 2025 are shown in table 19.6. It is estimated that the burden of diabetes and IGT will just about double in 2025 fromtheir 2003 levels. The rate at which new cases of diabetesare emerging poses an additional burden on countriesalready stretched to the limit by common life-threateninginfections, such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Although it is true that these data are from cross-sectional studies that have limitations in establishing causality, they at least support the hypothesis that increasing prevalence of diabetes can be attributedlargely to changes in lifestyle resulting in reduced physicalactivity and increased calorie intake and subsequent weightgain. Such changes have important implications for the pro- vision of health care and for health education to promote behavioral change in order to control the emergence of dia-betes in Sub-Saharan Africa. Age and Ethnicity. Age and ethnicity are the two main nonmodifiable risk factors of diabetes in Africa. Glucose intolerance in Sub-Saharan Africa, as in other regions ofthe world, increases with age in both men and women(figure 19.1); however, published studies lack uniformityon the age range in which the prevalence of diabetes isobserved. According to King, Aubert, and Herman (1998),in most developed communities the peak of occurrence fallsin the age group of 65 years or older, whereas in developingcountries it is in the age group 45 to 64, and in Sub-Saharan Africa it is in the age groups 20 to 44 and 45 to 64 years. Y et data from 12 other studies from Sub-Saharan Africa indicatetwo peak age ranges of 45 to 64 and older than 65 years (seetable 19.1 for references). Two studies in Sub-Saharan Africa have examined ethnic differences in the prevalence of diabetes. A difference was found between Indians, blacks, and Caucasians in SouthAfrica, where Indians had the highest predisposition andwere followed by blacks and Caucasians (Levitt et al. 1999;Omar et al. 1994). In the Tanzanian study, the indigenous African population had lower diabetes prevalence thanthe migrant Asian group (1.1 percent as opposed to 9.1 to7.1 percent) (McLarty et al. 1989; Ramaiya, Swai, McLarty,Bhopal, et al. 1991; Swai et al. 1990). The prevalence of diabetes appears to be substantially higher in African-origin populations living abroad than in indigenous Africans. West Africans from Nigeria (Cooperet al. 1997) and central Africans from Cameroon (Mbanyaet al. 1997) were compared with populations of West Africanorigin in the Caribbean (Cooper et al. 1997; Mbanya et al.1997), United Kingdom (Cooper et al. 1997; Mbanya et al.1997), and the United States (Cooper et al. 1997). Thesestudies suggest that environment determines diabetesprevalence in these populations of similar genetic origin. Urban-Rural Differences. Residence seems to be a major determinant of diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa, since urban residents have 1.5- to 4.0 times higher prevalence of diabetes than their rural counterparts. This is attributable to lifestylechanges associated with urbanization and Westernization.Urban lifestyle in Africa is characterized by changes indietary habits involving an increase in the consumption ofrefined sugars and saturated fat and a reduction in fiberintake (Mennen et al. 2000). Sobngwi and colleagues (2002)have recently reported an increase in fasting plasma glucosein those whose lives have been spent in an urban environ-ment, suggesting that both lifetime exposure to and recent migration to or current residence in an urban environmentare potential risk factors for obesity and diabetes mellitus.The disease might represent the cumulative effects overyears of dietary changes, decrease in physical activity, andpsychological stress. The population of Africa is predominantly rural, but the 1995-2000 urban growth rate was estimated at 4.3 percent (compared with 0.5 percent in Europe). Thus, more than70 percent of the population of Africa will be urban resi-dents by 2025 (UNFPA 2000). There will therefore be a 276 | Jean-Claude Mbanya and Kaushik RamiayaTable 19.6 Projections of Diabetes and IGT from 2003 to 2025 in the Age Group of 20 to 79 Years All diabetes and IGT 2003 2025 Total population (millions) 666.6 1,107.4 Adult population (millions) 295.1 541.1 Diabetes prevalence (%) 2.4 2.8Diabetes numbers (millions) 7.1 15.0 IGT prevalence (%) 7.3 7.3 IGT numbers (millions) 21.4 39.4 Source: Adapted with permission from IDF 2003. 15-24 Source: /H11001 ageFigure 19.1 Prevalence of Diabetes with Increasing Age in Cameroontremendous increase in the prevalence of diabetes attribu- table to rapid urbanization. In addition, life expectancy at birth is rapidly increasing. For example, in Cameroon in 1960 it was about 35 years but in 1990 was raised to approx-imately 55 years. An increase in diabetes prevalence simplybecause of the change in the age structure of the populationis therefore expected. However, the HIV pandemic may change these estimates and projections. Family History of Diabetes. A significant proportion of the offspring of Cameroonians with type 2 diabetes have either type 2 diabetes (4 percent) or IGT (8 percent)(Mbanya et al. 2000). A positive family history seems to be an independent risk factor for diabetes, but this was notthe case in the Cape T own study (Levitt et al. 1993), in whichfamily history was not an independent risk factor. Measure of Adiposity. Several studies from Sub-Saharan Africa have confirmed the association between the preva- lence of diabetes and a surrogate of obesity, body mass index(BMI). Reports from Mali (Fisch et al. 1987), Nigeria(Cooper et al. 1997) and Tanzania (McLarty et al. 1989) haveshown that the prevalence of diabetes increases withincreasing BMI. BMI and obesity seem to be independentrisk factors for diabetes (Levitt et al. 1993). Physical Activity. There seems to be a significant relation- ship between physical inactivity and diabetes and obesity (Sobngwi et al. 2002). Physical activity is more common inrural than urban regions of Africa because rural populationsrely on walking for transport and often have intense agri-cultural activities as their main occupation. In Sub-SaharanAfrica, walking time and pace is drastically reduced (by fac-tors of 2 to 4 for walking at a slow pace and 6 to more than10 for walking at a brisk pace) in an urban community ascompared with a rural community. The main difference inphysical activity between the two types of community, how-ever, is the use of walking in rural areas as a means of trans-portation. The reduction in physical activity associated with life in a city partly explains the excess prevalence of obesity in urban areas. In a South African study, the prevalence of a sedentarylifestyle in Cape T own in subjects age 30 years and over was39 percent for men and 44 percent for women (Omar et al.1993). Low physical activity was normal for 22 percent ofmen and 52 percent of women in urban Tanzania, whereasit was usual for only 10 percent of men and 15 percent ofwomen living in rural areas (Edwards et al. 2000). Cross-sectional data from 1,417 women age 15 to 83 years in arural community and an urban community in Cameroonshowed that in all age groups, fasting blood glucose levelswere inversely associated with energy expenditure fromwalking (figure 19.2) (Sobngwi, Gautier, and Mbanya 2003).Rural dwellers' higher level of physical activity and relatedenergy expenditure compared with urban subjects goes farto explain why obesity was found to be at least four timeshigher in urban areas than rural (Aspray et al. 2000). Thus,lack of physical activity appears to be a significant risk fac-tor for diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa. COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES The escalating prevalence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and their complications in Sub-Saharan Africa are a major drainon health resources in financially difficult circumstances, inaddition to having a considerable physical and social impacton the individual and community. Acute Complications of Diabetes The three main metabolic complications of diabetes inSub-Saharan Africa are diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolarnonketotic coma, and hypoglycemia. Diabetic ketoacidosisis a common diabetic emergency in developing countriesand carries with it relatively high mortality, ranging from 25 percent in Tanzania to 33 percent in Kenya. The majorcontributing factors to such high mortality are the chroniclack of availability of insulin, delays in seeking medical Diabetes Mellitus | 277/H11021 30 Source: Adapted from Sobngwi, Gautier, and Mbanya 2003.

Hyperosmolar nonketotic coma is usually a complication of type 2 diabetes and is less common and accounts for about 10 percent of all hyperglycemic emergencies in devel-oping countries (Zouvanis et al. 1997). Infection is the lead-ing precipitating factor for both diabetic ketoacidosis andhyperosmolar nonketotic coma, followed by first presenta-tion of diabetes at a health institution and noncompliancewith a medical regimen (Zouvanis et al. 1997). It carries ahigh mortality of up to 44 percent according to studies fromSouth Africa, which may be because the patients are usually elderly and have other major illnesses (Rolfe et al. 1995). Hypoglycemia is also a serious complication of treat- ment in patients with diabetes. Of a total of 51 episodesin 43 patients admitted at the Baragwanath Hospital,Johannesburg, South Africa, 14 cases (33 percent) were asso-ciated with sulfonylurea treatment. The major cause precip-itating the event was a missed meal (36 percent), althoughalcohol (22 percent), gastrointestinal upset (20 percent), andinappropriate treatment (18 percent) were also importantcontributory factors (Gill and Huddle 1993). No mortalitywas associated with hypoglycemia in this study. Chronic Complications of Diabetes The seriousness of diabetes is largely a result of its associat- ed complications, which can be serious, disabling, and evenfatal. Prevalence studies on complications reported up to theearly 1990s gave widely variable figures. These have been reviewed in two studies and include figures ranging from 9 to 16 percent for cataract, 7 to 52 percent for retinopathy,6 to 47 percent for neuropathy, 6 to 30 percent fornephropathy, and 1 to 5 percent for macroangiopathy(Mbanya and Sobngwi 2003; Rolfe 1997). The variations aredue to diagnostic criteria problems, local and geographicalfactors, type of diabetes, and variation in duration of dia-betes. Since 1995, however, many more vigorous and well-conducted studies have taken place, giving a much clearerpicture of complication prevalence; these are summarized in table 19.3. It can be seen that there is generally less wide arange between these studies and also that the figures them-selves are substantial. The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy varies from 13 to 55 percent, depending on the duration of diabetes andglycemic control, with severe retinopathy representing15 percent of all cases (table 19.3). At diagnosis, 21 to 25 per-cent of type 2 patients and 9.5 percent of type 1 patientshave retinopathy. Ethnic differences in the prevalence ofretinopathy have been observed in multiethnic communi-ties. In South Africa, the highest prevalence of retinopathy isobserved in Africans, rather than Indians or Caucasians(whites), at diagnosis and after a similar duration of follow-up (Kalk et al. 1997). Although genetic predisposition maynot be ruled out, lack of blood glucose and blood pressurecontrol because of difficult access to health care mightaccount for most of these differences. The prevalence of nephropathy varies between 32 and 57 percent after a mean duration of diabetes of 5 to 10 yearsand between 5 and 28 percent within the first year followingthe diagnosis of diabetes (table 19.3). Diabetic nephropathyalso occurs early in the course of diabetes, because between 32 and 57 percent of diabetic patients with a mean durationof diabetes between 5 and 10 years have microalbuminuria(Kalk et al. 1997; Rahlenbeck and Gebre-Y ohannes 1997;Sobngwi et al. 1999). The diagnosis of nephropathy may,however, be faulty because of the presence of proteinuriadue to renal infections and sickle-cell anemia. In Africa, dia-betes mellitus accounts for a third of all patients who areadmitted to dialysis units (Diallo et al. 1997), and renalreplacement is both expensive and not widely available. It appears, therefore, that diabetic end-stage renal failure is thefirst cause of hospital mortality in diabetic patients inAfrica. In South Africa, for example, 50 percent of all causesof mortality in type 1 diabetic patients may be due to renalfailure (Gill, Huddle, and Rolfe 1995). The estimates of the prevalence of neuropathy vary wide- ly, depending on the methodology used to assess them. Macrovascular complications of diabetes are consideredrare in Africa despite a high prevalence of hypertension. Lower-extremity amputation varies from 1.5 to 7 percent, and about 12 percent of all hospitalized diabetic patientshave foot ulceration. A high proportion of patients havelower-limb arterial disease that contributes to the develop-ment of diabetic foot lesions. It is common to see patientswith diabetic foot ulcers as the presenting complaint of diabetes. Data from Tanzania have shown that the vastmajority (over 80 percent) of ulcers are neuropathic inorigin and not associated with peripheral vascular disease(Abbas, Lutale, and Morback 2000). Audits of diabetes carecarried out in Cape T own, South Africa; Dar es Salaam,Tanzania; and Y aound\u00e9, Cameroon, have demonstratedpoor glycemic control and inadequate foot care as riskfactors for diabetic foot. Fewer than 22 percent of patients 278 | Jean-Claude Mbanya and Kaushik Ramiayahad their feet examined during a year of attendance at primary health care clinics in these three cities, even though in Cape T own, 37 percent demonstrated either peripheral neuropathy or peripheral vascular disease (Abbas, Lutale,and Morback 2000; Boulton 1990). Limited patient knowl-edge of proper foot care, practices relating to foot care, andcultural beliefs, including the association of diabetes, leg ulcers, and lower extremity amputation with bewitchment, are also common problems encountered in Sub-SaharanAfrica countries (Abbas, Lutale, and Morback 2000; Boulton1990). Data on cerebrovascular disease are scarce because of the mortality associated with this complication, the low propor-tion of patients seen in hospitals, and the lack of death cer- tificates or proper records of the cause of death. Recentresults from the general population of Tanzania, where amorbidity and mortality surveillance system has been setup, show that stroke mortality was three to six times that ofEngland and Wales and that 4.4 percent of type 2 diabeticpatients presented with stroke at the diagnosis of diabetes(Walker et al. 2000). Coronary heart disease may affect 5 to8 percent of type 2 diabetic patients and cardiomyopathy upto 50 percent of all patients. Whereas microvascular compli-cations of diabetes are highly preventable and occur earlyduring the course of the disease, macrovascular disease is rare. Late diagnosis of diabetes, poor metabolic control, andnonstandardized diagnostic procedures rather than geneticpredisposition may account for this difference with otherpopulations around the world. MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH DIABETES There have been relatively few structured mortality studies from Africa, making quantification of outcome difficult.However, a major study from Zimbabwe in 1980 (Castle and Wicks 1980) recorded follow-up of 107 newly diagnosed diabetic patients (both type 1 and type 2). In-patient mor-tality was 8 percent, and the survivors had a mortality rateof 41 percent within six years of follow-up. Most deaths were due to infection, hyperglycemic emergencies (ketoaci- dosis and nonketotic coma), or hypoglycemia. Particularrisk factors for an adverse outcome were male gender, alco-hol abuse, and insulin treatment. Another outcome study was reported from Tanzania in 1990. A cohort of 1,250 newly diagnosed patients was fol-lowed from 1981 to 1987, and actuarial five-year survival rates were calculated (McLarty, Kinabo, and Swai 1990;Swai, Lutale, and McLarty 1990). Eighty-two percent of those not on insulin survived five years, but only 60 percentof the group on insulin treatment survived that long. Onceagain, the causes of death were predominantly metabolicand infective. The authors concluded that in Africa \"diabeteswas a serious disease with a poor prognosis.\" One revieweralso observed that the Tanzanian study indicated thatfive years from diagnosis, 40 percent of those on insulinwould die, whereas in Europe 40 percent of similar patientswould survive more than 40 years (Deckert, Poulsen, andLarsen 1978; Gill 1997). There is some evidence, however, that at least in some parts of Africa the prognosis of diabetes is improving.Figures reported from Ethiopia (Lester 1991, 1996), forexample, are considerably better than the Zimbabwean(1980) and Tanzanian (1990) data. Interestingly, althoughmetabolic emergencies were still the major cause of death,the mortality from renal failure was substantial, presumablyfrom diabetic nephropathy and large vessel disease. A cohortof type 1 diabetic patients who were followed in Soweto,South Africa, has also shown relatively prolonged survival(Gill, Huddle, and Rolfe 1995). At follow-up after 10 years, with a mean diabetes duration of 14 years, only 16 percenthad died. This figure was still in excess of Western rates,although almost all these deaths were due to nephropathy, acomplication mostly untreatable in Africa even now. Obviously, many factors affect mortality patterns among diabetic patients in different parts of Africa. These includeprovision of medical care and supply of insulin and othertreatment modalities, as well as a variety of social, cultural,and ethnic factors. As seen earlier, the gradual lengthening of the duration of diabetes in itself contributes to changingpatterns of mortality, to which diabetic nephropathy andmacroangiopathy are rapidly playing a larger part in manyareas. Large vessel disease is likely to accelerate in preva-lence also because of Western influences, such as smoking,obesity, reduced exercise, and high-fat diets. COST OF DIABETES Studies on the economics of diabetes care in Sub-SaharanAfrica are limited. A Medline search of such studies over thepast 20 years yielded only the Tanzanian study (Chale et al.1992). In Tanzania about US$4 million would have beenrequired to take care of all patients with diabetes in 1989/90, which translates to US$138 per patient per year. This sumis equivalent to 8.1 percent of the total budgeted health Diabetes Mellitus | 279expenditure for that financial year and well above the allo- cated per capita health expenditure in Tanzania of US$2 for the year 1989/90 (Chale et al. 1992). In Cameroon the aver- age direct medical cost of treating a patient with diabetes in2001 was US$489, of which 56 percent was spent on hospi-tal admissions, 33.5 percent on antidiabetic drugs, 5.5 per-cent on laboratory tests, and 4.5 percent on consultation fees. The direct medical costs for treating all diabetic patients in Cameroon represented about 3.5 percent of thenational budget for the year 2001/2002 (Nkegoum 2002).Estimates of diabetes care management in Malawi, based on international prices for essential drugs and Malawi hospital cost data, suggest that a type 1 diabetic patient spends aboutUS$100 per year for the purchase of insulin, and a type 2 patient spends US$25 annually on oral hypoglycemic agents(Vaughan, Gilson, and Mills 1989). The average age at onset of diabetes in Tanzania was 44 years and the average age at death was 46 years; popula-tion life expectancy was 53 years. The calculated number ofhealthy life days (HLDs) lost because of diabetes was4,100 days per patient, of which 69 percent was because ofpremature mortality. This calculation was based on an aver-age case-fatality rate after five years of 29 percent and asevere chronic disablement rate of 14 percent. The estimatedHLDs lost per capita because of diabetes were 820 person-days per 1,000 people per year (Chale et al. 1992). In Ghana the average age at onset of diabetes was 40 years, with50 percent case fatality after 15 years and an average age atdeath of 55 years, with 30 percent disablement before death.The total days lost were calculated as 217 per 1,000 peopleper year, of which 52 percent were due to premature death(Vaughan, Gilson, and Mills 1989). Table 19.7 reports the calculated estimates of the costs of diabetes care in Sub-Saharan Africa for persons age 20 to 79 years (IDF 2003). The table uses population estimatesand diabetes prevalence estimates reported in table 19.4 forthose age 20 to 79 years for 2003. The total health care budg-et for 20- to 79-year-olds can be derived by multiplying thepopulation figures for that age group by the per capitahealth expenditures. Calculations are then presented for val-ues of Rof 2 and 3. Ris the ratio of the cost of care for people with diabetes compared with the cost of care of peo- ple without diabetes. The data suggest that, at least for coun-tries with high or moderate incomes, the value of Rlies between 2 and 3 (IDF 2003) .The top five countries with the highest costs of diabetes care in Sub-Saharan Africa are South Africa, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, and Ghana(table 19.7).STRATEGIES FOR CONTROL During the last 10 years, health care spending in the devel- oping countries has remained low. Of the 40 heavilyindebted poor countries (HIPC) defined by the World Bank,33 of them are in Sub-Saharan Africa. The average per capitaincome of HIPCs, is US$310 per year. The health care spending is approximately US$8 per person per year, andpharmaceutical spending is approximately US$2 to $3 perperson per year (WHO 2003). The economic cost of diabetes and its complications is unaffordable by most Sub-Saharan Africans. Their incomesare insufficient to purchase insulin, oral hypoglycemicagents, and other supplies for management of diabetes. Thelimited resources of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa aredivided between fighting poverty, implementing education strategies, providing housing and appropriate sanitation,and dealing with the socioeconomic and health burdenof fighting the increasing incidence and prevalence ofHIV/AIDS. Diabetes poses an additional burden on the lim-ited health care delivery system. The problems encountered in the management of dia- betes in Sub-Saharan Africa include diagnosis; medical care;insulin and other drug supplies; monitoring; infectionsassociated with diabetes, especially the diabetic foot; dietaryadvice; diabetes education; and the low priority placed onnoncommunicable diseases. The training of health care providers and organizations is not focused on effective and efficient treatment of peoplewith diabetes. With modernization, economic well-being,and a Westernized lifestyle, the burden of diabetes and itscomplications also increases significantly. The resource-limited countries are unable to provide even minimum carein some instances, let alone secondary and tertiary care. Over the last 10 years several assessments of health care services for diabetes have been done, particularly in SouthAfrica (Whiting, Hayes, and Unwin 2003). The findingsfrom these studies have shown the following: Patients' attendance is poor. Consultation times are short, resulting in little or no time for patient education. Staffing levels are inadequate, and staffs' knowledge isused inappropriately. Staff are poorly or inadequately trained, or both, andthere exist hardly any continuous education programs. Monitoring and evaluation of complications of diabetesare lacking. 280 | Jean-Claude Mbanya and Kaushik RamiayaDiabetes Mellitus | 281Table 19.7 Calculated Estimates of the Costs of Diabetes Care, by Country Overall per capita Cost of diabetes care per year given health expenditure values for Rb(thousands of international $a) Country (international 3,624.3 Comoros Dem.

Referral systems are almost nonexistent. Education of people with diabetes is lacking. Overall organization of the clinics is not satisfactory. Record keeping is poor. Even if treatment guidelines are available, they are hardlyused and are not up to date. Health care systems in Sub-Saharan Africa vary widely. A structured, organized diabetes health care system is lacking. Many people with diabetes are managed by tradi- tional health care providers and general practitioners who are inadequately integrated into the primary care system. Other problems with or barriers to the quality of delivery and affordable care include the following: inadequate infrastructure irregular supply of medicines unaffordable insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, and anti- hypertensives disproportionate distribution of health care facilities lack of information and clear roles for members of dia-betes health care teams lack of appropriate and locally adapted diabetes edu-cation programs for people with diabetes and diabeteshealth care professionals lack of government support or subsidy, resulting in unaf-fordable costs. Cost of medication, especially the high cost of insulin, is a major handicap to proper diabetes care in Sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed, in a recent International Diabetes Federationsurvey (IDF 2003), it was observed that 80 percent of thepeople with diabetes were unable to obtain insulin andinsulin syringes because they could not afford them. Thecost of insulin preparations was higher in Sub-SaharanAfrica than elsewhere (figure 19.3). Insulin and insulinsyringes were accessible to only 11 percent of all people withdiabetes in Africa. In addition, only 25 percent of people with diabetes monitored their blood glucose. Self-monitoring of blood glucose was rarely used, mainlybecause of the cost of testing supplies in 90 percent and theunavailability of testing supplies in 70 percent of the coun-tries in Africa (IDF 2003). It is clear that the organization of diabetes care in Sub- Saharan Africa has limitations at several levels of healthdelivery (box 19.1). There are solutions for each level oflimitations and problems.

Care for people with diabetes needs to begin at the primary health care level, followed by secondary and tertiary health care. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the rural-to-urban migration results in a significant increase in the geo-graphical spread of people with diabetes. The health care forpeople with diabetes tends to be concentrated in large urban hospitals, too far from most of the people who need to use the services. Outreach programs in which health careworkers move out into the community are feasible, afford-able, and achievable and will benefit the rural population. That will probably be the long-term solution to the prob- lems of the management of diabetes. DIABETES HEALTH CARE More than 50 years ago people with diabetes were mostly treated in hospitals by specialists. With limited resourcesand shrinking health budgets, together with a sharp rise in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, specialist care in a hospital is not possible for everyone. An increasing number of pri-mary and community health care professionals are respon-sible for managing people with diabetes. The ongoing health sector reforms in most of the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa have promoted more responsive and appropriateplanning through decentralized and demand-driven healthcare, in which district managers decide how to divide theirbudgets between prevention and control of different healthproblems (WHO 2000). In order to plan for proper delivery of diabetes health care, Sub-Saharan Africa countries need epidemiological and health services information. There is also a need toknow the estimates of the prevalence of diabetes, its risk fac-tors, and its complications. Finally, adequate knowledge ofthe overall burden of diabetes in high-risk populations andcountries is a prerequisite for effective diabetes health caredelivery (King et al. 1998). Prevention Sufficient evidence exists from countries outside Africa that weight loss, diet, and exercise can prevent or delay diabetesin people with IGT (Pan et al. 1997; Tuomilehto et al. 2001;Vijan et al. 1997) and that physical activity may exert anindependent effect on the prevention and control of dia- betes (Wojtaszewski et al. 2000). The strategies for primary prevention, mostly involving support for behavior change through different forms offocused education and mass-media campaigns, are highly cost-effective (Swai et al .1990). Prevention strategies in Sub-Saharan Africa have their own limitations. Lack of awareness by the population of and facilities for detectionand monitoring contributes to the high prevalence of dia-betic complications, and poorly skilled or inadequate healthcare staff, delay in seeking medical attention, and lack ofaccess to affordable drugs contribute to the high rate ofdiabetes-related mortality. Unless these factors are takeninto account when planning effective preventive strategies,the objectives will not be attainable. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS 1998a) and the Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT 1993) have shown that intensive control ofglucose results in a 25 to 70 percent reduction in the numberand severity of microvascular complications in people withdiabetes. The UKPDS also demonstrated a 12 percent reduc-tion in mortality related to type 2 diabetes. In the UKPDS,control of high blood pressure reduced the risk of microvas-cular complications by 37 percent and death from type 2diabetes-related disease by 32 percent (UKPDS 1998b),better reductions than those from tight blood glucose con- trol (UKPDS 1998a), although the combination of blood pressure and blood glucose control was the most effective. Health beliefs are still deeply enshrined in the healing cultures of people in Sub-Saharan Africa, thereby predis- posing most patients to alternate between modern and tra-ditional clinics. There are places in Sub-Saharan Africawhere chlorpropamide and tolbutamides are still drugs ofchoice (and the only ones available) together with alpha methyldopa (for blood pressure control) in people affectedwith diabetes. The newer classes of drugs\u2014sulfonylureagroup, glinides\u2014are unaffordable for the majority of thepopulation. One of the major challenges facing insulin-treated patients in Sub-Saharan Africa is the lack of a constant sup- ply of insulin at affordable cost (Yudkin 2000). The supplyof insulin in Sub-Saharan Africa is erratic, even at large hos-pitals, and the prospects for people with type 1 diabetes are poor (Amoah et al. 1998; Dagogo-Jack 1995). The exact bur-den of poor insulin access in developing countries is stillunknown, because no good scientific study has been carriedout in these countries. However, 16 percent of the world'spopulation in developed countries with about 35 percent ofall diabetic patients use over 40 percent of the world's total insulin each year (Jervell 1996; King 1998). Moreover, a small percentage of type 2 diabetes patients in developingcountries require insulin when they become severely wastedand hyperglycemic. Therefore, insulin is underutilized in Diabetes Mellitus | 283Sub-Saharan Africa. In the second edition of Diabetes Atlas, the IDF's Task Force on Insulin Survey reports that no coun- try in Africa had 100 percent accessibility to insulin. In fact two countries in Africa had the lowest accessibility in theworld: the Democratic Republic of Congo, where peoplewith type 1 diabetes had access to insulin for less than25 percent of the time, and Zambia, where those with type 2 diabetes had access to insulin only 26 to 49 percent of the time. The high cost of insulin appears to be the most impor-tant cause of lack of access to insulin in people with type 1diabetes in most countries of Africa (IDF 2003). There is therefore an urgent need for the initiation of international programs to alleviate the plight of insulin-treated patients inAfrica. These programs may include (a) a selection of type of drug through the essential drug list; (b) improvingaffordability of the price charged by applying such measuresas national price information, patent status, availability ofgenerics, equity pricing schemes, review of general taxes andmargins, and as a last resort, parallel import and compulsivelicensing; and (c) sustainable financing of medical suppliesthrough general tax levies, insurance schemes, copaymentor full payment by the patient, loans, and donations (IDF1998). One of the solutions to the problem being discussedis donation of insulin combined with a mechanism to sup-port logistics, education, and monitoring. The limiting fac- tor with this scheme is long-term sustainability. Very few countries in Sub-Saharan Africa can afford to screen and treat the complications of diabetes (nephropa- thy, retinopathy, neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease)(Dagogo-Jack 1995). ACE inhibitors are a cost-effective wayto reduce mortality and end-stage renal failure in peoplewith type 1 diabetes (and type 2 diabetes) with microalbu-minuria, but they are of limited use because most peoplecannot afford them (Hendry et al. 1997; T ooke, Thomas,and Viberti 2000). The potential for intervention andprevention of diabetic foot lesions is very high as a cost-effective strategy. The Role of Diabetes Associations The role of Diabetes Associations cannot be overempha- sized. National Diabetes Associations should urge the gov-ernment and nongovernmental organizations to ensureconsistent and readily available insulin and other antidia-betes drugs and supplies at a subsidized cost. The national associations can also play a significant role in impartingeducation at different levels of health care and to the com-munity at large.The Role of the Patient Patients must be empowered and motivated to join associa- tions. They have to be informed about their rights. T ogetherwith the community, they would be able to remove mis-conceptions, mistrust, and the stigma of diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa. The standard and quality of care being provided for people with diabetes has many limitations,which have to be overcome by a multisectoral approach. CONCLUSION Epidemiological data on diabetes mellitus in Sub-Saharan Africa are still limited. However, the prevalence and inci-dence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are increasing withthe persistent rural-to-urban migration. Clearly, knowledgeof the disease has increased since the 1990s; nevertheless, adoption of a Western lifestyle has greatly enhanced itsdevelopment. The evidence shows that type 2 diabetes is amajor cause of morbidity and mortality on the continentand that it is costly to manage diabetes and its complica-tions. Given that the region still has a double and sometimestriple disease burden and that little priority is given to non-communicable diseases like diabetes, and in the absence of ahealth care system adapted to this new reality and able to usecostly therapeutic interventions, well-planned cost-effective methods of prevention and treatment and refined tools toassess health services and monitor progress are thereforerequired.

Diabetes Mellitus | 287289Cancer has received low priority for health care services in Sub-Saharan Africa. The reason is undoubtedly the over-whelming burden of communicable diseases, as illustratedby the proportions of deaths by major categories. Table 20.1shows estimates, for Africa and for the whole world, made by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the percent-ages of deaths due to different causes in the year 2002(WHO 2004). From a purely objective point of view, therefore, con- centration on health problems in Africa that have beenlargely solved in the developed world (infant and childmortality, maternal mortality, infectious diseases) appearseminently reasonable. Unfortunately, these \"old\" diseasescoexist in Africa with the emergence of new ones, most prominently the acquired immune deficiency syndrome(AIDS), but also some of the noncommunicable diseases,such as hypertension, diabetes, accidents and Krug 2001; Seedat 2000;Walker et al. 2000), and cancer. Cancer is not a rare diseasein Africa. Even ignoring the huge load of AIDS-relatedKaposi's sarcoma, the probability that a woman living inpresent-day Kampala or Harare will develop a cancer by theage of 65 years is only about 20 percent lower than that of her sisters in Western Europe (table 20.2). Y et the facilitiesfor providing treatment for cancer cases in most of Africa are minimal, as illustrated by the sparse distribution of radiation therapy services in Africa (figure 20.1) (Levin,El-Gueddari, and Meghzifene 1999). The noncommunicable diseases, such as cancers, are emerging health problems that need to be dealt with appro-priately to sustain public health advances that have alreadybeen achieved. Increases in the prevalence of tobacco con-sumption and immunosuppression induced by the humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV), coupled with such existingrisk factors for cancer as alcohol; the high prevalence ofcancer-associated infectious agents like human papillo- maviruses (HPV), hepatitis B viruses (HBV), and humanherpesvirus-8 (HHV8); and environmental exposure totoxins, such as aflatoxins, will have an important impact onfuture cancer patterns and incidence. Even despite decliningoverall life expectancy as a result of the HIV epidemic,Africans will continue to age, which will contribute tocancer's becoming an increased burden on health services,both in relative and absolute terms.Chapter20 Cancers Freddy Sitas, Max Zvavahera Chirenje, Lara Stein, Nokuzola Mqoqi, and Henry WabingaUntil quite recently, knowledge of cancer patterns was based primarily on clinical and pathological case series from the 1950s and 1960s,which were the subject of several reviews that drew together information on the relative frequency ofdifferent types of cancer in different areas in order to piecetogether an overall picture (Clifford, Linsell, and Timms1968; Cook and Burkitt 1971; Oettl\u00e9 1964). Statistics on dis- ease mortality are particularly sparse. Only about 0.25 per- cent of the population of Sub-Saharan Africa is covered byaccurate death registration systems. The countries that havereasonably accurate death registration include islands like Mauritius and the Seychelles, which are unlikely to be rep- resentative of the region, and no country on the mainland ofSub-Saharan Africa has data of sufficient quality for the esti- mation of national mortality rates (Mathers et al. 2005).Hence, reliance has to be placed on indirect measures ofmortality and on the few cancer registries that do existacross Africa, now covering roughly 8 percent (Parkin et al.2003) of this population. An exception to this has beenSouth Africa, which until 1990 had almost complete deathnotification for whites, mixed race \"coloureds,\" and AsianIndians, comprising about 20 percent of the population.Population group identifiers on death notification formswere removed in 1991 but reintroduced in 1998. Nationalcoverage of deaths in South Africa across all populations has now increased to over 90 percent (Dorrington et al. 2001). Since the 1990s there has been a resurgence of interest in cancer incidence in Africa, and data from cancer registries from Sub-Saharan Africa have been published from WestAfrica in The Gambia (Bah et al. 2001), Mali (Bayo et al.1990), Guinea (Koulibaly et al. 1997), and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire(Echimane et al. 2000). Data from East Africa are availablefrom cancer registries in Kampala, Uganda (Wabinga et al.2000), and from southern Africa from the Zimbabwe CancerRegistry in Harare (Chokunonga et al. 2000), and theMalawi Cancer Registry in Blantyre (Banda et al. 2001). Cancer registration in economically underdeveloped populations, such as all the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa,is a difficult undertaking for a variety of reasons (Parkin et al.2003). The major challenge is to ensure that all new cases ofcancer are identified. Cases can be found only when theycome into contact with health services: hospitals, health cen-ters, clinics, and laboratories. When resources are restricted,the proportion of the population with access to such insti-tutions may be limited, and the statistics generated will thusnot truly reflect the pattern of cancer. The ease with whichthe cases can be identified also depends on the extent ofmedical facilities available and the quality of statistical and 290 | Freddy Sitas, Max Parkin, Zvavahera Chirenje, Lara Stein, Nokuzola Mqoqi, and Henry WabingaCause World Africa No. of deaths (all causes) 57,029,000 10,664,000 Infectious and parasitic diseases, 7.3 22.6 excluding HIV/AIDS, respiratory infections HIV/AIDS 4.9 19.6Respiratory infections 6.9 10.5Maternal and perinatal causes 5.2 7.4Cancer 12.5 3.8Cardiovascular disease 29.3 9.7Injuries, violence 9.1 7.0 Other causes 24.8 19.4 Source: WHO 2004.

It is impossible to know, without an extensive population survey, what proportion of those withcancer never come into contact with modern diagnostic ortreatment services, instead making use only of traditionalhealers or receiving no care at all. In the past, studies have suggested that some sections of the population may have been underrepresented in hospitalstatistics, particularly older women and young men, both ofwhom were more likely to return to their rural homes to seek care (Flegg Mitchell 1966). However, currently, this underrepresentation is probably rather rare in contempo-rary urban Africa. Most cancer patients will, eventually, seek medical assistance, although often at an advanced stage ofdisease. The situation in rural areas may be quite different,but almost all the present-day cancer registries are located inurban centers. From an epidemiological point of view, onemust guess at how well the cancer profile from the urbanareas reflects that in the country as a whole, given what is known of urban-rural differences in cancer patterns inother areas of the world. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has published the available data on cancer incidence and other cancer data from a variety of sources (Parkin et al.2003). Such data have also been used to prepare a set of esti-mates of incidence and mortality at the national level for theyear 2002 (Ferlay et al. 2005). These sources are extensivelyused in this chapter. We also draw upon the few availableseries from which it is possible to make some inferencesabout temporal trends in cancer incidence: the two cancerregistries with data available in the 1960s\u2014Kampala(Uganda) and Ibadan (Nigeria)\u2014and the mortality data sets from South Africa referred to earlier. According to the 2002 estimates of cancer incidence for the Sub-Saharan Africa region, about half a million (530,000) new cases of cancer occurred annually, 251,000in males and 279,000 in females. Table 20.3 shows the Cancers | 291Table 20.3 Estimated Number of New Cases and Age-Standardized (World) Incidence Rates for the Leading Cancers in Males and Females, 2002 (per 100,000 people) Eastern Middle Northern Southern Western Sub-Saharan Africa Africa Africa Africa Africa Africa Africa Sex/cancer Cases ASR Cases ASR Cases ASR Cases ASR Cases ASR Cases ASR Cases ASR Males Kaposi's sarcoma 23,094 23.0 10,097 4.4 3.9Ovary, 4,706 8,195 4.3 10,903 4.2Esophagus 5,411 8.0 62 0.2 875 1.4 1,301 7.0 410 0.6 7,184 4.1 8,058 3.4 All ASR/H11005age-standardized rate.leading cancer types by region (including the northern Africa region) and by sex. Figure 20.2 shows the major can-cer types in Sub-Saharan Africa; overall, world-standardized cancer rates were estimated to be 133 per 100,000 females and 136 per 100,000 males. The top six cancers in males were the following: Kaposi's sarcoma (15.9 percent) liver (13.3 percent) prostate (10.7 percent) esophagus (6.0 percent) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (5.8 percent) stomach (4.5 percent). In females, the following were the leading cancers: cervix (25.4 percent) breast (17.4 percent) Kaposi's sarcoma (6.2 percent) liver (5.5 percent) stomach (3.8 percent) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (3.8 percent). Each of these cancers is briefly discussed in this chapter. In addition, tobacco-related cancers (especially lung cancer, which currently ranks seventh in males) and HIV-relatedcancers (cancers aside from Kaposi's sarcoma) are discussed,as these are likely to increase over time as both theseepidemics mature.CERVICAL CANCER Cancer of the cervix is the leading cancer in women in Sub- Saharan Africa with an estimated 70,700 new cases occurringin 2002 (the total in the whole continent was 78,900 cases).Estimated rates for eastern and southern Africa of 30 to 60per 100,000 are higher than those found in the rest of Sub- Saharan Africa (20 to 35 per 100,000), but the reasons for thisdifference are unclear. In many developed countries, such asthe United Kingdom and Sweden, mortality from cancer of the cervix declined between the early 1900s and the 1960s and then declined further as a result of the introduction ofnational screening programs (Bergstrom, Sparen, and Adami1999). However, in Bulawayo between 1963 and 1977 and inKampala in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1990s, cancer of the cervixhas appeared to increase in incidence over time (Skinner et al. 1993; Wabinga et al. 2000). No increases over time wereobserved in Nigeria and South Africa (Parkin et al. 2003). It was noted early that cervical cancer has quite marked differences in incidence according to classical demographicvariables (social class, marital status, ethnicity, religion).Later, epidemiological studies (mainly case-control studies)showed a consistent association between risk and early age atinitiation of sexual activity, increasing number of sexualpartners of females or of their sexual partners, and otherindicators of sexual behavior. These findings were stronglysuggestive of a causative role for a sexually transmitted agent.It is now recognized that certain sexually transmitted onco-genic human papillomaviruses constitute the necessary causeof cervical cancer. However, additional independent riskfactors include increasing number of pregnancies, exposureto oral contraceptives, smoking, and specific dietary patterns. At the onset of the AIDS epidemic, cancer of the cervix was classified as an AIDS-defining cancer by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC 1993).But it is far from clear that HIV infection really increases therisk of invasive cervical cancer. No change in cervical cancerincidence has been demonstrated in some centers likeHarare, where HIV/AIDS has been endemic for some time(Chokunonga et al. 1999). In Kampala the increase in cervi-cal cancer incidence began before the advent of AIDS(Wabinga et al. 2000). With respect to cervical intraepithe-lial neoplasia (CIN), most studies failed to adjust for the factthat, for obvious reasons, women infected by HIV were veryoften also infected by HPV (with a consequently high risk ofCIN). Careful adjustment for such confounding suggeststhat HIV has an independent effect on risk of CIN but thatit is small; there is an interaction between the effects of HIVand HPV , as might be expected, if the role of HIV is indirect, 292 | Freddy Sitas, Max Parkin, Zvavahera Note: Number of cases was 530,148.Figure 20.2 Major Cancer Types in Sub-Saharan Africa, Both Sexes, All Agesthrough creation of immune suppression and dysfunction (Mandelblatt et al. 1999). Case-control and descriptive studies on cancer of the cervix in Africa have shown associations of the disease similar to those observed in Western countries with respectto number of partners, level of education, high parity, andsteroid contraceptives; however, genital hygiene, vaginal dis- charge, alcohol, and male circumcision were also found in certain studies to be important (Parkin et al. 2003). HIV wasfound to be associated with cervical cancer in case-controland cohort studies in South Africa and Uganda (Mbulaiteye et al., forthcoming; Newton et al. 2001; Sitas et al. 2000) with odds ratios between 1.6 and 2.4; however, such a weak asso-ciation could easily be due to confounding by sexual activity, and other studies have shown no association (Newton et al.1995; Sitas et al. 1997; ter Meulen et al. 1992). With regard toHPV , subtypes 16, 18, and 31 appear to be the leading ones,but other sexually transmitted infections causing chroniccervico-vaginal inflammation may increase the risk of cervi-cal cancer. Before the introduction of screening programs in the 1960s and 1970s, the incidence in most of Europe, North America, and Australia and New Zealand was much as wesee it in Africa today: it was 38 per 100,000 in the SecondNational Cancer Survey of the United States, for example(Dorn and Cutler 1959). National screening programs havebeen responsible for the further decline in the incidence ofcancer of the cervix. Pap test screening, with coverage ofover 80 percent of the female population over 35 years of ageappears to be the most effective method in reducing theincidence of cervical cancer. For example, if women wereoffered screening three times in their lifetime (at about ages35, 45, and 55) the incidence of cancer of the cervix wouldbe halved (Miller 1992). Given the complex organization of screening programs, no organized national cervical cancer screening program exists in Africa. Reasons for this include lack of good qualitycytology services, difficulty of long-term follow-up inmany communities, lack of education, and lack of postalfacilities and infrastructure. But many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa do not have the ability to diagnose or treatCIN. In other countries some attention has been given to thevalue of screening by visual inspection after acetic acidimpregnation of the cervix (University of Zimbabwe/JHPIEGO Cervical Cancer Project 1999). The high negativepredictive value of this approach suggests that few signifi-cant lesions will be missed. If appropriately and safelytreated by effective, affordable methods like cryotherapy(Chirenje et al. 2001), then this method may provide a use- ful alternative to the conventional Pap test, not least in thattreatment is provided during the same visit as the screening test, thus dispensing with the requirement to recall women for diagnosis and therapy. Vaccines against the leading HPV serotypes have now been developed, and programs may be implemented for women before they become sexually active. However, it isunclear how long the protection will last and whether thevaccine will also be effective in reducing the incidence ofcancer of the cervix among women who are infected. Theongoing trials are expected to clarify such issues. As men arealso carriers of HPV , future studies ought to measure anyadded effectiveness of vaccination in this group. BREAST CANCER Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women in Sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for 16.8 percentof all female cancers. Central, West, and East Africa appearto have lower incidence rates than southern Africa, the latterestimated at 33.4 per 100,000. An estimated total of 48,600 cases occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2002. Worldwide, risk factors for female breast cancer include menstrual and reproductive factors, high body mass index (BMI), family history of breast cancer, and certain geneticmutations, including BRCA1/2. Other suggested risk factorsinclude, to a much lesser extent, high alcohol consumption,contraceptive use, and the use of certain postmenopausalhormone replacement therapies. Reproductive and hor-monal factors appear to be the most important, with risk being increased by early menarche, late menopause, lateage at first birth, and low parity (Henderson, Ross, andBernstein 1988). Studies in Sub-Saharan Africa have also found reproduc- tive and hormonal factors to be important, reporting increased risk with advanced age at first pregnancy anddelivery, low parity, and late age at menarche (Adebamowoand Adekunle 1999; Coogan et al. 1996; Shapiro et al. 2000;Ssali, Gakwaya, and Katangole-Mbidde 1995). In Sub-Saharan Africa, higher incidence rates and relative frequencies of breast cancer have been reported in association with urban than with rural residence (Oettl\u00e9 and Higginson 1966; Schonland and Bradshaw 1968), but data are sparse.The incidence of breast cancer is much higher among whitewomen in Africa than among black African women; forexample, in Harare between 1993 and 1995, the incidence Cancers | 293was 127.7 per 100,000 in whites and 20.4 in blacks (Chokunonga et al. 2000). These differences may be a reflec- tion of the distribution of lifestyle factors thought to be important in the development of breast cancer, for example,low parity and high body mass. Breast cancer risk has been associated with socioeconomic status, with women of higher social class (as measured byeducation, income, housing, and so forth) having a higherrisk (Kogevinas et al. 1997). Once again, such differences aremost likely a reflection of different prevalences of risk factorsamong social classes (for example, parity, age at menstrua-tion and menopause, height, weight, alcohol consumption). The effect of oral contraceptive hormones on the risk of breast cancer has been the subject of much research. There appears to be a small but detectable risk in women currentlyusing oral contraceptives, but this diminishes when contra-ception ceases, and after 10 years, none of the excess riskremains (Reeves 1996). A case-control study in South Africafound that combined oral contraceptives may result in asmall increase in risk, confined to women below the age of25 years, but that injectable progesterone contraceptives didnot increase risk (Shapiro et al. 2000). Dietary fat appears to be correlated with the risk of breast cancer in interpopulation studies (Prentice and Sheppard 1990), but the association has been difficult to confirm in studies of individuals (Hunter et al. 1996). However, obesityin postmenopausal women has been identified as a riskfactor in Europe (Bergstrom et al. 2001) as well as in Sub-Saharan Africa (Adebamowo and Adekunle 1999; Walkeret al. 1989). Although traditional diets in Africa are typicallylow in animal products, especially fat, and high in fiber(Labadarios et al. 1996; Manning et al. 1971), this pattern isbeing modified by urbanization and Westernization oflifestyles, which may lead to an increase in breast cancerincidence in African populations. A case-control study inCape T own did not find a protective effect of breastfeedingon breast cancer (Coogan et al. 1999). However, in a meta-analysis of 47 studies from 30 countries breastfeedingappears to be protective; based on a reanalysis of about50,302 cases and 96,973 controls, two-thirds of the differ-ence in rates between developed and developing countrieswere estimated to be attributed to breastfeeding (Inter-national Collaboration on HIV and Cancer 2002). At least part of the familial risk of breast cancer is medi- ated through the major susceptibility genes BRCA1 andBRCA2 (about 2 percent of breast cancer cases in Europe).Very little is known of the prevalence of these mutations inAfrican populations, although family history of breast canceris also a risk factor in this setting (Rosenberg et al. 2002).About 1 percent of all breast cancer cases occur in men, with the male-to-female ratio being higher in black and African populations than among white populations (Parkin et al. 2003; Sasco, Lowels, and Pasker de Jong 1993). A review of the literature indicates a deficit of studies on breast cancer risk in Sub-Saharan Africa, and further research could be beneficial. As certain groups become moreWesternized and urbanized, with associated changes in diet,later childbirth, and reduced parity and periods of breast-feeding, breast cancer incidence may increase. Public healthcampaigns should encourage breastfeeding unless there aregood reasons not to (for example, HIV-infected motherswhere milk powder and sterile water are freely available).There is no organized mammography screening program in Sub-Saharan Africa. KAPOSI'S SARCOMA Prior to the HIV/AIDS era, Kaposi's sarcoma was a rare can- cer in Western countries, seen mainly among immigrantsfrom the Mediterranean littoral and African regions and inimmunosuppressed transplant recipients. Meanwhile, inAfrica, the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma varied 100-fold, being most common in central and eastern Africa and rarein northern and southern Africa (IARC 1996; Oettl\u00e9 1962);in certain parts of central and eastern Africa, Kaposi'ssarcoma was as common as cancer of the colon was in theWest (Cook-Mozaffari et al. 1998). There appears to besome geographical association with the prevalence ofhuman herpes virus-8, now regarded as a necessary causefor the development of Kaposi's sarcoma (Dukers and Rezza2003). The incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma has increased over 1,000-fold in populations at high risk of HIV in someWestern countries (Biggar et al. 1984; Rabkin, Biggar, andHorm 1991), but in the rest of the population the tumor stillremains relatively rare (Grulich, Beral, and Swerdlow 1992;Rabkin, Biggar, like Malawi, Swaziland, Uganda, and Zimbabwe, whereKaposi's sarcoma was relatively common before the era ofAIDS, the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma has increased about20-fold, such that it is now the leading cancer in men andthe second leading cancer in women. In these cancer reg-istries, overall age-standardized rates have increased byabout 15 percent, mainly as a result of HIV-associatedKaposi's sarcoma (for example, Bassett et al. 1995; Wabingaet al. 1993; Wabinga et al. 2000). According to the most recent estimates, 40,000 cases of Kaposi's sarcoma in males and 17,200 cases in females were 294 | Freddy Sitas, Max Parkin, Zvavahera Chirenje, Lara Stein, Nokuzola Mqoqi, and Henry Wabingaestimated for 2002 for Sub-Saharan Africa; only 200 male and 65 female cases were estimated to occur in northern Africa. The region most affected is central Africa (age- standardized rates in males of 30 per 100,000) followed byeastern, southern, and lastly western Africa, in line with thebackground prevalence of HIV in each of these regions.With regard to the effect of HIV infection, three case- control studies from Africa showed increased risks of 30 to 50 in association with HIV , and these risks rise to 1,600 inHIV-positive individuals with high HHV8 antibody titers(Newton et al. et al. et al. 1999; Sitas et al. 2000). HHV8 in adults is associated with increasing age, low educational standard, and increasing numbers ofsexual partners (Sitas et al. 1999). Antiretroviral therapy for treating HIV in adults has caused a decline in the incidenceof Kaposi's sarcoma in Western countries (InternationalCollaboration on HIV and Cancer 2000). HHV8 in childrenappears to be associated with infected mothers (Bourbouliaet al. 1998). In countries with a high prevalence of HIV ,Kaposi's sarcoma is now the leading cancer in children,causing almost a doubling in the childhood cancer inci-dence (Chokunonga et al. 1999; Wabinga et al. 1993).Antiretroviral drugs have now become more available inBotswana and recently in South Africa. If their use becomeswidespread, then a decline in the incidence of Kaposi's sar- coma would be expected; however, it is unclear whetherantiretrovirals (for example, zidovudine [AZT] or nevirap-ine) issued to mothers during delivery, which proved effec-tive in reducing mother-child transmission of HIV , wouldcause a decline in Kaposi's sarcoma in children. STOMACH CANCER A total of 13,800 cases of stomach cancer in males and 10,700 in females was estimated in Sub-Saharan Africa in2002. Age-standardized incidence rates in males varied, per 100,000, from 3.4 in western Africa to 7.4 in eastern, 8.2 in southern, and 13.4 in central Africa. In western Africa,where the incidence of stomach cancer is the lowest, themale-to-female ratio is 0.9 to 1; however, there is a male predominance in all other areas (table 20.3). Despite the generally low incidence rate in Africa, some populationshave a particularly high incidence rate. Clusters of high inci-dence exist among the South African mixed race, orcoloured, population of 98 per 100,000. A high incidencerate is also reported in the Great Lakes region that includesBurundi, Kivu Province of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, northwestern Tanzania, and southwesternUganda. In Rwanda the age-standard incidence rate was found to be 13 per 100,000 males and 15 per 100,000 females (Newton et al. 1996). In western Uganda, stomachcancer was the second most common cancer, accounting for12 percent of all male cancers and 6 percent of all femalecancers (Wabinga et al. 2000). Bamako in Mali was anotherarea with a high incidence rate: 18.5 per 100,000 males and15 per 100,000 females (Bayo et al. 1990). There is evidence of a slight but not significant increase in the incidence of stomach cancer over time in Kampala(Wabinga et al. 2000). In Kivu Province of the DemocraticRepublic of Congo, the incidence rates of stomach canceramong males and females were 9 and 15 per 100,000, respec-tively, in 1956-60, but this dropped to 6 and 4.5 per 100,000in 1983-86 (Bourdeaux et al. 1988; Clemmensen, Maisin, However, in rural Kenya reported inci- dence increased as a result of an endoscope acquired by themain hospital there (McFarlane et al. 2001). Trend data fromthe rest of Africa are incomplete or inconsistent; however,in South Africa, between 1948 and 1964 no real change inthe relative frequency of stomach cancer was observed overtime in one of the country's largest hospitals serving the pre-dominantly black population of Soweto, Johannesburg (Robertson 1969), nor was a change observed in pathology-based cancer national registrations between 1986 and 1995(Sitas, Madhoo, and Wessie 1998). Helicobacter pylori infection is now recognized as an important risk factor for cancer of the stomach (IARC 1994); however, smoking and diets low in fruit and vegeta-bles and vitamin C, and high in salts appear to play animportant role. Many studies have shown the prevalence ofH. pylori in Africa to be about 80 percent and that infection is acquired at a younger age than in Western countries (for example, Sathar et al. 1994). Chronic atrophic gastritis andintestinal metaplasia of the stomach are two key lesionsin the natural history of stomach cancer. Very few studies inSub-Saharan Africa have measured the association betweengastric mucosal pathology and H. pylori . In summary, even in a continent where the prevalence of H. pylori is high, differences exist in the prevalence of H. pylori between those with a normal mucosa (0-33 percent) and those with gastri- tis of any kind. Needless to say, the prevalence of gastritis(mild or moderate) is high, but the prevalence of severe orchronic atrophic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia is low(Parkin et al. 2003). Two case-control studies from Africashow an association between H. pylori and stomach cancer, but the relative risks are low, probably because the mucosa of patients with gastric cancer is unfavorable to the sur-vival of H. pylori (Jaskiewicz et al. 1989; Louw et al. 2001). Cancers | 295CagA positive strains, usually associated with more severe gastric pathology and outcomes, are the predominant strains in Africa (Ally et al. 1998), but their role in gastric carcinogenesis is unclear. Certain vacA genotypes appear tobe more common in patients with gastric cancer (Kidd et al.1999) and seem to be independent risk factors for the dis-ease; however, no studies have been done in Sub-Saharan Africa on the relation between stomach cancer, host suscep- tibility (in relation to inflammatory cytokines), and theother risk factors known to be associated with stomach can-cer (for example, diet, salt, smoking, and pickled foods) (see, for example, Coggon et al. 1989). There are many places in Africa where food is salted or pickled to aid preservation,but the relative importance of these risk factors in local settings is unknown. LIVER CANCER Early observations in Africa have always noted the high occurrence of liver cancer (for example, Oettl\u00e9 1964), and itis still one of the leading cancer types in men and women, although the relative frequency has been reduced in conse- quence of the large increase in the number of cases ofKaposi's sarcoma resulting from the epidemic of HIV/AIDS.Liver cancer is now the second leading cancer in men in Sub- Saharan Africa and the fourth leading cancer in women (table 20.3). There were an estimated total of 33,500 cases inmales and 15,500 cases in females in 2002. Areas of high livercancer incidence (mainly hepatocellular cancers) includecountries like The Gambia, Guinea, and Senegal in WestAfrica, where liver cancers comprise a quarter or more of allcancer cases, with incidence rates ranging from 30 to 50 per 100,000 in men and 12 to 20 per 100,000 in women. Similarly,in central Africa, liver cancer is the leading cancer in Rwandaand in the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville); the estimatedrate is 15.4 per 100,000 for men and 8.9 per 100,000 forwomen. Mozambique is reported to have high incidencerates, although the only data are old (Prates and T orres 1965). Few places in Sub-Saharan Africa have information on cancer trends over time. In Ibadan, Nigeria, between1960-69 and 1998-99, there appears to be no change in inci-dence, whereas in Kampala, Uganda, between the 1960s andthe 1990s there appears to be a decline of liver cancer in menbut not in women. However, a decline was noted in liver cancer incidence between the 1970s and the 1980s amongMozambican miners working in South Africa (Harington,Bradshaw, and McGlashan 1983).Chronic carriage of HBV or hepatitis C (HCV), causing cirrhosis, or chronic hepatitis is the leading risk factor for liver cancer. The prevalence of HCV in Sub-Saharan Africavaries between 6.9 percent in central Africa to 0.1 percent insouthern Africa (table 20.4). HCV transmission is probablyvia blood transfusion, unsterile medical and dental proce- dures, and traditional practices, such as scarification; sexualtransmission is thought to be rare (Madhava, Burgess, andDrucker 2002). Persistence of the HBV surface antigen (HbsAg) in blood is an indicator of chronic carriage of HBV infection. The risk of liver cancer in persons with chronic HBV infection,as indicated by the detection of HbsAg in serum, rangesfrom 6- to 20-fold in different studies, and it is estimatedthat about two-thirds of liver cancer in Africa is attributedto HBV (Pisani et al. 1997). Prevalence rates in Africa areover 10 percent in central, western, and eastern Africa andbetween 5 and 10 percent in southern Africa (Parkin et al.2003). There are relatively few African studies on the risk of HCV infection on the development of liver cancer. Those that have been conducted give relative risks ranging from 1.1 to 62 (Parkin et al. 2003). One study (Kirk et al. 2004)observed that, as has been found elsewhere, the risk ofchronic infection by HCV and HBV is additive, suggestingcommon mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is produced by molds of Aspergillus sp. that are common contaminants of poorly stored grains.AFB1 is a known liver carcinogen of animals and humans(IARC 1993, 2002). In Sub-Saharan Africa, high levels ofAFB1 contamination are found in groundnuts and, to alesser extent, corn. Contamination of groundnuts by AFB1is quite widespread and frequently exceeds thresholdspermitted in exports to most developed countries. Severalgeographical studies have demonstrated correlationsbetween AFB1 levels and the incidence of hepatocellularcancer (see Parkin et al. 2003). 296 | Chirenje, Lara Stein, Nokuzola Mqoqi, and Henry WabingaTable 20.4 Prevalence of Hepatitis C Virus IgG Antibodies in Sub-Saharan Africa, 2000 Region Prevalence of HCV (%) Eastern Africa 2.7 Middle Africa 6.9 Southern Africa 0.1Western Africa 2.4 All Africa 3.0 Source: Madhava, Burgess, and Drucker 2002.Iron overload, derived from food and drink preparation in iron vessels, is a common condition in rural Africa, and there have been several observations that elevated serum ferritin levels are associated with liver cancer. In one smallcase-control study in South Africa (Mandishona et al. 1998),liver cancer cases had higher iron overload levels thancontrols, corresponding to an odds ratio of 10.6 to 4.1 (depending on the control group used). Smoking, oral contraception, and alcohol consumption (IARC 2004, 1999, and 1988, respectively) were also found to be important risk factors for liver cancer. This associa- tion, however, has not been extensively examined in Africa. Early vaccine trials against HBV suggest that 70 to 75 per- cent of chronic infections could be prevented. A random- ized trial to measure the effectiveness of HBV vaccination inthe prevention of liver cancer is under way in The Gambia,but it will take many years before results are available. InTaiwan, however, children born after the introduction ofmass vaccination had a fourfold lower incidence than thoseborn before its introduction (Chang et al. 1997). Accordingto the WHO Web site, by 2002, about a dozen countriesin Sub-Saharan Africa had introduced hepatitis B vaccineinto their infant immunization system (http://www.who.int/vaccines-surveillance/graphics/htmls/HepBvaccineUseMar02.htm). Aflatoxin consumption could be reduced by improved education of individuals and farmers by, for example, agri- cultural extension officers. A trial in western Africa hasshown that improved post-harvest storage of groundnutscan significantly reduce aflatoxin exposure in rural popula-tions (Turner et al. 2005). The public could be educated toavoid contaminated peanuts sold by vendors (Wild and Hall2000). Companies manufacturing peanut butter could bebetter controlled by accepting peanuts only from certifiedfarmers and by the testing of their products by independentregulatory authorities. PROSTATE CANCER For the year 2002, a total of 26,800 cases of prostate cancer were estimated, comprising 10.6 percent of cancers of menin Sub-Saharan Africa (Ferlay et al. 2005). The relatively high incidence (and mortality) recorded in African popula- tions is reflected in populations of African descent else-where. Thus, within the United States, the black populationhas the highest incidence (and mortality) rates, some 72 per- cent higher than whites. Southern Africa appears to havethe highest rates (40.5 per 100,000). Rates of histologically diagnosed prostate cancer in South Africa are 40.1 per 100,000 in whites versus 14 per 100,000 in blacks, althoughfor blacks, access to diagnostic facilities has been limited(Parkin et al. 2003). In Zimbabwe (defined as being part ofeastern Africa), rates for whites and blacks were 70 versus 25per 100,000 (Parkin et al. 2003). Central Africa follows withrates of 24.5 per 100,000. Surprisingly, in West Africa, wherethe majority of African-American men originated, the inci-dence rate of prostate cancer was estimated as 19.3 per100,000 in 2002, compared with about 125 per 100,000 inthe United States (Ferlay et al. 2005). High rates are observedin other places with populations that are descendedfrom West Africa (for example, the Bahamas, Barbados,Trinidad). Histology of the prostate in elderly men often reveals latent malignant cells, and clearly, advances in diagnosticand screening methods can cause artificial increases inreporting. This is illustrated by a fourfold increase in theincidence of histologically verified prostate cancer amongwhites in South Africa (most whites were covered by privatehealth insurance) compared with no change in incidence inblacks between 1986 and 1995 (Sitas, Madhoo, and Wessie1998). Notably, in Cape T own in the 1950s prostate cancerappeared to be more common in blacks than in whites(Muir-Grieve 1960). Increases over time have also beennoted in Kampala and in Ibadan, but it is unclear how muchof these increases represents a greater risk and how muchcan be attributed to increased awareness or a greater readi- ness to perform prostatectomy for urinary symptoms inelderly men (Parkin et al. 2003). The consumption of fat and red meat has been implicat- ed as a risk factor for prostate cancer in studies in developedcountries, even though adjustment for total caloric intakewas not always done. Associations with vegetable consump-tion have been inconclusive. Associations with anthropo-metric measures or a link with obesity have been inconclu-sive, and so have associations with numbers of sexual partners and history of sexually transmitted diseases, orSTDs (Hayes et al. 2000; Key 1995; Kolonel 1996). In onecase-control study from South Africa, prostate cancer wasassociated with high intake of fat, meat, and eggs; eating outof the house; and a low consumption of vegetables (Walkeret al. 1992). Sex hormones, modulated by polymorphisms on the long arm of chromosome X, play an important role in the development of prostate cancer (for example, Ross et al.1998; Shibata and Whittemore 1997). Polymorphisms on Cancers | 297the androgen receptor gene may vary by ethnic group and may provide some explanation for the geographic variation observed. However, no studies have been done on intereth- nic variations in androgen receptor polymorphisms inAfrica. NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA The non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are composed of an extremely heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferativemalignancies displaying distinct behavioral, prognostic, and epidemiological characteristics. Advances in molecular biol- ogy, genetics, and immunology have resulted in extensivechanges in the classification of lymphoid tumors in the lastfew decades. The WHO classifies tumors according to cell lineage defined by immunophenotype (Jaffe et al. 2001). Three broad categories are B-cell neo-plasms, B-cell neoplasmgroup. A total of 14,500 cases in males (5.8 percent of all can- cers) and 10,600 cases in females (3.8 percent of all female cancers) were estimated for 2002 in Sub-Saharan Africa. Inmost African populations non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is rel-atively rare, but the relative frequency is above the worldaverage in North and Sub-Saharan Africa because of thehigh incidence of Burkitt's lymphoma in children in thetropical zone of Africa. As in Western countries, most non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in Africa are of B-cell type. In adults,clinical series show an excess of anda deficit nodular lymphomas. Human T-cell lymphotrophic (for example, HTLV-I) are common in tropical Africa (IARC 1996) and are a cause of T-cell lymphomas; however, the incidence of these in Africa is low. Although Epstein-Barr virus DNAmay be found in a small proportion of lymphomas, its rolein causing non-Hodgkin's lymphomas is unclear B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in some studies; the postulatedmechanism being through the stimulation of polyclonalproliferation of B cells (reviewed by Parkin et al. 2003). HIVinfection has been associated with 60-fold increased risks ofdeveloping non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in Western countries(for example, Beral et al. 1991); approximately 5 to 10 per-cent of HIV-infected persons will develop a lymphoma, andnon-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the AIDS-defining illness inabout 3 percent of HIV-infected patients (Remick 1995). InAfrica, however, the association between HIV and non- Hodgkin's lymphoma has been in the region of 2.3 to 12.3(Mbulaiteye et al., forthcoming; Newton et al. 2001; Parkinet al. 2003; Sitas et al. 1997; Sitas et al. 2000). The reason forthe discrepancy in the association between HIV and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma between developed countries andAfrica is unclear. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were increas- ing in incidence in Western populations before the advent ofHIV but have increased dramatically in high-risk groupsaffected by HIV (see, for example, Schultz, Boshoff, andWeiss 1996). In Harare, Zimbabwe (Chokunonga et al.1999), and in Kampala, Uganda, there is now evidence of anincrease in incidence between earlier cancer registration periods and periods in the 1990s (Parkin et al. 1999; Parkin et al. 2003). Burkitt's lymphoma affects mainly children between the ages of five and nine. The jaw is affected 50 to 60 percent of the time. Burkitt's lymphoma shows a peculiar geographicdistribution and has been reviewed by others (for example,Burkitt 1969; Williams et al. 1978; Wright 1973). It accountsfor about a quarter to a half of childhood cancers in the east-ern and central parts of Africa and in tropical West Africa,and less frequently in other places. Burkitt identified a strik- ing distribution 15 degrees north and south of the equator,with a southern tail into Mozambique. But even within thisarea Burkitt's lymphoma was rarer in higher altitudes. Theareas where it was most common were typified by rainfallsover 50 centimeters per year and an average of the coolestmonth of greater than 15.6\u00b0C, which seem associated withthe distribution of malaria endemicity (Burkitt 1969;O'Conor 1970). Low socioeconomic status, family cluster-ing, and proximity to the plant species Euphorbia tirucalli have been suggested as important factors in the etiology of Burkitt's lymphoma; however, the leading agent has beeninfection with Epstein-Barr virus (IARC 1997). In a follow-up study of 42,000 children, those who devel- oped Burkitt's lymphoma had higher titers of antiviralcapsid antigen than in matched controls (de Th\u00e9 et al. 1978;Geser et al. 1982). The link with malaria appears to be aresult of the loss of cytotoxic T-cell control due to dysfunc-tion of a subset of CD4 cells responsible for the induction ofsuppressor-cytotoxic CD8 cells. This may result in uncon-trolled proliferation of B cells containing the Epstein-Barrvirus and resultant malignant transformation (for example,Pagano et al. 1992; Whittle et al. 1990). In a five-year periodof malaria suppression (when chloroquine was issued tochildren under 10), Burkitt's lymphoma appeared to declinein incidence. Incidence returned to the original level after 298 | Freddy Sitas, Max Parkin, Zvavahera Chirenje, Lara Stein, completed (Geser, Brubaker, and Draper 1989). Burkitt's lymphoma is much adults, although Burkitt-like (or high-grade Burkitt-like) lym- phomas appear to be occurring with increased frequency asa result of HIV (Sitas et al. 2000). A prevention program for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas can be carried out only after the taxonomy and causes arefurther elucidated. It appears that antimalarial programsmay have a significant impact on Burkitt's lymphoma inchildren, and as in Western countries, widespread antiretro-viral therapy of HIV-positive individuals would cause adecline in the incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. CANCER OF THE ESOPHAGUS In 2002 a total of 15,150 cases of cancer of the esophagus were estimated to occur in males in Sub-Saharan Africa and7,200 cases in females. Cancer of the esophagus shows a remarkable geographic distribution, being one of the lead- ing cancers in southern and East Africa (average incidencein males about 19 per 100,000) but rare in West Africa (1 to2 cases per 100,000). Certain areas of high risk have been reported from Kenya and the former Transkei homeland in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, where incidencerates as high as 76.6 per 100,000 in males and 36.5 per100,000 in females were reported between 1991 and 1995(Somdyala et al. 2003). Several studies between the 1950sand the 1990s in South Africa, Uganda, and Zimbabwe havedemonstrated that cancer of the esophagus has increased in incidence. But the latest available data from cancer registriesin these countries show a declining trend in esophagealcancer incidence, particularly in males after 1990 (Parkinet al. 2003; Somdyala et al. 2003). T obacco and alcohol consumption, known risk factors for the development of esophageal cancer in many coun-tries, have also been documented as important in Africa instudies conducted from the 1980s onward; earlier studiesfound no such association, probably because of the lowalcohol concentration of noncommercial drinks. The neteffect of increasing commercial alcohol consumption,combined with increases in some places of tobacco con- sumption, on esophageal cancer trends is to date unclear.There is no consistent evidence of an effect of homemadebrews and esophageal cancer risk in Africa. Esophageal cancer also appears to occur in areas of extreme poverty and poor nutritional status. The high inci- dence of esophageal cancer in the Transkei region of theEastern Cape Province has been associated with the monot- onous consumption of corn, which contains low levels ofniacin, riboflavin, vitamin C, zinc, calcium, and magnesium(Van Rensburg 1981) and is sometimes contaminated withfungal toxins produced by Fusarium spp. Certain studies in this region have shown a geographical association with the presence of Fusarium moliniforme, a common fungal con- taminant of poorly stored corn. Other risk factors reported in the Transkei include infections with Candida albicans and the consumption of a green, leafy plant weed, Solanum nigrum (Sammon 1992) . and non-Hodgkin's lym- phomas, other cancers that appear to be associated with HIVimmune suppression are cancer of the conjunctiva and pos- sibly cancers of the cervix, vulva or vagina, anus, and liver (IARC 1996). However, except for conjunctival cancers, thedata, at least from Sub-Saharan Africa, are not yet conclusive(IARC 1996; Parkin et al. 2003). Conjunctival cancers are increasing in incidence in Malawi (Banda et al. 2001);Uganda (Newton et al. 2001; Parkin et al. 1999), and Zimbabwe(Chokunonga et al. 2000); these countries have some of themost prolonged and highest levels of HIV prevalence inAfrica, and it is anticipated that these cancers will increase intime in other places in Africa that are affected by HIV . TOBACCO-RELATED CANCERS T obacco smoking is by far the most important cause of lung cancer. The evidence has been reviewed many times (IARC1986, 2004). In 1985 it was estimated that about 76 percent of all lung cancer worldwide (84 percent of cases in men and 46 percent in women) could be attributed to tobacco smok-ing (Parkin et al. 1994). However, in Africa, because smok-ing is a relatively recent habit in most areas, the proportion of tobacco-attributed lung cancers is low. Only where the smoking habit has been established in a significant percentage of the population for a prolonged period of time is the proportion of tobacco-attributablecancers also significant\u201485 percent of cases in males incertain southern African populations and 68 percent innorthern Africa, for example (Parkin and Sasco 1993). Because of the lower incidence of lung cancer in Africa (and the low prevalence of tobacco consumption in most Cancers | 299places in Africa) there is a widespread misconception that the hazards of tobacco are only relevant in developed coun-tries. However, it appears that tobacco consumption, partic- ularly of manufactured cigarettes, is increasing in Africa. Figure 20.3 shows the distribution of per capita consump-tion of cigarettes in Africa in countries where data exist. It isnotable that aside from southern and northern Africa, con- sumption is low. Typical per capita consumption in the United States, for example, is 2,255 cigarettes, and in China,1,791, per year. In a WHO survey it was found that betweentwo decades, 1970-72 and 1990-92, 15 countries in Africaincreased their consumption of cigarettes, 6 decreased, and5 remained unchanged (WHO 1997). Data were unavailablefor the rest of Africa. Adult smoking rates also vary signifi- cantly; prevalence in Africa among men varies from 10 to50 percent, and among women from 1 to 10 percent (WHO1997). An exception may be the mixed-race population ofSouth Africa, where there has been a high prevalence(currently 40 to 50 percent) of smoking among women,and, indeed, lung cancer rates (and rates for other tobacco-associated cancers such as oral and esophageal cancers) arehigher in southern Africa than the rest of Africa. Evidence of the recent effect of the tobacco epidemic in Africa comes from the Northern Province (mainly rural) of South Africa (Mzileni et al. 1999) and Soweto (urban South Africa) (Pacella-Norman et al. 2002). In the Northern Province, the relative risk that males would develop lungcancer if they smoked 15 cigarettes or more per day was 13,but in Soweto the relative risk for smoking the same numberof cigarettes was 20.7. The latter relative risk is comparableto that observed in some developed countries. In a study from South Africa, which uses the death regis- tration system to ask the next of kin about the smoking status of the deceased, 61 percent of male and 48 percent offemale deaths due to lung cancer were found to be attrib- uted to smoking (compared with 80 to 90 percent in menand 30 to 70 percent in women in Western countries (Parkin and Sasco 1993). It was estimated that in all about 22,000adult deaths (8 percent of total deaths compared with 15percent of deaths in Western countries; Peto et al. 2004) were attributed to tobacco (Sitas et al. 2004). Surprisingly,more deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and tuberculosis would be expected from tobacco thandeaths from lung cancer. The reason for the lower propor-tions of lung cancers attributed to smoking is that some ofsuch cancers can be attributed to occupational exposures, environmental tobacco smoke, air pollution, and radon gasexposure (Parkin and Sasco 1993). Other tobacco-attributedcancers studied in Africa include those of the bladder,cervix, larynx, and esophagus and oral cancers (summarizedin chapters in Parkin et al. 2003). CONCLUSION Over the past century, until about the 1980s (prior to theadvent of HIV/AIDS), the average age of most populations inSub-Saharan Africa has increased because of improvementsin the rates of both infant and adult mortality (Timaeus1999). Since cancer risk is strongly related to age, the aging population has experienced an increase in the numbers ofcancers and in crude incidence. Cancer has therefore beenan emerging public health problem. The HIV epidemic hasarguably caused the biggest change in cancer patterns, withKaposi's sarcoma now being the leading cancer type in menand the third most common cancer in women. But also, cer-tain cancer types, such as cancer of the lung, breast, prostate,and esophagus, have increased significantly as a result ofchanging lifestyles and changes in exposures to common carcinogens. Although the relative importance of many important carcinogens has been described for many cancers in mostWestern countries, little is known about the distribution ofthese and the relative importance of the major causes ofcancer in Africa. Even in places with existing cancer reg-istries, or well-resourced countries like South Africa, very 300 | Freddy Sitas, Max Parkin, Zvavahera TOM\u00c9 AND PR\u00cdNCIPE GABON CONGO DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGORWANDA BURUNDI TANZANIA MOZAMBIQUEMALAWI consumed per capita (adults) international boundaries This map was produced by the Map Design Unit of The World Bank.

The relative importance of cancers andrelated exposures to them needs to be carefully assessed inorder to formulate appropriate health promotion strategies.Given the tremendous variation in the genetics, lifestyle characteristics, and cancer patterns throughout Africa, it may be misleading to extrapolate cancer patterns from onearea to the next, so better data from population-based can-cer registries and from mortality statistics are needed to provide data of local relevance. There have, however, been some positive developments. Compared with 1978-82, when no data from population- based cancer registries in Sub-Saharan Africa existed (Muiret al. 1987), the information derived from cancer registriesin Sub-Saharan Africa now covers 8 percent of the popula-tion. Despite this great achievement most of these registriesare staffed by a part-time director and one or two clerks,who do not know whether sufficient support will be forth-coming from their Departments of Health or other poten-tial stakeholders. Given the short time that these registrieshave existed in Africa the impact of these on cancer inci-dence is still difficult to quantify. Y et long-term surveillanceis necessary to quantify the impact of the epidemics oftobacco and AIDS and to evaluate the efficacy of cancercontrol measures. Still, despite the dramatic reduction in life expectancy in many populations in Sub-Saharan Africa, age-standardized cancer incidence in these registries has remained the same,and in places where HIV prevalence is high, the overall inci- dence of cancer seems to have increased by up to 15 percent. This is counterintuitive to the common belief that a reduc- tion in life expectancy due to HIV would cause a decline inchronic disease.

In 2002 it was estimated that 29 percent ofdeaths worldwide (16.7 million deaths) were due to CVD and that 43 percent of global morbidity and mortality,measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), wascaused by CVD (WHO 2002). Furthermore, 78 percent ofglobal mortality and 86 percent of mortality and morbidityfrom CVD occurs in developing countries. By 2020 it isestimated that CVD will become the leading cause of theglobal health burden, accounting for 73 percent of totalglobal mortality and 56 percent of total morbidity (Murrayand Lopez 1996; Reddy and Yusuf 1998). Africa has not been spared this global tide of CVD. In most African countries CVD is now the second most com- mon cause of death after infectious disease, accountingfor 11 percent of total deaths (WHO 1999); and CVD is amajor cause of chronic illness and disability. Projectionsfrom the Global Burden of Disease Project suggest that from1990 to 2020, the burden of CVD faced by African countrieswill double. A large proportion of the victims of CVD willbe middle-aged people. The poor will suffer dispropor- tionately as a consequence of their higher disease risk andlimited access to health care. The financial and social costs of this CVD epidemic are likely to have a negative impact on development and the alleviation of poverty (http://www.ichealth.org). African countries therefore face a double burden as they struggle to cope with the burden of communicable diseasesand diseases associated with lack of socioeconomicdevelopment\u2014the \"unfinished agenda.\" Furthermore, theirpredicament is only likely to worsen, because the majority oftheir populations are under 35 years of age, and the deter-minants and risk factors for CVD are already prevalent andincreasing within this age group. The relative cost of the epidemic of CVD is likely to be higher than in upper-income countries, where CVD prima- rily affects the elderly. In African countries more than half ofCVD deaths occur among people between 30 and 69 yearsof age, an age 10 years or more below the equivalent groupin Europe and North America (http://www.ichealth.org). InGhana, for example, where cerebral hemorrhage is a leadingcause of death, the average age at which people die from thisChapter21 Cardiovascular Disease Anthony Mbewu and Jean-Claude Mbanyaincreasing fat and calorie consumption, and decreasing exercise. Longer periods of exposure to these determi- nants because of longer life expectancy have increased the rates of chronic disease. Moreover, whereas European and North American pop- ulations experienced similar changes in demography, deter- minants, and disease rates over the course of a few centuries,African countries are passing through similar transitionsin just a few decades (http://www.ichealth.org). This forcedpace of globalization has resulted in the \"export of riskfactors\" from the West such as tobacco, refined foods, andlifestyles with high CVD risk that are portrayed on televi- sion and film (Mbewu 1998). Still, the process of epidemiological transition seems to be different in Africa than in developed and other developing countries, where it is mainly marked by the explosion of coronary heart disease (CHD). Indeed, although theepidemic of CHD was heralded in the 1980s (Ogunnowo,Odesanmi, and Andy 1986), in Africa it is still awaited,although hemorrhagic stroke is already a leading cause ofmortality and morbidity (Walker et al. 2003). Furthermore,dilated cardiomyopathy is particularly prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa, presumably owing to nutritional and viralfactors. The epidemiological transition was readily apparent in the changes in causes of mortality in the Seychelles over the past 30 years (table 21.1) (Bovet 1995). More reasons to suspect an impending epidemic of CVD in Sub-Saharan Africa include the recent finding that poorsocioeconomic conditions in childhood determine CVD inmiddle age as strongly as do CVD risk factors in middle age in the same individuals (Lawlor, Smith, and Ebrahim 2002).Furthermore, according to the Barker Hypothesis, poor fetalgrowth has been shown to be associated with hypertension, 306 | Anthony Mbewu and Jean-Claude Mbanyacause is 55 years (http://www.ichealth.org). Death and disability in middle age have major social and economic consequences, depriving families of parents, workplaces of employees, and communities of leaders. Patients deniedaccess to health care for CVD or deterred by high costs fromseeking it will cause the public health systems to incur evengreater health care costs in the long run as a result of the need to treat the same patients later at greater expense because the disease is more advanced. The potential costs of this CVD epidemic for African countries are staggering. Cardiovascular disease (direct and indirect) is estimated to cost the United States aboutUS$300 billion annually, equal to the entire gross domesticproduct of the African continent. Clearly, even a fraction of such cost has the potential to cause enormous damage to theeconomies and development trajectories of African coun-tries. In this way, the growing CVD epidemic in Africa willincrease already unacceptable levels of inequity in access tohealth care services. The overall health of African nations will not improve, nor will their level of development, unless they deal with this epidemic of CVD. Furthermore, in an increasingly integratedglobal economy the CVD epidemic in developing countrieswill divert economic goods to CVD care, resulting in areversal of developmental efforts; productivity will declinebecause of the loss of more productive citizens; and consumer markets will shrink as a result of loss of thepurchasing power of these citizens. THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL TRANSITION The process responsible for these global shifts in CVD mortality is termed the \"epidemiological transition\"(Omran 1971). Three main drivers fuel this transition: Declining infant and child mortality has led to rapiddemographic changes resulting in large increases in thenumber of individuals surviving until middle and older age, when chronic diseases become manifest\u2014the so- called demographic transition. By 2025 it is estimatedthat the number of Africans over 60 years old willincrease from 39 million to 80 million. Falling death rates from communicable diseases have accompanied socioeconomic development and improvedvaccination and other primary health care services. Changes have occurred in environmental and behavioraldeterminants of CVD, such as increasing tobacco use,Table 21.1 The Epidemiological Transition in the Seychelles, 1976 and 1994 (percent) Causes of death 1976 1994 Infectious and parasitic 9.9 5.5 Total CVD 26.3 39.5 Circulatory system 12.6 16.4 Hypertensive disease \u2014 8.4Ischemic heart disease \u2014 8.0 Cerebrovascular disease 13.7 5.2 Cancer 8.2 16.2 Source: Bovet 1995. Note: \u2014/H11005not available.and CVD, in later life. However, a study carried out in Nigeria failed to demonstrate this effect (Law et al. 2001). The current impoverishment of much of Sub-Saharan Africa may paradoxically result in an epidemic of CVD inmiddle age for those who survive the ravages of poverty-associated communicable diseases, such as AIDS, tubercu-losis, pneumonia, and malaria. Because fetal growth retar- dation is associated with chronic undernutrition among women, improvement in the nutrition and health of girlsand young women may be important in preventing CVD indeveloping countries. SOURCES OF DATA Sources of data on CVD rates in Sub-Saharan Africa are generally lacking, and when present, are often of poor quality.Much of the available data comes from individual studies, often hospital-based, with small numbers of participants. Often the different data sources are heterogenous inmethodology and cannot be compared; and systematic andregular surveillance systems are almost totally absent, making it difficult to plot changes in CVD rates over time. Nevertheless, the available data sources do give some idea ofthe nature and magnitude of CVD in Sub-Saharan Africaand of the changes in the nature and rates of CVD that havetaken place over the past 50 years. Measures of Cardiovascular Mortality Globally, cause-of-death data based on the death certificate as provided to the data bank of the World HealthOrganization (WHO) is available in only 77 countries. There is wide regional variation in coverage by national vital registration systems, ranging from 80 percent populationcoverage in the European region to less than 5 percent in theEastern Mediterranean and African regions of WHO (Sen and Bonita 2000). The most serious gap is for adult mor- tality, crucial if one is to gauge the true extent of CVD in thedeveloping world and monitor trends over time. The 10-fold variation in infant mortality between different regions of the world is largely due to communicable disease, malnutrition, and poverty, whereas the cause of death inadults age 15 to 60 is almost entirely due to noncommuni- cable diseases (NCDs) and injury (Murray and Lopez 1997).Men in Sub-Saharan Africa are three times more likely todie prematurely than men in Western industrial populationsas a result of AIDS and violence.Verbal autopsy has been shown to be an economical and useful way of improving the quality of cause-of-death infor-mation when health workers have minimal training. Forexample, in an investigation of causes of death in women ofchildbearing age in Guinea-Bissau, 70 percent of deathscould be attributed to a specific disease or condition (Senand Bonita 2000). Cardiovascular Surveillance Systems Data on the incidence and prevalence of CVD is scanty. Surveillance should become a critical component in thestrategies adopted in Sub-Saharan Africa to deal with theburgeoning epidemic of CVD. Sentinel surveillance is likelyto be the preferred methodology, whereby monitoring of disease episodes is periodically conducted at sentinel sitesthat are broadly representative of the general population.This methodology is preferred because Sub-Saharan coun-tries have limited resources, and their health systems cannotmonitor every single disease episode. The systems set inplace should include behavioral surveillance, often dubbed\"second generation surveillance.\" Demographic healthsurveys are cheaper to administer but suffer from the pitfallof their cross-sectional design. Surveillance will not only monitor the prevalence of CVD but will also help gauge theimpact of primary prevention strategies. Crude Mortality versus Age-Standardized Mortality The importance of CVD mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa countries tends to be underestimated, because crudemortality rates rather than age-standardized mortality ratesare used. Thus the appalling figures for infant mortalityfrom infectious disease and diseases of poverty tend to over- shadow all other causes of death. Y et, from the perspective ofcitizens of Sub-Saharan countries when contemplating theirown mortality, or the policy maker when considering causesof death among economically active people, age-specificmortality ratios are critical. They are also important for theplanner predicting the patterns of death in years to come.Age-standardized mortality ratios make it clear that thelong-heralded epidemic of CVD in Africa has, at least insome African countries, already arrived. Indeed, in some middle-income countries, such as South Africa, age-standardized mortality rates are higher than for Scotlandand Finland, and they are exceeded only by rates in theformer socialist economies of Europe (figure 21.1)(Bradshaw et al. 2003). Cardiovascular Disease | 307THE CHANGING PREVALENCE, INCIDENCE, AND PATTERN OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE The relative and absolute importance of CVD in countries of Sub-Saharan Africa is thought to be increasing, but infor-mation on morbidity, mortality, and prevalence of diseaseand risk factors is scanty (Muna 1993b; Razum 1996). Datafrom 20 years ago consisted largely of hospital records, which reported that 8 to 12 percent of hospital admissionswere due to heart disease in several countries in southernAfrica (Vaughan 1977); hypertensive and rheumatic heartdisease (RHD) accounted for 40 to 60 percent of theseadmissions. There were few recorded episodes of ischemiccardiac events. By 1977 such causes of death as syphiliticheart disease were rarely recorded, despite the continuinghigh frequency of acute syphilis. In the 1970s cardiac diseasewas common among young people in Kampala, Uganda, where autopsy data demonstrated cardiac disease to be acause of death in 15.3 percent of males older than 60 yearsand in 13.1 percent of males younger than 30 years (Drury1972). In 1980 the Zambian Ministry of Health report ofadmissions and causes of death in all government, mining,and mission hospitals listed 2.06 percent of deaths in thoseunder age 14 years as cardiac in origin compared with14.50 percent in those over age 14. As regards morbidity,0.62 percent of hospital admissions of children under 14in that same study were cardiac in origin compared with4.23 percent of those individuals over age 14 (Hutt 1990). By 1990, CVD had become the third most common cause of death in a prospective autopsy study in 90 of the 167 deaths in one year at Tshepong Hospital in the North WestProvince of South Africa (Steenkamp, Simson, and Theron1992). In patients over age 35, CVD was the most commoncause of death. Cerebrovascular disease accounted for 32 percent of the CVD deaths overall. Among these, intracerebral hemor-rhage was found in 50 percent and cerebral infarction in29 percent of cases. Fifty-seven percent of cardiovasculardeaths were due to cardiac conditions, the most commonbeing pulmonary hypertension (31 percent), dilated car- diomyopathy and chronic rheumatic valvular disease(17 percent each), and hypertensive heart disease (14 per-cent). Only 3 percent of the examined vessels had signs ofsevere atherosclerosis. The clinical diagnosis was the same asthe final autopsy diagnosis in only 38 percent of cases,emphasizing the importance of performing autopsies toobtain reliable mortality statistics in African countries. In a prospective study among elderly patients in Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya, in 1991 to 1992, clinical evidence of CVD was present in 40 percent of the patients evaluated; 54 percent were hypertensive, 53 percent hadarrhythmia, and 49 percent had congestive cardiac failure(Lodenyo, McLigeyo, and Ogola 1997). A prospective studyof 708 subjects with CVD was conducted between January 1992 and December 1995 in Ghana (Amoah 2000).Participants were evaluated clinically, with ancillary labora-tory tests, chest X-ray, electrocardiography, and two-dimensional echocardiography with doppler artery disease (CAD; n/H1100580) were the major causes of cardiovascular morbidity. The mean age of the subjects was 41.6; peak incidence of CVD occurred during the decile 40-49 years of age. 308 | Anthony Mbewu and Jean-Claude MbanyaFigure 21.1 Cardiovascular Disease, Age-Standardized Rates in the World, 1994-2000 (per 100,000 people) 700 0 100 200 300 400 Bradshaw (personal communication) and WHO Mortality Database, WHO Statistical Information System at http://www3.who.int/whosis/ (accessed June 2005). A retrospective study in 1995 in Cameroon of 312 adult patients with CVD, average age 44 years, revealed high blood pressure (38.5 percent), rheumatic valvular heart diseases (25.6 percent), cardiomyopathies (22.5 percent), and othercardiovascular diseases (13.5 percent) (Kotto and Bouelet2000). Rheumatic valvulopathies were predominant amongthe age group 20 to 39 years, hypertension was predominant from the age of 40 years, and cardiomyopathies were observed in the age range 20 to 60 years. A Cameroonian study between 1992 and 1997 ranked coronary artery disease eighth among the CVDs registered with a prevalence of 1.53 percent (2.42 percent in malesand 0.45 percent in females). Myocardial infarction was themost frequent clinical form of CAD observed (43 percent), followed by angina pectoris (23 percent), unstable angina(20 percent), and other forms of ischemic heart disease(13 percent). The cardiovascular risk factors were obesity(80 percent), hypertension (60 percent), dyslipidemia(43 percent), smoking (36 percent), diabetes/hyperglycemia(26 percent), and hyperuricemia (20 percent). Seventy-sixpercent of the patients had at least three cardiovascular riskfactors (Mbanya et al. 1998). In multiethnic South Africa, CHD is the major cause of death among white people and South Africans of Indian descent, with incidence rates of 165.3 and 101.2 per 100,000 people, respectively, but only 55.1 per 100,000 amongpeople of mixed descent and 5.3 per 100,000 among blackAfrican people. Cerebrovascular disease is the most com-mon cause of CVD death among those of mixed descent,followed by white people and South Africans of Indiandescent, and then black African people (73.6, 62.5, and 36.5per 100,000, respectively) (Bradshaw et al. 2003). In South Africa 90 percent of deaths are certified; of these certifications over 70 percent are by a medical doctor, and cause-specific data are available for most deaths. A graduallyshrinking proportion, currently 13 percent, are categorizedas \"ill-defined.\" It is quite possible that many deaths fromCVD could masquerade as ill-defined deaths, particularly ina country where there is still a reluctance to diagnose CVDdeath in black people. EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE VARIOUS CVDS With such inadequate data sources, it is inevitable that the epidemiology of CVD in Sub-Saharan Africa will be poorlyunderstood.Cerebrovascular Accidents The prevalence and incidence of stroke in Sub-SaharanAfrica have increased over the last half century, due princi-pally to increased life expectancy and changes in environ-mental determinants and risk factors. The majority ofcerebrovascular accidents (CV As) occur in young and middle-aged people and are related to hypertension.Hypertension is highly prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa andis often undetected or poorly controlled. This may be theexplanation for the high proportion of hemorrhagic CV As,whereas in developed countries most CV As occur in olderpeople and are thrombotic in etiology. This has beenconfirmed by clinical, radiological, and postmortem diag-nostic methods. Overall, CV As account for 7 percent ofdeaths in South Africa (Statistics South Africa 1996). Cross-sectional, hospital-based studies of the prevalence and incidence of CHD and stroke and associated risk factors have been carried out in South Africa, central Africa, WestAfrica, and North Africa (Ezenwaka et thecity of Tunis in Tunisia the crude annual incidence rate ofstroke has been estimated at 54 per 100,000 and the preva-lence rate at 600 to 1,400 per 100,000. The incidence rateadjusted to population at risk (greater than or equal to45 years old), is about 192 per 100,000. A door-to-doorsurvey conducted in the town of Kelibia in Tunisia showeda prevalence rate of 720 per 100,000 when adjusted to pop-ulation at risk. The crude incidence rate of stroke was esti-mated to be between 1 and 30 per 100,000; and the stan-dardized rate was 68 per 100,000. Fifty percent of the strokevictims were below the age of 54 years; and one-third ofthem died within one week of the stroke. Overall, the age-specific rates for both sexes rose with age, with the rates forwomen being higher at all age strata except for the group age45 to 54 years (Mirabet 1990). In a South African study ofstroke patients in 1998, only 20 percent of the total groupunderstood that hypertension had probably caused theirstroke, although 76 percent of the older group and 56 per-cent of the younger group had been told at some stage thatthey were hypertensive (Hale, Fritz, and Eales 1998). In a study of CV A in 21 centers in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, using computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or cerebral angiogra-phy, the overall odds ratio of ischemic stroke was 2.99(95 percent CI, 1.65-5.40) in Europe and 2.93 (2.15-4.00) inthe non-European (developing) countries. Table 21.2 shows data on incidence of stroke in Sub- Saharan Africa from a review of literature on hospital studies Cardiovascular Disease | 309in Africa (Rosman 1986), a population-based study in Nigeria (Osuntokun et al. 1987), and a hospital study inZimbabwe (Matenga 1997). In Mauritius between 1990 and 1994 (Sarti et al. 2000) the age-standardized stroke mortality for women and men age 35 to 74 years was 268 per 100,000 and 138 per 100,000,respectively. In Tanzania, recent verbal autopsy data demonstrated that the age-adjusted stroke mortality rates were high(Walker et al. 2000). During the three-year observationperiod 11,975 deaths were recorded in three surveillanceareas, of which 7,629 (64 percent) were of adults age 15 yearsor older; of these, 4,088 (54 percent) were of men and 3,541(46 percent) were of women. CVD accounted for 421 (5.5 per- cent) of the deaths; of these, 225 (53 percent) were of menand 196 (47 percent) were of women. The yearly age-adjust-ed rates per 100,000 in the 15-to-64-year age group for thethree project areas (urban, fairly prosperous rural, and poorrural) were 65 (95 percent CI, 39-90), 44 (31-56), and 35(22-48), respectively, for men, and 88 (48-128), 33 (22-43),and 27 (16-38) for women. In a hospital-based study of 116patients in Pretoria, one-month mortality was 33.6 percent(Rosman 1986). Coronary Heart Disease CHD, clinically manifested as ischemic heart disease (IHD), was formerly rare in Sub-Saharan Africa, again probablylargely because the majority of Africans did not live longenough to suffer the clinical manifestations of angina, acuteischemic syndromes, myocardial infarction, and heart fail- ure that usually develop in middle and old age. Still, even inthose Africans who did live long enough for the cumulativeeffects of risk factors for CHD to take effect, CHD was rareup until the mid-twentieth century as evidenced by 3,500postmortem studies in Ghana (Edington 1954) in whichonly three cases of CHD were found; of 635 cases of cardiacdeath in Uganda in 1966, 10 years later, less than 1 percentof CHD was found at autopsy (Hutt and Coles 1969). CHDhas been increasing since the 1980s (Hutt 1990), however, with reports of clinical IHD and increasing CHD prevalence(Bertrand 1992; Hutt 1990). The risk factors seem to be thesame as in Europe, but the risk index is 2.1 to 2.7 compared with 3.6 in France. Myocardial infarction at 49 percent was the most common manifestation of CHD, followed byangina pectoris at 32 percent; infarction in black Africans under age40 years shows characteristics similar to those seen inpatients under age 40 in the West, particularly regarding thefrequency of myocardial infarction as the first manifestationof the disease, low prevalence of coronary artery stenosis, and a relatively common finding of normal coronary arteri-ography (Nethononda et al. 2004). The increase in CHD in Sub-Saharan Africa since the 1980s is presumably because of the increasing prevalence among African populations of the classical risk factors forCAD: smoking, a diet high in saturated fat, hypertension,obesity, diabetes mellitus, and lack of physical exercise. Inaddition, life expectancy in Sub-Saharan Africa has risensince the 1950s, meaning that more people are exposed tothese risk factors for long enough periods to cause CAD. Astudy of black African patients admitted to a coronary careunit with acute myocardial infarction between 1995 and 1996 showed high rates of smoking and hypertensionamong the patients compared with controls matched by ageand sex (Mayosi et al. 1997). A coronary angiographic study of black African patients with acute myocardial infarction and acute ischemic syn-dromes admitted to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital inJohannesburg, South Africa, showed a clear increase inprevalence of risk factors for CHD in these patients com-pared with age- and sex-matched controls (Nethononda et al. 2004). In coronary angiographic studies of blackAfricans following myocardial infarction, mild to moderatecoronary artery disease is often found rather than the mod-erate to severe artery disease found in their white and Indiancounterparts. Indeed, CHD is the most common cause ofmorbidity and mortality in South Africans of Indian descent (Seedat 1998). The risk factor profile, then, for CHD is the same in Sub- Saharan Africa countries as in Western countries, but the hemoglobin S or C trait could be a risk factor for CHDunique to Sub-Saharan Africa. The long-term outcome ofinfarction is severe and influenced by myocardial sequelaeof imprecise origin, delayed hospitalization, absence ofthrombolysis and angioplasty, and socioeconomic andliteracy problems. 310 | Anthony Mbewu and Jean-Claude MbanyaTable 21.2 Incidence of Stroke Author and date Site Incidence Rosman 1986 Hospital based (review of literature) 101/100,000 Osuntokun et al. 1987 Population 58/100,000 Matenga 1997 Hospital based 30.7/100,000 Source: Compiled by authors.Mortality from CHD is much more difficult to estimate than that from stroke without a population-based study in Sub-Saharan Africa. Steinberg, Balfe, and Kustner (1988) reported a 25 percent decline in age-adjusted mortality fromIHD in South Africa, from 162 per 100,000 people in 1978to 121 per 100,000 in 1985. Bertrand (1992) reported an in-hospital mortality after myocardial infarction of 15 percent. A recent case-control study of 98 black South Africans with CHD over 15 years culminated in 58 deaths frommyocardial infarction with postmortem data available.Logistic regression analysis revealed that the classical risk factors in this cohort of patients operated in the same way as in Western populations (K. Steyn, unpublished observa-tions). Similar results have been found in the soon-to-be published Interheart Study of risk factors for CHD among15,152 patients around the world compared with age- andsex-matched controls. This included several hundredpatients in South Africa from all ethnic groups and demon-strated that nine easily measured risk factors are associatedwith more than 90 percent of the risk. These results areconsistent across all geographic regions and ethnic groupsof the world, men and women, and young and old (Yusufet al. 2004). Rheumatic Heart Disease Twenty years ago rheumatic heart disease (RHD) was the most common form of cardiac disease in Sub-SaharanAfrica and still remains prevalent, with many young people in their teens and early twenties presenting with severe RHD (Ekra and Bertrand 1992). In the 1980s RHD accountedfor 10 to 35 percent of hospital cardiac patients in Sub-Saharan Africa (Hutt 1990) and up to 20 percent of cardiac deaths noted at autopsy. Most of the cases occurred in young people. In Soweto, Johannesburg, South Africa, the inci-dence of RHD among primary schoolchildren was 6.9 per1,000; and in Ibadan, Nigeria, the incidence was 3 per 1,000among children (Hutt 1990). A Ghanaian study reported the rheumatic valvular lesion to be mitral regurgitation (Amoah 2000). In a survey of 1,115 children in Kenya, 3 had clinical andechocardiographic evidence of RHD, giving a prevalencerate of 2.7 per 1,000 (Anabwani and Bonhoeffer 1996),whereas 6.2 had trivial mitral per-cent, aortic regurgitation; and 0.4 percent, isolatedmild to moderate regurgitation of the pulmonary valve.Congenital heart disease was found in two children, onewith secundum atrial septal defect and the other with aventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis, giving aprevalence of 1.8 per 1,000. RHD is a disease of poverty, related to overcrowding, poor housing, and undernutrition and requires a multisec-toral response for prevention and cure. It is caused by groupA beta-hemolytic streptococci. The principal methods ofcontrol are primary and secondary prevention of strepto-coccal infection. Specifically, these preventive measuresentail prompt treatment of streptococcal throat infectionswith penicillin in primary prevention and penicillin pro-phylaxis following rheumatic fever in order to prevent rheu-matic heart disease in secondary prevention. The lack ofthese preventive measures explains the persistence of rheu-matic fever and RHD in Sub-Saharan Africa, which, com-pared with the rest of the world, has remained poor.Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa also lack adequate health systems for managing rheumatic fever and RHD. Heart Failure Systemic hypertension is the most common cause of heart failure among black Africans. In a study of 52 Gambians and55 Nigerians between ages 16 and 69 years with hypertensiveheart failure, the mean duration of diagnosis of systemichypertension among the previously known hypertensives was 4.3 years (Isezuo et al. 2000). The overall one-year sur-vival rate was 71 percent, although it was unclear whetherthis was largely systolic or diastolic heart failure and whetherthe cases were primarily essential hypertension or included large numbers with secondary hypertension. The prognosis of hypertensive heart failure among this population is poor,with the first three months from onset of heart failure beingcritical for survival. Early detection and control of systemichypertension should be more aggressively pursued. A 1993 study of patients admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital with congestive heart failure revealed that almost 32 percent had RHD, 25 percent had cardiomyopathy, 18 per-cent had hypertensive heart disease, 13 percent had pericar-dial disease, and 2 percent had ischemic heart disease (Oyooand Ogola 1999). RHD remains a major cause of heart failure in Africa, especially in the young, and hypertensive heart failure iscommon, unlike in developed countries, where improvedblood pressure control has reduced the prevalence of thiscondition (Mendez and Cowie 2001). However, as African countries go through the epidemiological transition and develop socioeconomically, the epidemiology of heart fail-ure becomes increasingly similar to that of Western Europeand North America, with CHD being the most common Cardiovascular Disease | 311cause of heart failure. Preventive and public health strate- gies need to take cognizance of the local epidemiological characteristics. Risk factors for cardiac failure in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, from 1975 to 1999 were found to be arterial hyper- tension (53 percent), hypercholesterolemia (38 percent),smoking (28 percent), obesity (24 percent), and diabetes(5 percent) (Kimbally-Kaky and Bouramoue 2000). percent),tobacco smoking (44 percent), arterial hypertension(41 percent), diabetes (40 percent), and overweight (27 per-cent) (Thiam et al. 2000). Seventy-five percent of patientspresented with coronary pain, and 50 percent had symp- toms of cardiac insufficiency. Dilated Cardiomyopathy Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) resulting in congestive cardiac failure is surprisingly common in Sub-SaharanAfrica, accounting for up to 20 percent of cardiac cases insome regions. Occasionally the disease is familial with spe-cific candidate genes recently identified (Sliwa, Damasceno, and Mayosi 2005). A similar picture can be seen in beriberiand alcoholic cardiac disease. There may be a whole spec-trum of causes of DCM, including genetic etiology, toxins,and vitamin or micronutrient deficiency, such as seleniumdeficiency. Dilated cardiomyopathy is often seen as a latecomplication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)infection (Fauci and Lane 2001). In a Ghanaian study of 708 patients in a cardiac referral center, DCM was the most common form of cardiomyopa- thy, followed by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and endomy-ocardial fibrosis (Amoah 2000). Treatment involves nonspe-cific management of the congestive cardiac failure, althoughcardioselective beta-blockade has been increasingly used.End-stage disease often necessitates cardiac transplantation,although this is rarely feasible in most African countriesbecause of resource constraints. Endomyocardial Fibrosis Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) was first described in detail by J. N. P . Davies in Uganda in 1948 (Davies 1948). Fibrosisof the inflow tracts of the right and left ventricles results in mitral or tricuspid incompetence and impaired ventricular function, as a result of the restrictive deficit in which the stifffibrotic ventricles cannot contract and relax normally.Patients usually present in their twenties or thirties. Thedisease is found in a broad swath across Africa, between the Sahara Desert in the north and the Zambezi River in thesouth. In temperate climates the disease is rare, presentingas Loeffler's endocarditis, a syndrome exhibiting markedeosinophilia. Consequently it has been suggested that EMFmay be caused by an eosinophilic response to filariasisor malaria. Another hypothesis from Uganda implicatescassava protein in the etiology of EMF, but the geographi-cal spread of the disease compared with areas where cassavais eaten does not support this as a sole etiological agent(Hutt 1990). In a Kenyan study, patients with echocardiographically proven EMF recruited between 1993 and 1996 were found to have eosinophilia of more than 500 cells per microliter,compared with non-EMF cardiac patients, and generalmedical outpatients (Mayanja-Kizza et al. 2000). Higheosinophilia of more than 1,000 cells per microliter wasfound in 38 percent of the EMF patients but only 6 percentof the non-EMF cardiac patients and in 5 percent of generalmedical patients. High levels of eosinophilia in the range ofthe hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES; over 1,500 cells permicroliter) were found in 20 percent of EMF patients but inonly 2 percent of the non-EMF cardiac patients and in 1percent of the general medical patients. The prevalence ofblood and stool parasites was identical in all groups andcould not explain eosinophilia. More often than not theeosinophilic cells in EMF patients were abnormal. HIV-Related Cardiomyopathy People with AIDS have evidence of cardiac involvement at postmortem (40 percent) and by echocardiography (25 per-cent) (Fauci and Lane 2001). However, fewer than 10 per-cent ever experience symptoms. Cardiac involvement is thecause of death in only 1 to 2 percent of patients infected with HIV (Boon 2003). These figures may be higher inAfrican populations, but good quality epidemiological dataare lacking. The possibility of higher figures rests on thepremises that nonischemic cardiomyopathy is more com-mon in African populations than in Western countries andthat the etiological factors that cause this high incidence ofcardiomyopathy, be they nutritional deficiencies, geneticpredispositions, or toxic factors, act synergistically with theeffects of HIV infection on the heart. HIV infection causes not only cardiomyopathy and heart failure but also In arecent review of 17 peer-reviewed publications covering 312 | Anthony Mbewu and Jean-Claude MbanyaJanuary 1980 to February 2003 on cardiac involvement in HIV-infected people living in Africa, Magula and Mayosi (2003) showed that cardiac abnormalities are more com- mon in HIV-infected people than in normal controls andthat about half of hospitalized patients and a significantproportion of patients followed over several years developcardiac abnormalities. The most common HIV-related car- diac abnormalities were cardiomyopathy and pericardial disease. Tuberculosis was the major cause of pericar-dial effusion in Africa. HIV-related pericardial effusions areusually exudates and tend to occur in patients with advanced disease, with an annual incidence of 10 percent among people living with HIV and AIDS. They are an inde-pendent risk factor for early death, with median survival of less than six months after occurrence of the effusion. Myocarditis was the most common pathological abnor- mality and nonviral opportunistic infections, such as toxoplasmosis andCryptococcus, may account for up to 50 percent of such cases in Africa. Although the mechanisms involved in cardiomy-opathy in people with HIV infection are poorly defined, arole for direct retroviral action or focal infiltration of acti-vated immune cells, or both, has been postulated. Recentstudies have demonstrated cardiac myocyte protein infiltra-tion in rather than focalimmune cell lesions (Magula and Mayosi 2003). In Africa,however, other factors, such as nutritional deficiencies andthe cardiotoxicity of antiretroviral medications, are asso-ciated with dilated cardiomyopathy in HIV-infected patients(Magula and Mayosi 2003). Long-term cardiac side effects ofantiretroviral therapy are likely to become increasingly com-mon in Africa as antiretroviral therapy becomes more read-ily available through national treatment programs, such asthe Plan for the Comprehensive Treatment and Care of HIVand AIDS in South Africa (http://www.doh.gov.za), theWHO \"3 by 5\" Initiative (WHO 2004), and the President'sEmergency Plan for AIDS Relief sponsored by the UnitedStates (IOM 2005). Most African programs, however, donot include protease inhibitors, responsible for much ofthe long-term cardiac toxicity, in their first regimen.Antiretroviral cardiac side effects may become apparent onlyin several years time as protease inhibitors come off patentand become affordable to national programs in Africa. Sickle-Cell Disease A study of 70 children between the ages of 3 and 16 years with homozygous sickle-cell anemia in Lom\u00e9, T ogo, fromJanuary 1996 to April 1997 found that 26 percent had a nor-mal heart, 66 percent had dilated cardiac cavities and a hypocontractile left ventricle, and cavities, and ahypocontractile left 1999). A study ofthe left ventricular systolic function of patients with sickle-cell anemia at the University College Hospital, Ibadan,Nigeria, revealed that although the left ventricular massindex was significantly larger in the patients than in the con-trols, there were no significant differences in the left ventric-ular systolic function at rest between patients with sickle-cell anemia and age- and sex-matched normal controls(Adebiyi, Falase, and Akenova 1999). The prominent car-diovascular abnormalities seen in patients with sickle-cellanemia, therefore, are most likely to have resulted fromleft ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Further studies arerequired to evaluate the left ventricular diastolic function inpatients with sickle-cell anemia as well as their cardiac func-tion during exercise and during episodes of crisis. Congenital Heart Disease Ventricular and atrial septal defect, Fallot's patent most common congenitallesions in a Ghanaian study (Amoah 2000). The majorcardiovascular children were congenital heartdisease and RHD. Idiopathic cardiomyopathy was rare. In a study of 13,322 schoolchildren from Sahafa T own,Khartoum, Sudan, from 1986 to 1990, the prevalence of con-genital heart disease was 2.0 per 1,000, with ventricular atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, making up 85 percent of the al. 1997). Patent ductus arteriosus and atrial septal defectwere twice as common in females as in males. The preva-lence rate was comparable to that of similar African coun-tries but lower than European and North American rates. Dysrhythmias Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in South Africa, often related to RHD, and is responsible forsignificant morbidity and mortality in the general popula-tion. The incidence of atrial fibrillation in South Africa isabout 8 percent of the population 70 years and older. Atrial fibrillation affects more than 5 percent of the populationover 65 and 10 percent of those over 80. The incidence ishigher in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy andheart failure. Intraventricular malconductions seem toexhibit a prevalence in African populations similar to that inother parts of the world (Omotoso and Kane 2000). Cardiovascular Disease | 313Pericarditis A study carried out from 1989 to 1996 in the Republic of Congo found that 4.9 percent of patients with cardiovascu-lar disease had nonrheumatic pericarditis with effusion(Nkoua, Tsombou, and Bouramoue 1999). Twenty-twopercent were HIV positive. The principal cause of the peri- carditis was tuberculosis, which accounted for about a quar-ter of the patients, all of whom were HIV positive; all thosewith benign acute pericarditis were HIV negative; and allthose with lymphocytic pericarditis were HIV positive. Ofthose affected by cardiac tamponade, just under a third wereHIV positive. The mortality rate was 11.0 percent\u20149.9 per-cent among those who were HIV negative and 15.0 percentamong those who were HIV positive. This study confirmsthe high rate of nonrheumatic pericardial effusion, the role of HIV infection, and the leading place of tuberculosisamong causes. These findings corroborate those suggestingthat the outcome of pericardial effusion associated withHIV cardiac tamponade (Nkoua, Tsombou,and Bouramoue 1999). DETERMINANTS, BEHAVIORS, AND RISK FACTORS In the past few decades appreciation of the importance of determinants and risk factors in the etiology of CVD hasgrown. Determinants are the ecological factors that providethe milieu in which a disease develops and need not bedirectly linked to the disease causally. Most people exposed to the determinant do not inevitably develop the disease.Genetic determinants provide the foundation on which behavioral, sociocultural, economic, and educational deter-minants build. As an example, the popular hypothesis thatAfrican people have a genetic predisposition for salt reten-tion may be compounded in urban African cultures inwhich salt intake is high, thus causing hypertension and inpart explaining the documented higher incidence of hyper-tension in urban than rural African societies (Steyn andFourie 1991). Risk factors arise from determinants and are directly linked to a disease in a causal fashion, although not every- one with the risk factor develops the disease. Risk factorsinclude smoking, high blood pressure, malnutrition, obesity, hyperlipidemia, lack of physical exercise, and beta-hemolyticstreptococcal infection. Many of the determinants of CVDare shared with cancer, diabetes, and chronic obstructivedisease. Table 21.3 illustrates the relation between CVDdeterminants, risk factors, behaviors, and disease (Reddy2004). Coronary heart disease and stroke share the same risk factors, but their relative implication in the occurrence ofthese diseases is different. Since the middle of the twentieth century the prevalence of all risks factors for CVDs, excepthyperlipidemia, has been increasing. Hyperlipidemia,although less prevalent than in developed countries, isfound in patients with metabolic disorders and families withgenetic susceptibility (Law 1998). Risk factors for CVD pres-ent in developed countries are the same in Sub-Saharan Africa, but their association and the possibly differing genetic susceptibilities may be responsible for the particular patternof CVD in Africa. 314 | Anthony Mbewu and Jean-Claude MbanyaTable 21.3 The Relation between CVD, Risk Factors, Behaviors, and Determinants Disease or disorder Risk factors Behaviors Determinants Tobacco Alcohol Food Hypertension Obesity Lack of physical activitySmoking tobacco Chewing tobacco Alcohol misuse Food consumption eating cookingpurchasing Salt use Health care-seeking behavior Medication compliance behavior Sedentary Educational EnvironmentalEconomic heart disease,peripheral vascular disease)A Tunisian population study estimated the prevalence of risk factors for CVD to be 19 percent for hypertension, 10 percent for diabetes, 28 percent for obesity, 36 percent forandroid obesity, and 21 percent for smoking (Ghanem andFredj 1999). T otal calorie intake was 2,483 kilocalories, com- prised of 67 percent carbohydrates, 18 percent protein,and 15 percent fat. Among urban dwellers in Sub-SaharanAfrica, intakes of food, especially fat, have risen, and intakesof high-fiber foods have fallen. The mean serum cholesterollevel is significantly higher than that of rural populationsliving traditionally (Steyn and Fourie 1991). Obesity infemales has risen enormously. The prevalence of hyperten-sion exceeds that in developed countries. The same appliesto the practice of smoking in males but not in females. The level of physical activity has fallen. Table 21.4 shows therelative prevalence of the most important risk factors forcoronary heart disease in hospital patients. Stroke and coronary heart disease occurs earlier in the lives of people in Africa, as in other low-income countries,than in the industrial world. Whereas CVDs are diseases ofelderly people in developed countries, where they occurafter the age of 60, they are preponderant in Africans evenbefore the age of 40. Hypertension At the beginning of the twentieth century, high blood pres- sure was virtually nonexistent among indigenous Kenyans(Lore 1993) and Ugandans (Hutt 1990), but the reason mayhave been the lack of screening programs and access to care.From about 1975, high blood pressure became established in Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo,Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda. As in developed coun-tries, consumption of salt and alcohol, psychological stress,obesity, physical inactivity, and other dietary factors arethought to have played an important etiologic role in thegenesis of primary hypertension in genetically predisposedindividuals. Nevertheless, communities still exist in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Nigeria, and theKalahari Desert in which blood pressure is low and does notseem to rise with age. Rural-to-urban migration coupledwith acculturation and modernization trends have somerelation to the development of high blood pressure asobserved in Kenyan and Ghanaian epidemiologic studies(table 21.5). The prevalence of hypertension is particularly high in urban settings in Sub-Saharan Africa; between 8 and 25 per-cent of the adult population are affected, depending on whatdefinition of hypertension is used. The two commonly usedare the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation,and Treatment of High Blood Pressure VI (JNC VI) defi- nition (JNC 1997), which is a systolic pressure above 140and diastolic pressure above 90 millimeters of mercury(mmHg), and a more conservative cutoff of 160 systolicpressure and 100 diastolic, as used in many African controlprograms. Over 80 percent of hypertensive patients in clini-cal practice have essential hypertension (that is, primaryhypertension with no known cause), with most of theremainder having a renal origin for their hypertension(Akinkugbe 1976). Before the latter half of the twentieth century most people in most Sub-Saharan Africa countries did not live beyond 40 years, the age at which hypertension becomesincreasingly more prevalent. Some earlier researcherssuggested that Africans did not show the characteristicincrease in blood pressure with age (Shaper 1974), but this observation may have been due to deficiencies in the design of cohort studies. So prevalent is hypertension today in Sub-Saharan Africa that hypertensive heart disease might in fact be the mostcommon form of CVD in Africa. Hypertension is a riskfactor for both stroke and IHD (Bradshaw et al. 2003). Leftventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, and strokeare common in Africans with hypertension.

Local, regional, andnational surveys are required to provide epidemiological data necessary for informed decision making and policy setting on when and whom to treat in Africa (Kapuku,Mensah, and Cooper 1998; van der Sande et al. 2001). There seem to be marked urban-rural differences in the prevalence of the disease (table 21.5). Prevalence levels arehigher in South Africa among urban Zulu people thanamong their rural counterparts (Mokhobo 1976; Seedat,Seedat, and Hackland 1982) and among urban Xhosa peo-ple in Cape T own than their rural relatives in the EasternCape (Sever et al. 1980; Steyn et al. 1993). In Cameroon,age-adjusted rates of blood pressure in urban areas were greater than or equal to 160 mmHg systolic or 95 mmHgdiastolic, and treatment of hypertension rose from 5 per-cent in rural areas to 17 percent in urban ones (Cruickshanket al. 2001). Few studies from Africa have reported on hypertension treatment and control. In the Black Risk Factors Study(BRISK) study in urban black townships in the Cape penin-sula of Cape T own, South Africa, 61 percent of those withhypertension (greater than or equal to 160 over 95 mmHg)were aware of their hypertension, and 48 percent were treat-ed. In an urban population in the Democratic Republic of Congo only 31 percent of those with hypertension (bloodpressure greater than or equal to 160 over 95 mmHg) wereaware of their diagnosis; 13 percent were treated and 3 per-cent of those with hypertension had their disease controlled(M'Buyamba-Kabangu et al. 1986). Nigerian studies ofhypertensive patients confirm that patients are unable to perceive changes in their blood pressure and should betaught to rely on regular blood pressure checks by their physician (Familoni and Ariba 2003). In Western societies, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, the prevalence of hypertension and stan- dardized mortality rates from stroke are higher for peopleof African origin than for whites (Cooper, Rotimi,Kaufman, et al. 1997). The same pattern is emerging inSub-Saharan Africa. Thus in South Africa, age-adjustedhypertension prevalence and age-specific rates of deathfrom stroke are higher among urban blacks than equivalentwhite populations (Opie and Steyn 1995). There is evidencethat hypertension is an important cause of mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Adult Morbidity and MortalityProject (AMMP 1997) showed that the probability of dyingfrom an NCD (which is largely made up of stroke inTanzania) between the ages of 15 and 60 years is more thansix times higher in an urban area and between two and fourtimes higher in two rural areas in Tanzania than in theUnited Kingdom (AMMP 1997). In the same study, NCDwas the most common cause of death in the urban areaand one of the rural areas for those over 60 years of age (figure 21.2). As in other parts of the world, the prevalence of hyper- tension in the Sub-Saharan Africa region has increased as amanifestation of the epidemiological transition (Omran1983). This implies that, as elsewhere in the world, environ-mental factors related to urbanization and increasingaffluence are important determinants of the disease. 316 | Anthony Mbewu and Jean-Claude MbanyaTable 21.5 Prevalence of Hypertension, by Country Prevalence (%) Country Author and date Criteria Population Male Female Cameroon Mbanya et al. 1998 (1) Urban 16.4 12.1 Cameroon Mbanya et al. 1998 (1) Rural 5.4 5.9 Mauritius Nan et al. 1991 (1) Urban and rural 11.0 2.0Nigeria Cooper, Rotimi, Ataman et al. 1997 (2) Urban and rural 15.0 14.0 Senegal Astagneau et al. 1992 (1) Urban 11.0 11.0 Senegal Astagneau et al. 1992 (2) Urban 24.0 22.0South Africa Steyn et al. 1996 (1) Urban 13.0 2.0 South Africa Metcalf et al. 1996 (1) Rural 16.0 2.0Tanzania Berrios et al. 1997 (1) Urban 9.0 12.0 Tanzania Edwards et al. 2000 (2) Urban 30.0 28.6 Tanzania Edwards et al. 2000 (2) Rural 32.2 31.5 Source: Compiled by authors.

Interregional varia-tions in the prevalence of vascular disorders have beenattributed to socioeconomic, psychosocial, and heritable physiological parameters. Among the Luo of Kenya, increasing blood pressure within months of migrating from the rural areas to the cityhas been recorded, with concomitant increases in theirdietary sodium and declines in their dietary potassium(Poulter 1988; Poulter et al. 1984). A prospective cross-sectional study in rural Nigeria showed the prevalence ofobesity to be 2 percent, with 1.2 percent in males and 3.2percent in females (Okesina et al. 1999). High blood pres- sure, observed in 15.2 percent of the subjects, occurred moreamong males (19.1 percent) than females (10.3 percent).Malignant hypertension is common. Hypertensive patients whose blood pressure fails to fall at night in the normal 24-hour rhythm (nondippers) have a higher incidence of cardiovascular complication, earlyglomerular failure, and microalbuminuria. A Nigerian studyidentified 28 percent nondippers, 57.1 percent of whom hadmicroalbuminuria (Alebiosu et al. 2004). As regards hypertension control, the guidelines of JNC VI may be more relevant to Sub-Saharan Africa than JNC VIIbecause of the difficulty of effecting even moderate control of hypertension in Sub-Saharan Africa. Hyperlipidemia Hyperlipidemia is uncommon in Africa, being present mainly in patients with metabolic disorders (hypertriglyc-eridemia) or a family history of hypercholesterolemia. It is, however, present in 10 to 70 percent of patients withantecedent CHD or stroke. A study of black African patientsadmitted to a coronary care unit in Cape T own, SouthAfrica, with acute ischemic syndromes and myocardialinfarction revealed relative hyperlipidemia among thepatients but not in the healthy controls (Mayosi et al. 1997). Diabetes Diabetes mellitus is a well-established risk factor for CVD (King, Aubert, and Herman 1998). The prevalence of type 2diabetes in Africa is about 2.5 percent, ranging from 0.8 per-cent in rural Cameroon (Mbanya et al. 1997) to 13.5 percentin Mauritius (Dowse et al. 1990). Type 2 diabetes is more frequent in South Africa and North Africa than in centraland West Africa, and it increases from rural to urban areas(Cooper, Rotimi, Kaufman, et al. 1997; King and Zimmet1988). The World Bank ranks these countries as upper-middle-income countries, and they are further along theepidemiological transition than the low-income countriesof Sub-Saharan Africa (table 21.6). Tobacco Smoking and Alcohol Consumption T obacco consumption in South Africa has declined since 1994 due to stringent antitobacco legislation and hikes inexcise duty, resulting in 25 percent reductions in boththe number of people smoking and overall tobacco con-sumption (Reddy 1997; Steyn 1998) (see table 21.7). Alcohol consumption, however, is relatively frequent in Africa. Thetypes of alcohol consumed include wine, beer, and locallymade beverages. Alcohol has been implicated in the devel-opment of hypertension, CHD, stroke, and heart failure(table 21.8). Lack of Physical Activity Physical activity is more prevalent in rural than urban regions of Africa, and that partly explains the higher preva-lence of obesity in urban areas. The prevalence of sedentarylifestyles in Cape T own, South Africa, among individuals30 years of age and above was 39 percent for men and 44 per- cent for women (Levitt et al. 1993). Twenty-two percent ofmen and 52 percent of women in urban Tanzania (Edwardset al. 2000) had low levels of physical activity. Also, 10 per-cent of men and 15 percent of women in rural areasindicated low physical activity during the same study.

Hospital-based study.Obesity Obesity is increasing in prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa; particularly among urban women (tables 21.9 and 21.10).However, the value of the waist-hip ratio has never been properly validated in large population-based studies in Sub- Saharan Africa in regard to their predictive value for cardio-vascular outcomes. The same holds true for waist cir-cumference of greater than 88 centimeters for females and 102 centimeters for males. Genetic Determinants The renin-angiotensin system and associated gene polymor- phisms may be important in predicting cardiovascularevents, but the association is likely to be weak, as shown in one study of myocardial infarction in young South AfricanIndians (Ranjith et al. 2004). PREVENTION, REHABILITATION, AND CURE OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE Traditionally, interventions have focused on altering risk factors by, for example, eradicating streptococcal infectionusing antibiotics in order to prevent rheumatic fever andsubsequent RHD. The health promotion approach, however,teaches that to be fully effective in curing, ameliorating, or preventing a disease, one must understand how the deter-minants give rise to a disease within particular settings. Onecan then develop determinant-based interventions. Thus,for example, rheumatic fever typically develops in situationsof poverty and overcrowding, where children are malnour-ished, immunocompromised, and susceptible to bacterialinfection. An intervention that focuses on providing peni-cillin for those children with streptococcal sore throat willnot be fully effective in eradicating the disease. The determi- nants of the disease must also be dealt with by educating thecaregiver to appreciate the need for prompt treatment ofsore throats, educating health professionals to take a throatswab before starting antibiotic treatment, providing child support grants to caregivers so that they can buy food for the malnourished child, alleviating overcrowding so that thesick child does not sleep six to a bed with his or her siblings,thus spreading infection, and so on. Health promotion also teaches the importance of the \"settings approach\" to disease prevention and control.

Understanding the etiology, natural history, and management paradigms of the diseasewithin these settings is therefore crucial to developingprevention, rehabilitation, and cure programs. These interventions may be tailored for the population, such as screening schoolchildren by taking throat swabs for beta-hemolytic streptococcus after an outbreak of rheu-matic fever in a school or treating an infected child withpenicillin for a streptococcal sore throat. Primary preven-tion may include the prevention and treatment of strepto-coccal infection by providing school feeding programs formalnourished children and providing penicillin to treat sore throats or training health personnel in the diagnosis ofthe condition and educating the caregiver. Secondary pre-vention is treating with penicillin for several years after anattack of rheumatic fever in order to prevent rheumaticheart disease; and tertiary prevention could involve treatingthe RHD symptomatically withdiuretics and digoxin, curatively with balloon valvuloplastyor cardiac surgery. A modern understanding of disease management empha- sizes the importance of analyses of the cost-effectiveness of disease interventions in order to build sustainable systemsfor disease control. This is important for developed coun- tries as well as for developing countries. It is particularlycritical for the prevention and control of cardiovasculardisease, for which secondary and tertiary interventions areoften extremely expensive and require high-grade technicalskills to administer. A difficult tradeoff has to be made insuch CVD control programs between the different interven-tions, and this is best done rationally rather than emotion-ally. The tradeoff may be between providing antibiotics toprevent rheumatic fever versus providing surgery to babieswith congenital heart disease, a difficult choice to make. Theformer intervention, however, may be far more cost-effectivein the long run. It is extremely difficult for policy makers and health plan- ners to articulate and make these choices, as they often come with considerable political as well as emotional cost. Oftenthe hard choice is masked under a \"waiting list\" on whichchildren may die without an overt decision having beenmade to deny them lifesaving interventions. In Sub-SaharanAfrica there often is no choice to make because the sufferingand dying patients never even reach the clinic to demandtreatment, or the facilities and surgeons to provide thesurgery are nonexistent.IMPACT ON THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN AFRICA AND STRATEGIES FOR CONTROLAND PREVENTION Options to improve monitoring of CVD morbidity and risk-factor levels include establishing community registries of stroke and repeatedly examining representative popula- tion samples. Nationwide vital registration to monitor CVDmortality would be desirable but appears not to be feasible at present, and maintaining a sample registration systemwould be prohibitively expensive. In spite of the current low prevalence of hypertension in some countries, the total number of people with hyperten-sion in the developing world is high, and a cost analysis ofpossible antihypertensive drug treatment indicates thatdeveloping countries cannot afford the same treatment asdeveloped countries (Seedat 2000). Only 20 percent of thehypertension in the United States is under control, whereas in Africa only 5 to 10 percent is controlled at a blood pres-sure of less than 140 over 90 mmHg (Pretoria Departmentof Health 2002). It is claimed that black patients respond well to thiazide diuretics, calcium channel II receptor antagonists unlessthey are combined with a diuretic. This is increasingly beingbrought into doubt, however. Comprehensive cardiovascu-lar disease research programs in Africa are needed, as social,economic, and cultural factors impair control of hyperten-sion in developing countries. Hypertension control is ideallysuited to the initial component of an integrated CVD con-trol program. Primary prevention, through a programfocused on lifestyle should be synergistically linked to cost-effective methods of detection and management. The exist-ing health care infrastructure needs to be oriented to meetthe emerging challenge of CVD while empowering the com-munity through health education. The lipid cardiovascular risk-factor profile of African populations continues to be relatively benign, with meantotal cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, andmedian triglyceride levels in the \"low risk\" ranges, evenamong cohorts with established CVD. The other major riskfactors, however, are significantly elevated in urban popula-tions, particularly prevalent hypertension, increasingobesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as growingrates of tobacco use. Furthermore, the prevalence of riskfactors has risen in both urban and rural areas. A 1998 study 320 | Anthony Mbewu and Jean-Claude Mbanyacarried out by the WHO in Tanzania found that hyper- cholesterolemia (total cholesterol greater than 5.2 millime- ters molar per liter) was present in 21.8 percent of men and 54 percent of women; that measured weight, body massindex (BMI), and prevalence of obesity (BMI greater thanor equal to 30 kilograms per square meter) had increasedsignificantly to 22.8 percent among women in urban Dar es Salaam; and that the overall prevalence of hyper- tension (blood pressure higher than 160 over 95 mmHgor antihypertensive drug use) was 41.1 percent (Njelekelaet al. 2001). These classical risk factors operate in much the same way as in northern European populations with regard tobeing predictive of CVD (Kruger, Venter, and Vorster 2001; Yusuf et al. 2004). T o date no evidence has been found thatAfricans have esoteric, genetically determined risk factorsthat differ from other populations in the world; nor do theyappear to have special genetic traits that protect them fromheart disease. It seems likely that the continuing socioeco-nomic advance in many African countries will be accompa-nied by the attendant increases in CVD that are seen inepidemiological transitions across the world. The challengeis to introduce primary and secondary prevention measuresnow, before the epidemic of CVD accelerates, particularly assuch strategies may be more cost-effective than angioplasty and cardiac surgery in the cash-strapped economies ofSub-Saharan Africa. Up to 22 percent of premature all-cause mortality and 45 percent of stroke mortality could be reduced by appro-priate detection and treatment (Yusuf et al. 2004). Cheap,effective therapy is available. With mortality risk now higher from NCDs than from communicable diseases in Sub- Saharan Africa and elsewhere, systematic measurement, detection, and genuine control of hypertension once treatedcan go hand-in-hand with other adult health programs inprimary care. In many African countries undernutritioncoexists with obesity in the same communities, demonstrat-ing a double burden of disease, such as in The Gambia,where a 1996 community-based survey demonstrated aprevalence of undernutrition (BMI less than 18 kilogramsper square meter) of 8 percent, whereas prevalence ofobesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kilograms persquare meter) was 4 percent. However, obesity was higher(32.6 percent) among urban women 35 years or older (vander Sande et al. 2001). Furthermore, CVD risk factors tendto cluster, with the potential for synergistic effects, as hasbeen described in other populations in the world (Kruger,Venter, and Vorster 2001). Differential interventions shouldfocus on high-risk groups, and prevention needs a multisec- toral, health promotion approach. A suitable strategy to adopt in the prevention and control of NCDs is the WHO Global Strategy for Noncommunicable Diseases, whose principal objectives are to do the following: Map the emerging epidemics of NCD and analyze their determinants. Reduce the levels of exposure of populations to commonrisk factors and their determinants. Develop norms and guidelines for effective interventions. NCDs, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary diseases, liver disease, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, and trauma, constitute the major cause of death in developed countries and are predictably emergingas significant threats to health in countries at intermediatestages of the epidemiological transition (Yusuf et al. 2004).Interventions could be designed based on the philosophythat diseases with common risk factors, such as smoking,increased fat and salt in the diet, alcohol abuse, and so on,require common preventive strategies. Screening programs to detect hypertension in the com- munity may be appropriate, as the disease does not become clinically manifest until it causes end organ damage, such asheart failure, heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure. Suchmeasures would be subject to the constraints of availableresources, however; and an approach that targets high-riskpatients, that is, those who present with other related condi-tions or with multiple risk factors, may be more feasiblethan populationwide screening in poorer African countries(WHO 2002). Health systems in developing countries will need to be drastically improved to deal with the burden, as they often suffer from inefficient allocation of resources and manage- ment of services. Better management must be based on both the high-risk-behaviors approach, such as detectionand management of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes atthe primary health care level, and the populationwideapproach, such as education through the mass media andschools. Integration of the package of CVD prevention andcontrol within the programs of ministries of health will beneeded. Increasing availability of drugs and diagnostics is a major issue in Africa, as it was for HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.Local manufacture of off-patent CVD drugs may improveaccess as well as stimulate the economy, as proposed inthe Initiative for Pharmaceutical T echnology Transfer of Cardiovascular Disease | 321South Africa, a program of the New Partnership for Africa's Development. Health technology for management of these CVDs will need to be appropriate, affordable, and sustainable and not simply imported from the West. The detection, prevention,and control of CVD in women is a major issue in Sub-Saharan Africa, where women may suffer inferior diagnosis of CVD and limited access to care because of adverse gender-power relations between men and women. CVD control in Africa will probably not reach a high level of adequacy for a few decades to come, given the scant human, financial, and infrastructural resources in its coun-tries. However, those countries cannot ignore the problem ifthey hold fast to the dictum of \"health as a human right.\" They will, however, have to carefully categorize and priori-tize their public health expenditure on the prevention andcontrol of CVD. The experience of developed countries,who are further on in the course of their \"epidemiologicaltransition,\" suggests that primary prevention of CVD now islikely to be more cost-effective than acute care for affectedpatients in 20 years. In the United States, for example, thedirect costs of CVD are estimated to account for 2 percent ofthe gross domestic product. In Canada, CVD accounts for21 percent of total disease-classifiable costs of illness. Thedata for other chronic diseases in developing countries sug-gest that these scales of health care costs are likely to be sim-ilar. As an example, in India, the annual cost of drugs for apatient with type 2 diabetes mellitus is US$70, considerablymore than the annual per capita expenditure on health care inthat country. In Tanzania, diabetes care swallows up 8.1 per-cent of the health care budget (http://www.ichealth.org). The costs of intersectoral, primary preventive measures to control CVD are likely to be much lower than those foracute, secondary care. As an example, the cost-effectivenessof introducing antitobacco legislation, or limiting the quan-tities of salt permitted in processed food, is likely to be sub-stantially higher than building coronary care units. The evi-dence from developed countries since 1990 suggests thatmost of the decline in CVD mortality in these countries hasresulted from better secondary care for CVD, but the relativecost per life saved is still high, too high for health systems indeveloping countries to cope with. Developed countriesfaced the peak in their incidence of CVD when they werealready wealthy and had the resources to cope. Thus, thestratagems adopted by developing countries are likely to bedifferent. In secondary care, African countries of the southwill need to develop essential vascular packages, such asaspirin and beta-blockers for patients with angina pectoris.The data are scanty and there is a dire need for more health economics research. Development of a global program to provide access to CVD drugs, similar to the \"3 by 5\" Initiative of the WHO for antiretroviral drugs, is unlikely, because cardiovascular deaths do not have the same emotive power as AIDS deaths.Y et CVD deaths are often sudden, striking down victims intheir most productive years and resulting in deep emotionaland economic shock for their families. For survivors, theyears lived with disability, such as heart failure or hemiplegia,are often traumatic and expensive because of health carecosts and lost productivity. The prognosis for living withheart failure is like that for someone living with HIV/AIDSon antiretrovirals; the annual mortality is 5 to 15 percent. Perhaps the health systems being set up in African countriesfor provision of antiretroviral drugs and comprehensiveAIDS care could have the beneficial side effect of providingsystems and personnel for CVD surveillance and care. In many African countries medicinal plants are used to treat cardiovascular complaints (Diallo et al. 1999). If theseare truly effective, it could in part explain the low prevalenceof CVD (and cancer) in rural African populations.Indigenous knowledge systems should be researched, inorder to determine whether to popularize natural medicinesfor the prevention and cure of CVD. Cardiovascular disor-ders currently receive little or no attention in most Africancountries (Muna 1993b). Projections based on recent stud-ies suggest that the management of these disorders will rep-resent a major challenge for the overextended and shrinkinghealth budgets of these poor nations in the near future.Given the prevalence of such common cardiovascularconditions as hypertension, which in some cases can be25 percent or higher, treatment is beyond the budgetarypossibilities of any of the African countries. Other condi-tions, including infections involving the heart and relatedstructures, rheumatic fever and its complications, cardiomy-opathies, and congenital heart disease, are also common.Recent trends suggest that ischemic heart disease may be lessuncommon than was previously thought. Health plannersand policy makers must be educated on the crucial role ofhealth research in general, and cardiovascular disordersresearch in particular, as a basis for formulating a rationalhealth care policy and making managerial decisions. Theneed for training and funding, and especially the leadershiprequired to develop and sustain research activity, willrequire a multidisciplinary, multidirectional, collaborativeapproach at national and international levels, as well as firmlocal commitment. As is the case for most other important 322 | Anthony Mbewu and Jean-Claude Mbanyahealth problems, cardiovascular disorders are rapidly becoming a global issue and should be recognized as such. Following the guidelines of JNC VI in the screening, detection, and treatment of all hypertensive patients is beyond the health budgets of most African countries(Gaziano and Opie 2001). Most countries, therefore, adoptan opportunistic approach to the identification of patients with hypertension and aim for significantly higher target blood pressures than those recommended. The result is thatconsiderable numbers of patients continue to suffer hyper-tension-related strokes leading to disability or death. This inadequate detection and treatment of hypertension is the most likely explanation for the high proportion of hemor-rhagic strokes in African populations. The major challenges in the management of hyperten- sion are therefore twofold. First is to develop cost-effective, population-based, health promotive strategies for primaryprevention, and secondary amelioration of hypertension.The second challenge is to lower the costs of treatmentsthrough strategies such as the local manufacture of antihy-pertensive drugs that have come off patent (IPTT 2003).These are also probably the principal challenges in the man-agement of cardiovascular disease in Africa, as hypertensivestroke is the leading cause of cardiovascular death anddisability in Africa. Research is under way to develop theseprevention and control strategies (http://www.ichealth.org). Research continues into which of the two approaches to hypertensive control is most cost-effective: treating hyper-tension according to the absolute risk for CVD or followingan arbitrary blood pressure target. The former is likely to bemore cost-effective, but more research is still needed to settlethe issue. The prevention and treatment of CVDs has become a priority for some multilateral agencies. The WHO is activein promoting prevention strategies, including tobacco con-trol and hypertension treatment. The World Bank has fundedcardiovascular control initiatives in a few countries throughits loans program. However, among other lenders anddonors of funds for health care, such as the AsianDevelopment Bank and most bilateral donor agencies, CVDremains a low priority (http://www.ichealth.org). CONCLUSION CHD and strokes share common determinants and risk factors and are more common in urban than rural areas.Any suggestion that people of black African descent are insome way immune from CVD has been dispelled by well- documented evidence from, among other countries,Cameroon, Caribbean countries, Mauritius, the Seychelles,South Africa, Tanzania, and the United States. In such coun-tries CVD already accounts for between 15 and 40 percent ofall deaths. Data on the burden of cardiovascular disease for most African countries are, however, scanty. The estimations made in the Global Burden of Disease Study for CVD in1990 in Africa relied on data from only 2 percent of the 700million inhabitants of Africa (Murray and Lopez 1996). Still,studies do suggest that the prevalence of risk factors for CVD, and the behavioral, socioeconomic, and demographic determinants that underlie these risk factors, are increasingin Africa, despite the persistence of an appalling burden ofcommunicable disease and diseases of poverty. Further-more, the prevailing pattern of past decades, when CVD inAfrica was predominantly RHD, hypertensive heart disease,stroke, and dilated cardiomyopathy, is now beginning tochange, with an increasing proportion of morbidity andmortality due to ischemic heart disease. It is probably cheaper and more effective to take popula- tion-based measures to prevent heart disease and strokethan it is to treat the people with surgery and drugs onceCVD is established. RHD and heart failure also have highlyeffective primary and secondary interventions that can bereadily applied. The time to act in prevention and control ofCVD is now. REFERENCES Adebiyi, A. A., A.

Cardiovascular Disease | 327329Mental disorders include depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and psychosocial and mental disorders as consequencesof alcohol and substance abuse, conflicts and complexemergencies, the human immunodeficiency virus/acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), and gender- based violence; in addition, there are mental disorders ofchildren. Standardized research instruments have beentested and widely used in Sub-Saharan Africa, and consid-erable attention has been paid to the transcultural per-formance of these instruments. However, challenges toepidemiological research still exist, including unreliablehealth facility records, noninclusion of mental disordersin the health management information systems (HMISs),and lack of any disease surveillance system that includes mental disorders. This chapter discusses measurement and data sources, the burden of mental disorders and alcohol abuse in Sub-Saharan Africa, current interventions, and effective treat-ment strategies relevant to the context of the region. Itconcludes with recommendations for research as well asimplications for policy formulation and development. Anappendix supplies selected data on mental health disorders.THE SCOPE OF MENTAL DISORDERS Mental disorders are increasingly prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa, the consequence of persistent poverty-driven condi-tions, such as malnutrition, malaria, and AIDS; the demo-graphic transition; and the persistent conflicts prevalentin the region. The leading mental disorders, anxiety and depression, are often grouped together and referred to ascommon mental disorders (CMD). Many of the disorders, such as depression and anxiety, are potentially preventable or treatable with currently avail-able interventions. Increasingly, epidemiological studiescarried out in Sub-Saharan Africa show that some mentaldisorders are more prevalent there than in other areas of theworld, and some, such as depression resulting from the con-sequences of conflicts and HIV/AIDS, especially among orphans and other vulnerable children, are overrepresentedin Sub-Saharan Africa. Cultural and religious issues influence the value placed by society on mental health, the presentation of symptoms,illness behavior, access to services, pathways through care,the way individuals and families manage illness, the way theChapter22 Mental Health and the Abuse of Alcohol and ControlledSubstances Florence K. Baingana, Atalay Alem, and Rachel JenkinsConsiderable attention has been given to the transcultural performance of several diagnostic tools. Goldberg and col- leagues (1997) found that the widely used screening instru- ment the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) performedjust as well in detecting cases of depression and anxiety inlow-income countries as in the Western world. Bolton(2001a), Wilk and Bolton (2002), and Bolton, Neugebauer, and Ndogoni (2002) investigated how people in an African community severely affected by HIV view the mental healtheffects of the epidemic, and they used the data to investigatethe validity of Western concepts of depression and posttrau- matic stress disorder (PTSD) in the rural Ugandan commu- nity studied. Ethnographic methods (those that take into thefield certain developed viewpoints and techniques but also acknowledge that because individual cultures are uniquethey can be evaluated only according to their own values andstandards, wary of the ethnocentric belief that one's ownculture is superior in every way to all others) were used, andthe participants were able to describe two, independent,depression-like syndromes resulting from the HIV epidemic.No syndromes similar to posttraumatic stress syndromewere found. The authors concluded that people recognizedepression syndromes and consider them consequences ofthe HIV epidemic. Bolton and colleagues (2003) evaluatedthe feasibility of conducting controlled studies in Africa and found the controlled trial to be feasible in the local setting. Kaaya and colleagues (2002) carried out a study to test the validity of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) among HIV-positive women in Tanzania. They found theinternal consistency of the HSCL-25 and the HSCL-15 to beadequate. The HSCL-25 demonstrated its usefulness as ascreening tool for depression. Epidemiological studies have been carried out in Kenya (Kiima et al. 2004) using the UK Clinical Interview Schedule(revised), and in Burundi, a survey of national welfare indi-cators was carried out (Baingana et al. 2004) that includedthe 12-item GHQ and the 5-item Alcohol Use DisordersIdentification T est (AUDIT). The Kenya mental health surveyalso used the Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ),an instrument developed by the World Bank for rapid pop-ulation-level assessments of welfare indicators (World Bank2001), and the AUDIT. In 1998, 12 psychological questionsadapted from the GHQ-12 were integrated into the BurundiHousehold and Living Standards Survey. Analysis of thedata revealed two indicators of distress, similar to thosefound by Goldberg and colleagues (1997) while using theGHQ-12. The two indicators were internally validated(Baingana et al. 2004). 330 | Florence K. Baingana, Atalay Alem, and Rachel Jenkinscommunity responds to illness, the degree of acceptance and support experienced by the person with the illness, and the degree of stigma and discrimination experienced by that person. Therefore, cultural and other contextual issues areimportant considerations in developing locally appropriatemental health policy and programs. MEASUREMENT AND DATA SOURCES Although community surveys date from nearly 100 years ago, it is only in the last four decades that they have provid-ed adequate diagnostic information based on standardized methods of assessment, allowing the comparison of research from different locations and from different levels. A useful framework, originally devised for understanding the pathway by which individuals become defined asmentally ill\u2014that is, passing through primary care andeventually reaching specialist mental health services\u2014is theorganization of epidemiological data into groupings. Thesegroupings are defined by how far along the pathway thepopulation under study has come, in order to ensure thatlike is compared with like (Goldberg and Huxley 1992). Theframework comprises five levels: (a) all individuals in the community, (b) all individuals attending at the primarycare level, (c) those in primary care who have been diag-nosed by their doctor or nurse, (d) all those referred to spe-cialist services, and (e) those who have been admitted to ahospital. The framework postulates a set of four filtersbetween the five levels; the filters are influenced by the ill-ness behavior of the patient, access to primary health careservices, the ability of the primary care team to detect disor-der, and the team's capacity to refer patients to higher orlower levels of care, and access to specialist services and in-patient care. Standardized research instruments, both questionnaires and structured or semistructured interviews, have been developed, tested, and used widely around the world over thelast few decades, allowing estimates of prevalence, incidence,outcome, and examination of associated risk factors (forexample, Thompson Psychiatric Research Methods, HopkinsSymptom Checklist, General Health Questionnaire, Beck'sDepression Inventory, Harvard Trauma Questionnaire).Whereas studies in the 1950s and 1960s showed that thereliability of psychiatric diagnoses was often low, the intro-duction of international diagnostic systems with guides,structured interviews, and operational definitions has trans-formed the situation.Strauss and colleagues (1995), in assessing the predictive value of a screening questionnaire for depression and anxi- ety, found that general practitioners could correctly diag- nose depression in 3.2 percent of patients. The screeningquestionnaire had a 42 percent chance of correctly iden-tifying depression and a 97 percent chance of correctlyidentifying patients who did not have depression. The study confirmed the low identification rate for depression among general practitioners, highlighting how unreliable patientrecords are as sources for epidemiological studies. South Africa's National Non-Natural Mortality Surveil- lance System, which began operation in 1998, is an excellentsource for suicide mortality. \"Non-natural mortality\" refersto deaths from homicide, suicide, accidents, and undeter- mined causes. An evaluation carried out in 2001 found sen-sitivity to range from 65 to 95 percent for manner of death,with a positive predictive value that ranged from 74 to80 percent for manner of death and 71 to 82 percent formechanism of death. Maintenance costs are estimated to beR 8.00 (US$1.00) per case registered. However, there still exist challenges to epidemiological research for mental disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa. Health facility records are not reliable, mental disorders are notincluded as separate items in the HMIS, and very few cross-sectional or longitudinal studies have been carried out. No disease surveillance system includes mental disorders, and no censuses, registries, or other administrative data includemental disorders. A PubMed search was carried out with the key words \"mental disorders,\" \"depression,\" \"suicide,\" and \"Sub- Saharan Africa.\" Few epidemiological studies carried out in Sub-Saharan Africa have been published in peer-reviewed journals. The best data sources are from South Africa and Nigeria and a few from Kenya and Zambia. Additional dataare potentially available in unpublished surveys, particularlyin Francophone Africa. EPIDEMIOLOGY Major challenges to epidemiological research are limited capacity in the use of international classification systems forcoding of disorders, noninclusion of mental and neurologi-cal disorders as separate categories in the HMIS, nonstan-dardized instruments for epidemiological research that have not been validated for use in all areas of the subcontinent,and limited capacity and resources to carry out comprehen-sive and scientifically sound community assessments. Alarge number of the studies use hospital-based data, yet many of the patients do not have access to or knowledge of the mental health services available in their vicinity. Although prevalence studies for mental disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa are scarce, studies from the rest of the world can be extrapolated to the Sub-Saharan region.Epidemiological studies of communities (for example,Jenkins 1998; Kessler et al. 1994; Kessler et al. 2005), of peo-ple at work (Jenkins 1985), and of people in primary healthcare (Demyttenaere et al. 2004; Ormel et al. 1994; Sartoriuset al. 1996; Ustun et al. 2004) from all regions of the worldhave shown that depression and anxiety are common every-where. They contribute to sickness absence and laborturnover (Jenkins 1985) and form a significant contributionto the overall public health burden (Murray and Lopez1996). In 1996, major unipolar depression was projected tobe number two as a leading cause of disability in 2020 (Murray and Lopez 1997a); estimates of the Global Burdenof Disease carried out in 2000 found depression to be theleading cause of disability, accounting for 12 percent of theglobal disability burden (Ustun et al. 2004). Global Burden of Disease 2000 Study The Global Burden of Disease was launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the 1990s, and the first setof data was published in 1996 (Murray and Lopez 1996). In 2000 WHO carried out the second assessment of the Global Burden of Disease, the GBD 2000 (Mathers et al. 2002). Thisis the most up-to-date GBD data available. The GBD 2000study estimated the incidence and prevalence and the mor- tality rates of major depression, bipolar disorder, schizo- phrenia, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorderin the Sub-Saharan Africa WHO subregions (table 22.1).The study also estimated years lived with disability (YLDs)and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for these disorders(table In the GBD 1996, unipolar depres- sion, which differs from bipolar depressive disorder in that it presents with recurring depressive episodes without anymanic episodes, unlike bipolar disorder, which has bothmanic and depressive episodes, was estimated to be the lead-ing cause of the nonfatal disease burden in the world in1990, accounting for 10.7 percent of total YLD. It was thefourth leading cause of total disease burden, accounting for3.7 percent of total DALYs (Murray and Lopez 1997b).

In Butajira, Ethiopia, a demographicstudy site for the University of Addis Ababa and the ministryof health of Ethiopia, it was found that, using the DALYmethod, depression contributed 7 percent to the total disease burden (Abdulahi, Mariam, and Kebede 2001). 1 Panic Disorder. In the GBD 1996, panic disorder was esti- mated to be the 27th leading cause of the nonfatal burden of disease in the world (Murray and Lopez 1996). In the GBD2000 the estimated burden of panic disorder increasedslightly, accounting for 1.2 percent of the total YLD. One of the data sources used for this estimate was a study carriedout in Lesotho, which found an estimate of a one-monthprevalence of 3.7 percent for males and 15.3 percent forfemales in a population age 19 to 93 years. This prevalencewas substantially higher than that found in other regions ofthe world (Mathers et al. 2002). Bipolar Disorder. Bipolar disorder is a chronic disease with periods of depression and elevated mood and with remissions and relapses between them. In the 1990 GBD, it was estimated to be the seventh leading cause of the nonfa-tal burden of disease, accounting for 3 percent of the totalYLD (Murray and Lopez 1996). In the GBD 2000, bipolardisorder accounts for 2.5 percent of total YLD (Mathers et al. 2002). Schizophrenia. The seventh leading cause of YLD at the global level, schizophrenia accounts for 2.8 percent of totalglobal YLD in the GBD 2000 study, up from 10th place (2.6 percent of YLD) in 1990 (Mathers et al. 2002; Murrayand Lopez 1996). In an Ethiopian Burden of Disease study, 4 percent of the total disease burden was due to schizophre- nia (Abdulahi, Mariam, and Kebede 2001). Sartorius andcolleagues (1986) estimate an incidence rate for schizophre-nia of 10 cases per 10,000 people. Mathers and colleagues (2002) estimate the incidence rate for Sub-Saharan Africa at 0.2 for males and 0.3 for females per 1,000 people, age-adjusted to between 0.4 and 0.53 percent. In a large semi-urban and rural population study in Ethiopia the prevalenceof schizophrenia was found to be 4.7 per 1,000 people(Kebede et al. 2003). Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. In the GBD 1990, PTSD was estimated to account for 0.4 percent of the total YLD,about the same percentage as schizophrenia (Murray and Lopez 1996). In the GBD 2000, PTSD has increased to0.6 percent of total YLD (Mathers et al. 2002). Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder was estimated to be the 11th cause of the nonfatal burden of disease in the world, accounting for 2.2 percent oftotal YLD in 1990 (Murray and Lopez 1996). In the GBD2000, obsessive-compulsive disorder now accounts for2.5 percent of total YLD (Mathers et al. 2002).

This is due to an increase in the number of African universities that are training psychiatrists, an increase in the number of African psychiatrists who have been trained in research methods and who are practicing inAfrica, an increase in the number of African universitiespartnering with Western and northern universities, as wellas an increasing number of African institutions participat- ing in multi-site studies led by WHO or by U.S. research institutes. There is also a wealth of information coming outof South Africa, which had a much stronger research culturebut was closed off to the rest of Africa in the apartheid years. Depression. There have been at least three geographically localized but well-conducted epidemiological surveys of depression in Sub-Saharan Africa. Hollifield and colleagues(1990) used a two-stage approach in a rural village inLesotho and found a prevalence of depression of 9 percentwhen alcohol abuse was corrected for, assuming that alcohol use preceded depressive disorder. The researchers noted that 19 percent of subjects with panic and depressive disorderhad comorbid alcohol use. Rumble and colleagues (1996)note a similar high prevalence of depression in people ina rural South African village, in a study that screened forsymptoms using an adapted version of the Self ReportQuestionnaire-25-item version (SRQ-25) and the PresentState Examination (PSE) as a second-stage instrument. The weighted prevalence for unipolar depressive disorder using the CATEGO (a computerized classification system) was 18 percent. More than half of the psychiatric morbiditydetected was attributed to depressive disorders. In a home-stead survey in two villages in Uganda, where the Lugandaversion of the PSE was used, Orley, Blitt, and Wing (1979)found that 14.3 percent of males and 22.6 percent of femalesamong adults age 18 to 65 met criteria for depressive disor-der using the CATEGO classification system. Estimatedprevalence of depression in women in Harare, Zimbabwe,was reported to be 30 percent (Abas and Broadhead 1994)and the incidence rate of depression in the same populationwas estimated at 18 percent (Broadhead and Abas 1994).The incidence rate of major depression was found to be15.6 percent in a rural general practice of South Africa(Strauss et al. 1995) and 15.5 percent in Rwanda five yearsafter the genocide of April 1994 (Bolton, Neugebauer, andNdogoni 2002). Common Mental Disorders. Common mental disorders is a term used to discuss both anxiety and depression when they occur in the primary health care setting, often presentingwith medically unexplained physical symptoms as well as the symptoms of depression, and anxiety (Patel et al. 1995).People with CMDs are frequent attenders at general primaryhealth care clinics and medical and surgical inpatient beds,because they are specifically seeking help for their disorder, because they have a coexisting physical illness, or becausethey are somatizing their mental disorder. CMDs are signif-icant contributors to the workload in general health clinics. Schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is found in all countries and cultures and has a lifetime prevalence of between 7 and 9 per 1,000 people (Jablensky et al. 1992). The point prevalencevaries between about 2 and 5 per 1,000. Collaborative stud- ies by the WHO have shown that the prevalence of schizo-phrenia, when assessed in comparable ways, is similar indifferent countries (Jablensky et al. 1992). Although muchrarer than depression and anxiety, it too forms a significantcontribution to the overall public health burden because ofthe chronicity, deterioration, and extreme social disability ina significant proportion of sufferers. The outcome of schiz-ophrenia is more favorable in developing countries than inthe West, but the reasons are not yet clear (IOM 2001;Jablensky et al. 1992; Leff et al. 1992; Sartorius et al. 1986). Jablensky recently reviewed the epidemiology of schizo- phrenia (IOM 2001) and concluded that there have been few systematic surveys of psychoses in Africa, although thereare plenty of service-based clinical studies. An exception isa recent, well-designed community survey in an area ofEthiopia with a population of 100,000 in the age range 15 to49 years. He concluded that the reported point prevalenceof schizophrenia in most areas of the developing worldwhere epidemiological surveys have been conducted iscomparable with that in the developed world. Taking intoaccount such factors as the higher mortality among peoplewith serious mental disorders and incomplete ascertain-ment of a proportion of cases, it is likely that the reportedrates are underestimates of the true prevalence of thedisorder. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Forty-one percent of all deaths in the WHO Sub-Saharan Africa region are from intentional injuries, the highest rates being for males age15 to 29 years (56 percent) and 30 to 34 years (53 percent).The Sub-Saharan Africa region has the highest rates of deathdue to war-related injuries in the world, with a rate of22 percent of all war-related injuries and 32 per 100,000people (WHO 2002b). Estimates for psychosocial andmental disorders resulting from conflicts were 15.5 percent 334 | Florence K. Baingana, Atalay Alem, and Rachel JenkinsMental Health and the Abuse of Alcohol and Controlled Substances | 335in Rwanda five years after the genocide (Bolton 2001b; Bolton, Neugebauer, and Ndogoni 2002). Studies carried out in Africa and other parts of the world indicate rates of 20 to 60 percent for depression, anxiety symptoms, andPTSD among children and women (de Jong 2002; Mollicaet al. 1998; Mollica et al. 1999). Alcohol Abuse. Adult per capita alcohol consumption is generally estimated by dividing the sum of alcohol produc- tion and imports less alcohol exports by the adult popula-tion age 15 years and older (WHO 1999b). In countrieswhere the production is mainly home brews and spirits, thusnot taxable, as in most of Sub-Saharan Africa, it becomesextremely difficult to get an accurate estimate of consump- tion. It is now widely accepted that the proportion of thepopulation drinking excessively is closely related to the aver-age consumption of that population (WHO 1999b). Theincrease in road traffic accidents, liver cirrhosis, and pancre- atic disease as alcohol consumption increases further vali- dates this premise. The WHO estimates a sharp increase in per capita con- sumption of alcohol in Sub-Saharan Africa. Five of the 13 countries with the world's highest increase in alcoholconsumption from 1970-72 to 1994-96 are in Sub-SaharanAfrica. Lesotho ranked 1st, with a 1,817 percent increase; Nigeria, 5th, with a 196 percent increase; Rwanda, 10th, witha 129 percent increase; Burkina Faso, 12th, and Sudan,13th, with 116 percent and 108 percent increases, respec-tively (WHO 1999b). Drinking is greater among males thanfemales and greater among the uneducated than theformally educated. In the Seychelles, male drinkers consumeeight times as much alcohol as females; among black SouthAfricans, more than twice the men drink more regularlythan women; and in Zambia, four times as many men aswomen drink weekly. A pattern of men drinking more fre-quently and to the point of intoxication is prevalent acrossSub-Saharan Africa (WHO 1999b). A worrying trend is that of consumption of alcohol by children (WHO 1999b). In Namibia, 20 percent of school-children and 75 percent of young people not in schoolabuse alcohol on weekends. In Zimbabwe, 31 percent ofthose age 14 years and under report using alcohol. InLesotho, 8.8 percent of children between the ages of 10 and14 years and 4 percent of those between 5 and 9 years cur-rently use alcohol. Suicide. Suicide is an important cause of mortality in Sub- Saharan Africa. Studies have mainly been carried out inNigeria, South Africa, and Zambia. In South Africa from 1984 to 1986 up to 0.37 percent of all admissions to hospi-tals (Okulate 2001) and 1.3 percent of all national mortalitywere suicide attempts (Flisher and Parry 1994). Parasuicide(attempted suicide) rates are much higher. In a study of 10,984 patients seen in a hospital in Durban, 17.7 percentwere referred to the Department of Psychiatry because ofparasuicide (Schlebusch 1985). In Nairobi, Kenya, suicidewas the fourth most common cause of death due to injuries,making up 12 percent of all injury-related deaths (Muniu et al. 1994). In a study of high school students in Addis Ababa in 1989 and 1990, Kebede and Ketsela (1993) found 14.3 percent reporting having attempted suicide. Kebede and Alem (1999) found a lifetime prevalence of 0.9 percent in AddisAbaba, and Alem et al. (1999) found a lifetime prevalence of3.2 percent in Butajira, Ethiopia. Suicides generally occurbetween the ages of 13 and 50 years and peak at 20 to29 years (WHO 1999a). Most studies reported that femalesgenerally have a higher frequency of suicide than males.Most of the suicide and parasuicide is associated withdepression or alcohol abuse, or both. Dong and Simon(2001) found an increase of 320 percent in organophos-phate poisoning in urban Zimbabwe for the period 1995 to2000. Breetzke (1988) reported that in South Africa, suicide was more frequent among the white population (14 per 100,000) than among those of mixed race (3 per 100,000)and blacks (0.7 per 100,000). A study of accidental andviolent death in Tanzania in women age 16 to 45 found thatsuicide is as common in that country as it is in the UnitedKingdom (CDC 2000; Setel et al. 2000). Table 22.3 summa-rizes some of the studies of suicide carried out in Sub-Saharan Africa. Psychiatric Disorders among Children. Not many data are available on the burden of mental disorders among children. This is mainly because of the lack of validatedtesting instruments sensitive to the context of Sub-SaharanAfrica; the lack of specialized personnel, such as child psy-chiatrists and child psychologists, able to carry out theassessments; and limited resources. Schier, Y ecunnoamlack,and T egegne (1989) found that 6.8 percent of 1,078 chil-dren treated on pediatric wards in Ethiopia had a neu-ropsychiatric disorder. A study carried out in Kenyafound that one-third of the children referred to a psycho-logical assessment center had emotional disorders as thecause for their learning difficulties (Dhadphale andIbrahim 1984).336 | Florence K.

Etiology and Determinants The major risk factors for mental disorders can be classified into genetic factors; nutritional deficiencies; infection;exposure trauma.Malnutrition. Malnutrition is prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa; from 20 to 50 percent of all children under five yearsare severely malnourished. The World Health Report 2002 estimates that 32 percent and 31 percent of children inWHO AFR D (characterized by high child and high adultmortality) and AFR E (characterized by high child and very high adult mortality), respectively, are two standard devia- tions below the weight for age.2Malnutrition is associated with mild to moderate mental retardation. Micronutrient deficiencies have also been found to be a major risk factor. These include iodine and zinc, with rates of 37 percent in AFR D and 62 percent in AFR E not consuming the recom-mended dietary intake. Iodine deficiency is the single mostprevalent cause of mental retardation and brain damage, 25 percent of the global burden of iodine-related deficiency disorders are contributed by AFR E (WHO 2002a). Irondeficiency is prevalent in the region with hemoglobinlevels of 10.6 for both AFR D and AFR E. A growing body ofevidence indicates that iron deficiency anemia in earlychildhood is associated with reduced intelligence in mid-childhood (WHO 2002a). A study carried out in South Africa found that permanent intellectual stunting resultsfrom chronic malnutrition of infants up to four years of age(Booyens, Luitingh, and van Rensburg 1977). Genetic Vulnerability. There is strong evidence that genetic vulnerability is an important part of the cause of schizophrenia; a person's risk of developing the disorderincreases steeply with the degree of genetic relatedness(IOM 2001). Few risk factors have been specifically identi-fied or validated in developing countries, although obstetric complications and early brain injury due to neuroinfection,toxic effects, other trauma, or maternal malnutrition duringgestation are likely to be involved in a greater proportion ofcases of adult schizophrenia in the developing world than inthe developed world. Incidence and prevalence studies from developing coun- tries suggest a clustering of onset of schizophrenia in early adulthood, similar to that observed in developed countries,although it tends to occur at an earlier age in developingcountries. The onset tends to be earlier in males than in females. An important difference between developing anddeveloped countries is that in the majority of developedcountries males have a higher morbidity than females,whereas in some developing countries this dominance isattenuated or inverted. Given that in many developing coun-tries, women have higher mortality than men, this findingsuggests that if adjustment for mortality could be made, the risk for schizophrenia for women in developing countrieswould be even higher. Causes of such a higher risk of schizo-phrenia among women in developing countries may involveboth biological and psychosocial factors and requires furtherresearch.Life Events. Life events that lead to the threat of loss or to actual loss, such as the death of a family member, marital separation, maternal deprivation, or loss of employment,have been shown to cluster before the onset of depressiveepisodes and to influence the course of depression in both developed and developing countries. Beck (1986) hasdescribed a cognitive triad that may contribute to the onsetor reoccurrence of depressive episodes by increasing the riskof exposure to stressful life events: negative self view, nega- tive interpretation of experience, and negative view of the future. Rates of depression increase in a variety of vulnera-ble groups, including refugees, neglected ethnic minoritygroups, and those exposed to war trauma (Baingana et al.2004; Baingana, Bannon, and Thomas 2005; Green et al. 2003; Mollica et al.1998). Depression is also postulated to be high in Sub- Saharan Africa, resulting from the prevalent violence againstwomen and HIV/AIDS (Baingana, Thomas, and Comblain,2005; Bouta, Frerks, and Bannon 2004). Poverty. A large body of evidence demonstrates the associ- ation between poverty and CMD. For example, a meta- analysis of five cross-sectional surveys carried out in Brazil,Chile, India, and Zimbabwe of people who sought treatmentin primary care and the community, examining the eco-nomic risk factors for CMD, found a consistent and signifi-cant relation between low-income countries and risk for CMD. Similarly, a population-based study from Indonesiarevealed that people with less education and fewer materialpossessions than others in their community were morelikely to suffer from depression (Friedman 2004). It appearsthat both absolute and relative poverty are important in thegenesis of depression (Friedman 2004). Voices of the Poor, a three-volume publication of the World Bank that reports the findings from global focus group dis- cussions with more than 60,000 poor people, notes feelingsof worthlessness, hopelessness, and anxiety, as well as lack ofplanning for the future, as expressions of the state of beingpoor. These are some of the core symptoms of depression. Gender. Both community and primary care-based studies indicate that women are often affected disproportionately by depression in both developing and developed countries(Abas and Broadhead 1997; Bean and al. 1999; Ustun et al.2004). The multiple roles assumed by women, includingthe bearing and rearing of children, responsibility for thehome, caring for both healthy and ill relatives, growing food, Mental Health and the Abuse of Alcohol and Controlled Substances | 337and earning income, can lead to increased exposure to life events, social adversity, and other environmental factors.Women in both developed and developing countries alsoencounter difficulties in relation to their social position,aspirations, social support networks, and domestic prob- lems, which may include physical or sexual abuse. Postpartum depression has been identified in both devel- oped and developing countries. The greatest risk for post-partum depression is within the first 30 days of childbirth,and the condition can persist for up to two years. Certainpractices in some developing countries, such as isolation ofrecent mothers from family and the new infant, are disrup-tive to the initial mother-infant relationship and eliminatethe benefits of positive social supports. These practices have been identified as possible contributing factors to theonset of postpartum depression. In a study carried out inZimbabwe, a brief screening questionnaire proved effectivein identifying women in the eighth month of pregnancywho were at higher risk of postpartum depression(Nhiwatiwa, Patel, and Acuda 1998). Such a tool may beuseful in devising preventive measures aimed at implement-ing interventions shortly after childbirth for previouslyidentified high-risk individuals. Violence against women, including sexual abuse of chil- dren, is linked to mental disorders of these women (Mulugeta, Kassaye, and Berhan 1998). A study carried outin Ethiopia found that in 5 percent of female high schoolstudents, completed rape had occurred and another 10 per-cent suffered attempted rape. Social isolation (33 percent),fear and phobia (19 percent), hopelessness (22 percent), andsuicide attempts (6 percent) were the psychological sequelae.Rates of 21.1 percent have been found for domestic violenceamong patients presenting at a general practitioner's office(Marais et al. 1999). Depression resulting from violence against women is pos- tulated to be high in Sub-Saharan Africa (Marais et al. 1999). Rates of PTSD for those with a history of domestic violencewere 35.3 percent versus 2.6 percent for those without sucha history; rates of depression were 48.2 percent versus11.4 percent; rates of suicide attempt were 19.0 percent ver-sus 5.8 percent; and rates of substance abuse were 9.4 per-cent versus 4.7 percent. Those with major depression werealso more likely to have attempted suicide and more likely tohave unexplained physical symptoms and to make morevisits to the general practitioner. Those with depression werealso more likely to have comorbid PTSD (Marais et al. 1999). In Butajira, Ethiopia, more than 3,000 women were systematically selected for a domestic violence study usinginstruments developed by the WHO (Y egomawork et al. 2003). This study showed that 59 percent of women sufferedfrom sexual violence, and 49 percent suffered physical vio-lence in their lifetime. Within the 12 months prior to thesurvey, 29 percent and 44 percent, respectively, had experi- enced physical and sexual violence. Very often, intimatepartners are responsible for the violence. Women who suf-fered domestic violence reported increased lifetime mentalhealth problems more often than those who did not sufferthese adverse life events. The etiology of suicide is linked to awoman's history of sexual abuse and domestic violence;alcohol abuse; stressful life events, such as unwanted preg-nancy or school-related pressures; as well as mental disor-ders, including depression and schizophrenia. An inverse relation has been found betw een suicide and education, older age, higher social class, and other indicators of well-being. Table 22.3 summarizes some of the studies carriedout on suicide in Sub-Saharan Africa. Weiss, Longhurst, and Mazure (1999), studying risk for depression in American women, found that child sexual abuse is associated with adult-onset depression in both menand women. A study of the patient profile of a clinic forchild abuse and neglect in South Africa found that femalesmade up 80 percent of the patients and that sexual abuse(90 percent) was the most common presenting complaint (de Villiers and Prentice 1996). The majority of the patientswere young, 55 percent being below 10 years of age and7 percent below 3 years. Behavior problems were recorded in73 percent of cases, the commonest being school problems(21 percent), masturbation (19 percent), clingy behavior(12 percent), and withdrawal or depression (11.5 percent). Similar findings were reported by Berard and Boermeester (1999). This study also found that more sexu- ally abused patients received a diagnosis of depression thanwas expected, and they also scored higher on depression-rating scales. Logistic regression showed that the presence ofsuicidal symptoms and alcohol use were independentlyassociated with sexual abuse. The authors concluded that\"the associations of sexual abuse with suicidal symptoms,alcohol use, and troubled family circumstances, in the con-text of high unemployment, poverty, and gang-related vio-lence, indicate a strong correspondence between adversesocial conditions and psychological symptoms\" (Berard andBoermeester 1999, 975). HIV/AIDS. The psychiatric sequelae of HIV/AIDS are numerous and have etiologies that involve neurobiological and psychosocial factors. These include depression, anxiety 338 | Florence K. Baingana, Atalay Alem, and Rachel Jenkinsdisorders, manic symptoms, and atypical psychosis. Neuropsychiatric abnormalities were present in 41 percent of patients who tested positive for HIV-1 in Zaire (Perriens et al. 1992), and depression was found to be higher insymptomatic seropositive individuals than in matchedseronegative individuals in the WHO NeuropsychiatricAIDS study (Maj et al. 1994). Kwalombota (2002), in a study carried out in Lusaka, Zambia, on the effect of pregnancy in HIV-infected women, found 85 percent to have majordepressive episodes with suicidal thoughts. Those who knewtheir HIV status before becoming pregnant did not show severe depressive episodes, but those who found out while pregnant were liable to develop major depressive illness. In Zaire, Boivin et al. (1995) studied the impact of a mother's HIV-positive status on the well-being of her chil- dren. The researchers found that \"maternal HIV infectioncompromises the labor-intensive provision of care in theAfrican milieu and undermines global cognitive develop-ment in even uninfected children\" (p. 13). Some research has been carried out in Sub-Saharan Africa on the links between HIV/AIDS and mental and neu-rological disorders. Although much of the research was donein the developed world, the data can provide information onthe gaps in knowledge and the possible consequences ofbeing HIV positive in Sub-Saharan Africa. Table 22.4 sum- marizes several of the studies on HIV/AIDS in Sub-SaharanAfrica. Consequences of Mental Disorders and Alcohol and Substance Abuse Mental disorders and alcohol and substance abuse are dis- abling and costly. They affect productivity, impact the familyand the community of the person with the disorder, and are associated with higher health care and other social services utilization, including the criminal justice system. The fol-lowing is a brief discussion of some of the data available onthe impact of mental disorders and alcohol and substance abuse in Sub-Saharan Africa. Poverty. Psychiatric and neurological disorders impose a significant burden in developed and developing countries. In the West, considerable evidence links poverty and mentaland neurological illness. For example, the national psychi- atric morbidity surveys of 1993-94 in Great Britain showedthat people with any form of mental disorder had an aver-age income of only 46.5 percent of the average income forthe general population. In countries where there are nosocial security payments, as is the case in many developing countries, this situation is greatly aggravated. In addition to this effect of poverty on the individual, the economy experi-ences a loss because of lost production from people withmental and neurological illnesses being unable to work,either in the short, medium, or long term, and reduced pro-ductivity from people being ill while at work. There are also socioeconomic costs to families, including the cost of supporting the dependents of people with mental and neurological illnesses. Long-term consequences include unemployment, crime, and violence in young people whosechildhood problems (for example, depression, conduct dis-order, dyslexia, and other special educational needs) werenot properly addressed in childhood. Poor Physical Health. Poor mental and neurological health is a risk factor for many physical health problems, and emo- tional distress makes people more vulnerable to physical ill-ness. Various studies carried out in the West show thatdepression increases the risk of heart disease fourfold (Lett et al. 2004; Nemeroff, Musselman, and Evans 1998; Zellwegeret al. 2004), even though it controlled for other risk factorssuch as smoking (Hippisley-Cox, Fielding, and Pringle1998). Lack of control at work is also associated withincreased risk of cardiovascular disease (Marmot et al. 1997).Sustained stress or trauma increases susceptibility to viralinfection and physical illness by damaging the immune system(Marmot et al. 1997; Stewart-Brown 1998). Poor mentalhealth in mothers is a major risk factor not only for their own physical ill health but also for impaired physical, cognitive,and emotional development of children and child mortalityfrom infectious diseases (Rutter and Quinton 1984). Comorbidity. Comorbidity (the coexistence of two or more disorders) has been found to be common among patients suffering from depression. It typically involves a combination of general physical and mental disorders orneurological and mental disorders. In one study of patientsattending primary care, of nearly 21 percent of patients withclinically significant depressive symptoms, only 1.2 percentcited depression as the reason for their visit to the physician(Broadhead and Abas 1994). Comorbidity of physical andmental illness has been found to increase with age. Substance abuse is a frequent comorbid condition with depression. Studies in both developed and developing countries point to substance abuse as both a cause and effectof depression linked to both genetic and environmentalfactors.

Identifying substance abuse in patients presenting with depressive illness is an important component of man- agement of the illness. Depression is also a common con-comitant of HIV/AIDS (Ciesla and Roberts 2001; Morrisonet al. 2002) and is associated with decreased compliancewith medications (Turner et al. 2003), increased risk-taking behavior, putting others at risk for infection, and faster pro- gression of the course of the illness evidenced by a rapid fallin the CD4 cell counts (Baingana, Thomas, and Comblain2005; Evans et al. 2002). Patients with epilepsy often present with psychological or psychotic symptoms. Sixty percent of 230 patients withepilepsy who were referred to the neurology clinic of Muhimbili Medical Center, Tanzania, had a psychologicaldisturbance warranting intervention; 81 percent had aminor neurotic disorder, but 19 percent had schizophreni-form psychosis (Matuja 1990). Other disturbances wereagoraphobia and severe depression. Over 80 percent ofpatients with a major disturbance had epilepsy and a brainlesion; 77 percent of patients with a minor disturbance hadevidence of an organic brain lesion. Organic brain lesionand psychological disturbance were overwhelmingly associ-ated with social disadvantage. In a study of 478 Zambian patients on a given day, all of whom were examined for goiter, 34.4 percent of all adult females and 23.2 percent of all adult males were found tohave goiter (Rwegellera and Mambwe 1977). Goiter wasfound in 57.6 percent of females with affective illness and77 percent of males with paranoid psychosis. Bademosi andcolleagues (1976) found that 38 percent of patients withinfective endocarditis had neuropsychiatric symptoms. For75 percent of these, the neuropsychiatric symptoms were thepresenting feature. INTERVENTIONS Possible interventions available and feasible in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa are grouped here into the traditionalthree: promotion, prevention, and treatment. Promotion The West has provided evidence about the value of inter-ventions to strengthen individuals' mental well-being andincrease emotional resilience. Such interventions aredesigned to promote self-esteem and improve life and cop-ing skills, including communicating, negotiating, relating toothers, and parenting. Early child interventions, as well as early recognition of any problems, have been found to becrucial to optimizing cognitive development and the futureperformance of children in school. Strengthening communities\u2014for example, increasing social inclusion and participation, improving neighborhood environments, and developing health and social servicesthat support mental health\u2014and reducing discriminationand inequality by promoting access to education, meaning-ful occupation, and adequate housing are all appropriatetargets for promoting mental health. Addressing stigma inrelation to mental disorders is also crucial. Primary Prevention Prevention is critical in reducing the impact of mental disorders and alcohol and substance abuse. On ethical grounds alone, prevention is always preferable to treatment or rehabilitation. In most instances prevention is also more cost-effective than treatment. Many potentially catastroph- ic disorders are now preventable. Examples include iodinesupplementation to prevent mental retardation and iodinedeficiency disorder, as well as immunization againsttetanus, tuberculosis, measles, rubella, and polio; immu-nization in the perinatal and early child period preventsthese infections, which can damage the central nervoussystem and could have epilepsy as a sequelae, and mentalretardation (Down's Syndrome) is associated with rubellain the first trimester of pregnancy. Zinc, folic acid, and iron supplementation and fortification are crucial to preventinglearning disabilities, mental retardation, and developmen-tal delays. Prevention of maternal transmission of HIVis increasingly critical, thus preventing the neurologicaland developmental consequences associated with pediatricHIV infection. Safe motherhood initiatives, such as atten-dance at an antenatal clinic, tetanus vaccination duringpregnancy, and delivery with a trained attendant, also greatlyreduce the impact of prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal riskfactors. Preventive community-wide psychosocial programs have been shown to be effective, especially for populations affected by conflict and HIV/AIDS. These include child carecenters for orphans and vulnerable children, children'sclubs, school-based mental health programs, and supportgroups in the communities. Recently, short-course antiretroviral prophylaxis regi- mens have been shown to provide a relatively low cost andeffective strategy for preventing mother-to-child transmis-sion of HIV in low-income populations by up to 30 percent Mental Health and the Abuse of Alcohol and Controlled Substances | 341(Connor et al. 1994; Mofenson 1999). Supplemental feeding reduces the transmission through breastfeeding by a further 30 percent, thus preventing the neurological and develop- mental disabilities associated with HIV infection in children. Treatment A brief description is provided here for the treatments avail- able for the mental disorders discussed. A concerted effortwas made to provide treatment alternatives where the costs and effectiveness are known, but this is not always possible for Sub-Saharan Africa, since these studies are just beingcarried out. The next best alternative is to provide a discus-sion of what is presently being provided as treatment, even when evidence for cost-effectiveness may not be available. Depression. Effective treatment strategies exist for depres- sion in the form of pharmacological agents, cognitive behavioral therapy, and psychosocial treatments. Althoughtreatment interventions may not cure all forms of depres- sion, a large number of efficacious and low-cost treatmentsare available. Despite the availability of these interventions,many people in Africa remain undiagnosed and untreated.It is difficult to estimate the actual treatment gap (all thosewith a clinically diagnosed mental disorder who are not ontreatment) because epidemiological data of diagnosed men-tal disorders in the community or of those who are ontreatment are limited. The scant data available are oftenunreliable. Andrews, Henderson, and Wayne-Hall (2001),studying utilization of the Australian mental health services,found that only about 30 percent of those with a diagnosedmental disorder used the services. Because of their efficacy and cost-effectiveness, antide- pressant medications represent the mainstay of treatmentfor depression in developed countries. Seventy percent ofpatients prescribed antidepressants show significant clinicalimprovement. Antidepressants are also effective as prophy-laxes: treatment has been shown to reduce the relapse ratefor recurrent depression from 80 percent over three years to22 percent. There has been far less research in developingcountries, but the limited available evidence shows similarrates of efficacy. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and thenewer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)have similar efficacy for moderate depression. The reducedside effects of SSRIs enhance patient compliance. However,the high cost of SSRIs means that they remain out of reachas a first-line treatment in Africa for all but the wealthy.Indeed, simply ensuring an adequate supply of TCAs to theprimary care level across Sub-Saharan Africa still represents a major financial challenge for these countries, even thoughTCAs are relatively cheaper than the SSRIs, even if the latterare now getting off patent protection. The median yearly costfor treating depression in an individual with amitriptyline in Sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at US$30.66 in 2001 andis now estimated to be US$34.38 (WHO 2001, 2005). Bolton and colleagues (2003) tested the efficacy of group interpersonal psychotherapy in alleviating depression and dysfunction in rural Uganda and found it to be highly efficacious. Mean reduction of depression severity was17.47 points for intervention groups and 3.55 points for con-trols. After the intervention, 6.5 percent of the interventiongroup and 54.7 percent of the control group met the criteriafor major depression compared with 86 percent and 94 per-cent, respectively, before treatment was initiated. Cognitive behavior therapy, problem-solving therapy, and family-focused therapy have met with success in thetreatment of depression. A small number of publishedreports address the use of psychosocial interventions to treat depression in developing countries. Problem-solving therapyhas been suggested as an effective psychosocial treatment,particularly because it seeks to provide the patient with atechnique for coping with future problems, thereby poten-tially preventing a recurrence of depressive symptoms orenabling the patient to deal with them more effectively whenthey recur. Problem-solving therapy has been conductedeffectively by trained community nurses in primary caresettings, making the approach particularly attractive forresource-poor settings, where psychiatrists and speciallytrained general physicians are not available. Schizophrenia. Evidence suggests that correct early diag- nosis and initiation of treatment can have a positive impact on the subsequent course of schizophrenia. Antipsychoticmedication is the mainstay of treatment and is indicated forthe majority of patients over prolonged periods with nofixed limit to duration. Two classes of pharmacologicalagents are available. The two offer approximately equal effi-cacy in controlling the positive symptoms of the disorderbut differ considerably in their side effects and tolerabilityas well as cost. The median yearly cost per person for chlor-promazine for Sub-Saharan Africa was estimated atUS$40.88 in 2001 and is now estimated to be US$49.06(WHO 2001, 2005). Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. A combination of psy- chosocial and mental health interventions is recommended 342 | Florence K. Baingana, Atalay Alem, and Rachel Jenkinsfor PTSD. Psychosocial interventions include counseling, group support meetings, play activities, art, music, and other expressive art therapies. Mental health interventions include a short course of anxiolytics for acute distress, not tobe taken for longer than two weeks. Symptoms that persistbeyond the acute phase respond to smaller doses of antide-pressants and antipsychotics. Drug treatment for PTSD is best combined with a psychotherapeutic intervention, such as group therapy, individual therapy, or counseling. Mental Disorders among Children. The first step in the management of mental disorders among children is making the correct diagnosis. Management is also dependent on a collaboration between the parents or caretaker, the teachers,and the health care provider. Treatment depends on thediagnosis and the underlying causative factors. Antidepres-sants are effective in the management of emotional disor-ders of children. However, the teacher must be aware of thediagnosis and provide support within the school system. Forchildren with learning difficulties, special needs educationteachers play a crucial role in providing education tailoredto the needs of the child. For children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disor- der, Ritalin and other stimulants are not widely used in Sub-Saharan Africa, mainly because of the lack of child psychia- trists and psychologists, necessary for the close supervision required. High activity levels can be managed with behav-ioral methods, and a special needs education teacher candesign a learning program tailored to the attention deficit. A few countries, such as Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda, have developed comprehensive special education teacher-training programs. A FRAMEWORK FOR RESEARCH In developing short-term, medium-term, and long-term strategies, it is clear that further research will have to becarried out in order to provide the evidence necessary tostrengthen the mental health care systems of Sub-SaharanAfrica. Following are some of the recommended research areas that could be pursued. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of mental disor- ders in Sub-Saharan Africa, including validation of thestandardized testing instruments for the different popula-tions of Africa, would establish the epidemiology andcausative and risk factors, as well as links to sexual abuse, violence against women, HIV/AIDS, and conflicts. TheButajira community laboratory (Alem et al. 1999; Kebede et al. 2003; Kebede et al. 2006), where a group of Ethiopianresearchers is conducting cross-sectional and longitudinalmental health studies could be cited as a good example forsuch undertakings in Sub-Saharan Africa. Multisite studies on the mental well-being of children would establish the incidence and prevalence of mentaldisorders of children, links to abuse of all forms, malnutrition, conflicts, poverty and vulnerability, what interventions are available, what the burden is within theschool system, and how it affects educational outcomes. Stigmatization confounds epidemiological studies, pre- vents treatment, and leads to personal and economic dis-aster for many affected individuals and their families. Because stigma and other cultural beliefs are locally grounded, they require local study in order to develop ways in which to deal with them constructively. Cost-of-illness, cost-effectiveness, cost-minimization, and cost-benefit analyses should be undertaken to pro-vide government officials and funding agencies the necessary economic perspective in relation to mental dis- orders and alcohol abuse. Socioeconomic determinantsof the outcome measures that could best reflect optimalcare for people with mental disorders and those abusing alcohol should be identified. Family, twin, and adoption studies in Western countries have provided evidence of the genetic contribution to theetiology of depressive disorders. Twin studies have also demonstrated the strong role of the nonshared environ- ment in the causation of depression. Thus, examinationof gene-environment interactions is essential to futureresearch and would benefit from a wide range of varia- tion in the psychosocial environments, making it possible to delineate better the etiological contributions of suchenvironmental factors as socioeconomic adversity, lifeevents, and the breakdown of social support networks.There is a need for such studies to be carried out in Sub-Saharan Africa. Defective neurotransmission and neuroendocrine recep- tor responses are associated with depression. Three mo-noamines have been implicated: 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), noradrenaline, and dopamine. Conclusive evidence on the impact of these defects on the course ofdepressive disorders remains to be found. It is stillunclear whether associations with neurological function represent cause or effect in the pathogenesis of depres- sion and whether neurological function is the major riskfactor for depression in Sub-Saharan Africa. Mental Health and the Abuse of Alcohol and Controlled Substances | 343Additional research should be conducted in developing countries to determine the cost-effectiveness of cognitivebehavioral therapy in primary health care settings. Requisite long-term follow-up studies have not been conducted in low-income countries. They would need toinclude attention to recovery from symptoms, dysfunc-tion and reversal of the dysfunction following treatment, disability, the family's support of the patient, and the cost of this support to the family, as well as the social andeconomic burden on the family and the community.Measurements would have to be made over at least fiveyears. Not enough evaluations of mental health services have been carried out in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the few thathave been done are neither comprehensive nor country- wide. The process for integrating mental health into pri- mary health care and the effectiveness of this approachneeds to be documented. POLICY ISSUES The policy implications resulting from the epidemiology of mental health and substance abuse disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa discussed here are provided only as a menu of possible policy interventions, to be selected from, depending on the context and the needs of each country. As societies and economies become increasingly infor- mation oriented and dependent on highly skilled andliterate workers, it is critical that children everywhere have an opportunity to reach their optimal levels of cog- nitive and neurological development. The persistence ofexcess prevalence rates of preventable mental disorders\u2014 such as depression, PTSD, and mental disorders resultingfrom sexual abuse of children\u2014observed in Sub-SaharanAfrica countries today is a consequence of both povertyand poor resource allocation, and it is an impediment tofuture social and economic development. T o implement effective programs for community-level detection and treatment of patients with mental disor-ders, governments and health authorities of Sub-Saharan Africa countries must first issue clear policies articulat- ing measures for the identification and treatment ofpatients with mental disorders, including children.Essential components of any strategy include the assur- ance of a continuous drug supply and means of distribu- tion, prevention programs, social programs, and stigma mitigation strategies to increase employment and improve general welfare among individuals sufferingfrom the disease. Also essential are training of health carepersonnel and methods for surveillance and routine datacollection. Reforms in the health, social, and economic sectors need to address mental health and substanceabuse clearly and in an integrated way, and programsneed to be set up targeting other priority areas, such asHIV , malaria and other infectious diseases, and repro-ductive and child health.

Baingana, Atalay Alem, and Rachel Jenkins351Neurological disorders are increasingly prevalent in Sub- Saharan Africa. The factors that are producing this increasedburden include malnutrition, adverse perinatal conditions,malaria, the human immunodeficiency virus and theacquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and other causes of encephalitis and meningitis, demographictransitions, increased vehicular traffic, and persistentregional conflicts. Leading neurological disorders includecerebral palsy, mental retardation and other developmentaldisorders, epilepsy, peripheral neuropathy, stroke, and,increasingly, the nervous system complications of HIV/AIDS, trauma, and alcohol abuse. The disabling rather thanfatal nature of many neurological disorders, the stigma asso-ciated with brain disorders, and the enormous difficulty in gathering epidemiologic data have resulted in their beingunderreported and neglected in Sub-Saharan Africa. Thisneglect represents an unfortunate paradox, since neurological(and psychiatric) disorders make up at least 25 percent ofthe global burden of disease and are responsible for an evengreater proportion of persons living with disability. Among the hundreds of specific disorders, some common and some uncommon, many are potentially preventable ortreatable. For example, most developmental disorders and many strokes are preventable. Epilepsy, a common problem,is potentially treatable with currently available low-cost medications. Disorders such as HIV/AIDS and the dementia that often accompanies HIV infection are currently untreat-able, but their prevalence can be drastically reduced withantiretroviral therapy intervention (Sacktor 2002). Although few epidemiological studies have been carried out in Sub- Saharan Africa, it is clear that some disorders of the nervoussystem are more prevalent in this World Bank region thanelsewhere in the world. Examples of such overrepresentationinclude epilepsy, stroke in younger individuals, and neuro-logical complications related to HIV infection. Cultural and religious issues and beliefs are important in Sub-Saharan Africa. They influence the value placed by soci- ety on neurological health, the presentation of symptoms,illness behavior, access to services, pathways through care,the way individuals and families manage illness, the way thecommunity responds to illness, the degree of acceptance andsupport\u2014and stigma and discrimination\u2014experienced bythe person with neurological illness. Because of this, culturaland other contextual factors are important considerations inChapter23 Neurological Disorders Donald Silberberg and Elly Katabira74 to 80 percent for manner of death, and 71 to 82 percent for mechanism of death. The maintenance cost of this sys- tem is estimated to be R 8.00 (US$1.00) per case registered (Gill et al. 2001). Another useful tool for accumulating data is period prevalence studies, such as those that can be registered at a single health facility. These are relatively inexpensive stud-ies to conduct, and they are informative regarding outpa-tient or hospital use at a particular point of service(Birbeck 2001). Newer epidemiological methods, such as capture-recapture methodology and log linear modeling, do not seem to have been introduced into investigations of neurologic disease inSub-Saharan Africa at this time. The basic problems of data acquisition must first be solved, including designing validscreening instruments that will allow population-basedscreening. However, the International Clinical EpidemiologyNetwork has fostered the development of clinical epidemio-logy research units in Cameroon, Ethiopia, and Uganda, eachof which seeks to apply appropriate methods to their country'schallenges. A PubMed search carried out with the key words \"neuro- logical disorders,\" and \"Sub-Saharan Africa\" also confirmed that few epidemiological studies have been carried out andpublished in peer-reviewed journals. The best data sources are from South Africa and Nigeria and a few from Kenya and Zambia, whereas others, such as those from Uganda, are veryold. Additional data are potentially available in unpublishedsurveys, particularly in Francophone Africa. EPIDEMIOLOGY In a unique study, Jelsma and colleagues (2002) conducted house-to-house screening visits of 10,839 residents in a\"high density suburb\" of Harare, Zimbabwe. Visits werefollowed up by medical examination and interview of thoseidentified as having a functional limitation. The rate of disability and morbidity was 5.6 percent for the whole sam-ple. Headaches, including migraine, were the most commonproblem. These were followed by back pain, hypertension,and osteoarthritis. HIV/AIDS was the fifth most commoncondition. Depression, based on responses to a screeningtool, was evident in one-third of the subjects. Commonactivity limitations included difficulty with the performanceof housework and with walking. HIV/AIDS resulted in themost severe activity limitation, in that cognitive functions were also affected. 352 | Donald Silberberg and Elly Katabiradeveloping locally appropriate health care policies, pro- grams, and services. MEASUREMENT AND DATA SOURCES One of the most challenging public health problems in Africais data collection. Although community surveys date fromnearly 100 years ago, it is only in the last four decades that these and other epidemiological methods have provided adequate diagnostic information based on standardizedmethods of assessment that permit the comparison ofresearch from different locations and from different levels. Major challenges to epidemiological research are the limited capacity of international classification systems forcoding disorders and the noninclusion of neurological disorders as separate categories in health managementinformation systems. Additionally, systems and instrumentsfor epidemiological research of neurological disorders havenot been standardized and validated for use in all areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. The existing capacity and resources tocarry out comprehensive and scientifically sound communi-ty assessments are limited. Many studies have used hospital-based data, even though many of the patients do not haveaccess to or knowledge of the availability of these services. Further challenges to epidemiological research of neuro- logical disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa are the often unreli-able health facility records, the noninclusion of neurolog-ical disorders as separate items in the health managementinformation system, and the paucity of cross-sectionalstudies. No disease surveillance system and no censuses, reg- istries, or other administrative data include neurological disorders. Few of the epidemiological studies of developmental dis- orders, Parkinson's disease, stroke, peripheral neuropathies,dementia, or other disorders carried out in Sub-SaharanAfrica have been published in peer-reviewed journals.Similarly, few studies have been carried out that specificallyquantify the neurological complications of HIV/AIDS inSub-Saharan Africa in spite of the overwhelming burden ofthe disease in the region. In 1998 South Africa began pilot operation of its National Non-Natural Mortality Surveillance System, a use-ful method of accumulating data. \"Nonnatural mortality\"refers to deaths from homicide, suicide, accidents, andundetermined causes. Evaluation carried out in 2001 foundsensitivity to range from 65 to 95 percent for manner ofdeath, with a positive predictive value that ranged fromDevelopmental Disorders Few data exist on developmental disorders, other than such reports as that on the pediatric neurology clinic in TheGambia, which indicated that developmental delay, speechdisorders, and learning difficulties were present among128 children during a six-month period (Burton and Allen 2003). A three-year study of a child neurology clinic inIbadan, Nigeria, found that cerebral palsy accounted for16.2 percent of new referrals. Sixty-three percent of thesecases were judged to have had potentially preventable causes,not including intracranial infections (Nottidge and Okogbo1991). Anecdotal evidence suggests that the prevalence andincidence of mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and otherserious developmental disturbances are much higher inSub-Saharan Africa than in wealthy countries.Studies carried out in other low-income regions, which show rates up to24 times higher than in similar studies carried out in Europeor North America, support this probability (Durkin 2002). Epilepsy Published figures for prevalence of epilepsy in Sub-Saharan Africa range from 2.2 to 58.0 per 1,000 people. Rates arehigher in rural areas, reflecting the higher prevalence ofpredisposing factors, such as higher rates of birth traumaand repeated malaria or other parasitic infections. Hospital-based studies underestimate the prevalence ofepilepsy at the community level by at least 30 percent. Forcomparison, the available community-based prevalencedata on epilepsy for industrial countries range from 3.3 per1,000 people in England to 6.6 per 1,000 in the UnitedStates (IOM 2001, p. 184). Community-based surveys are the best way to evaluate the magnitude and distribution of epilepsy (IOM 2001 p. 186). As one of the few published examples, Osuntokun et al. (1978) used an instrument developed for the WorldHealth Organization (WHO) by Bruce Schoenberg. At theUniversity of Limoges, a questionnaire in French has beendeveloped for the assessment of epilepsy prevalence in trop-ical countries (Preux 2000). However, the results of suchsurveys are influenced by local cultural factors. Whereepilepsy is regarded as a social stigma, which is common,family members hide patients suffering from the conditionfrom researchers. Because of the difficulties and the expenseof implementing door-to-door surveys, increased attentionis being focused on the use of key community informants toidentify patients suffering from epilepsy. This strategy was applied successfully in an urban marginal and rural regionin Kenya (Feksi et al. 1991). The WHO publication Epilepsy in the African Region provides a more complete account of epidemiological studies (WHO 2004). Furthermore, epilepsy is a much more frequent cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa than in wealthy countries. A community-based study done in Ethiopia revealed that6.3 percent of people with epilepsy had died over a two-year period, and one-third in 20 years (T ekle-Haimanot,Forsgren, and Ekstedt 1997). In Africa, epilepsy mortality isprimarily due to status epilepticus, falls, drowning, and burns in addition to the sudden death that is knownthroughout the world. Infections Few studies from Sub-Saharan Africa document the impact of the many infections on neurological morbidity andmortality. Bacterial meningitis, particularly that due topneumococcal and meningococcal organisms, is still com-mon. The neurological outcomes of these readily treatable infections depend on the availability of and access to healthservices, which differ tremendously across the region. Thesituation is made worse where populations are displacedby conflicts. Epidemics of meningococcal disease are partic-ularly frequent in the \"meningococcal belt,\" which extendsfrom Guinea to the Sudan and northern Uganda andwhere, every 5 to 10 years, up to 100,000 cases occur. Viralencephalitis is on the increase, particularly where the preva-lence of HIV infection is high as well. The HIV virus enters the nervous system within hours of an individual's becoming infected. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome),which can cause paralysis leading to death from respiratoryfailure, often accompanies this initial HIV infection andoccurs with greater frequency in those infected withHIV/AIDS than in uninfected populations. As HIV/AIDSprogresses, all the neurological complications appear tooccur with the frequencies similar to those that were reportedin wealthier countries prior to the advent of treatment withantiretroviral agents. Opportunistic infections of the nerv-ous system occur in about 30 to 40 percent of those withAIDS (McArthur, Brew, and Nath 2005). An example is thecommon cryptococcal meningitis that often develops asimmune suppression occurs. Other complications includetoxoplasmosis; herpes zoster; central nervous system (CNS)lymphoma; several varieties neuropathies;myelopathy, causing paraplegia; strokes; retinal infection,leading to blindness; and the dementia that develops in Neurological Disorders | 353approximately 40 percent of those with AIDS. The fact that most infants and children who acquire HIV from their mothers develop cognitive delay, seizures, and opportunistic nervous system infections is barely recognized in mostreviews. As a result of the HIV pandemic in Sub-Saharan Africa, the neurological complications of HIV infection havebecome major, often overwhelming components of theoverall health burden. These complications are among themost common, and often themost common neurologic disorders in a population. This is particularly true in East, central, and southern Africa. Opportunistic infections over-whelm many facilities, some of which have developed poli-cies that permit only one hospital admission in a patient's lifetime. CNS lymphoma, a relatively uncommon tumorordinarily, is now the most commonly found brain tumor inmany regions. It is important to note that where highlyactive antiretroviral therapy has become available, the inci-dence of these complications among those with HIV hasdecreased significantly (Sacktor 2002). Due to the widespread prevalence of (often unrecognized and untreated) sexually transmitted diseases, the neurologi-cal complications of syphilis remain common. These includemeningovascular the insane\"), which is rapidly fatal if nottreated. All these manifestations of infection with Treponema pallidum are preventable by treatment with antibiotics. Malaria rivals AIDS for its impact on the nervous system. In addition to the hundreds of thousands of children who die each year from cerebral malaria, many more survive (often repeated attacks) and develop sequelae that have yet to be quantified. These include cognitive disorders and epilepsy. Similarly, tuberculous meningitis, and spinaltuberculosis (TB), leading to spinal cord compression andparaplegia (Pott's disease), are leading causes of death anddisability. Additionally, in many regions leprosy continues tocause deforming peripheral neuropathy, and it may bebecoming more common as the result of the redirection ofresources in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Stroke Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in Sub- Saharan Africa. T o date, most data on mortality have beenhospital-based, although the majority of stroke deaths in theregion are thought to occur at home (Kahn and T ollman1999). More accurate measures of stroke mortality havebeen attempted in urban and rural Tanzania (Walker et al. 2000). Among adults, 5.5 percent of deaths were attributedto cerebrovascular disease. The yearly age-adjusted rates per100,000 people in the 15 to 64 age group averaged 49 per100,000, four times the rates in England and Wales. In SouthAfrica, stroke accounts for 8 to 10 percent of all reporteddeaths and 7.5 percent of deaths among people of primeworking age, between 25 and 64 years old (Kahn andT ollman 1999). A prospective community survey in ruralSouth Africa reported that stroke accounted for 25 percent of all noncommunicable disease, including in many younger individuals. Stroke was responsible for 5.5 percent of alldeaths and 10.3 percent in those age 35 to 64 years. Strokeranked second as the cause of death in those age 35 to 64years, first in those age 55 to 74 years (11 percent of alldeaths), and second among those age 75 and older (6 percentof all deaths) (Kahn and T ollman 1999). In a rural hospitalin Zambia, stroke accounted for 9 percent of admissions,but used 14 percent of the intensive care unit's bed days(Birbeck 2001). The mortality following stroke was 50 per-cent, far higher than in wealthy countries, reflecting the lackof resources for early recognition and access to treatment. Dementia Available data indicate that the age-specific prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in Nigeria is similar to that amongAfrican Americans (Hendrie et al. 2001). However, age-related dementia becomes less common as HIV/AIDS low-ers life expectancy. Those who live long enough to develop dementia are often regarded culturally as not sick and thusdo not seek medical care. However, HIV/AIDS has madedementia a major issue because the associated dementia iscommon and often occurs in young people. Movement Disorders Parkinson's disease is known to occur in the region, but there is little documentation as to its prevalence and impacton morbidity and mortality. At the neurology clinic inMulago Hospital, the teaching hospital for the Faculty ofMedicine, Makerere University, Uganda, about two to three new cases are seen every month. However, most of theafflicted never seek medical care, particularly in the ruralareas. Sydenham's chorea, now uncommon in wealthy coun-tries, remains a common problem in Sub-Saharan Africa,due to the high rates of streptococcal infection and pooraccess to antibiotics. Additionally, the full spectrum of 354 | Donald Silberberg and Elly Katabiracommon movement disorders (such as essential tremor) and uncommon movement disorders (such as chorea gravi- darum and focal dystonias) occur. Headache From the limited available studies in the region, headache is one of the most common neurological complaints encoun-tered by health workers. Matuja (1991), at Muhimbili Medical Center, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, found that recur- rent headaches accounted for 20.6 percent of all new refer-rals to the adult neurology clinic over a period of two years.Thirty-four percent of the individuals had migraine, 27 per- cent had psychogenic (mostly anxiety and depression) disorders, and 13 percent had posttraumatic headache(Matuja 1991). Similarly, migraine accounted for 5.7 per-cent of all new patients seen in the child neurology clinic atEstate Specialist Hospital, in Kano, Nigeria (Okogbo 1991).Similarly, data from Zimbabwe indicated that headacheswere the most common problem encountered in a large door-to-door survey (Jelsma et al. 2002). These prevalencerates for headache do not differ significantly from those inthe United States and Europe. Trauma In some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, trauma rivals infections and vascular disorders as the most importantcause of neurological disease. Moreover, increasing motor- ized transportation, violence, and persistent armed con- flicts in the region are rapidly changing the pattern of thistrauma. Head trauma, if not immediately fatal, often leadsto cognitive impairment or epilepsy or both. Spinal cord trauma often produces quadriparesis, paraparesis, or paral- ysis. In the absence of skilled rehabilitation services, theaverage life span following significant spinal cord injury isno more than several years. ETIOLOGY AND DETERMINANTS The major risk factors for neurological disorders can be classed as genetic factors; nutritional deficiencies; infection;exposure to environmental toxins; prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal factors; poverty; and trauma. In Sub-Saharan Africa, by far the leading causes of neu- rological disorders are preventable. These include infectionsduring pregnancy, such as syphilis and rubella; perinatal conditions, such infections, meningitis, andsepticemia. Preventable infections resulting in the extremelyhigh under-five mortality in the region are often the causeof neurological sequelae for those that survive. The frequencyand adequacy of care for epilepsy and cerebral palsy can beused as indicators of the available quality of the health caresystems. In children, febrile convulsions are reported in every African health structure as a major cause of seizures. Prevalent causes of fever are similar across the region andinclude malaria, pneumonia, and measles. Other infections,such as meningitis, encephalitis, and bacterial septicemia,may directly affect the brain and cause epilepsy. Otheretiologies of epilepsy include such obvious causes as headinjury, parasitic infestations of the nervous system (such ascysticercosis), congenital CNS abnormalities, tumors, andvascular and metabolic disorders. A review of the neurological disorders seen at the pedi- atric neurology clinic of the University of Nigeria T eaching Hospital in Enugu revealed that perinatal problems, such asbirth severe neonatal most identified (Izuoraand Iloeje 1989). Studies from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe found hypertension to be the main risk factor for bothischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (Matenga 1997; Walker1994). Hypertension is an increasingly important publichealth problem in African countries, where it may affect upto 10 percent of the population and contributes to coronary heart disease, as well as to hemorrhagic and thromboticstroke. The condition frequently goes unrecognized, how-ever, in part because many African health care providerslack reliable equipment for measuring blood pressure(Birbeck 2000). In addition, the limited and erratic supplyof and access to appropriate drugs for the management ofhypertension contributes to the related high morbidity andmortality. Sickle-cell disease is a major cause of strokeamong children and young adults in West, East, and centralAfrica, affecting at least 1 percent of those with sickle-cell disease per year. An analysis of 320 adult stroke patients inDurban, South Africa, revealed that HIV/AIDS, tuberculo-sis, cysticercosis, and syphilis were the most common causesof stroke in the young adult age groups. Additionally, emboli from streptococcal infection-induced cardiac dis-ease (rheumatic heart disease) are a common cause ofstroke in young adults. Neurological Disorders | 355CONSEQUENCES OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS Neurological disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa impose a significant burden on the family and community, as well ason the affected individual. Some disorders, such as epilepsy,are well recognized but are not socially and culturallyacceptable. The enormous stigma attached to epilepsy often leads to the patient's being denied access to proper care.Lack of care then leads to severe complications, social isola-tion, and early death. Other disorders, such as dementia,paraplegia, and stroke, put undue stress on the caring familybecause institutional or community care support is limitedor nonexistent. This stress leads to further neglect of theafflicted person and eventually his or her premature death.Protein-calorie and micronutrient malnutrition contributeto impaired cognitive development, which compromises the future productivity of a nation's workforce. Althoughthe more complete epidemiology and cost analyses have yetto be done, there seems little doubt that neurological disor-ders impede economic development in many Sub-SaharanAfrica countries. RESOURCE ISSUES Virtually all of the excess morbidity and mortality that occur as a consequence of neurological disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa result from scarcities of resources. Twomajor subsets of resource scarcities that are particularlyimportant to neurological health and disease are the num- bers of specifically trained health care workers, and the diag-nostic (and therapeutic) resources available to them. Human Resources Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa do not have sufficient qualified staff in the clinical neurosciences (neurologists,neurosurgeons, psychiatrists). Except for South Africa, themean ratios for countries that have these medical specialistsare 1 neurologist for 1 million to 2.8 million people (versus 4 per 100,000 in Europe); 1 psychiatrist for 900,000 people(versus 9 per 100,000 in Europe); and 1 neurosurgeon for2 million to 6 million people (versus 1 per 100,000 in Europe).Most of the clinical neuroscience services are located in thecapital cities, often the largest urban areas, where the profes-sionals also often lecture at the medical schools. Neurologypatients often must travel long distances to consult with adoctor in the city.Osuntokun (1975) noted that because of the gross short- age of \"Western-trained\" health personnel, Nigerians fre- quently turn to traditional native medicine and nativeherbalists (as do many in other countries in Sub-SaharanAfrica). Although the training of these native doctors isarduous and lasts an average of 8 to 10 years, their short-comings often interfere with administration of effectivetreatments in community clinics. These doctors are excel-lent psychotherapists and maintain good relationships withtheir patients. Y oruba native doctors recognize severalclassical neurological diseases, including epilepsy, cere- brovascular disease, fever and headache, migraine, andataxic neuropathies. However, the scientific basis of theirpharmacotherapeutics is for the moment mostly unknown.Their practice is thus partially based on the very large bodyof knowledge of herbal medicines in Africa that has yet to beexplored scientifically. The role of the traditional healer is sometimes problem- atic. People who would without hesitation go to their local health care center with a severe cough, fever, or burn mayseek care for epilepsy through their local healer for years,never revealing their problem to the health care workerstreating their other problems, and thus not receiving appro- priate treatment. In a personal communication, Gretchen Birbeck, an asso- ciate professor of neurology and epidemiology at MichiganState University, had this to say, based on her extensive expe-rience in Zambia: It is important also to recognize that traditional healersmay fail to recognize or refer urgent treatable conditionsand that their therapies can have adverse effects. Childrenwhose parents attribute their malaria-associated seizures to supernatural causes suffer from higher parasite countsand require longer lengths of hospital stays than theirpeers, likely associated with initially seeking care fromlocal healers. Until traditional healers can become moreconnected to the biomedical healthcare system and/orthe public becomes a great deal more educated, tradi- tional healers will continue to care exclusively for patients who would benefit greatly from medications and treat-ments that are routinely available in most Sub-SaharanAfrica hospitals. Physicians are too scarce to provide routine outpatient care in most settings. The nurses and community health workers who are the frontline providers receive little orno training in how to diagnose and treat the common neu-rologic conditions that present to their clinic every day 356 | Donald Silberberg and Elly Katabira(Birbeck and Munsat 2002). Their inability to respond to neurologic complaints reinforces the patients' inclination to seek care from traditional healers. In addition, as neurology has evolved into a subspecialty separate from generalmedicine, fewer generalists receive neurologic training.The adequate supply of physicians in wealthier countrieshas resulted in greater use of neurologic consultations. However, where neurologists are lacking, as in Sub-Saharan Africa, this segregation of neurology from general medicineleaves a vacuum. Because it may take many years to increasethe number of neurologists, better training for primary care providers is essential. Diagnostic Facilities: Instrumentation The most important diagnostic measures are through inter- views and by the usual clinical examination, looking forsigns and symptoms of disturbed neurologic functions. This can be accomplished in any health structure. However, accu- rate diagnosis and management often requires diagnosticmeans that are usually found in secondary and tertiaryhealth care facilities. In Sub-Saharan Africa, with the excep- tion of South Africa, the specialized diagnostic tools for brain disorders, necessary for such purposes, consist of79 EEG machines, 65 CT scanners, and 9 MRIs. In contrast,South Africa has 60 EEG machines, 214 CT scanners, and46 MRIs (WHO 2004). T o compound the problem, this equipment is often badly maintained or out of order. Further, most of the patients referred to capital city hospitals cannot afford the price andtherefore cannot benefit from the technological progress. The few neurological surgeons practicing in Sub-Saharan Africa not only face these shortages in diagnostic equipment but must cope with a scarcity of needed surgical instrumentsas well as with a general paucity of the institutional resourcesneeded to carry out major procedures successfully. INTERVENTIONS: WHAT HAS WORKED? Despite the problems enumerated above, many avenues are open to reduce the impact of neurological disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa. The potential advances start with preven-tion, and proceed to treatment and rehabilitation. Primary Prevention Prevention is critical in reducing the incidence of braindisorders. Impairment caused by these disorders is oftenirreversible. On ethical grounds alone, prevention is always preferable to treatment or rehabilitation. In most instancesprevention is also more cost-effective than treatment. Manypotentially catastrophic disorders are now preventable.Preventive measures include immunization against tetanus,tuberculosis, measles, rubella, and polio, all of which pro-duce neurological dysfunction as their primary route ofattack, or as a very common complication; early and effec-tive management of childhood fevers to prevent febrileconvulsions; and the use of zinc, folic acid, and iron supple-mentation and fortification to facilitate normal brain devel-opment. Prevention of HIV transmission through effectivehealth education strategies and programs to prevent moth-er to child transmission are critical. Short-course antiretro-viral prophylaxis regimens are becoming widely used insuch programs in Sub-Saharan Africa and, in conjunctionwith supplemental feeding, are likely to significantly reduceHIV transmission. The situation will improve still furtherwhen antiretroviral therapy becomes universal in the region.Safe motherhood initiatives also greatly reduce the impactof prenatal and perinatal risk factors. The potential for prevention of stroke is illustrated by the fact that in wealthy countries the incidence of stroke has been reduced by 25 to 40 percent, largely because of earlyrecognition and treatment of hypertension and the reduc-tion in tobacco use (Rothwell et al. 2004; Whisnant 1984).Other preventive strategies include increased exercise,adopting healthy eating habits, and regular monitoring ofcholesterol. Prevention programs, although highly cost-effective, have not been undertaken in Sub-Saharan Africa. Treatment The WHO recommends phenobarbital as the first-line drug for the treatment of partial and generalized tonico-clonic epilepsy in developing countries. The use of this old and simple drug is encouraged because its efficacy for a wide range of seizure types and its low cost make it suit-able for use in primary health care in developing countries.The majority of affected individuals can be treated suc- cessfully with phenobarbital at a cost of about US$5 per year, thereby avoiding disability and the risk of prematuredeath. Phenytoin, which may be more effective for someindividuals, has few side effects and cost US$20.59 in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2000 (WHO 2001). The publicationEpilepsy in the African Region (WHO 2004) provides a more complete account of the availability and cost of treatment, by country. Neurological Disorders | 357The current global effort to make antiretroviral drugs readily available and affordable to a much larger infected population in the region will reduce morbidity and mortal- ity related to neurological complications due to HIV/AIDS. A FRAMEWORK FOR RESEARCH Although disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) have been computed for some of the specific causes of developmentaldisability, such as meningitis and iodine deficiency, 1these figures do not convey the full proportion of cases within agiven category of disorder that result in early and lifelong disability or death (see IOM 2001). DALY estimates are not currently available for developmental disability as a whole.What is needed before useful DALY or other measures ofimpact can be calculated for developmental disability is accurate and up-to-date information from Sub-Saharan Africa countries on the prevalence and impacts of long-termfunctional limitations originating early in life, as a result ofboth known and unknown causes. Stigmatization of those with epilepsy, and often their families, is widespread. Some cultural beliefs, such as thefear that epilepsy is contagious and that the individual is possessed of demons, confound epidemiological studies,prevent treatment, and lead to personal and economic dis-aster for many affected individuals and their families.Because stigma and other cultural beliefs are locally grounded,they require local study in order to develop ways in which todeal with them constructively. The full picture of the epidemiology of epilepsy remains sketchy. In addition to descriptive studies, analyticalresearch is needed to ascertain specific risk factors for thedevelopment of the disease with an emphasis on its relationto infectious disorders, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and tetanus; its links to the common causes of under-fiveand neonatal mortality; and its links to birth trauma.Environmental and genetic causes should be explored invarious geographic locations and among different ethnicgroups. Information gathered through such efforts would becritical to the formulation of effective preventive strategies. Most econometric studies of epilepsy in developing countries await implementation. Cost-of-illness, cost- effectiveness, cost-minimization, and cost-benefit analysesshould be undertaken to provide government officials andfunding agencies with the necessary economic perspective.Furthermore, quality of life should be measured for epilepticpatients receiving treatment in an economically constrainedenvironment. Socioeconomic determinants of the outcome measures that could best reflect optimal care for epilepsypatients should be identified. Most of the same observations can be made about stroke prevention and treatment, largely unrecognized majorproblems in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the many other disor-ders that affect the nervous system. For example, the directand indirect costs of stroke are enormous, including loss of wage-earning capacity and the need for the family's provi-sion of care for survivors. Evaluations of cost-effectiveness of neurological inter- ventions have not been extensively carried out in the region. They depend on the actual costs of specific drugs and other treatments, which vary among countries and will decrease asnewer drugs come off patent. POLICY ISSUES Among brain disorders, epilepsy stands out, not only because of its high prevalence and incidence rates and thepotential for successful treatment, but because of the myths and beliefs attached to it in various cultures and the result- ing impact on the individual, family, and the community.Epilepsy commonly attacks children and young adults in themost productive years of their lives and frequently leads to unemployment, which confounds not only the problems of the afflicted but often the family that relies on their financialsupport. T o implement effective programs for the community- level detection and treatment of patients with epilepsy, governments and health authorities of developing countriesmust first issue clear policies articulating measures for the identification and treatment of patients with epilepsy.Essential components of any strategy are a continuous drugsupply and means of distribution, prevention programs,social programs and stigma mitigation strategies to increaseemployment and improve the general welfare of individualssuffering from the disease, training of health care personnel,and methods for surveillance and routine data collection. Increasing the clinical and research professional capacity in developing countries is key to developing sustainable,locally appropriate programs. Approaches to addressingthese deficits include the following: Capacity building through training via on-site education, exchange programs, and distance learning using moderninformation technology 358 | Donald Silberberg and Elly KatabiraDevelopment of local networks that link centers with expertise to their surrounding communities Development of regional networks of centers withexpertise Development of educational programs to enable primarycare health workers to recognize, and when appropriate,treat brain disorders Introduction of locally relevant basic, clinical, and healthcare policy research that will lead countries to choose toincrease capacity. Clinical neuroscientists should be part of the teams that address the issues of the health care systems in Sub-Saharan Africa, so as to be certain that the prevention, recognition,treatment, and rehabilitation of brain disorders areadequately addressed.

Neurological Disorders | 359361Historically, injuries have been understood as inescapable realities of everyday life. Increasingly, the timely and accu-rate collection and analysis of data in various parts of theworld has encouraged a revision of these assumptions.Careful scrutiny of such data has revealed that both inten- tional and unintentional injuries are preventable and inmany respects subject to elements of control. An injury may be defined as \"the physical damage that results when a human body is suddenly or briefly subjected to intolerable levels of energy\"(Holder et al. 2001, 5). Injuriesare traditionally grouped according to two broad categories:intentional and unintentional. Conventionally, intentionalinjuries are comprised of interpersonal violence (spousalabuse, child abuse, other assaults), self-inflicted injuries (attempted and completed suicides), as well as collective vio-lence and war-related injuries. Motor vehicle injuries, burns,falls, drownings, and other injury classifications in whichintentionality is understood to be absent constitute thebroad unintentional injuries category. Thus, whereas inten-tional injuries are associated with violence, as defined by theWorld Health Organization (WHO), unintentional injuriesare not. Such a distinction may be valuable for conceptualand analytical clarity, but recent evidence points to a cluster of shared risks across intentional and unintentional injuries.Furthermore, intentionality cannot always be ascertained in particular circumstances, and violence may indirectly contribute to the prevalence of unintentional injuries(Berger and Mohan 1996). The \"intentionality divide\" is thusestablished as a useful concept for injury prevention programs, but risk factors appear porous across it. Whatever the conceptual ambiguities may be, the WHO estimates that injuries constitute 16 percent of the global burden of disease (WHO 2002a). This translates into5.8 million injury-related deaths at a rate of 97.9 per 100,000worldwide. Injuries further account for between 10 and30 percent of all hospital admissions and render at least 78 million people disabled each year (Berger and Mohan1996). In 1998, unintentional injuries accounted for justunder 3.5 million deaths worldwide (WHO 2000b). Theburden resulting from unintentional injuries tends to behigher in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs) andcommunities. For instance, 87.9 percent of all road trafficdeaths, and 88.3 percent of lost disability-adjusted life years(DALYs) were from LMICs (Mathers et al. 2001).Chapter24 Violence and Injuries Brett Bowman, Mohamed Seedat, Norman Duncan, and Olive Kobusingye(Smith and Barss 1991) to the effective execution of this mandatory recording and the poor or absent record keeping among most vulnerable populations and communities, such as refugees, displaced persons, and communities afflicted bycivil and armed conflict, national mortality data sets makefor sound starting points from which to describe the preva-lence and magnitude of injury in Africa. These figures, however, represent the tip of the injury iceberg, because although nonfatal injuries are estimated to exceed the globalfatal injury profile by as much as 20 times (WHO 2002a),surveillance systems for capturing and reporting nonfatal injury are far less developed than those recording fatal injury (WHO 2002a). Most of the data on injury areacquired from surveys and specialized studies within rela- tively limited population groups. These studies provide apatchwork picture of the injury profile of Africa. TheAfrican injury profile provided here is thus made up of a fullsupplement of smaller studies extracted from the literaturethat complement the Africa-specific data subsets gleanedfrom information provided by the WHO. INTENTIONAL INJURIES Intentional injuries (violence) resulted in the deaths of some 311,000 people in Africa in the year 2000. This translatesinto a rate of 60.9 deaths per 100,000 people in Africa as a direct result of intentional injury alone. This figure dwarfs the unintentional injury mortality rates of both the WHOEuropean and American regions with rates of 32.0 (WHO2002a) and 27.7 unintentional injury deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. As indicated earlier, morbidity and dis- ability due to intentional injury have a prevalence thatexceeds mortality by at least 20 times. Intentional injuriestherefore resulted in the disability or incapacitation of atleast 6.2 million people on the African continent in the year2000. Data collected and analyzed in some selected Africanstates indicate the dire burden that injury exerts on these countries. In Zimbabwe, injuries were reported to accountfor 15 percent of all deaths for the year 1988 (Zwi et al.1993). Survey data suggest that the injury contribution tomortality is as significant in both Ghana and Kenya(Forjuoh, Zwi, and Romer 1996). Homicide According to the WHO (2002a) over half a million (520,000) people died as a direct result of homicide at a rateof 8.8 per 100,000 in the year 2000. More than three-quarters 362 | Brett Bowman, Mohamed Seedat, Norman Duncan, and Olive KobusingyeDespite the heavy burden from the human immunodefi- ciency virus and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), malaria, and other infectious diseases, injuries were still responsible for 19.93 percent of all deaths of thosebetween the ages of 15 and 59 years, and for nearly one inevery four deaths of those between 15 and 29 years. Most ofthese deaths resulted from road traffic injuries, wars, and interpersonal violence. According to the WHO (2002a), road traffic injuries, war, and homicide, respectively, werethe 10th, 11th, and 14th leading causes of mortality in Africaduring 2000. In the year 2000, an estimated 1.6 million people died from various forms of violence (WHO 2002a). Althoughviolence manifests as a worldwide public health concern, the epidemiology of violence indicates that the majority ofviolent deaths occur in LMICs. Less than 10 percent of allviolence-related deaths occurred in high-income countries(HICs) in 2000 (WHO 2002a). The WHO (2002a, 5) definesviolence as \"the intentional use of physical force or power,threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, oragainst a group or community, that either results in or has ahigh likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychologicalharm, maldevelopment or deprivation.\" This chapter covers the incidence, prevalence, and mag- nitude of intentional (violent) and unintentional mortality resulting from injuries at the global and continental (African) levels. The injury profiles of South Africa andUganda are examined to demonstrate the merits of estab-lishing a country-level injury surveillance system. The chap- ter also includes an overview of the risk factors and determi-nants that are associated with intentional and unintentional injuries resulting in mortality in Africa. In conclusion, generic recommendations are listed for the control, preven- tion, and elimination of injuries and violence in Africa, witha view to encouraging injury control and safety promotionpractice and policy. DATA SOURCES The global, regional, and national burden of nonfatal injury is exceedingly difficult to measure. Perhaps the most reliableindicators of the magnitude of violence and injury arenational mortality data sets. The mandatory recording andcertification of deaths in most countries renders mortality information an adequate source from which to calculate thefrequency and prevalence of violence and injuries withinnational and global contexts. Despite the various obstacles(77 percent) of these victims were male (WHO 2002a). Globally, the highest levels of homicide occurred among males 15 to 29 years old, closely followed by those 30 to 44 years old. The gender disparity in the worldwide distri-bution of homicide is most apparent through a rate com-parison. For every female victim of homicide, 3.4 males arekilled per 100,000 people globally. Conversely, more women than men are the victims of intimate partner violence, and women are more likely than men to die from such violence(NCIPC 2003). Homicide rates vary according to region andincome levels (WHO 2002a). Recent results from the South African National Injury Mortality Surveillance System (NIMSS) indicate that homicide contributed 36 percentto all nonnatural injury deaths in that country in 2000 (Burrows et al. 2001) and that homicide continues to be theleading cause of premature death among South Africanmales (Bowley, Parmar, and Boffard 2004). Suicide Suicide was the cause of death for an estimated 815,000 people worldwide in 2000 (WHO 2002a). The age-adjustedrate of 14.5 per 100,000 attests to the global magnitude of self-directed violence. Suicide among males is more frequent than among females, with over 60 percent of allsuicides being male (WHO 2002a). An analysis of Africanand global suicide reveals that there is a proportionate increase in suicide with age, suicide reaching its peak among individuals 60 years of age or older. In this age cohort, malesuicide rates are twice those of females. Suicide is most pro-nounced in the European, Southeast Asian, and WesternPacific regions of the WHO database coverage, where sui-cide rates are 19.1 per 100,000, 12.0 per 100,000, and 20.8per 100,000, respectively. The suicide rate for African males in 2000 was 6.7 per 100,000, whereas the rate for females was3.1 per 100,000. Africa appears to be the least frequentlyrepresented region in studies of suicide, but a number ofnational, regional, and citywide comparative studies doserve to provide a (limited) profile of the African suicideinjury burden (Burrows et al. War-Related armed conflicts worldwide has grown expo- nentially over the past century. In the 1950s there were nomore than 20 armed conflicts in progress across the globe. This number rose to 50 in the late 1980s and doubled to 100 armed conflicts worldwide during the 1990s (Stohl 2002).Recent studies estimate that 310,000 people died as a direct result of injury incurred during warfare in 2000 (WHO2002a). Injuries resulting from collective violence have beenconcentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and theCaribbean (Jansson and Svanstrom 1999). The highest ratesof these wartime injuries occurred in Africa, where war-related deaths numbered 32 per 100,000 people. Africa thuscontributed 167,000, or 53.8 percent, of war-related injurymortality to the WHO injury data in 2000. Colonial andpostcolonial Africa has been an epicenter for collective vio- lence over the last 100 years. Indeed, civil strife and political instability have characterized the continent throughout itsmodern history. Moreover, the wars in Africa have tended tohave increasingly long durations. The increased sophistica-tion of weaponry has changed the nature of global conflicts.Examples of wars on the African continent are numerous.The WHO has estimated that the war between Ethiopia andEritrea toward the concluding years of the twentieth centuryresulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people. Besidesthe obviously direct mortality consequences for Africanstates, wars undermine health and political infrastructures,indirectly resulting in many more deaths from outbreaks ofcommunicable disease (WHO 2002a). Many injury studies in the literature focus on the injury consequences of African war on children (Cliff and Noormohamed 1993; Stohl 2002). Others concentrate onthe direct and indirect health outcomes of war for thecontinent in general (Elliot 2000; Elliot and Harris 2001;Marysse 2003). Although the bulk of lives lost to warinjuries in Africa have resulted from armed conflicts in theDemocratic Republic of Congo (Marysse 2003), Liberia, andRwanda, the legacy of war continues to contribute to African mortality through, for example, the detonation ofredundant landmines in Mozambique (Elliot 2000; Elliotand Harris 2001). The indirect war-mortality figures areequally as devastating as the casualties resulting from directcombat. Estimates of the indirect war-mortality figuresvary; some studies estimate 2.5 million Congolese deaths asan indirect consequence of the civil strife that characterizedthe Democratic Republic of Congo from 1998 to 2003(Marysse 2003). UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES The magnitude, prevalence, and severity of unintentional injury mortality (bar deaths resulting from naturaldisasters) are often underpublicized.Such mortality imposes, Violence and Injuries | 363however, a significant burden on global and African health systems. Traffic-Related Fatal Injuries According to the WHO (Peden, McGee, and Sharma 2002),the overwhelming majority (90 percent) of all fatal roadtraffic injuries (RTIs) occurred in LMICs in 2000. In that year 1.26 million people across the globe died as a direct result of these injuries. This figure translates into a rate of 20.8 people dying from RTIs per 100,000 worldwide. Again,males are at higher risk of dying in this manner than theirfemale counterparts. For every female traffic-related death,there are at least three male victims (Peden, McGee, andSharma 2002). Globally, males in Africa have the secondhighest RTI fatality rate of 35.8 per 100,000, superseded onlyby the male RTI fatality rate of 42.4 per 100,000 in SoutheastAsia. Worldwide, over 50 percent of all fatal RTIs occuramong young adults between the ages of 15 and 44 years. This trend is replicated in Africa (Peden, McGee, andSharma 2002). A study focused on describing the prevalence and magni- tude of RTI fatalities in Kenya (Odero, Khayesi, and Heda2003) reported that the country has one of the highest roadfatality rates in relation to vehicle ownership in the world,and a number of South African studies (De Wet 1993;Peltzer 2003; Venter 1998 ) have the country's nonnatural mortalityburden. A recent injury epidemiological study conducted inTanzania again revealed RTIs to be the leading cause of injury mortality in the areas of Dar es Salaam, Hai, and Morogoro (Moshiro et al. 2000). A study comparingtransport-related injuries in urban and rural settings inGhana found that the \"nature of transport injury in bothurban and rural areas is fundamentally different from that indeveloped countries\"(Mock, Forjuoh, and Rivara 1999, 367).This difference is most pronounced in the contribution ofminibus taxis and other public transport vehicle crashes andmotor vehicle crashes involving pedestrians (Mock, Forjuoh,and Rivara 1999) to transport-related injuries in Ghana. Burns, Falls, and Drowning Fire-related burn injuries resulted in the death of some 238,000 people in 2000 (Peden, McGee, and Sharma 2002).Ninety-five percent of these occurred in LMICs. Africa hadthe second highest rate of fatal burn injuries in that year.Most notably, fire-related burns are the only cause of injuryin which global female rates of death outnumber those of men. This is, however, not the case in Africa, where malesare more frequently the victims of burn fatalities. Y oungchildren and the elderly are the most vulnerable to burninjuries. This seems to be the case in all forms of burn mor-tality in particular African countries. A study conducted inTanzania (Mbembati, Maseru, and Leshabari 2002) foundthat children younger than 15 years constitute a particularlyvulnerable group for domestic burn injuries. Children in thesame age cohort have been identified as especially vulnerable to burn injuries in South Africa (Lerel 1994). Forjuoh (1996) confirmed that children were a vulnerable uninten-tional (and in 5.4 percent of cases, intentional) burns cohortin the Ashanti region of Ghana. The most frequently repre-sented external causes of the initial epidemiological investi-gation (Forjuoh 1995) included scalds (44 percent), contactwith hot objects (30 percent), and flames (20 percent). Falls accounted for more than 280,000 deaths globally in the year 2000 (Peden, McGee, and Sharma 2002). Almost a quarter of all falls occurred in high-income WHO regions. Globally, females over 70 years of age constitute the mostvulnerable group to fall fatalities. This is particularly pro-nounced in Africa, where female fall fatalities in the agegroup 80 years and older are approximately twice that ofmales. Deaths due to drowning are almost exclusively an injury problem of LMICs. Ninety-seven percent of all drownings worldwide occur in LMICs, and thus Africa, where thedrowning mortality rate is 113.1 per 100,000 people (Pedenand McGee 2003), has been identified as a region at riskfor drownings. Males in Africa have the highest drowningmortality rates in the world with a drowning rate of 19.2 per 100,000 population. Children are unquestionably most atrisk for death from drowning; more than 50 percent of allglobal drowning mortalities occur in children up to 14 yearsold. This trend is emphasized in Africa, where the highestrate of drowning fatalities (18.9 per 100,000) occurs amongchildren between zero and four years (Peden, McGee, andSharma 2002). THE EXPERIENCES OF SOUTH AFRICA AND UGANDA Both South Africa and Uganda are countries that can provide examples of the benefits of developing sound injury meas-urement systems. Such systems are aimed at establishing or implementing African context-specific \"best-practices\" for 364 | Brett Bowman, Mohamed Seedat, Norman Duncan, and Olive Kobusingyethe prevention of injury and can be of use in the various African states. According to collated international data, South Africa contributes significantly to the burden of injury in Africa. A sound South African injury mortalitysurveillance system could, however, bias the injury-mortalitycontribution of the country to the continent. Nonetheless, asocioeconomic profile that describes significant disparities between rich and poor measured by a Gini coefficient of 0.58 (Nattrass and Seekings 2001) and a complex politicalhistory make South Africa a good country to analyze as aninjury control and prevention case example. The South African NIMSS, which captures approximately 34 percent of all nonnatural deaths nationally, reported 18,876 people tohave died as a direct result of injuries in 2000 (Matzopoulos 2002). Homicide was the leading manner of death (44.5 per-cent), followed by transport-related fatalities (34.5 percent)and suicide (9.4 percent). Figures extracted from the 2001NIMSS annual report reveal no significant decrease in themagnitude and prevalence of mortality due to injury inSouth Africa (Matzopoulos 2002). Again these figures repre-sent the tip of the injury iceberg, as they do not describe thepreponderant morbidity prevalence of the country. The NIMSS statistics to a large extent reflect the gender trends in international injury statistics, indicating that inSouth Africa males are more likely than females to be thevictims of nonnatural deaths. Indeed, it would appear that the gender divide in terms of injury prevalence is even morepronounced in South Africa than internationally.Specifically, the NIMSS statistics indicate that, in the citiesparticipating in the NIMSS, 80 percent of all victims of non-natural deaths are males (Donson and Van Niekerk 2002).These statistics also indicate that during 2001, malesaccounted for 82.4 percent of all suicide cases. In the South African cities of Pretoria, Durban, Cape T own, and East London, where injury-mortality surveillance systems provide full coverage, injury rates indicate the diremagnitude of injury as a disease burden. Pretoria, the capi-tal city of South Africa and home to a population of2,043,500 (Sukhai and Matzopoulos 2002) had an all-injurydeath crude rate of 136 per 100,000 in 2001. Although thisfigure pales in comparison to injury death estimates inKampala (the capital city of Uganda), the rate attests to theprevalence of injury resulting in death in one of SouthAfrica's cities with the most resources. Such figures continueto call attention to the burden of injury in other SouthAfrican cities, where crude injury mortality rates are equallydisturbing. In the west coast city of Cape T own, the touristhotspot of South Africa, the all-injury mortality rate of 170per 100,000 is a serious source of concern. The injury death rate of 160 per 100,000 in Durban further emphasizes theburden of injury on another one of South Africa's coastal cities. In the southwest city of East London, the rate of injury death was 203 per 100,000 for the year 2000. Transport-related deaths and homicide collectively account for the majority of deaths in the urban centers of South Africa (Sukhai and Matzopoulos 2002); East Londonshowed a homicide rate of 100 per 100,000 in 2001 andCape T own revealed a transport-related fatality crude rate of42 per 100,000 in 2001 (Sukhai and Matzopoulos 2002).Although nontransport injury deaths areovershadowed by violent and transport-related causes ofdeath in South Africa, their contribution to the injury burden of the country is significant; in 2001 alone, EastLondon had an unintentional, nontransport-related injurymortality rate as high as 27 per 100,000. Focusing on cities that yield data like those presented above have proved of use in injury prevention and safety promotion in South Africa for many reasons. Census data that yield accurate population denominators for calculatingrates of injury in most cities in South Africa provide deci-sion and policy makers with quality information for mobi-lizing resources toward the prioritization of injury preven-tion and safety promotion at both national and local levelsof government. The experience of South Africa has indi-cated that although national data collection is imperativefor the development of national injury profiling, a city focusappears to expedite data collection, analyses, and delivery todecision makers aiming at preventive action. Injury preven-tion practitioners have therefore reversed earlier attempts tosecure full coverage at the national level and refigured theirtargets to data-driven prevention in cities. Ultimately, injuryprevention researchers and practitioners believe that illus-trating the utility of injury surveillance at the city level willinform the prioritization of a national injury preventionagenda. In Uganda, as in South Africa, violence and unintentional injury are a major cause of disease burden and constitute thefifth leading cause of premature death nationally (Uganda,Ministry of Health 2000). The magnitude of these burdenswas measured in a survey conducted in Kampala by theMinistry of Health. In one section of Kampala 119 fatalinjuries were reported for a population of 10,982 for the five-year period 1992 to 1996, resulting in a mortality rate of 220 per 100,000 people per year.

The incidence of nonfatal injuries was 114 per 1,000 per year. Furthermore, 312 dis-abilities as a direct result of injury were recorded by thesurvey. This translates into an injury-caused disability rateof 2.8 per 1,000 per year. The overall incidence of all the injuries was 116 per 1,000 per year. Road traffic crashes con-stituted the primary cause of injury deaths and disabilities.Interpersonal violence involving the use of firearms was thesecond leading cause of injury mortality in this urbancommunity. Burns were the leading cause of severe (fatal ordisabling) injuries in children age 10 years or younger. Burnsalso constituted 51 percent of all injuries from which this age group fully recovered, pointing to the importance ofburns in the population (see tables 24.1 to 24.5). In the rural district of Mukono, in the southern part of the country, 34 fatal injuries were reported to have occurred in a population of 7,427 people during the five-year period preceding the ministry's survey. These figures translated intoan average annual injury mortality rate of 92 per 100,000persons (see table 24.1). The prevalence rate of disabilitiesdue to injury was 0.7 percent.

Falls were the most common cause of severe injuries in children below 10 years of age (33 percent),followed by traffic (27 percent) and burns (13 percent). In Gulu, a rural district in northern Uganda that is expe- riencing a protracted armed rebellion, 1,475 households with 8,595 people were surveyed. Seventy-three percent ofthe population lived in temporary housing, 46 percent were internally displaced persons living in camps, and 81.3 per- cent of the total population was under 35 years. These con-ditions are being experienced in several countries in Africa,and the pattern of injuries has not been well described.Fourteen percent of the population were injured annually,gunshots being the leading cause of injury mortality. Theannual injury mortality rate was 7.7 per 1,000 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 7.01-8.49), and the annual injurydisability rate was 11.3 per 1,000 (95 percent CI, 10.4-12.2).Only 4.5 percent of the injured were reported to be combat-ants. Fifty percent of the injured received first aid, whereasonly 13 percent of those who died reached the hospital. The injury fatality rate is three and a half times higher than thatin urban Uganda, and more than eight times the global aver-age (Lett, Kobusingye, and Ekwaru 2006).These figures serve well as a picture of the alarmingly high prevalence and magnitude of death due to injury in Uganda and South Africa. Furthermore, these statisticsdescribe and underscore the importance of data as the basisfor prioritizing interventions aimed at the prevention of violence and injury in Africa. The establishment of similarinjury surveillance systems in other parts of the continentwould thus contribute to a more complete profile of conti-nental injury patterns. This more comprehensive picturewould allow for inclusively prioritizing prevention pro-grams for those countries not yet identified as primaryinjury prevention targets in Africa. RISK FACTORS Throughout this review of the magnitude of injury mortal- ity, the data have implied various risk factors. In response tothe range of injury risk factors identified within myriadstudies, the WHO has developed a factor matrix thatcaptures its typology of injury risk. These risk factors, which the WHO, in its ecological typology for grouping risk 368 | Brett Bowman, Mohamed Seedat, Norman Duncan, and Olive Kobusingye/H1102110 Total5871 126 964033 7 431Burns TrafficFalls Traffic Falls Burns Traffic Gunshots Animal bites Traffic Gunshots Falls Traffic Gunshots Falls Traffic Falls Cuts/stabs Traffic Burns Blunt force Traffic Gunshots Burns24 41 14 24 7 12 25 35 1 15 8 11 56 44 27 21 10 8 50 52 20 21 5 5 19 48 6 15 4 10 11 33 9 273 9 2 29 1 14 1 14 117 27 59 1447 11168 90 105 61 251316 478Burns Falls Cuts/stabs Traffic FallsCuts/stabs Traffic Cuts/stabsBlunt force Traffic Falls Burns Traffic FallsCuts/stabs Cuts/stabs TrafficFalls Traffic BurnsCuts/stabs85 51 31 1924 14 28 31 22 2420 22 48 46 14 1313 12 27 44 12 20 6 10 11 44 4 16 3 12 4 39 4 39 3 23 4 25 3 192 13 139 29113 24 73 15 Table 24.5 Top Three Causes of Injury, by Age, Urban Division (Kawempe), Uganda Severe injuries Recovered injuries Age group n Causes No. % n Causes No. % Source: Kobusingye, Guwatudde, and Lett 2001.factors, refers to as \"individual\" factors, do not remain dis- creet through the complex causal paths that result in vio- lence. So, for example, being a male is associated with being a risk factor for being both the perpetrator and the victim ofa violent (and in the case of the victim) fatal act. These riskfactors are enmeshed within the complex relationalexchanges in the production of fatal injury. They interact both within and between the broader matrices of the risk factors of fatal injury. Following the ecological typologyproposed by the WHO (2002a), relationships, community,and society form another set of risk factors. Relationship Risk Factors Relationship factors can be defined as those factors related to close personal relationships, such as family, peer, and inti-mate partner relationships, that increase the likelihood of violence and injury. Family Relationships. Family relationships appear to be central to the development and occurrence of a broad range of injuries and acts of violence. For example, violent behav-ior during adolescence has been linked to conflictualparental relationships (WHO 2002a). Furthermore, researchhas found that the physical abuse and neglect of childrenwere strong predictors of the latter's later arrest for violence.Similarly, other studies have found that the harsh physical punishment of children by their parents at the age of eightyears appeared to increase the former's chances of arrest forviolence up to the age of 30 years (WHO 2002a). Moreover,it also appeared to increase the likelihood that these childrenwould become physically abusive parents themselves. Peer Relationships. Peer relationships, particularly during adolescence, appear to be strongly related to violent behav- ior and intentional injuries. For example, researchers havefound a strong relationship between violence and havingdelinquent friends (WHO 2002a). However, the causal direction of this relationship, that is, whether having delin- quent friends leads to violence or whether violence results inthe establishment of friendships with delinquent friends isnot clear. Community Factors This repertoire of risk factors includes those related to various community contexts that may increase the likeli-hood of violence and injury, such as the neighborhood, theworkplace, places of worship, and schools. These factors include community integration or cohesion, the availabilityof firearms, the presence of gangs, neighborhood density,policing, and drug trafficking. Social Cohesion. The degree of community cohesion and functionality is strongly related to the rates of various forms of violence and injury. Studies have found a cyclical relationbetween the levels of violence and community dysfunctionand lack of cohesion in Jamaica (WHO 2002a). Along simi-lar lines, other studies have found that communities withthe lowest levels of intimate partner violence were thosecharacterized by levels of cohesion and functionality thatallowed for sanctions against intimate partner violence andeffective victim support (WHO 2002a). In South Africa,Keikelame and Ferreira (2000) also found a strong relation-ship between community dysfunction and elder abuse. Drug Trafficking. Internationally, violence has been found to be closely associated with drug trafficking. For example, in Brazil, research has shown that drug trafficking is respon-sible for a significant proportion of homicides and injuries(WHO 2002a). In other parts of South and CentralAmerica, studies have also found that adolescents involvedin drug dealing exhibit higher levels of violence than theirpeers who are not (WHO 2002a). Societal Factors This set of risk factors are those broad social factors \"that create an acceptable climate for violence, those that reduceinhibitions against violence, and those that create andsustain gaps [and tensions] between different groups orcountries\" (WHO 2002a, 13). These include health, educa- tional, economic, and political factors and social policiesand practices that result in high levels of social, political, andeconomic inequality. Prevailing cultural values and practicesalso form part of this set of societal risk factors. Economic Inequalities. The WHO (2002a) argues that there is a manifest relationship between poverty and levels of violence and injury. This position is borne out by a range of studies. For example, various studies conducted inAfrica report a link between poverty and the risk of child-hood burns (Mbembati, Maseru, and Leshabari 2002).Additionally, as reported earlier, 87.9 percent of all road traf-fic deaths occur in LMICs (WHO 2002a). Then too, theWHO (2002a) indicates that although the composite rate of Violence and Injuries | 369homicide, suicide, and war-related deaths for high-income countries is 14.4 per 100,000, the rate for LMICs is 32.1 per 100,000, more than twice as high as that for HICs. In this regard, studies have found that the gross domestic productacross countries is negatively related to violence (WHO2002a). In South Africa, Budlender (2000) has also reporteda link between poverty and death and injury due to crime. However, in many cases, this relationship is substantially moderated by income inequalities. In effect, significantincome inequalities are associated with high rates of vio-lence, even in high-income contexts. T o a certain extent, this finding could perhaps account for the high levels of violence in South Africa, given its substantial income disparities(May, Woolard, and Klasen 2000). Culture. T o a large extent, people's responses to their envi- ronment are influenced by culture, which is reflected in the values and norms of a society. For this reason, culture is alsoconsidered to play an important role in the levels of violencein a particular society. Research shows that cultures thatsupport values that endorse violence and that do not pro-vide nonviolent alternatives to resolve conflicts appear tohave higher rates of violence. More specifically, a number ofstudies have found that the risk of violence against womenis increased in cultures that endorse male dominance and aggression (WHO 2002a). Additionally, the WHO (2002a) argues that contemporary cultural norms that valorizeyouthfulness is a significant contributory factor in theelevated levels of elder abuse. STRATEGIES FOR CONTROL: WHAT PRACTICES EXIST? The preceding analysis and the work of international agen- cies, including the WHO, point to the importance of estab-lishing injury surveillance systems that can provide timely, accurate, and quality data for informing prevention policies and practices and serve as the backbone of national preven-tion programs. Without surveillance as a method and aprocess, health care planners are unable to prioritize the allocation of resources. Thus, a national program may focus on strengthening capacities for data collection and preven-tion methodologies, encouraging research on the determi-nants and costs of injuries and their prevention, encourag-ing intersectoral and cross-disciplinary collaboration, andenhancing responses for the prevention, control, and man-agement of injuries.Prevention of Road Traffic Injuries In the prevention of RTIs the focus could be on proven measures, such as encouraging pedestrians to walk facingtraffic, introducing bright and visible clothing, enacting speed limits, persuading drivers to use headlights during the daytime, and promoting the use of approved disc brakes.Environment-based measures for the prevention of RTIsinclude vigilant and consistent policy and enforcement measures; the introduction of red light cameras; the use of traffic circles; the bright illumination of crossings; and theprovision of adequate sidewalks for pedestrians, who areamong the most vulnerable road users. Other preventionmeasures include segregating public vehicles from privatetransport vehicles; providing adequate separate lanes forheavy vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians; and introducing a flexible time arrangement for car-free zones for pedestrians(Mohan 2003). Control measures aimed at reducing the severity of RTIs may include requiring the use of protective clothing and helmets for cyclists, the use of seatbelts, and the develop-ment of safer dashboards in motor vehicles. Key measuresfor the effective management of traffic-related injuriesinclude rapid responses to crashes in the form of first aid forthe injured, elimination of fuel leakage, and clearance ofaccident scenes, in addition to effective policing systems andaccessible hospital and rehabilitation centers for the injured(Forjuoh 1996). Violence Prevention Violence prevention measures may be universal, selected, or indicated in nature. Whereas universal interventionsare aimed at the total population without consideration ofindividual risks (for example, community-wide mediacampaigns), selected interventions target those at risk for violence (for example, training single parents in parentingskills and anger management). Other interventions shouldbe directed at those who have already engaged in violentbehavior (for example, rehabilitation programs for perpe-trators of domestic violence). Selected interventions that are keenly attuned to risk factors that include biological factors, psychological and behavioral characteristics, family influences, peer influences,income, gender, age, geographical location, and various other context-specific variables have been shown to be effec-tive in preventing violence (Berger and Mohan 1996).Following the ecological approach of the WHO (2002a),violence prevention targeting the vulnerable 12-to-19-year 370 | Brett Bowman, Mohamed Seedat, Norman Duncan, and Olive Kobusingyeage cohort may, for instance, include social development programs, academic enrichment programs, mentoring ini- tiatives, extracurricular activities, and attempts to reduce poverty and income inequality (WHO 2002a). The causalpathways of violence are complex, and the prevention ofinterpersonal violence should be multisectoral and multidi-mensional and therefore include all the identified risk factors that are specific to the context in which such violence occurs (Zwi et al. 1996). A survey study conducted by Butchart, Kruger, and Lekoba (2000), in which community perceptions of violence yielded qualitative information,provides an alternative means of gaining rich informationon the causes and possible prevention of violence. Thisinformation lends itself to analysis that may uncover the nuances and context specificities often overlooked by morebroadly based epidemiological studies. Burns, Falls, and Drowning Prevention The WHO (2002b) has provided the most comprehensive set of recommendations and guidelines for the preventionof burns, falls, and drowning to date. Although most of these prevention suggestions are formulated in relation to the Southeast Asia region, their generic applicability to otherLMICs cannot be underestimated. Country-specific factorsmust, however, be included in prevention strategies that take local risk factors and available resources into account. Country-specific studies should tailor these guidelines totheir local contexts; for example, studies in South Africasuggest that the unsafe use of paraffin is significantly associ-ated with burn injuries (Steenkamp, van der Merwe, andde Lange 2002). Paraffin management strategies must there-fore inform burn prevention strategies for the country. Recommendations for the prevention of burn injuries include the provision of stable lamps and stoves in LMIC contexts, effective training of personnel in evacuationprocesses following fires in the workplace, the installation offire and smoke alarms in public buildings, the regulation orelimination of dangerous fireworks, the greater use offlame-resistant fabrics, and the promotion of the use of coldwater in the treatment of burns at the tertiary preventionlevel (WHO 2002b). Falls could be best prevented through the use of accom- modating and soft materials, such as mud and sand, in thedesign of playgrounds; the provision and implementation ofsafety regulations for places in which children most fre-quently play; legislating for safer designs for fall-vulnerablestructures, such as railings and grab bars on balconies; andthe stimulation and encouragement of safer working tech-niques in the workplace (WHO 2002b). Measures for the prevention of drowning as recom- mended by the WHO (2002b) include the development of strategies to ensure safe water transport and commutation, the sensitization of policy makers to the benefits of life jack- ets and other flotation devices to the protection of children and other vulnerable users near water, and the provision ofadequate life protection services (in the form of adult super-vision or qualified life guards) for recreational swimmingtimes and places (WHO 2002b). CONCLUSION Violence and injury are salient and definitive threats to the health of African nations, and the globe. Consequently, theinclusion of violence and injury prevention curricula across the full spectrum of primary, secondary, and tertiary educa- tion platforms, as well as the training of African injuryprevention specialists, should be seen as vitally important.Fortunately, it appears as though these areas are receiving growing attention in some African countries. For instance, in a positive development, the WHO Injuries and ViolencePrevention Department collaborates with Mozambicancounterparts to enhance the safety and security ofMozambique's 20 million people. The Mozambique Project,as a national action plan, includes the development ofnational violence prevention policies, the detailed country- wide analysis of injuries, the development of a network ofprevention practitioners through training and awarenesscampaigns, and an initiative aimed at controlling the supplyand distribution of small arms. Perhaps the most powerfulillustration of the recent prioritization of injury preventionand safety promotion for combating the devastating socialand economic effects of injuries and violence on the Africancontinent is embodied by a resolution passed by the heads ofstates of the African Union (signed in Maputo in 2003). Theresolution declared 2005 the African Y ear of ViolencePrevention and endorsed the nine recommendations of the World Report on Violence and Health (WHO 2002a), which urged states to implement multisectoral national plans of action to limit injury and violence and to enhance datacollection systems. In South Africa, the presidential Lead Programme on Crime, Violence and Injury is focused on the development of injury surveillance methods; good practices for theprevention, control, and management of injuries; the Violence and Injuries | 371implementation of injury prevention strategies through training; the strengthening of current bottom-up and top- down initiatives; and the stimulation of prevention policies. A major focus of the program is to chart the contextual,social, process, and content factors that influence data uptakeand the stimulation of prevention policies and practices(Seedat 2002). Injury prevention may thrive while a national program focuses on developing systems to record the magnitude andrisks of injuries, evaluating and documenting promisingand effective practices, stimulating the wide-scale imple- mentation of these practices, and encouraging the develop- ment of evidence-led policies and associated fundingdecisions. T o ensure the long-term development of the injury and violence prevention sector in Africa, however,intersectoral and multidisciplinary collaboration, technicalcooperation, and partnerships between government andcivil society are vital.

The potential impact of HIV/AIDS was anticipated in that year, but the current volume documents the depth and breadth of the burden that epidemic is inflicting on Africa. Updates to the data on morbidity and mortal- ity from 1990 to 2004 are put into context with discussions also of the conflicts and wars, the famines and droughts, the migration of human resources, and the global economic downturn that have affectedthe health of the population in the region. The goal of this second edition remains the same as that of the first: to provide policy makers with a comprehensive resource of high-quality information on the nature and extent of health problems in Sub-Saharan Africa and the health care strategies that show the most promise. Good data do not ensure gooddecisions, well-designed programs, or effective implementation, but they are a necessary first step. This volume reflects the growth in technical capacity for data collection and analysis of health statistics since 1991. Many new sources of health and demographic information have become available as aresult of unprecedented international interest in health conditions in Sub-Saharan Africa. TheMillennium Development Goals, described in the Millennium Declaration signed by 189 countries in2000, focused the world's attention on specific targets\u2014including health outcomes\u2014and deadlines toreduce global poverty. The year 2015, the deadline for achieving the three major health goals, is justaround the corner. Sub-Saharan Africa is not on track to reach any of the public health Millennium Development Goals. HIV/AIDS has taken its toll, leading to a stalling or a reversal of the gains made in health indicators,including infant and under-five mortality rates and life expectancy at birth. The epidemic has not onlyincreased the spread of communicable disorders\u2014such as tuberculosis, malaria, respiratory tractinfections, and diarrhea\u2014but has also affected the epidemiology of cancers, such as Karposi's sarco-ma, mental health disorders, such as depression, and neurological disorders, such as dementia. Not all trends have been negative. Uganda has seen a decrease in the prevalence of HIV/AIDS within its borders, southern Africa has virtually eliminated measles mortality, and across Africa onchocerciasis control improved greatly during the 1990s. But the continued success of such efforts depends on both themonitoring of disease indicators and the effectiveness of programs to address them. The year 2015 loomsand presents a large challenge, so high priority must be given to the continuing improvement of diseasesurveillance, the timely sharing of public health information, and wise policy decisions. This book will be an invaluable resource to those working in the health sector\u2014in epidemiology, pub- lic health, population and reproductive health, and health policy\u2014whether in government, research,academia, "}
