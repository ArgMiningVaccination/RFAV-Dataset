However, additional Omicron sublineages have appeared, and the link between sgRNA and prior immunity derived by vaccination or infection has not yet been established. For the current study, sgRNA was quantified by rRT-PCR in 246 clinical samples from symptomatic patients collected before the rollout of the bivalent Omicron booster and 94 clinical samples collected after the rollout. sgRNA was found to correlate with total viral RNA. Similar relative sgRNA abundance was demonstrated among Omicron sublineages, individuals from differing vaccination strata, individuals with and without previous COVID infection, and individuals with and without the bivalent booster. Thus, sgRNA detection can identify individuals with active viral replication regardless of sublineage or vaccination status. These data are consistent with current guidance on isolation for symptomatic individuals and indicate that prior immunity may not play a role in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission in breakthrough infections. Participants may have been immunologically imprinted with ancestral variants, and the concept of the original antigenic sin should be explored further in relation to SARS-CoV-2.
