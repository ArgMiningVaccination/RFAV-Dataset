Oudin, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, D epartment of Biomedical Engineering, Tufts University Location: Remote via Zoom Nutrition Obesity Research Centers Initiative to Advance the Careers of Researchers from Groups Underrepresented in Academia (URiA) The Nutrition Obesity Research Centers (NORCs), supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), will launch an initiative in the Fall of 2020 to identify the barriers and challenges to success of scientists from URiA groups and to identify actionable strategies to overcome these challenges. The g oal will be to provide specific recommendations to improve equity and inclusion for the NORCs, NORC -associated institutional leadership, and scientific societies such as the American Society for Nutrition (ASN) and The Obesity Society (TOS). The initiative will be initially delivered virtually with the agenda consisting of presentations by leading experts, followed by small group discussions. Speakers will identify challenges, solutions, opportunities, and future needs for successful recruitment, retention, and advancement for researchers from groups underrepresented in academia. All sessions will be recorded and widely distributed through NORCs, NIDDK, the American Society of Nutrition, The Obesity Society, and other interested groups. Please see the link below for additional details including the schedule of sessions .

BN ORC's Pilot and Feasibility Program provides funding on a competitive basis for new investigators who are transitioning to an independent line of research or established investigators with novel ideas in the area of nutrition and obesity research. Applica tions that address the themes of the Center will be given higher priority. These themes are: 1) Nutrient Metabolism in Health and Disease, 2) Brain Control of Feeding Behavior and Metabolism, and 3) Environmental and Genetic Influences on Obesity and Related Chronic Diseases. How to Apply: The first step in the application process is the submission of a letter of intent, one- page proposal summary, NIH biosketch and letter from mentor (required for MD and PhD fellows and senior postdoctoral fellows only). These materials must be submitted via the Center's website as a single PDF file no later than September 1. Full proposals (by invitation only) will be due October 22. Adipose Seminar Series 2020 -2021 Virtual Series Fall 2020 The Adipose Seminar Series sponsored by the Adipose Tissue Biology and Nutrient Metabolism Core (ABM) of the Boston Nutrition Obesity Research Center is currently planning the Adipose Seminar Series for the 2020 -2021 academic year. The series will begin in September and will be held remotely via Zoom . Please contact Valentina Perissi ( vperissi@bu.edu) and/or Katie Harper ( kharp@bu.edu ) if you are interested in presenting and/or would like to be added to the distribution list for this series.

These include diabetes and other metabolic diseases, obesity, and endocrine, digestive, liver, pancreas, kidney, urological, and hematologic tissues and diseases. The application cycle for this funding opportunity opens on November 16, 2020 and closes on D ecember 16, 2020. Please click here for instructions on how to apply. New NIDDK R01 Program Announcement for Small R01s to Conduct P&F Clinical Trials NIDDK has changed our approach for pilot and feasibility clinical trial applications. As an alternative to R21s, we now have R01s (3 years; $200,000 DC/year) to conduct clinical trials in humans to acquire preliminary data regarding the effects of the intervention as well as feasibility data related to recruitment and retention and study conduct. The PA clearly states that preliminary data is not required, and anyone submitting an application is encouraged to refer to the PA in their specific aims page and indicate that preliminary data is not required for this PA. Note that this is a NIDDK-specific PA, and it is limited to clinical trials, not clinical studies. Now that we have this FOA, we will be terminating our NIDDK -specific clinical trial R21 PAs. BNORC Small Grants Program Do you need some preliminary data that can be obtained using one of the Center's four Cores for a grant application? The BNORC Small Grants Program provides funds up to $3,000 (direct co sts only) to offset BNORC Core use. The timeline from application to award is 1-2 weeks.
