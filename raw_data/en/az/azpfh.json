If you keep feeling that you have suffered needlessly in this life, then this is by itself causing you more anguish. The beauty of spiritual healing is that it slowly gets you to understand your life from a higher perspective, especially when you start communicating with spirits. Your spirit guides and angels can become a great blessing in your life once you learn some spiritual healing. At the age of thirty, I went to the Alps. It was just a crazy inspiration I got out of nowhere that I needed to spend a decent time in nature, so I went to the Austrian Alps and spent the whole month of August there. I was alone, wandering the entire day, sleeping under a tree at night, and discovering phenomenal sceneries every few hours. The importance of that trip to me was that I went as an atheist and came back as a spiritualist. Long story short, I spoke to God at a certain point during that trip and I saw God once during the night. It was the most life-changing experience of my whole life. My spiritual journey was initiated from that point on. I first needed to make sense of my paranormal experiences, then over several years to understand what my life is about, how to communicate with spirits, and why we live. And what happens after death? It was not an easy journey. I endured some of the most emotionally loaded years during my early thirties, but it was quite rewarding, and I eventually knew that I was blessed to have gone on this path and undergone all that. My life has become meaningful, easy, and happy ever after. And this happiness is not the kind of adrenaline buzz that comes after winning the lottery, but a knowledgeable kind of happiness that comes from knowing that life is always with me and never against me and that my spirit guides, angels, and God are always loving me. The proof is through bona fide experience and communication with spirits. And yes, I have seen spirits often enough to know that they are real and have felt their love intensely enough to leave a permanent impression in my consciousness until the end of my life. Let me tell you how it all happened. It started with a chance encounter with a Reiki master from Mexico. He was in his 50's and he didn't practice Reiki professionally, but he showed me something amazing. He showed me how energy flowed out of his hands and how I could feel it with my own. I was fascinated and curious. I wanted to learn how to do that too, so I started practicing. I discovered that if I held my hands in front of me at a certain distance, they would start to tickle each other, as if they were sending subtle vibrational electric waves to each other. Of course, I had to be in a focused and relaxed state to feel this. Around the same time, I noticed something else. Many people from different walks of life were telling me that I might be a healer or have the potential to be one. This was a strange idea for me. I didn't even know what a healer was, let alone how to become one. But I was intrigued by the idea, especially after hearing it from so many sources. I felt like there was something more to this than just coincidence. I felt like there was a calling for me to explore this path. But I still needed to meet a professional healer and see what it was all about. The opportunity came in 2005, when I heard about a \"spiritual fair\" that was happening in a nearby town. I don't know if these events are still popular, but back then they were quite a big deal. They attracted a lot of people who were interested in alternative healing, psychic readings, and other spiritual topics. They also featured some cutting-edge technology that claimed to measure or enhance your health and well-being, such as microscopes that showed your blood cells, machines that took pictures of your aura, and so on. I was curious about all of these things, but I had limited time and money, so I had to choose wisely. I decided to go for an hour of spiritual healing by a renowned healer that I had read about online. The internet was still relatively new back then, and we didn't have social media or blogs or podcasts like we do now. Most of the information online came from small business websites that advertised their services or products. This healer had one of those websites, and he seemed to have a lot of testimonials and credentials. I went to his booth and he greeted me warmly. He told me that he would invite his \"spirit technician\" to work on my energy body or auric field. He said that this spirit technician would perform something like surgery on me, but without any physical tools or incisions. He said that this would heal any issues or imbalances that I might have in my energy system. He said that all I had to do was sit on a chair and relax. I was skeptical but curious. I agreed to try it out and see what would happen. As soon as he placed his hands on my shoulders and called upon his spirit technician, something in my mind went boom! It was like I was instantly transported to another state of consciousness that I had never experienced before. It was like a trance, but more intense and vivid. I could feel everything that was happening in my body, but not in a physical way. It was more like an energetic sensation that moved across different parts of me as the healer directed his spirit technician to work on them. It was amazing! The hour flew by like it was only three minutes. There was so much going on and so much to witness. The healer also gave me some feedback as he worked on me. He told me things that he sensed or picked up from my energy field, such as the fact that I needed to drink more water because my body was dehydrated. I didn't believe him at first because I didn't think dehydration was a big deal for me. But then he repeated the message again, saying that his spirit technician insisted on telling me this for some reason that he didn't understand. That's when I realized that he wasn't making this up. He was actually communicating with a spirit who could read my mind and knew what I needed better than I did. That blew my mind even more than the healing itself. I left the fair feeling more than satisfied with what I had experienced. Spiritual healing was real, and so were spirits. It wasn't a fantasy or a placebo; it was as real as the floor I was walking on. Spirits existed, and they could help us heal and grow in ways that we couldn't imagine. I still didn't know much about them or how they worked, but I knew they were there and they cared about me. That alone changed my life forever. That year was the most interesting year of my life. I was on a quest to learn and experience as much as I could about healing, both for myself and others. I spent all my money on visiting different healers and learning from them. I learned how to invite spirits to heal me and how to do spiritual healing on others. I even got to see spirits with my own eyes a few times. And let me tell you, it was not scary at all. It was the opposite of scary. It was amazing, exciting, intriguing, refreshing, reassuring, loving, blissful, and informative. It was nothing like the horror stories that some people tell about the spirit world and spiritual experiences. I realized that those stories were based on fear and ignorance, not on reality. I realized that the spirit world was not something to be afraid of, but something to be grateful for and connected with. I also explored many other types of spiritual healing modalities that were available to me. I noticed that they had different methods and philosophies, but they all used the spirit world in some way. Reiki, for example, was one of the modalities that I learned extensively. It taught me how to channel universal life force energy through my hands and into myself or others. Crystal healing was another modality that fascinated me. It taught me how to use the natural vibrations of crystals to enhance the healing process, especially when combined with spiritual energies. I also learned some of Barbara Brennen's healing methods by reading her book and practicing on people who agreed to let me try them out. She taught me how to work with the human energy field and its different layers and aspects. I enjoyed learning and practicing all these modalities, but after a couple of years, I started to feel that something was missing. I realized that spiritual-energy healing was not enough by itself. It could do some good things on the energy level, such as creating deep relaxation, clearing blockages, or balancing chakras, but it didn't seem to have much effect on the physical, mental, or emotional level. It didn't address the root causes of the problems or the patterns that created them. It didn't help me or others to heal fully and permanently. I felt that there was more to healing than just working with energy. That's when the universe brought me new teachers and new lessons. They taught me about emotional healing and how to deal with the feelings and beliefs that were holding me back from being happy and healthy. They taught me how to release negative emotions, forgive myself and others, love myself unconditionally, and create positive affirmations. They taught me how to heal my inner child, my wounded self, and my shadow self. But emotional healing was not enough either. There were still other factors that affected my well-being and that of others. That's when the universe brought me more teachers and more lessons. They taught me about diet, intermittent fasting, yoga, exercise, lifestyle, and other things that influenced my physical health and vitality. They taught me how to nourish my body with wholesome foods, cleanse my system with fasting, stretch and strengthen my muscles with yoga, boost my metabolism with exercise, and create a balanced and harmonious lifestyle. That's how the universe guided me on this amazing journey of healing. It brought me everything I needed at the right time and in the right way. I didn't plan it or expect it; it just happened naturally and beautifully. And I'm so grateful for it. Conclusion: I'm not saying that spiritual healing is the only way to heal or that you should ignore other forms of healing, such as medical treatment. I'm saying that spiritual healing has its own value and significance, especially since it can make your healing journey more enjoyable and meaningful. It can help you to realize that there is a loving and caring power beyond our physical reality, and that this power is always there for you. This can make a huge difference in your well-being. It can give you hope, comfort, guidance, and inspiration. It can help you to cope with any challenges or difficulties that you might face in life. The spirit world is real, and you can experience it for yourself if you are open-minded and willing to look for the evidence. Don't expect it to be exactly like what other people tell you or what you see in movies or books. The spirit world is not a fixed or uniform place; it is a dynamic and diverse realm that adapts to your level of understanding and perception. The spirit world will come to you in the best way that you can relate to and learn from. For example, you might encounter spirits in your dreams, where they can appear as teachers, wise men, women, or even animals. They can give you messages, lessons, or insights that can help you in your waking life. Or you might encounter spirits in your meditation, where they can appear as lights, colors, sounds, or sensations. They can give you healing, peace, joy, or bliss that can uplift your energy and mood. Of course, for some people, spirituality is connected to religion and beliefs that they grew up with or adopted later in life. And that's okay too. The spirit world will respect your beliefs and come to you in the form that you are most familiar with and comfortable with \u2014 Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, White Light, etc. The spirit world is not limited by any labels or names; it is universal and inclusive. Spiritual healing is not a new or exotic concept; it is an ancient and natural one. Our ancestors have used it for thousands of years, and many cultures and traditions still use it today. And we still need it too, because we are more than just physical bodies; we are also emotional, mental, and spiritual beings. We cannot heal ourselves fully by just focusing on one aspect of ourselves; we need to address all aspects of ourselves. That's why I invite you to explore spiritual healing and see what it can do for you. You might be surprised by how much it can enrich your life and enhance "}
