Vision Dental Life Insurance Medicare Supplements Director's Corner LW n this issue, we highlight the outstanding and never-ending work of those in the Consumer Protection Division (CPD) of the Nebraska State Attorney General's Office as they continue to fight against what the National Council on Aging considers \"the crime of the 21st century\" - scams and fraud targeting our older population. Division Chief Meghan Stoppel, Mediation Center Supervisor Kevin Bollinger and Outreach Coordinator Ryan Sothan are working hard to protect older adults from all kinds of elder fraud - from Medicare/health insurance scams to telemarketing/phone scams, to investment schemes and \"the grandparent scam.\" The CPD has seen it all before, but they need your continuing help in the ongoing fight. \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\" is how the old saying goes. This holds true in how the CPD goes about trying to thwart scammers. Educational or preventive measures can be credited for as much as 80 percent of the success in keeping seniors safe by helping them recognize and avoid fraud compared to after-the- fact prosecution and enforcement measures, which succeed generally 20 percent of the time. Stay educated, stay informed and help the CPD prevent senior fraud and \"Protect the Good Life\" in Nebraska. The CPD's senior hotline and mediation center are great tools that can work for you when you are committed to \"report, report, report!\" For more information, visit ProtectTheGoodLife.Nebraska.gov or call 402-471-2682 or 800-727- 6432.

It also seeks to ensure fair competition between businesses, and is responsible for oversight of charitable assets and entities. The division accomplishes this through consumer education, mediation of consumer complaints and enforcement. More importantly, the office works for the public, especially when it comes to fraud and scam education. There's no cost to the public for the division's services or education. \"Our time, travel and expenses are taken care of,\" Sothan said. \"We can even help educate on evenings and weekends, too. Don't be shy in asking for an educator to discuss how to reduce and narrow exposure to scams.\" Division Chief Meghan Stoppel said, \"Our consumer education tools are the most powerful weapon we have as they help keep individuals from falling victim to frauds and scams.\" Education is essential to effectively shut down scams and ensure potential victims don't take the bait. Accounting for nearly 25 percent of Nebraska's complaints filed with the Federal Trade Commission, which includes data provided by the Attorney General, imposter scams involve a caller telling a story with a sense of urgency and authority. For example, the callers may note that they're with a law enforcement agency and say that you're in trouble and need to make an immediate payment over the phone. Similar scams state that your grandchild needs money to get out of trouble, or requests that you provide your Social Security number for a Medicare issue. \"If you didn't originate the call, don't give out your information,\" Sothan said. \"Hang up, call the agency or your grandchild and confirm the information is correct. You can't rely on caller ID either, as scammers can spoof it to appear as whatever they want.\" Information on specific types of scams and fraud for seniors can be found at ProtectTheGoodLife. nebraska.gov/protecting-nebraskas- seniors. You also can find more information about identity theft, stopping unwanted calls and more resources at protectthegoodlife. nebraska.gov/resources. The best thing you can do is educate yourself and your friends about how to identify a scam. The second is to report it. Importance of Reporting Scams When it comes to reporting scams, seniors can help! \"The biggest problem we have nationally is that seniors are the least likely to report that they've been scammed,\" Sothan said. \"Our seniors make up about 20 percent of the state population, but 37 percent of our complaints. Seniors being scammed and reporting is disproportionate to their actual population.\" Another report suggests that seniors are twice as likely to be targeted by a scammer. \"We want seniors to report, report, report,\" Sothan said. \"Don't let an offense go unreported. Let us Staying Involved Consumer Protection Here for You: Helping Nebraskans Against Fraud W Helping Nebraskans Against Fraud Imposter Scams About 1 in 10 people lost money $667 million reported lost $700 median lossLiving Well | 5know what's going on in your lives so we can help.\" While many might feel fear or shame of being scammed, there's no judgment, and the data helps the greater good. Reports to the Consumer Protection Division help the Attorney General monitor trends related to scams. \"We merge our complaint data into the federal database to see the trends and how often they're occurring,\" Stoppel said. This data also is used to educate consumers, making it more difficult for scammers to get money from others. \"When you report, you help increase the likelihood of bringing legal enforcement action, if necessary,\" Stoppel said. \"Without data, we wouldn't be able to work with local and national lawmakers or other law enforcement agencies to create regulatory standards and industry accountability.\" Consumers can report scams or fraud at protectthegoodlife. nebraska.gov or 800-727-6432. Be sure to include as much information as possible, including any written documentation such as emails, transactions or receipts. \"It's important to report what you can so we can aggregate data with other consumers,\" Stoppel said. \"This enables us to identify patterns and see if we have information to investigate further. Anything the consumer can provide is better than nothing.\" Along with reporting, you can contact the Consumer Protection Division if you receive something suspicious. A recent example involves a person who received a bill from a West Coast cable company, although the recipient had never lived there. \"There's a chance their personal information was stolen and used to open a phone, utility, internet or cable account,\" Sothan said. \"We educated the consumer on how to file a complaint and report identity theft so we can get involved and help have the charges removed.\" The Mediation Center The Consumer Protection's Mediation Center handles up to 10,000 calls annually related to mediation, complaints and scam reports. The center helps facilitate voluntary consumer and business mediation related to unfair, unconscionable and deceptive trade practices. Once mediation is requested, a letter is sent to the business and the paper-driven process begins the resolution process. Through the Mediation Center's efforts, it has in years past returned up to $1.5 million to taxpayers annually. The center also provides education when consumers call in to report scams and suspicious emails, and it can help identify if something is legitimate. Here for You The Consumer Protection Division was created for you. \"We want seniors to feel comfortable reporting an issue,\" Sothan said. \"We want to connect them to their state government. We're available, caring and concerned, and want to prevent their exploitation.\" For more information on the Consumer Protection Division, visit protectthegoodlife.nebraska.gov.

Leadership Lincoln has been developing strong leaders for a stronger Lincoln for 35 years. In 1985, a group of community-minded leaders founded the independent organization to create a pool of well-trained, informed and connected individuals. Leadership Lincoln now engages individuals from diverse backgrounds and provides them with knowledge, experience, skills and tools to help them become more effective community leaders. As the state's largest leadership program and one of the largest in the nation, participants come from Lincoln's leading businesses, government agencies, nonprofit organizations and Lancaster County high schools to join one of four cohorts: Fellows, Executives, Youth or Advocates. Leadership Lincoln's Cohorts Fellows: The original cohort program, Fellows, consists of individuals who desire to learn about different leadership opportunities and gain various industrial insights. The group ranges from young professionals to retirees. Over the course of nine months, Fellows participate in retreats and other seminars covering subjects such as education, health care, government and goal setting. \"Big things have come out of this group,\" said Brendan Evans, interim executive director. Projects resulting from Fellows include the \"Just Ask\" Volunteer Fair, which connects retirees with volunteer opportunities, and the MyLNK app, which directs citizens to current, local resources, as well as encourages them to participate in Meals on Wheels deliveries when volunteers are scarce. Executives: The Executives cohort is comprised of individuals from various nonprofits, organizations and businesses who bring experience, responsibility, influence and willingness to tackle certain community issues. \"We help them network and see where they fit in Lincoln,\" Evans said. \"So when they want to pick up the phone and get something done, they know who to call for assistance.\" Advocates: Originally known as \"Project ALL,\" the Advocates cohort includes participants from diverse backgrounds and advocates for underrepresented individuals. This group continues to be sponsored by various community organizations, and focuses on advocating for communities, diversity and inclusivity. Youth: In its 23rd year, Leadership Lincoln's Youth cohort is comprised of Lancaster County high school sophomores and juniors who are interested in civic service, including working with a charitable foundation. What Do Cohorts Do? Cohorts work within their group \u2014 and occasionally with the other groups \u2014 to focus on community-relevant themes where they can make a positive impact. They connect with leaders in business, government, public safety, education and human services, and bring people together who wouldn't normally interact, according to Evans. ILiving Well | 7Building Leaders, Strengthening Community: Leadership Lincoln Celebrates 35 Years \"Networking sets Lincoln apart,\" Evans said. \"We have great parks, arts organizations, food security and safety in Lincoln partly because we have a good organization that helps the people who are passionately driving these community projects to network and accomplish their goals.\" After living in several cities, Evans saw Leadership Lincoln's impact when he returned to the Star City. \"When I moved back, I gained a better understanding of the quiet yet big way Leadership Lincoln impacts our community,\" he said. \"The group engages people and helps them understand how to create a network to get things done.\" Throughout the year, Leadership Lincoln holds combined program days, inviting Fellows, Executives and Advocate cohort members to come together and create opportunities.

Looking Forward Leadership Lincoln currently boasts about 3,700 alumni and many community projects and connections. \"There is probably a Leadership Lincoln alumni in every major employer or nonprofit in Lincoln,\" Evans said. Beyond the numbers, it's about the connections that help foster a better community. The group estimates its alumni performed more than 160,000 hours of community service last year, an estimated benefit of more than $3.5 million. \"We've appreciated the community's support for the last 35 years,\" Evans said. \"Now we plan to serve Lincoln and engage others to make our community even better.\" Participation in each cohort is limited. Costs vary, but payment plans and scholarships are available. To learn more about Leadership Lincoln, visit LeadershipLincoln.org or Facebook.com/LeaderLNK.

She just couldn't remember the song's title. \"She started humming it, and eventually was able to tell me some of the words,\" said Jen Wolf-Wubbels, Averil's granddaughter. With that information, Wolf- Wubbels searched for the lyrics to identify the song. She then pulled a song up on her phone for her grandmother to listen. \"The smile of joy on her face was amazing,\" said Wolf-Wubbels, knowing immediately she found the right song her grandmother was talking about. \"And then she could fill in more of the broken story, because the song brought back more of the memory.\" This situation exemplifies how music can transport people back in time. And it should be no surprise that music may have the same effect on individuals with dementia. Southlake Village Rehabilitation & Care Center was recently approached by Brown University researchers to participate in the Music & Memory study. The study cites how music is deeply rooted in our conscious and unconscious. It looks to determine if music therefore can be used to awaken the brain's functioning and memories associated with familiar songs for those who struggle due to dementia, Alzheimer's and other types of cognitive loss. Since summer 2019, Southlake has provided participants with personalized playlists, helping them reconnect with the world through music-inspired memories. And Southlake resident Averil is among the 17 resident participants enrolled in the Music & Memory program. Determining Participants Southlake residents are evaluated to determine if the program could be helpful to them. \"We look for individuals with dementia and have what we call 'out- of-character responses,'\" said Gayle Resh, life enrichment coordinator, MA, CTRS, CPRP . \"They are behaving in a way, prior to their dementia, they would not have done \u2014 physical or cognitive restlessness, something that indicates they are not at peace with themselves.\" According to Resh, the selected individuals should benefit from the reminiscent aspect of \"memory bump\" music, or music during their late childhood/early adult years. \"We are looking back to the music that was popular when they were 13 to 27,\" Resh said, noting that's where deep memories are encoded. The team interviews the individual and family members to determine the right songs that are important to the participant. Playing a variety of music, the team looks for responses, both verbal and nonverbal, such as smiles, nodding, shifting shoulders, toe tapping or fingers swaying. Once a few songs elicit a response, they begin pulling from the same time period, style and artists to create a playlist of about 150 songs to put on the participant's own iPod. \"Some might have more than one playlist,\" Resh said. \"They might have one that is upbeat to get them going in the morning, and one that is calming and soothing before bedtime.\" Songs can be added or removed anytime, and residents can listen whenever they want. Staff disinfect the device and headphones during charging. Musical Impact Some Southlake participants have shown a decrease of out-of- character responses and clear visible enjoyment. Nationwide, the program has seen a decrease in the use of psychotropic medications. \"Medicines are not used to manage dementia, but the symptoms,\" Resh said. \"Through Music & Memory, I don't have to give a pill that can increase the chance of the person falling or other things.\" This method provides a calmer environment, enhances engagement and socialization and reduces agitation. The overall process for each resident is labor intensive, taking about 10-15 hours. The program comes at no cost for participants or Southlake, other than occasionally purchasing music. The equipment was provided for free by the study organizers. Southlake would like to provide anyone in the facility the opportunity to use Music & Memory and will gladly accept donations of CDs, iPods/ MP3 players or iTunes gift cards. Averil listens to music through the Music & Memory program at Southlake Village Rehabilitation & Care Center.A10 | Living Well Outdoor Fitness-Focused Gym for Adults incoln will soon be the site of the state's first FitLot thanks to AARP . A FitLot is an outdoor fitness park that's free and accessible to the public. The equipment, including an elliptical and pull-up bars, is designed to use one's own body weight as resistance. Due to its central location, the FitLot will be installed in Lincoln's Woods Park at 33rd and \"O\" streets. Woods Park also boasts on-site parking and trail accessibility, and is close to low- and moderate-income and senior populations. Parks officials hope to install the station by the picnic shelter and playground area. The idea is to be close to the playground so there are good lines of vision between the two facilities but with enough separation to deter children from unintentionally interfering with people using the exercise equipment, according to J.J. Yost, Lincoln Parks & Recreation facilities manager. Construction began June 1 with a ribbon cutting tentatively scheduled for July 24. AARP plans to gift the fitness station and donate funds to help Lincoln Parks & Recreation staff three years of programming. While this is Lincoln's first FitLot, the City recently has installed multiuse fitness equipment during neighborhood park renovations. The single multipurpose units are close to playgrounds to encourage multigenerational use. To date, equipment has been installed at Seacrest, Lintel and Cripple Creek parks, and will soon include Cooper Park. Regular exercise helps delay, prevent or manage chronic illness. AARP officials hope to build a FitLot in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.AARP will install a FitLot in Woods Park for citizens to utilize.

Mike Roth: President Living WellPlanning Ahead CAging Partners Here to Serve in Uncertain Times OVID-19 has caused people to re-evaluate how they live. Cities and state governments are looking at how best to protect the vulnerable and deter the virus from spreading. Meanwhile, Aging Partners strives to adapt while continuing to provide much-needed services for those age 60 and over. \"Our immediate concern was for those who rely on us for daily meals through our senior centers,\" Director Randall Jones said. Because congregate settings have caused the virus to spread, Aging Partners closed senior centers and began enhancing a home-delivered meal program. \"Those persons who regularly attended our senior centers began receiving home-delivered meals shortly after we closed,\" Jones said. Through a partnership with Tabitha Health Care Services, Aging Partners provided funding to assist Tabitha with the increase in meals to deliver through Meals on Wheels to Lincoln and Lancaster County residents who requested the service. \"It's a comfort for folks to know that food is going to arrive, and the service reduces their need to go out in the public,\" Jones said While many stores adopted \"senior or at-risk shopping hours\" it is still a challenge for some older adults to go out and obtain needed supplies \u2014 so NeighborLNK was born. NeighborLNK connects volunteers with homebound seniors or persons with a disability. The volunteers help with errands such as picking up groceries, medications, or library books and reduce isolation through checking in via phone or video call. \"We hope through these partnerships between the volunteers and the seniors or persons with disabilities that we are forming new relationships and a support system for the future,\" Jones said. Isolation Another consideration for Aging Partners' clientele is isolation. With seniors potentially Living Well | 13ALLO has been connecting families in Nebraska since 2003.

For many, this has reduced support systems they have depended upon. Isolation stands as a major concern for those who are homebound and living alone. About 90 percent of Aging Partners staff began working from home in April, but that didn't stop them from reaching out. \"Care managers and service coordinators have reached out to hundreds of clients weekly to ensure their services were being continued and they were able to address any new needs that developed,\" Jones said. Aging Partners also launched a new program to further support older adults. Sunshine Kids for Seniors coordinates efforts to provide letters or artwork from children in the community to seniors, who smile with gratitude for the gesture. The art and letters are delivered when individuals receive their home-delivered meals. \"It has been great to see the smiles this created, and people look forward each day to receiving the pieces of art,\" Jones said. \"In fact, we're seeing people hang them in their windows or on the wall.\" To keep seniors active in their homes, Aging Partners also has increased health and fitness classes showing on LNK-TV. The Rural Transit System has continued operations with precautions, which many seniors outside of Lincoln rely upon as their transportation to doctors appointments or the grocery store. Moving Forward \"Our staff is planning to sustain the services we are doing and provide them in a way that is the safest for our population,\" Jones said. \"Even as some of the community opens, we will determine how we want Continued on page 14.14 | Living Wellto respond in collaboration and with guidance from the Health Department. Eventually, we will provide services like in the past, but we are going to be very cautious.\" The Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department (LLCHD) began watching the virus movement in China in January. Local planning and preparation began in February before Lincoln Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird declared a state of emergency March 16. LLCHD began working with Lincoln Fire & Rescue, Lincoln Police Department and Lincoln Transportation and Utilities to create a unified command with planning and coordination of the response in the short and long term. Health care workers \u2014 such as those working in hospitals, clinics and pharmacies \u2014 quickly acted to protect themselves and the community in need of medical services. Restaurants and grocery stores took precautions to continue providing service amid shortages and restrictions. Community members have stepped up, too by making masks, donating PPE for health care workers and working together to help public health efforts. Jones, who spent many years working for the American Red Cross in disaster response, said he has never seen anything like this. \"Every household across the country has been affected in some way,\" he said. \"Every person has been affected. I think this experience will have a long-lasting impact. I hope in many ways there are positive impacts and lessons we've learned from this event.\" Now more than ever, we should value our support systems, friendships and family, and the need to care for one another. \"We've seen a remarkable response from those in the community and their willingness to help one another,\" Jones said. \"We've formed new relationships and support systems. I think those will have long-lasting, positive impacts on our community.\" No matter how long this pandemic lasts, let's continue supporting one another to make a better tomorrow.Aging Partners Here to Serve in Uncertain Times Continued from page 13. LW 9401 Ander matt 20th Street (402) 475-6791 | sumnerplacecare.com Living Well | 15ARecognizing and Combating Malicious Emails By Jeremy Hoshor, Aging Partners system specialist lthough electronic communication has evolved over the past decade, email continues to be a staple method, especially with important information. However, criminals are also aware of this and attempt to use email to their advantage to scam people from their hard-earned money. Unfortunately, older adults are targeted more frequently with these tactics. These attempts to scam have become more and more sophisticated and potentially more dangerous. This article focuses specifically on tips to identify these types of malicious emails and how to respond. It has become increasingly important to analyze emails with a higher level of scrutiny than ever before. A good place to start is to simply ask yourself a couple questions regarding the email: Do I know the sender and was I expecting an email from them? Is there a good reason the email would have a link or attachment associated with it? It is estimated that about two- thirds of all malware (i.e., viruses, spyware and ransomware) originates from an email attachment. Coupled with malware installed from hyperlinks within emails, the overwhelming majority comes from these two methods. Although email systems are designed to block such emails from reaching your inbox, the barrage of sophisticated attempts leads to some making it through. For the novice user, a good rule of thumb is to avoid opening any attachments or hyperlinks in emails, especially if you are unaware of the sender or not expecting an email from them. Even with those two boxes checked, if there is any question, it's advisable to look for clues that may show deviation from validity. A good place to start is to analyze the \"From\" address. If you don't know the sender or weren't expecting an email from that sender, you should already be skeptical. Further analysis of the sender email address can reveal clues as to whether it truly originates from whom it appears, or if it is a phishing email. The important part of the \"From\" address is the domain, which is the section that comes after (to the right of) the '@' symbol. If the domain is misspelled or contains additional characters or numbers, or does not contain a legitimate company name, there is a good chance you are dealing with a phishing email. After you analyze the \"From\" address and are still unsure about the email, start by looking at the message. Typos and strange wording are giveaways. Also, if the email is promising a gift or threatening you, it is probably not legitimate. As mentioned earlier, emails containing hyperlinks or attachments should be avoided if there is any question. However, for the more advanced user, you can hover over (do NOT click!) the link to reveal additional information about it. When hovering over the link, the actual destination address shows in a bar at the bottom of your web browser. If, for example, you are expecting an email from your local power company, you would expect that what shows up in that bar would have the name of that company. If it does not, that is a red flag. After you've done all the work and analysis and have determined the email to be spam or malicious, what do you do now? In most cases, simply deleting the email is the best choice. You can add it to the \"junk\" or \"block\" list if your email system has that capability, but many times it's largely ineffective due to Continued on page 16.16 | Living Well Stephanie Swerczek Licensed Independent Sales Representative Retiring soon?

Aging is a continual progression of life. Reaching a higher number doesn't make us any less valuable or less able to contribute to society, but it does give us the opportunity to see the world in a new way. \"We have to approach aging adults for who they are and not what we think they should be,\" said Julie Masters, University of Nebraska Omaha Professor and Department of Gerontology chair. \"We have deliberately made older people alike for our convenience, but we need to step back and allow them to flourish and be who they are.\" With less than 5 percent of the senior population residing in nursing homes, many older adults have the opportunity to give back in various ways throughout the community, but there are many myths holding them back from achieving their full potential. Myth: Aging is Meaningless Age is just a number. Being older means you have more experience, knowledge and wisdom to impart to future generations. There is no age that makes you less capable of giving back. \"We need to see aging as an opportunity to give back, rather than just to take,\" Masters said. \"Some think older adults aren't able to contribute, but we need elders to see not only what's in it for them, but how they can give back to help society.\" Aging adults can positively impact the world for future generations. \"We need them now more than ever to be able to find the strength and resilience to get through this time of uncertainty,\" Masters said. \"Older adults bring a lot more to the table in terms of our understanding about life and what it means.\" Myth: It's Not OK to Think About the Future As we age, it's important to remember aging is a process and it's OK to age with intention. \"Our last breath is truly as important as our first,\" Masters said. \"We should all think about what we want our last days of life to be like.\" Everyone should consider how they want to live their life and what type of care they'd like to receive if necessary.

How you take care of your body, even now if you haven't done so in the past, can help you extend your life expectancy.

Summer Special22 | Living WellBeing Well Support Groups Help Caregiver Mental Health aregivers often face difficult challenges creatively maintaining a positive environment and their health while caring for their loved ones. It can be an overwhelming task at times, and others may not understand. And that's why Aging Partners hosts its Caregiver Support Group Meetings, which aim to provide hope, information and a safe environment for caregivers to share concerns with others who have the same experiences. Meetings are open to individuals of any age who provide care for an adult age 60 and over; those caring for an adult with Alzheimer's disease, a brain injury or related brain disorder; and individuals over the age of 55 raising a grandchild. \"Anytime you are a caregiver, you are faced with various challenges,\" said Sandy Lutz, a licensed independent mental health practitioner and Aging Partners program supervisor. \"These caregivers have similar experiences and frustrations as their needs often take a back seat to those in their care. It can be hard to establish balance, and the different emotions involved with being a caregiver.\" As she leads the meetings, Lutz provides professional guidance and helps caregivers develop long-term relationships. \"I am able to provide information and hopefully help these individuals find support for any mental health concerns or issues they might be experiencing by caring for their loved ones,\" she said. Each session will be different, but they all will be respectful, confidential, and focus on resources and the group's wants and needs. \"The groups are fun,\" Lutz said. \"You never know what each attendee might bring to the group. Many times they're bringing resources in they may not even be aware of. We want to help those people recognize how they're resources to one another, themselves and the facilitator.\" The Caregiver Support Group Meetings take place at Aging Partners' Downtown Senior Center, 1005 \"O\" St., or the Aging Partners Fitness Center, 555 S. 9th St. Caregivers can attend the group, and loved ones can come along and utilize the fitness or senior center. The meetings began in February, but only two occurred before they were canceled due to COVID-19. When it is safe to do so, Aging Partners plans to start the group meetings again \u2014 the City will issue a news release indicating times. Aging Partners offers a spectrum of services to support caregivers and their important work. This includes stress management, respite care, fitness and nutrition counseling, education and more.

Loneliness is described as distressed feelings of being alone or separated. For example, you can still feel lonely while attending a Nebraska football game with 90,000 other fans. Social isolation, however, is described as the physical separation from other people such as living alone. \"Loneliness and social isolation are different but related concepts,\" Miers said. \"Social isolation can lead to loneliness, and loneliness can lead to social isolation. It's possible that both could happen simultaneously.\" Research shows that the senior population is growing, but many baby boomers are feeling alone in the crowd. \"Those experiencing loneliness and social isolation share the potential for deteriorating health, and sensory or mobility impairments,\" Miers said. That can lead to depression. Depression isn't a normal part of aging. It's a mental condition that can be treated just like heart disease or diabetes. Older adults are at an increased risk for experiencing depression.

Health care providers may mistake an older adult's symptoms as a natural reaction to illness or life changes that occur during the aging process. In some instances, medication and illness also can display similar symptoms of depression. Therefore, medical providers may not see it as something that can be treated.Symptoms of Depression Symptoms and warning signs that a person may be experiencing mental health concerns include: Feelings of guilt, worthlessness and/or helplessness. Feelings of hopelessness and/or pessimism. Irritability, restlessness. Loss of interest in activities or hobbies once pleasurable. Fatigue and decreased energy. Difficulty concentrating, remembering details and making decisions. Insomnia, early morning wakefulness or excessive sleeping. Overeating or appetite loss. Thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts. Persistent aches or pains, headaches, cramps or digestive problems that do not get better, even with treatment. Older adults go through various life changes; so it's important to note that depression symptoms typically persist for more than two weeks. \"If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms, you can refer them to a physician or mental health professional for an evaluation,\" Miers said. \"If you're concerned about a loved one being depressed, offer to go with them to see a health care provider to be diagnosed and treated.\" Bryan Medical Center also offers a free confidential online screening available at bryanhealth.com/ services/online-screenings.Social Isolation and Loneliness Can Lead to Depression Continued from page 23.Living Well | 25 If you or someone you know is in danger due to depression, go to the nearest emergency room, call 911 or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. Treatment options for depression are different for each person. The most common treatments include anti-depression drugs, psychotherapy \u2014 also known as talk or cognitive therapy \u2014 or a combination of both. Combating Depression Seniors living alone should take time to build relationships with family members and friends, either in-person, by phone, letters or email. \"It's important to establish ways to increase senior's social contacts but also to address the quality of those relationships,\" Miers said. Older adults can take steps to combat loneliness and prevent depression and other serious health concerns, such as: Discover hobbies or pastimes that interest you and share with your friends and loved ones. Ask your friends and loved ones to lunch or go on a Sunday drive. When friends or family can't visit, call or write them. Develop a non-isolation plan and stay active. Have friends and family help you as needed to connect with groups or clubs with similar interests. Teach others about your hobby or pastime, including teaching those of younger generations. Connect with others by learning about their pastimes and hobbies.Taking care of yourself is one of the best ways to help your loved one. Respite allows the family caregiver time away to: Go to the grocery store. Visit the doctor. Have lunch with a friend. Take a nap. Do anything else needed to help reduce stress. A family caregiver is a person who provides ongoing care for an individual unable to care for themselves. Caregiving is rewarding, but also demanding and stressful.

Including fresh produce in your favorite meals will not only enhance the flavor and appeal, but also make it more enjoyable. By carefully selecting and storing produce, you will be able to enjoy it for days to come and add healthy components to your diet. How to Select There is never a surefire way to predict how good fresh produce will be by appearance or even how long it will store. However, there are many tips and tricks to ensure you have the best luck on your next grocery run. Choose items that are not visibly bruised or damaged. Bruised or damaged food items can be of poor quality and also have their freshness greatly reduced. The specific area where the product is damaged, such as a cut or a bruise, can be a prime location for mold and bacteria to grow. When buying items such as precut, bagged, or produce that is packaged such as half fruit or bagged salad mixes, only select those that are surrounded by ice or in a cooler. It is also extremely important to keep fresh produce away from raw meats, seafood and poultry. Selecting the freshest produce available also helps limit food waste, since that food will have a longer time frame to be used. How to Store Storing your local produce treasures can be both confusing and sometimes rather difficult. Certain fruits and vegetables do NOT mix well when stored together; some can even cause the others around them to spoil. We can't let one bad egg spoil the bunch and ruin our goodies, especially if they don't get along. Examples of produce you should keep out of the fridge are avocados, peaches, pears, plums, tomatoes and bananas. Examples of produce you can have in the fridge but stored away from others include apricots, figs, honeydew, apples and cantaloupes. Examples of items that must be stored in the refrigerator away from others because of their vulnerability are broccoli, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, lettuce and leafy greens. Helpful tips: Keep your fridge as clean as possible, checking every so often for soon-to-be-expiring food items (especially fresh fruits and vegetables). Be sure to store all precut or packaged fruits and veggies in your refrigerator. Always check that your fridge is working properly and is 40 degrees or cooler. Extending the Life of Your Fruits and Vegetables Bananas: Bananas stay good on the counter for five to seven days. After that, you may notice them turning brown. Placing bananas in the refrigerator will help slow down the ripening process (the peels will turn brown, but the insides are still good). Berries: Blueberries, blackberries, strawberries and raspberries are delicate and should not be washed until ready to eat. If washed too far ahead of time, water will contribute to mold growth. If berries are starting to get mushy before you have a chance to use them, place on a cookie sheet in the freezer. Once frozen, place in a sealed baggie. They're perfect for smoothies or an easy snack! Carrots: You may notice that your baby carrots will start to form a white film on them after time.

When baby carrots are exposed to air, the outer layer becomes dry. Carrots with \"white blush\" are safe to eat. Consider putting the baby carrots in a sealed bag after opening the original bag to help prevent air exposure. If eating raw, try putting in water for a few minutes to add back some of the moisture. If cooking, just add them along with the other vegetables. Celery: Re-crisp limp or dehydrated celery by washing, cutting into strips and placing into a container of ice water. In a half hour, the stalks will absorb enough water to help transform it back into a crisp, crunchy celery. Greens: Kale, spinach and collard greens don't stay good for long after you get them home. If you start to notice the wilt and know you won't be able to use them all, seal in a zip-close bag and place in the freezer. These are perfect to add to smoothies or blend into soups. Properly selecting and storing fresh fruits and vegetables is an important step to extend their shelf life, and it can also be a fun and nutritious way to add more color and creativity to your plate! LW Living Well | 2728 | Living WellExercise and Resilience HBy Peggy Apthorpe, Aging Partners Health and Fitness ave you ever wondered why some people seem to remain calm in the face of disaster while others appear to come undone? People who can recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change have what psychologists call \"resilience,\" or an ability to cope with problems and setbacks. Resilience gives people the strength to address problems head on, overcome adversity and move on with their lives. They remain strong and carry on. Frequently, they are even able to offer emotional support to others affected by the same situation. A resilient person faces challenges with flexibility, adaptability and an \"I can do this\" attitude. Resilience is boosted by remembering or reminding someone how they faced and overcame previous challenges. The recent social isolation and social distancing mandated by the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged all of us in many different ways. Aging Partners Health and Fitness staff was not surprised to see how program participants reacted to the directed health measures in a selfless, positive and creative manner. The resilience they have demonstrated is inspiring. Positive social connections with family and friends and/or a close-knit community of mutual social support helps build resilience. A healthy, active lifestyle is also predictive of higher resilience. Studies on exercise and stress find four ways exercise can boost your psychological stress resistance: It's a leg-up for your immune system. If you overdo it and take your workouts to extreme levels, the stress can wear you down and wreck your immune health. In moderate doses, plenty of evidence suggests regular exercise is great for immune function. Consistent regular exercise builds up your immune system. When the psychological stress comes, your body will be ready. It blunts the hormonal stress response. Like physical stress, psychological stress initiates a cascade of hormones. Cortisol is probably the best known, but there are others like norepinephrine. If you've ever been startled and suddenly had a huge surge in physical energy, you've felt norepinephrine in action. Regular exercise reduces baseline levels of stress hormones and blunts the hormonal response to sudden psychological stress. Mental or emotional stressors will feel less intensely stressful and do less damage to your body and brain. It changes your gene expression. Everyone is born with a certain set of genes and there is little or nothing we can do about that. We can change the expression of our genes - which genes get turned on or off. This is called epigenetics. A recent study conducted at the National Institute of Health indicated that, in general, exercise has numerous epigenetic benefits. Among them are changes in gene expression that increase mental stress resilience. If you are genetically prone to stress, a consistent exercise program can actually help reduce that problem. It is anti-inflammatory. Regular workouts, which should include enough breaks to recover, have been shown again and again to reduce inflammation. Recent research suggests that reducing inflammation might help to reduce stress and anxiety. For more information on Aging Partners Health and Fitness, contact 402-441-7575.

I plan to finish up some borders around my flower beds tonight so I can go chase Ictalurus punctatus (aka channel catfish) tomorrow night. So far this spring, the catfish have been doing a darn good job of social distancing from me, with the exception of a nice 6-pounder I landed in late April. So with everything that is or isn't happening related to COVID-19, this column will touch on the \"staying self-sufficient\" basics. Our programs are still going strong, but not to the degree they normally do this time of year. I can't even begin to guess what level we'll be functioning at when you're reading this around Independence Day.Home Handyman Our team is only doing outdoor work to help keep our clients and themselves safe.

We are currently not accepting anything new and are only distributing items in extreme situations. OK, enough of the depressing recap. The team and I want to make sure each and every one of you is staying as safe as possible. So please read on about keeping yourself safe in your home with the proper equipment.Smoke Detectors Most everyone knows how important smoke detectors are and that we need to check them every six months. However, many people don't do it correctly. When you push the button on the unit, all you are testing is the battery, not the unit's sensors. To properly test a smoke detector, you actually need to use smoke. You can use a match, a candle or canned smoke by gently waving the smoke toward the unit. If it doesn't start beeping, try spraying the unit with some compressed air. Then retest. Dust, small insects and other things can get into the unit and cause the sensor to not work. If it fails, just replace the unit completely with a new one. This is not the item to go bargain hunting for. Most smoke detectors have a life span of about four to eight years. I don't recommend using a cigar to test them as it can make spouses very irate! Fire Extinguishers This is an item every home should have at least one of - personally, I have four. And you must ensure they are of good quality and working. Check the extinguisher to make sure the gauge is \"in the green.\" This means the unit has pressure from the propellant (probably air) and will probably discharge the powder. Please note I said \"probably;\" the powder in extinguishers will become compacted over time if left alone. Every once in a while as you walk by them, pick them up and turn upside down a few times.

First, the chemical in it is basically baking powder, and it's easy to clean up; whereas, the powder in an ABC is more caustic, very fine and a pain to clean up. Secondly, if you have a small fire with wood, paper or cloth, just throw a pan of water on it! Well, once again the editor is leaning over my shoulder and counting words while glancing at the clock, so I better wrap it up. Please stay safe and reach out to us if there is something we can help with!LW32 | Living WellCaregiver Corner While many care for family or friends, others take on the role of professional caregiver as a career. A professional caregiver is someone who assists another in a way that enables them to live as independently as possible. They have many job titles \u2014 some offer medical care while others help with daily activities \u2014 but they all provide direct care. Professional caregivers advocate for seniors in many ways. They can help individuals obtain resources or apply for eligible benefits, in addition to helping with various daily tasks that allow them to live at home. Caregiving in professional roles is both vital and honorable. The Physical Caregiver The most common type of professional caregiver works directly with patients in a health care facility. Lisa Campbell, a certified nursing assistant (CNA) and medication aide, cares for residents at Legacy Retirement Communities. Along with bathing, she assists with various daily activities and medication delivery. Campbell began serving food at an assisted living facility when she was 16. \"I quickly realized I loved helping the residents in other ways,\" she said. Now, Campbell advocates for older adults by serving as their caregiver, and using her knowledge to advise them. \"I believe that I advocate for seniors through shower care,\" she said. \"I do a head to toe assessment and make sure there is no skin breakdown or sores.\" Campbell also serves as a sounding board for resident concerns, helps provide information and suggestions, and informs the charge nurse of issues when needed. The most rewarding part of her job is keeping residents happy, cared for and content. \"Knowing I've met their needs is rewarding to me,\" Campbell said. The Role of Professional Caregiver Barbara Straus, center, and her mother, Kathleen and grandson, Luke Lisa Campbell and her grandmother, Marilyn 32 | Living WellLiving Well | 33 Prepared and con/f_ident Call today!

The Social Work Caregiver As an Aging Partners social worker, Barbara Straus' role is to assist elders in receiving the help and services they need. \"When possible, I meet with the individual to identify their problems, needs and concerns,\" she said. \"I let them know what the community options are to serve them, such as housing, home health care, transportation and financial benefits.\" Straus works with the individual to develop a plan. \"I always tell people I'm a resource so they can make more informed decisions,\" she said. \"Our agency's goal is to help people stay as independent as possible and maintain their quality of life.\" Straus knows everyone has their own story and unique circumstances \u2014 and that \"one size fits all\" is not the best approach. She helps individuals make phone calls, fill out applications, understand programs and find resources. Before joining Aging Partners in 1986, Straus worked with seniors in a variety of roles. She learned how an individual's needs changed as he or she aged. \"The most rewarding part of my job is having the opportunity to get to know and help so many people,\" Straus said. \"The most challenging aspect has been trying to get help for people when the resources are limited and sometimes insufficient.\" Separating Professional and Family Caregiver Roles Drawing from her experience at work, Straus shares that information, when requested, with her 96-year-old mother, Kathleen, who lives in Michigan. \"Just like in my job, I learned not to tell her or anyone else what to do,\" Straus said. \"I respect her right to make her own decisions. If she asks me for help or information, I'm happy to provide as much as I can. But usually, it's very clear to me that she's fully in charge of her own life and doesn't need my professional assistance.\" Outside of work, Campbell also cares for her elderly grandmother. She can find it difficult to separate her professional and family caregiver roles, but appreciates it. \"I feel caring for family can be easier at times because you can say and do more for them,\" she said. Campbell can be more involved in her grandmother's care; whereas, as a CNA, she can advise and give suggestions, but ultimately leaves it up to the patient. There are many types of caregivers, and professional caregivers make the choice to care for others and often at home. They are a vital resource in our communities, caring for our loved ones when we cannot.LW Living Well | 3334 | Living WellA Pioneering Area Agency on AgingAGINGPARTNERS AGING PARTNERS 1005 \"O\" St., Lincoln, NE 68508-3628, 402- 441-7070 or 800-247-0938 aging.lincoln.ne.gov Serving Butler, Fillmore, Lancaster, Polk, Saline, Saunders, Seward and Y ork counties.
