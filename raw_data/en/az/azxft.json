This article is a must-read before a kidney cleanse.", "sitename": "Plant-Powered Kidneys | Renal Diet For Kidney Health", "date": "2021-12-07", "cleaned_text": "Cleansing the kidneys has become a hot topic. Many herbs, supplements, foods, and drinks promise to make you feel great. But before you start looking for kidney cleansing herbs, learn if there is any truth to these \"best\" kidney detoxes and if it is even possible to naturally cleanse kidneys for improved health. Table of Contents What Is A Kidney Cleanse A cleanse is when a person attempts to rid the body of substances regarded as toxic or unhealthy. The kidneys are the body's own cleansing system. They work hard all day, every day to flush out toxins, water, and wastes. [Learn more about what our kidneys do here.](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/why-are-kidneys-important/) The marketing of these cleanses often targets people with poor kidney health. Anyone with a bladder infection, kidney stone symptoms, or any other kidney issue are prey to cunning advertising tactics. It will leave them feeling the need to take cleansing the kidneys into their own hands. Kidney detoxes and cleanses consist of foods, drinks, supplements, and/or proclaimed kidney cleansing herbs taken over the course of a few days. The cleanse and detox methods restrict to only certain foods for a set period of days. The following is a review of products you may come across online that claim to help in cleansing the kidneys. We are not recommending any type of kidney cleansing product. Be sure to discuss any and all supplements - herbal, over-the-counter, or even prescribed by other practitioners - with your [nephrologist](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/kidney-specialist-tips/) and/or primary care physician. What To Know Before Starting a Kidney Cleanse Be sure to get adequate calories and nutrients to avoid fatigue and potential deficiencies. If you have any nutrient restrictions include foods, herbs, and supplements that will not cause drug interactions and put your kidneys in jeopardy. If you have any kidney issues it is best to talk to your doctor and [ registered dietitian](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/renal-dietitian-near-me/) (RD) about whether or not a kidney cleanse is right for you. They can help you make a plan tailored to fit your individual needs without compromising your health. Connect with our [dietitians at Plant-Powered Kidneys](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/meet-the-team/) for private nutrition counseling. Types of Kidney Cleanses In a cleanse you will have specific foods, drinks, herbs, teas, and/or supplements over a few days. Kidney Cleansing Herbs Many herbs for cleansing kidneys claim to improve kidney function. Learn the truth behind these \"so-called\" best kidney cleansing herbs. Dandelion Root Dandelion root is a herb in kidney cleanse tea. It may [ lower blood pressure and regulate blood sugar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5553762/). Dandelion root [prevents kidney stones](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6014465/) by [increasing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19678785/) urine production. The herb also contains inulin. This nutrient may help to [lower blood pressure and regulate blood sugar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5553762/). Some common side effects include: Don't take this herb if you are on certain medications: - Diuretics - Depression medications - Antipsychotics - Estrogen-based birth control - Antibiotics - Antacids - Cholesterol-lowering drugs You should also avoid dandelion if you have any weed allergies. The long-term effects of this herb are unknown. Dandelion root has a high content of [ potassium](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/herbalsupp). One leaf contains an average of [ 43 to 45 mg of potassium per gram of dandelion root](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3155102/). Those with kidney issues should avoid it. Stinging Nettle Stinging nettle is a herb that [fights bacteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6100552/) and [lowers inflammation](https://books.google.com/books?id=P_s7sD11RM8C&pg=PT54&dq=Gregory+L.+Tilford,+Edible+and+Medicinal+Plants+of+the+West,+ISBN+0-87842-359-1&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjs0K7Fi-zhAhWDTN8KHfRICCIQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=stinging%20nettle&f=false). It is unknown how this herb affects kidney function. Stinging nettle was found to interfere with blood-thinning drugs, diuretics, blood pressure drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, alpha-blockers, and finasteride. Stinging nettle has a high amount of potassium. One cup contains about 297 mg. Limited [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32523882/) has shown stinging nettle to be potentially effective with antibiotic-related acute kidney injury in rats. No human studies have been found. This is another reason why stinging nettle should not be considered one of the kidney cleansing herbs. Hydrangea Animals given hydrangea had [less kidney damage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5735979/). It also had an [anti-inflammatory effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5358452/) on kidney cells damaged by chemotherapy. Side effects include: - Dizziness - Feelings of tightness in the chest - Stomach and intestinal upset We are unsure of its effect on the kidneys. Hydrangea has not been tested on humans. Sambong Sambong [decreased the size of kidney stones](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5772838/) and reduced them from forming. It may also lower blood pressure. Reactions can occur in those with ragweed allergies. Side effects include rashes and itchy skin. We do not know how it specifically affects the kidneys. Marshmallow Root Marshmallow root both helps and hurts the kidneys. It may [lower inflammation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21281251/) but it also [decreased kidney function in mice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4274541/). Stomach upset and dizziness are some side effects. This herb contains [vitamin A](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/vitamin-a-kidney-connection/), potassium, and sodium. Those with restrictions should avoid this root as it is not considered one of the kidney cleansing herbs. Juniper Juniper is a herb with high water content. It is also a diuretic which is why it is claimed to help in cleansing the kidneys. It treats urinary tract infections (UTIs) and kidney stones. This herb contains antibacterial compounds called terpenoids. They may improve kidney function. [Urine increased](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/%28SICI%291099-1573%28199811%2912%3A7%3C494%3A%3AAID-PTR340%3E3.0.CO%3B2-N) without the [loss of electrolytes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6726717/) in rats that were fed juniper. The use of juniper may irritate the kidneys. It should not be used to treat [kidney damage or kidney disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6726717/). Parsley Parsley contains compounds that have health benefits. In rats, this extract [reduced cell damage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4224708/) and also [improved kidney function](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:QUAL.0000041152.24423.bb). Overall, we do not know the true effects of parsley extracts in humans. In addition, many supplements have [side effects](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/herbalsupp) so it is best to use the actual food. Use this herb sparingly due to its high potassium content. One tablespoon contains 21 mg. Parsley can be included in the diet without being used as one of the proclaimed kidney cleansing herbs. Try adding a little to your meals to provide a bright, fresh flavor. Try a sprig of parsley as a breath freshener after a meal, which is in part why many restaurants serve it alongside their meals. Red clover Red clover is also a natural [anticoagulant. It may cause excessive bleeding](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6549048/). Red clover contains [isoflavones](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/red-clover). These compounds are similar to estrogen and may affect hormone function. Red clover may improve kidney function due to compounds found in this herb. However, there is no evidence showing this, so the true effects of red clover are unknown. Unfortunately, we don't know if red clover can help the kidneys. Therefore, it should be avoided. Goldenrod Goldenrod is used to treat diabetes and arthritis. It prevents kidney stones and UTIs by flushing out bacteria. This herb can lower levels of [ sodium, potassium, and calcium](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1669338/). It may cause high blood pressure. Those with [kidney disease should not take goldenrod](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/herbalsupp). Basil Diabetic rats given basil extract had [lower blood sugar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6542390/) and better heart health. Eugenol is a compound that lowers blood pressure for a short period. It is found in basil. Human studies have found basil to be able to decrease [blood sugar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8880292) and [blood pressure](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13590849762709). However, there is [no evidence](https://www.rxlist.com/basil/supplements.htm) showing basil can help the kidneys. Garlic Garlic may produce a compound that relaxes blood vessels and [lowers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19017826/) blood pressure. Because of this, many think of it as one of the kidney cleansing herbs. It may protect the kidneys. Cell damage and kidney function were [prevented or improved](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11033412/) in rats fed garlic. Those with potassium restrictions should be [careful when consuming garlic](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/herbalsupp) so they do not get too much of this mineral. Ginger [Ginger](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/ginger-good-for-kidney/) can help with [ nausea and morning sickness](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/ginger-good-for-kidney/#Benefits_of_Ginger). It may also improve kidney health. Rats with poor kidney function had low inflammation when fed ginger extract. Ginger may lower [ inflammation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22017619/), [ blood pressure](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30972845/), and [ regulate blood sugar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6455977/) when used with other medications. There is some concern with ginger as a detox since it [may interfere with some medications](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/herbalsupp). [Read more about ginger and how to safely include it in the renal diet here.](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/ginger-good-for-kidney/) Turmeric Turmeric contains the compound curcumin. It lowers [ inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6271001/). In rats, curcumin prevented the formation of arterial plaque. It also reduced protein losses and improved [ kidney function](https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-019-1621-6). However, curcumin is not well absorbed. Taking it with the spice black pepper can increase the bioavailability. Some recipes, like [Golden Milk](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/ginger-good-for-kidney/#Golden_Milk_for_Kidney_Health_Recipe), use both of these spices. Turmeric contains both [potassium and phosphorus](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/herbalsupp). These nutrients may need to be limited in some people with kidney disease. Burdock Root Burdock root is a herb often made into tea. It has many antioxidants and a diuretic effect which make it a recommended herb for kidney stones. It is thought to decrease sodium levels. Burdock root [improved circulation and detoxified blood](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10787-010-0062-4) but it is uncertain how it affects those with kidney disease. Rehmannia Rehmannia contains a compound called catalpol. Catalpol makes Rehmannia a diuretic that can lower blood sugar. Rehmannia may improve blood, immune, endocrine, nervous, and cardiovascular systems. Claims stated it would [revive the kidney](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18407446/). However, there is no evidence on how it affects kidney health. Food for Cleansing the Kidneys Foods have been praised for their health benefits. However, it is important to know about any nutrients that might interfere with kidney function. Food for cleansing your kidneys are reviewed in the next section below. Kidney Beans Kidney beans provide [soluble fiber and a plant-based protein](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22012132/). These essential nutrients regulate blood pressure and glucose levels. Kidney beans do contain phosphorus, however, nutrient levels often decrease during digestion. This is because the [ phytates in kidney beans will bind to phosphorus](https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/5/3/519). Subsequently, the level of phosphorus ingested will be lower. Those with a phosphorus restriction still should be mindful of this food in regards to their overall phosphorus intake, especially from [additives](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/low-phosphorus-foods/). [Learn more about the low phosphorus diet here.](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/low-phosphorus-foods/) Watermelon Kidney Cleanse Watermelon may [increase urine and balance levels of phosphate, calcium, oxalate, and citrate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29145146/). Additionally, [nutrients in watermelon](https://www.sysrevpharm.org/fulltext/196-1594117973.pdf) may also protect the kidneys from tissue damage. Lycopene [ lowered inflammation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21391123/) in rats with kidney damage. This fruit is also high in potassium. [Too much watermelon may increase potassium levels](https://www.sysrevpharm.org/fulltext/196-1594117973.pdf) and compromise normal kidney function or worsen symptoms of renal disease. This kidney cleanse has not been proven effective. There are no studies to back up the claims about a watermelon kidney cleanse. This type of cleansing for the kidneys, which consists of eating only watermelon for a certain number of days, increases the risk of malnutrition, blood sugar fluctuations, dehydration, and other health complications. It also promotes unhealthy disordered eating patterns. Pomegranate Extract and Pomegranate Juice Pomegranate contains the compounds flavonoids and anthocyanins which give it a purple color. Research suggests these compounds in pomegranates may prevent [kidney damage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5877626/) and [heart disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18590349/). Additionally, pomegranate extracts prevented [ kidney stones](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19025399/) and increased urine output. Antioxidants in pomegranate improved filtration, blood flow, [increased kidney glomeruli](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4867030/), and [regenerated kidney tissue in rats](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22285521/). It reduced inflammation and calcium oxalate in the [kidney cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5877626/). In the short term, pomegranate juice or extract [did not improve](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4282815/) inflammation, blood pressure, or cholesterol. Long-term pomegranate had improved kidney function when compared with a placebo. Consumption of 100 mL for a year [improved health outcomes in hemodialysis (HD) patients](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22609423/). It reduced inflammation, infections, risk of death, and improved immunity. Kidney disease can cause problems with filtering certain minerals so it is important to be aware of the [ potassium levels in pomegranates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5872679/). Additionally, some [medications](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4007340/) may also have interactions with pomegranate. Beets Beetroot contains [ betalain and nitric oxide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6947971/). These compounds lower blood pressure and blood sugar. When compared with animals, humans had less improvement in kidney function when given beetroot. Alternatively, animals also had a slower progression of the disease. The progression of the disease was reduced. There was also a lower risk of death in those with hypertensive CKD and diabetic nephropathy. [Beetroot and beetroot juice may work as a complementary therapy for kidney treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6947971/). A [beetroot extract improved](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6947971/) structural damage by and decreasing inflammation and cell death. [Beetroot supplementation has been shown to](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4425174/) - Reduce blood pressure - Lower inflammation - Prevent oxidative stress - Maintain blood vessel function - Restore brain blood flow to the brain Beetroot juice has some interactions with medications like [ED drugs resulting in low blood pressure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6947971/). Beets are also high in potassium and those with potassium restrictions should limit this food. Cherries Cherries contain polyphenols and vitamin C. These compounds lower [ inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5872786/). Regular consumption of cherries may [ prevent cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5872786/). There is no evidence showing benefits for improved kidney health. Cherries have a medium amount of potassium so it may be good to eat them in moderation. Cherry juice was also found to [ interfere with medications. As a result, it caused acute kidney injury](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6620216/) in patients with chronic kidney disease. Cherries and cherry juice may help prevent gout. [Read more about that here.](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/gout-kidney-stones/) Olive Oil Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats and phytonutrients. These compounds lower inflammation, cholesterol, and the risk of heart disease. In addition, olive oil is used to alleviate kidney stones. Unfortunately, there is no evidence this actually works. Despite this, it is still a healthy food to incorporate into the kidney diet. Olive oil plays a large role in the Mediterranean diet, which can lower inflammation, insulin resistance, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Furthermore, olive oil itself can [reduce cardiovascular risk, inflammation, and improve the health of blood vessels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4443792/). There is no evidence olive oil can improve kidney health. It may, however, lower inflammation associated with kidney disease. Red Peppers Red peppers contain antioxidants lycopene, [vitamin A, C, fiber, and folate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4665466/). There is no specific evidence showing peppers can improve the kidneys or do any cleansing of the kidneys. However, nutrients in bell peppers may prevent [ heart disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4665466/) associated with kidney conditions. Grapes Red grapes contain flavonoids. These compounds may protect from [ kidney disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5928447/). Mice given flavonoids had improved kidney function. Grapes also contain resveratrol. This is a flavonoid that reduces fibrosis, [inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3893857/). It also repaired kidney cells and improved function. In humans, resveratrol [improved kidney function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682908/) in kidney disease. More research needs to be done to know the true effects of resveratrol. Cruciferous Vegetables Cruciferous vegetables include cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and brussels sprouts. These vegetables may [ reduce kidney cell cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3810374/) in humans. Large consumption of broccoli [ lowered the incidences of kidney failure in mice](https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/31/1/102) lacking the gene GSTM1. Mice with the defect had improvements in kidney injury when given broccoli powder. Normal mice were not affected. These vegetables are high in fiber. Fiber helps improve blood pressure and blood sugar. These vegetables are low in potassium, sodium, and phosphorus. Seaweed Seaweed is a popular kidney cleanse food. It is nutrient-dense and has been shown to improve health. Mice who consumed brown seaweed for 22 days had [reduced diabetic kidney damage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3910465/). Types of seaweed include spirulina or chlorella. They have been known to eliminate heavy metals that may cleanse the kidneys. Spirulina and chlorella are high in potassium which may not be good for those with mineral restrictions. Berries Berries contain [phytochemicals that reduce inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2643866/). [Rats with acute kidney injury](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2643866/) had [ lower blood pressure and cell damage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2643866/) after consumption of berries. Eating blueberries for 15 weeks also improved glucose tolerance and lowered blood pressure. Blueberries also repaired the angiotensin system in animals. This [ regulated blood pressure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4221362/) and had an overall protective effect on the kidneys It is unknown how blueberries affect the kidneys of humans. Pumpkin Seeds Information on pumpkin seeds is conflicting. Some say they can reduce kidney stones, while other information says it is not a kidney-friendly food. Cleanses involving pumpkin seeds claim they increase circulation and can flush out uric acid and other toxins. There is no scientific data to back this up. Furthermore, some sources show that pumpkin seeds are too high in potassium and are not always a renal-friendly food. Detox Drinks and Juicing for Kidneys The best drinks for cleansing the kidneys is a question that often comes up with kidney patients. There are a ton of kidney cleanse drinks that claim to improve kidney health. But when it comes to research some of these may be no help at all. See how these kidney cleansing drinks stack up. Water You cannot function without water. It is an essential nutrient that needs to be consumed daily. Water flushes toxins from the body by [increasing urine output](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8583588). Water helps move blood to the kidneys for filtration. Increased water reduces the levels of [ calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and uric acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8583588). This can [prevent kidney stones](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4953772/). Increases in water slowed the progression of [kidney disease in animals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5571765/). It also prevented high blood pressure and heart disease. For optimal hydration getting [ 2 to 2.5 liters a day is recommended](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5571765/). Cranberry Juice Drinking cranberry juice for kidney health is popular due to the antioxidants found in cranberries. Cranberries contain tannins that have antimicrobial properties. They can [block the growth of bacteria](https://www.jrnjournal.org/article/S1051-2276(16)30153-4/abstract) on the urinary tract as well as flush toxins out of the body. Cranberry juice is recommended to improve both UTIs and kidney stones. Increased [incidences of gut permeability and leaky gut](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31140512/) occur in kidney disease. This [can also increase the production of toxic bacteria](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26376131/) further fueling inflammation. Cranberries reduce inflammation and may also [promote the production of healthy bacteria](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23849454/) that can heal the intestinal lining. Cranberry [improved an impaired intestinal barrier](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4564871/) in rats with leaky gut. These mice also produced [ Akkermansia sp](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25080446/), a bacteria that protects the intestinal barrier. Some cranberry juices are high in potassium and sugar. It is best to get one that has no sugar added and is 100 percent juice. Coconut Water Coconut water can [break down kidney stones](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6236775/). Rats given coconut water had [ fewer incidences of kidney stones](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23489503/). No studies have linked better kidney function to coconut water. Coconut water is a hydrating drink that provides essential nutrients and antioxidants. It is high in potassium. Those with mineral restrictions may need to avoid this product. Lemon Juice Lemon juice is recommended for kidney stone prevention. There is [ some controversy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6236775/) over whether this actually can prevent stones. [Some had no difference in urinary citrate levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17572176/) found among those drinking lemonade while others found lemon juice did [prevent stone production](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5428529/). Lemon is a good source of the antioxidant vitamin C. Vitamin C enhances [immune function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5707683/) and [ prevents tissue damage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6431442/). It may also [ improve glucose control, insulin sensitivity, cholesterol levels, and blood vessel health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6431442/). Naringenin is an antioxidant compound in lemons that [may improve kidney function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6431442/#B61) in rats at moderate doses. Higher doses were ineffective. Cucumber Juice Cucumbers and cucumber juice are rich in [antioxidants](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23098877/) like [triterpenes which help with immune function](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20079412/). Cucumbers have been said to be a cleansing food and [remove waste materials and chemical toxins](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23098877/) such as kidney stones. However, there is no specific evidence on how cucumbers may help kidney function. They [may prevent tissue damage and slow cell aging](https://www.jarlife.net/3050-evaluating-the-potential-benefits-of-cucumbers-for-improved-health-and-skin-care.html). Damaged and diseased kidneys have a harder time regulating the blood pH. Cucumbers and cucumber juice reduced [inflammation and regulates blood sugar and cholesterol](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0367326X12002791?via%3Dihub) in animals. Apple Cider Vinegar Apple cider vinegar has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. It may possibly [ regulate blood sugar.](https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/27/1/281.long) In animals, it [lowered blood pressure](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11826965/) and [cholesterol](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1756464618300483). There is no specific evidence showing this food is helpful for kidney disease. Apple cider vinegar may be helpful for kidney stones. [Here is an article all about that.](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/apple-cider-vinegar-for-kidney-stones/) Vitamin Supplements for Kidneys Supplements for kidneys are also a popular part of detox programs. You'll often find these supplements and more included in products that are sold for cleansing the kidneys. Vitamin B6 B6 forms the compound [glyoxylate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5752631/) which inhibits oxalate production. Without adequate B6 oxalate levels may increase. Too much oxalate can result in kidney stones. B6 can [ prevent kidney disease and elevated cholesterol in diabetic rats](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253815483024). It also improves [ cardiovascular health](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/245068) and [immunity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9350682/) in dialysis patients. [Learn more about the B vitamins in this article.](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/vitamins-for-kidneys-b-complex/) Magnesium may [slow crystal formation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4414543/) and [reduce kidney stones](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6023850/). Supplementation of 400 mg per day was found to help people with recurring stones. [Too much or too little magnesium is a problem for those with kidney disease](https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/485212). This is because kidneys lose the ability to regulate magnesium. Too low levels can result in cardiovascular disease. Taking 30 mg of magnesium for 8 weeks lowered levels of calcification propensity, a marker for hardening of the arteries in kidney disease. This indicated a [possible delay of atherosclerosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5678662/) when compared with a placebo. [Learn more about magnesium and other electrolytes in this article.](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/vitamins-for-kidneys-minerals/) Omega 3 Fatty Acids Omega 3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory. They can improve [ blood sugar control, lower cholesterol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5067287/), and [ decrease the risk of heart disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5067287/). Diets high in omega 3 may also prevent kidney stones. Taking 1,200 mg of fish oil daily decreased the incidences of kidney stones. Omega 3 fatty acids can [ lower the risk of inflammatory conditions](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15485592/) like heart disease. They also reduced the [risk of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5241408/) and decreased [protein losses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5241408/). Besides fish, omega 3 fatty acids can be found in plants like chia seeds, flaxseeds, walnuts and walnut oil. Potassium Citrate Potassium citrate is associated with the [prevention of kidney stones](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5686309/). It can increase urine pH and [prevents stone formation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12028622/). Potassium citrate showed improvements in [70 to 75 percent](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11475849/) of those with kidney stones. Potassium citrate does not benefit kidney disease. Supplements including potassium are not recommended for those with kidney disease unless prescribed by your nephrologist. Pre-Formulated Kidney Detox Supplements On the market today there are many preformulated kidney detox pills, powders, and teas. Some common ones include the following: - Renaltrax - CleanseDrops - Uriflow - Stone CLR - Kidney Complete - Stone Free What to Know and Be Aware of Before Using Kidney Cleansing Herbs and Detoxes Before you try a kidney cleanse or kidney cleansing herbs, there are some things to consider. Benefits of Kidney Cleanses The benefits associated with these detoxes claim to include improved energy, focus, digestion, and reduced infections. The inclusion of these foods into the diet may help to lower kidney disease-related inflammation. [Reduced inflammation may improve](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2582781/): - Blood pressure - Blood sugar - Cholesterol - Weight management However, as discussed above, the herbs and cleanse products are not always scientifically proven to be effective nor safe. The above benefits are results of reducing inflammation. Risks of Kidney Cleanses There are some things you should know before cleansing the kidneys. Anytime you restrict certain foods you are at risk for [nutrient deficiencies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19931065/). This can cause [fatigue](https://medlineplus.gov/bvitamins.html) and [low energy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3999603/). On detoxes, calories are often restricted. Limiting calories can sometimes [slow down metabolism](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23404923/) and increase weight gain. Certain drinks, foods, and supplements [high in oxalates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4891250/) may affect kidney function. Too much fluid intake from water, juices, and teas may increase levels of potassium, sodium, and/or phosphorus. This can lead to an [electrolyte imbalance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6368431/) which can have serious health consequences. Kidney detox supplements may contain large amounts of herbs that could be hazardous to those with kidney dysfunction. They may also cause adverse side effects as seen above. The risk of drug interactions can also occur with certain foods, supplements, and drinks. What the Research Says About Cleansing the Kidneys When it comes to detoxes and cleanses there is little evidence these practices actually can improve health. The few studies done on detoxification programs showed [some positive results in blood pressure and insulin resistance](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/detoxes-and-cleanses-what-you-need-to-know) but the studies are often of low quality. Many programs only offer anecdotal evidence that cannot be applied to everyone. When medically reviewed, these programs have no compelling short or long-term research to support their claims. Other Ways To Improve Kidney Health You Incorporating daily healthy habits can help to improve kidney disease symptoms and lower inflammation. These include - Consuming enough water - Eating more whole [unprocessed foods](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/2019-10-10-3-mega-mistakes-to-avoid-plant-based-eating-with-chronic-kidney-disease/) - Limit or avoid added sugar and artificial sweeteners - Lower sodium intake - Don't smoke - Limit [alcohol](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/kidneys-and-alcohol/)and caffeine intake from sources like [coffee](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/2019-2-26-can-i-drink-coffee-if-i-have-kidney-disease/) - Get daily [exercise](https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/kidney-exercise/) Summary Some foods, drinks, and supplements including kidney cleansing herbs may help to lower inflammation in kidney-related conditions. Often kidney detox and cleanses are very restrictive and may lead to more health problems if not done properly.
