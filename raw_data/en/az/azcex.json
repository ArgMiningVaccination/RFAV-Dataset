Since publication of the last American Psychiatric Association (APA) practice guideline (American Psychiatric Association 2004) and guideline watch on schizophrenia (American Psychiatric Associatio n 2009a), there have been many studies on new pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. Additional research has expanded our knowledge of previously available tr eatments. This practice guideline aims to help clinicians optimize care for their patients by pr oviding evidence-based statements that are intended to enhance knowledge and increase the approp riate use of treatments for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is associated with significant he alth, social, occupational, and economic burdens as a result of its early onset and its severe and often persistent symptoms (American Psychiatric As- sociation 2013a). Worldwide, schizo phrenia is one of 20 caus es of disability (GBD 2017 Dis- ease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collab orators 2018). Economic burdens associated with schizophrenia are high (Chapel et al. 2017; Jin and Mosweu 2017), with an estimated cost of more than $150 billion annually in the United States ba sed on 2013 data (Cloutier et al. 2016). Lost pro- ductivity due to unemployment and caregiving ea ch account for approximately one-third of total costs, and direct health care costs account for a pproximately one-quarter of total costs. The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is estimated to be approximately 0.7% (McGrath et al. 2008; Moreno-K\u00fcstner et al. 2018; van der Werf et al. 2014), al though findings vary depending on the study loca- tion, demographic characteristics of the sample, the approach used for case finding, the method used for diagnostic confirmation, and the diagnostic criteria used. Schizophrenia is also associated with increased mo rtality, with a shortened life span and standard - ized mortality ratios that are reported to be tw ofold to fourfold those in the general population (Hayes et al. 2017; Heil\u00e4 et al. 2005; Hjorth\u00f8j et al. 2018; Olfson et al. 2015; Tanskanen et al. 2018; Walker et al. 2015). The common co-occurrence of other psychiatric disorders (Plana-Ripoll et al. 2019), including substance use disorders (Hunt et al. 2018), contributes to morbidity and mortality among individuals with schizophrenia. About 4%- 10% of persons with schizophrenia die by suicide, wi th rates that are highest among males in the early course of the disorder (Drake et al. 1985; Heil\u00e4 et al. 2005; Hor and Taylor 1998; Laursen et al. 2014; Nordentoft et al. 2011; Palmer et al. 2005; Popovic et al. 2014; Saha et al. 2007; Tanskanen et al. 2018). Additional causes of death include other unnatural causes, such as accidents and traumatic injuries, and physical conditions, su ch as cardiovascular, respiratory, and infectious diseases and malignancies, particularly lung cancer (American Psychiatric Association 2013a; Hayes et al. 2017; Heil\u00e4 et al. 2005; Hjorth\u00f8j et al. 2018; al. 2015; Tanskanen et al. 2018; Wa lker et al. 2015). Increases in morbidity and mor - tality related to physical health in individuals with schizophrenia are likely associated with such fac- tors as obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, greater use of cigarettes, reduced engagement in health maintenance (e.g., diet, exercise), and disparities in access to preventive health care and treatment for physical conditions (Bergamo et al. 2014; De Hert et al. 2011; Druss et al. 2000; et al. 2015; Kisely al. 2007, 2013; Kugathasan et al. 2018; La wrence et al. 2010; Moore et al. 2015). Lack of ac - cess to adequate psychiatric treatment may also influence mortality (Schoenbaum et al. 2017). 1 This practice guideline focuses on evidence -based pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. In addition, it includes statements related to assessment and treat - ment planning, which are an integral part of pati ent-centered care. Thus, the overall goal of this guideline is to enhance the treatment of schizoph renia for affected individuals, thereby reducing the mortality, morbidity, and significant psychosocial and health consequences of this important psychiatric condition. Scope of Document The scope of this document is shaped by Treatments for Schizophrenia in Adults (McDonagh et al. 2017), a systematic review commissioned by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) that serves as a principal source of in formation for this guideline on the basis of its methodological rigor and adherence to accepted standards for systematic reviews. This guideline is focused on the treat- ment of patients with schizophrenia, and, as such, the statements in this guideline will be relevant to individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The AHRQ review uses the DSM-5 definition of schizophrenia; however, many of the systematic reviews included studies that used earlier DSM or International Classification of Dise ases (ICD) criteria for schizophre nia. Several studies, particularly those assessing harms and psychosocial intervention s, also included patien ts with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder diagnosis. Consequently, discussi on of treatment, particularly treatment of first- episode psychosis, may also be relevant to individuals with schizophreniform disorder. Although many of the studies included in the sy stematic review also included individuals with a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, these da ta were rarely analyzed separately in a way that would permit unique recommendations to be crafte d for this group of patients. In addition, this guideline does not address issues related to identi fication or treatment of attenuated psychosis syn- drome or related syndromes of high psychosis risk, which were not part of the AHRQ systematic review. Data are also limited on individuals with schizophrenia and significant physical health condi- tions or co-occurring psychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders. Many of the avail-able studies excluded these individuals from the clinical trial or did not analyze data separately for these patient subgroups. Nevertheless, in the abse nce of more robust evidence, the statements in this guideline should generally be applicable to individuals with co-occurring conditions, includ-ing individuals who receive treatment using integrated collaborative care or inpatient or outpatient medical settings. Although treatm ent-related costs are often barriers to receiving treatment, and cost-effectiveness considerations are relevant to he alth care policy, few high-quality studies exist on the cost-effectiveness of treatments for schizophreni a. In addition, costs of treatment typically differ by country and geographic region and vary widely with the health system and payment model. Consequently, cost-effectiveness considerations ar e outside the scope of this guideline and its rec- ommendations. Overview of the Development Process Since the publication of the Institute of Medicine (now known as the National Academy of Medi- cine) report Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust (Institute of Medicine 2011), there has been an increasing focus on using clearly defined, transparent processes for rating the quality of evidence and the strength of the overall body of evidence in systematic reviews of the scientific literature. This guideline was developed using a process inte nded to be consistent with the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine (2011) and the Principles for the Development of Specialty Society Clinical Guidelines of the Council of Medical Specialty Societies (2012). Parameters used for the guideline's systematic review are included with the full text of the guideline; the development process is fully de- 2 APA Practice Guidelines scribed in the following document available at the AP A website: www.psych iatry .org/psychiatrists/ practice/clinical-practice-guidelin es/guideline-development-process. Rating the Strengths of Guideline Statements and Supporting Research Evidence Development of guideline statements entails weig hing the potential benefits and harms of each statement and then identifying the level of confidence in that determination. This concept of bal - ancing benefits and harms to determine guidel ine recommendations and strength of recommenda - tions is a hallmark of Grading of Recommenda tions Assessment, Deve lopment and Evaluation (GRADE), which is used by multiple professional organizations around the world to develop prac - tice guideline recommendations (Guyatt et al. 2013). With the GRADE approach, recommendations are rated by assessing the confidence that the bene fits of the statement outweigh the harms and bur- dens of the statement, determining the confidence in estimates of effect as reflected by the quality of evidence, estimating patient values and preferences (including whether they are similar across the patient population), and identifying whether re source expenditures are worth the expected net benefit of following the recommendation (Andrews et al. 2013). In weighing the balance of benefits and harms for ea ch statement in this guid eline, our level of con- fidence is informed by available evidence, which includ es evidence from clinical trials as well as ex- pert opinion and patient values and preferences. Ev idence for the benefit of a particular intervention within a specific clinical context is identified thro ugh systematic review and is then balanced against the evidence for harms. In this regard, harms are broadly defined and may include serious adverse events, less serious adverse events that affect tolera bility, minor adverse events, negative effects of the intervention on quality of life, ba rriers and inconveniences associated with treatment, direct and in- direct costs of the intervention (including opportun ity costs), and other negati ve aspects of the treat - ment that may influence decision-making by the patient, the clinician, or both. Many topics covered in this guideline have relied on forms of evidence such as consensus opin - ions of experienced clinicians or indirect findin gs from observational studies rather than research from randomized trials. It is well recognized that there are guideline topics and clinical circum - stances for which high-quality evidence from clinical trials is not possible or is unethical to obtain (Council of Medical Specialty Societies 2012). For example, many questions need to be asked as part of an assessment, and inquiring about a particul ar symptom or element of the history cannot be separated out for study as a discrete intervention. It would also be impossible to separate changes in outcomes due to assessment from changes in outcomes due to ensuing treatment. Research on psychiatric assessments an d some psychiatric interventions ca n also be complicated by multiple confounding factors such as the interaction between the clinician and the patient or the patient's unique circumstances and experiences. The GRADE working group and guidelines developed by other professional organizations have noted that a strong recommendation or good practice statement may be appropriate even in the absence of research evidence when sensible alternatives do not exist (Andrews et al. 2013; Brito et al . 2013; Djulbegovic et al. 2009; Ha zlehurst et al. 2013). For each guideline statement, we have described the type an d strength of the available evidence as well as the factors, including patient preferences, that were used in determining the balance of benefits and harms. The authors of the guideline determined each fina l rating, as described in the section \"Guideline Development Process,\" that is endorsed by the APA Board of Trustees. A recommendation (denoted by the numeral 1 after the guideline statement) indi cates confidence that the benefits of the inter- vention clearly outweigh harms. A suggestion (denoted by the numeral 2 after the guideline state- ment) indicates greater uncertainty: although th e benefits of the statement are still viewed as outweighing the harms, the balance of benefits and harms is more difficult to judge, or the benefits The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 3 or the harms may be less clear. With a suggestion , patient values and preferences may be more vari- able, and this can influence the clinical decision that is ultimately made. Each guideline statement also ha s an associated rating for the strength of supporting research evi- dence . Three ratings are used: high, moderate , and low (denoted by the letters A, B, and C, respec- tively). These ratings reflect the level of confid ence that the evidence for a guideline statement reflects a true effect based on consistency of findings across studies, directness of the effect on a spe - cific health outcome, precision of the estimate of ef fect, and risk of bias in available studies (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 2014; Ba lshem et al. 2011; Guyatt et al. 2006). Proper Use of Guidelines The APA Practice Guidelines are assessments of curr ent (as of the date of au thorship) scientific and clinical information provided as an educational service. The guidelines 1) should not be considered as a statement of the standard of care or inclusive of all proper treatments or methods of care, 2) are not continually updated and may not reflect the mo st recent evidence because new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when the guidelines are published or read, 3) address only the question(s) or issue(s) specifically identified, 4) do not mandate any particular course of medical care, 5) are not intended to su bstitute for the independ ent professional judgment of the treating clinician, and 6) do not account for individual variation among patients. As such, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the effect s of omitting a particular recommendation, either in general or for a specific patient. Furthermore, adherence to these guidelines will not ensure a suc-cessful outcome for every individual, nor should th ese guidelines be interpreted as including all proper methods of evaluation and care or excluding other acceptable methods of evaluation and care aimed at the same results. The ultimate recommen dation regarding a particular assessment, clinical procedure, or treatment plan must be made by the clinician directly involved in the patient's care in light of the psychiatric evaluation, other clinical data, and the diagnostic and treatment options avail- able. Such recommendations should be made in co llaboration with the patient, whenever possible, and should incorporate the patient's personal and so ciocultural preferences and values in order to en- hance the therapeutic alliance, adherence to treatment, and treatment outcomes. For all of these reasons, APA cautions against the us e of guidelines in litigation. Use of these guide- lines is voluntary. APA provides the guidelines on an \"as is\" basis and makes no warranty, expressed or implied, regarding them. APA assumes no respon sibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of the guidelines or for any errors or omissions.

Implementation The importance of the psychiatric evaluation cannot be underestimated because it serves as the initial basis for a therapeutic relationship with the patient and provides information that is crucial to differ- ential diagnosis, shared decision-making about tr eatment, and educating patients and family mem- bers about such factors as illness course and prognosis. APA's Practice Guidelines for the Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults , 3rd edition (American Psychiatric Association 2016a) describe recommended and suggested elements of assessment for any indi vidual who presents with psychiatric symptoms (Table 1). These elements are by no means comprehe nsive, and additional areas of inquiry will be- come apparent as the evaluation un folds, depending on the responses to initial questions, the present- ing concerns, the observations of the clinician du ring the assessment, the complexity and urgency of clinical decision-making, and other aspects of the cl inical context. In many circumstances, aspects of the evaluation will extend across multiple visits (American Psychiatric Association 2016a). The specific approach to the interview will depend on many factors, including the patient's abil - ity to communicate, degree of cooperation, level of insight, illness severity, and ability to recall his-torical details (American Psychiatric Association 2016 a). Such factors as the patient's health literacy (Clausen et al. 2016) and cultural background (Lew is-Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2016) can also influence the patient's understanding or interpretation of ques tions. Typically, a psychiatric evaluation involves a direct interview between the patient and the cl inician (American Psychi atric Association 2016a). The use of open-ended empathic questions about the patient's current life circumstances and rea- sons for evaluation can provide an initial picture of the individual and serve as a way of establish- ing rapport. Such questions can be followed up with additional structured inquiry about history, symptoms, or observations ma de during the assessment. Throughout the assessment proces s, it is important to gain an understanding of the patient's goals, their view of the illness, and preferences fo r treatment. This information will serve as a start - ing point for person-centered care and shared deci sion-making with the patient, family, and other persons of support (Dixon et al. 2016; Hamann and Heres 2019). It will also provide a framework for recovery, which has been defined as \"a process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live self-directed lives, and stri ve to reach their full potential\" (Substance Abuse 7 TABLE 1.

Consequently, discussions of goals should be focused beyond symptom relief and may include goals related to school ing, employment, living situation, relationships, leisure ac tivities, and other aspects of functioning and quality of life. Ques- tions about the patient's views may help determine whether the patient is aw are of having an illness and whether the patient has other explanations for symptoms that are helpful to them (Saks 2009). Patients may have specific view s about such topics as medicati ons, other treatment approaches, mechanical restraints, or involuntary treatment based on prior treatment experiences. They may also be able to delineate strategies that have been helpful for them in coping with or managing their symptoms in the past (Cohen et al. 2017). Some pa tients will have completed a psychiatric advance directive (Murray and Wortzel 2019), which is important to review with the patient if it exists. In addition to direct interview, patients may be asked to complete el ectronic or paper-based forms that ask about psychiatric symptoms or key aspects of the history (A merican Psychiatric As- sociation 2016a). When available, prior medical reco rds, electronic prescription databases, and in- put from other treating clinicians can add further details to the history or corroborate information obtained in the interview (Ameri can Psychiatric Association 2016a). Family members, friends, and other individuals involved in the patient's support network can be an important part of the patient's care team and valuable sources of collateral information about the reason for evaluation, the patient's past hist ory, and current symptoms and behavior (American Psychiatric Association 2016a). Outreach to family , friends, and others in the support network will typically occur with the patient's permission. In situ ations in which the pati ent is given the opportu- nity and does not object, necessary information can be shared with family members or other persons involved in the patient's care or payment for care (Office for Civil Rights 2017b). For example, if a relative or person of support is present with the patient at an appointment, the clinician may discuss information about medications or give education about warning signs of a developing emergency. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 9 In some instances, however, patients may ask that family or others not be contacted. When this is the case, patients can usually identify someone whom they trust to provide additional information, and they are often willing to reconsider contact as tr eatment proceeds. It is also useful to discuss the reasons that the patient has concerns about contac ts with family members or other important people in the patient's life. For example, a patient may wish to avoid burdening a loved one, may have felt unsupported by a particular family member in the past, or may be experiencing delusional beliefs that involve a family member or fr iend. The patient may also want to limit the information that clini- cians receive about past or recent treatment, symp toms, or behaviors. Even when a patient does not want a specific person to be contacted, the clinic ian may listen to information provided by that indi- vidual, as long as confidential information is no t provided to the informant (American Psychiatric Association 2016a). Also, to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of the patient or others, The Principles of Medical Ethics (American Psychiatric Association 2013f) and the Health Insurance Po rtability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA; Office for Civil Rights 2017b) permit clinicians to disclose necessary info rmation about a patient to family members, care - givers, law enforcement, or other persons involved with the patient as well as to jails, prisons, and law enforcement officials having la wful custody of the patient. HIPAA also permits health care pro- viders to disclose necessary information to the patient's family, friends, or other persons involved in the patient's care or payment for care when such disclosure is judged to be in the best interests of the patient and the patient either is not present or is unable to agree or object to a disclosure be- cause of incapacity or emergency circumstances. Examples of such circumstances are not limited to unconsciousness and may also include such circum stances as temporary psychosis or intoxication with alcohol or other substances (Office for Civil Rights 2017b). Although it is beyond the scope of this guidelin e to discuss the differential diagnosis and evalua- tion of psychotic disorders, many features and aspect s of clinical course will enter into such a deter- mination in addition to psychotic symptoms per se. Clinicians should also be mindful that biases can influence assessment and diagnosis, with disparities in diagnosis based on race being particularly common (Olbert et al. 2018; Schwartz and Blankens hip 2014). The clinician should be alert to fea - tures of the history, including family, developmen tal, and academic history, that may suggest spe- cific conditions or a need for additional physical or laboratory evaluation. Examples of conditions that can mimic schizophrenia in their initial presentation include neurosyphilis, Huntington's dis - ease, Wilson's disease, and anti- N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis (Lieberman and First 2018). Individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome have a substantially increased risk of developing schizophrenia (Bassett et al. 2017; McDo nald-McGinn et al. 2015; Va n et al. 2017). In ad- dition, the presence of a 22q11.2 deletion is associ ated with an increased likelihood of neurocogni- tive and physical health impair ments (McDonald-McGinn et 5; Moberg et al. 2018; Swillen and McDonald-McGinn 2015), which has implications for treatment (Fung et al. 2015; Mosheva et al. 2019). Psychotic symptoms can also occur in th e context of other neurological and systemic ill- nesses, with or without delirium, and such acute st ates can at times be mistaken for an acute exac - erbation of schizophrenia. Furthermore, because a significant fraction of in dividuals with psychosis will have a shift in diagnosis over time, the diag nosis may need to be reevaluated as new informa- tion about the patient's illness course and symp toms becomes available (Bromet et al. 2011). Spe- cialty consultation can be helpful in establishing and clarifying diagnosi s (Coulter et al. 2019), particularly if the illness symptoms or course appear to be atypical or if the patient is not respond- ing to treatment. A thorough history is also important for identify ing the presence of co-occurring psychiatric con- ditions or physical disorders that need to be ad dressed in treatment pla nning (American Psychiat- ric Association 2016a; Firth et al. 2019). For exampl e, individuals with serious mental illness have higher rates of smoking, higher rates of heavy smoking, and lower rates of smoking cessation than do community samples (Cook et al. 2014; de Leon and Diaz 2005; Myles et al. 2012; Wium-Andersen et al. 2015). Furthermore, the use of cannabis may be more frequent in individuals with schizophre - nia (Koskinen et al. 2010) and associated with grea ter symptom severity or earlier onset of psycho- APA Practice Guidelines 10 sis (Carney et al. 2017; Large et al. 2011). Other subs tance use disorders, if present, can also produce or exacerbate symptoms of psychosis (American Psychiatric Association 2016a; Large et al. 2014). Thus, as part of the initial evaluation, it is impo rtant to determine whether the patient uses tobacco, cannabis, or other substances such as alcohol, ca ffeine, (e.g., \"bath salts,\" K2, Spice). Th e route by which substances are used (e.g., ingestion, smoking, vaping, intranasal, intravenous) is similarly important to document. Mortality is increased in individuals with schi zophrenia (Brown et al. 2000; Fazel et al. 2014; Olfson et al. 2015), and the average life span is shortened by a decade or more, with much of this de- crease related to increased rates of co-occurring physical conditions (Laursen et al. 2013; Saha et al. 2007; Walker et al. 2015). Adverse health effects of smoking also contribute to an increased risk of mortality among individuals with schizophrenia (Lariscy et al. 2018; Reynolds et al. 2018; Tam et al. 2016). Many other conditions are more frequent in individuals with serious mental illness in general (Janssen et al. 2015; McGinty et al. 2016) and schizophrenia in part icular (Henderson et al. 2015), including, but not limited to, poor oral health (Kisely et al. 2015), he patitis C infection (Chasser et al. 2017; Hauser and Kern 2015; Hughes et al. 2016), HI V infection (Hobkirk et al. 2015; Hughes et al. 2016), cancer (Olfson et al. 2015), sleep apnea (Myles et al. 2016; Stubbs et al. 2016b), obesity (Janssen et al. 2015), mellitus (Vancampfort et al. 2016a), metabolic syndro me (Vancampfort et al. 2015), and cardiovascular disease (Correll et al. 2017c). These disorders, if present, can contribute to mortality or reduced quality of life, and some may be induced or exacerbated by psychiatric medications. Laboratory tests and physical examinat ion as part of the initial evaluation can help to identify common co-occurring conditions and can serve as a baseline for subsequent monitoring during treatment (Table 2). As part of the initial evaluation, it is also us eful to inquire about the course and duration of symptoms prior to treatment (i.e., duration of untreated psychosis) (Penttil\u00e4 et al . 2014; Register- Brown and Hong 2014; Santesteban-Echarri et al. 2017) and whether the patient has received any mental health treatment. If the patient has receiv ed treatment previously, it is important to ask about a broad range of treatments and other approa ches to addressing the patient's symptoms and functioning and to specifically ask about the full ra nge of treatment settings (e.g., outpatient, partial hospitalization, inpatient) and approaches that the patient has found helpful or problematic (Amer- ican Psychiatric Association 2016a). Although mo st patients will comment on prior medications, psychotherapy, or psychiatric hosp italizations if asked about treatment history, specific questions may be needed to gather details of such treatments. Prompting may be needed to learn information about the patient's experiences with other interven tions such as psychosocial rehabilitation, sup- ported employment, assertive community treatmen t (ACT), court-ordered treatment, treatment while incarcerated, substance use treatments, neur omodulatory therapies (e.g., electroconvulsive therapy programs, spir - itual healers, and complementary or alternativ e treatment approaches. Pharmacy databases and patients' lists of active medications are not likely to include long-acting injectable (LAI) medica- tions contracep- tive agents), over-the-counter medications, herbal products, or nutritional supplements. For each specific type of intervention that the patient has received, it is helpful to learn more about the du - ration, mode of delivery (e.g., formulation, route, and dose for medications; format, type, and fre-quency of treatment for psychotherapy), response (i ncluding tolerability, changes in quality of life, level of functioning, and symptom respon se/remission), and degree of adherence. The psychosocial history reviews the stages of the patient's life and may include attention to perinatal events, delays in developmental milest ones, academic history and performance (includ- ing learning difficulties, special education interven tions, or disciplinary ac tions), relationship and sexual history, interpersonal functi oning (including in social and family roles, such as parenting), occupational history (including military history) , legal history, and identification of major life events (e.g., parental loss, divorce, traumatic experiences, migration history) and psychosocial The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 11 TABLE 2.

Preventive care and other tests, such as sc reening for hepatitis C or HIV, are expected to occur as a part of routine primary care. Nevertheless, determining whether a patient is receiving pr imary care and inquiring about the patient's relationship with their primary care practitioner can be a starting point for improved access to quality health care and preventive services. bAlthough this practice guideline recommends that patients treated with antipsychotic medications be monitored for physical cond itions and side effects on a regular basis, there are no absolute criter ia for frequency of monitoring. Occurrence of conditions and s ide effects may be influenced by the patient's history, preexisting conditio ns, and use of other medications in addition to antipsychotic a gents. Thus, decisions about monitoring patients for phys ical conditions, specific side effects, or abnormalities in laboratory test results will neces- sarily depend on the clinical circumstances. In general, assess ments related to physical condit ions and specific medication-rel ated side effects will be done at the time of initiating or changing anti psychotic medications or when adding other medications that cont ribute to these side effects. cBMI may be calculated by using the formula weight in kg/(height in m)2 or the formula 703 \u00d7 weight in lb/(height in inches)2 or by using a BMI calculator available from the National Heart, Lung , an d Blood Institute ( www .nhlbi.n ih.gov/health/educational/lose_ wt/ BMI/bmicalc.htm). A of is considered ov erweight, and one with a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obe se. In addition to BMI, waist circumference can be used as an indicator of risk (>35 inches for women and >40 inches for men). Exce pt for patients with a BMI of <18.5, an increase in BMI of 1 unit woul d suggest a need for intervention by monitoring weight more clos ely, engaging the patient in a weight management program, using an adjunctive treatment to reduce weight, or changing the antipsycho tic medication. dFactors that suggest a possible need for im aging include focal neurological signs, ne w onset of seizures, later age at symptom onset, symptoms suggestive of intracranial pathology (e.g., chronic or severe headaches, nausea, vomiting), and symptoms suggestive of au- toimmune encephalitis (e.g., rapid progression of working memory deficits over less than 3 months; decreased or altered level o f con - sciousness, lethargy, or personality change; Graus et al. 2016). In the absence of such indications, decisions about imaging sh ould consider that the yield of routine brain imaging is low, with <1% of studies showing potentially serious incidental findings or abnormal - ities that would influence treatment (Cunqueiro et al. 2019; Falken berg et al. 2017; Forbes et al. 2019; Gibson et al. 2018). O n the other hand, routine imaging is a low-risk procedur e, and a negative finding can be reassuring to patients and to families. If imaging is ordered, it is rarely necessary to delay other treatment or hospitalization while awaiting imaging results. eFactors that may suggest a possible need for chromosomal testing (e.g., to identify abnormalities such as 22q11.2 deletion synd rome) include mild dysmorphic features, hypernasal speech, developmen tal delays, intellectual impairme nts, learning difficulties, and con- genital heart defects (Bassett and Chow 1999; Miller et al. 2010). fThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has requested that all manufacturers of second-generation antipsychotic medications (SGAs ) in- clude a warning in their product labeling regarding hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus. Although precise risk estimates for hy perglyce - mia-related adverse events are not available for each agent, epid emiological studies suggested an increased risk of treatment-e mergent adverse events with SGAs, including extreme hyperglycemia. In some patients, this hyperglycemia was associated with ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or death. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 13 TABLE 2. Suggested physical and laboratory assessm ents for patients with schizophrenia (continued) gFactors that indicate an increased risk for undiagnosed diabetes include a BMI >25, a first-degree relative with diabetes, habi tual phys- ical inactivity, being a member of a high-risk ethnic population (African American, Hispanic, American Indian, Asian American, Pacific Islander), history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension (140/ 90 mmHg or on therapy for ovary syndrome (in women), having had gestational diabetes, and other clinical condit ions associated with insulin resistance (e.g., severe obesity , acanthosis nigricans) (American Diabetes Association 2018). Symptoms of po ssible diabetes include frequent urination, excessive thirst, extreme hunger, unusual weight loss, increased fatigue, irritability, and blurry vision. hWhen screening for the presence of diabetes, criteria for diagno sis include a fasting blood glucose higher than 125 mg/dL, wher e fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 hours (American Diabetes Association 2018). Alternatively, a hemoglobin A1C of 6 .5% or greater can be used. Other acceptable approaches for diagnosis of diabetes include an oral glucose tolerance test or a random b lood glu- cose of at least 200 mg/dL in conjunction with a hyperglycemic cr isis or classic symptoms of hyperglycemia. With all of these a pproach- es, results should be confirmed by repeat testing unless unequivocal hyperglycemia is present. In patients with hemoglobinopath ies or conditions associated with increased red blood cell turnover (e.g., second- or third-trimester pregnancy, hemodialysis, recent blood loss, transfusion, erythropoietin therapy), fasting blood glucose should be used rather than hemoglobin A1C. An abnormal value of fas ting blood glucose or hemoglobin A1C suggests a need for medical consultation. More frequent monitoring may be indicated in the pres ence of weight change, symptoms of diabetes, or a random measure of blood glucose >200 mg/dL. iAdditional information on screening and management of patients with lipid disorders can be found in the AHA/ACC/AACVPR/AAPA/ ABC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/APhA/ASPC/NLA Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol (Grundy et al. 2018). jMetabolic syndrome is currently defined by the presence of at least three of the following five risk factors: elevated waist ci rcumference (defined for the United States and Canada as >102 cm [40.2 inch es] for men women); elevated trigly cerides of 150 mg/dL (or drug treatment for elevated triglycerides, such as fibrates, nicoti nic acid, <50 mg/dL in women (or drug treatm ent for such as fibrates or nicotinic acid); ele- vated blood (BP) with BP mmHg and/or di astolic BP 85 mmHg (or antihypertensive treatment in a patient with a history of hypertension); and elevated fa sting glucose 100 mg/dL (or drug treatment for elevated glucose) (Alberti et al. 20 09). kUsing an adverse drug event causality analysis intended to evaluate the risk of sudden death when taking a specific medication (Woosley et al. 2017), the listed drugs have been categorized as prolonging the QT interval and being clearly associated with a known ri sk of torsades de pointes, even when taken as recommended (Woosley et al. 2009). lIn this context, risk factors include non-modifiable (e.g., congenital long QT syndrome, age, sex, family history of sudden car diac death, personal or family history of structural or functional heart disease, personal history of drug-induced QT prolongation, metabol izer sta - tus) and modifiable risk factors (e.g., starvation; bradycardia; ri sk hypokalemia, infusion of QTc interval-prolonging drugs; simultaneous use of multiple drugs that prolong QTc intervals; or factors affecting drug metabolism such as drug-dru g interactions, acute or chronic kidney disease, or hepatic imp airment) (Funk et al. 2018). mScreening should assess changes in libido, menstrual changes, or galactorrhea in women, and changes in libido or in erectile or ejacu- latory function in men. nAssessment can occur through clinical examination or through the us e of a structured evaluative tool such as the Abnormal Invol untary Movement Scale (AIMS; Guy 1976; Munetz and Benjamin 1988) or the Dyskinesia Identification System: Condensed User Scale (DISCUS ; Kalachnik and Sprague 1993). For a copy of the AIMS, see www.aacap.org/App_Themes/AACAP/docs/member_resources/ toolbox_for_clinical_practice_and_outcomes/monitoring/AIMS.pdf, and for a copy of the DISCUS, see https://portal.ct.gov/-/ media /DDS/Health/hcsma20002b.pdf. oPatients at increased risk for developing abnormal involuntary movements include individuals older than 55 years; women; indivi duals with a mood disorder, substance use disorder, intellectual disab ility, or central nervous system injury; individuals with high cumulative exposure to antipsychotic medications, particularly high-potency dopamine D2 receptor antagonists; and patients who experience acute dystonic reactions, clinically significant parkinsonism, or akat hisia (Carbon et al. 2017, 2018; Miller et al. 2005; Solmi et a l. 2018a). Ab - normal involuntary movements can also emerge or worsen with antipsychotic cessation. pFrequency of monitoring for involuntary movements in individuals receiving treatment with an anti psychotic medication is also s ubject to local regulations in some jurisdictions. Practice Guidelines 14 stressors (e.g., financial, housing, legal, school/occupational, or interpersonal/relationship prob - lems; lack of social support; painful, disfiguring, or terminal medical illness) (American Psychiatric Association 2016a; Barnhill 2014; MacKinnon et al . 2016; Smith et al. 2019). Information about the patient's family constellation and persons who provide support will serve as a foundation for working collaboratively with the patient and their support network. The cultural history also em- phasizes relationships, both familial and nonfamilial, and the role of important cultural and reli - gious influences on the patient's life (Aggarwa l and Lewis-Fern\u00e1ndez 2015 ; American Psychiatric Association 2013a; Lewis-Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2016). The mental status examination is an integral part of the initial assessment. A full delineation of the mental status examination is beyond the scope of this document, and deta iled information on con- ducting the examination is available elsewhere (American Psychiatric Association 2016a; Barnhill 2014; MacKinnon et al. 2016; Smith et al. 2019; St rub and Black 2000). However, for individuals with possible schizophrenia, a detailed inquiry into ha llucinations and delusions will often identify psy - chotic experiences in addition to the presenting concerns. Negative symptoms and cognitive im - pairment are common and influence outcomes (Bowie et al. 2006; Green 2016; Jordan et al. 2014; Rabinowitz et al. 2012; Santesteba n-Echarri et al. 2017) but may go undetected without specific at - tention during the evaluation. Nega tive symptoms also can be difficult to differentiate from lack of interest or reduced motivation due to depression, medication side effects, substance use, or neuro- logical conditions. Insight is also impaired in a significant proportion of individuals with schizophrenia (Mohamed et al. 2009) and can manifest as a decreased aw areness of having a disorder, symptoms, conse- quences of illness, or a need for treatment (Mintz et al. 2003). Consequently, inquiring about the pa - tient's degree of insight and judgment will provide information relevant to risk assessment, treatment outcomes, and adherence (Mintz et al. 2003; Mohamed et al. 2009). Risk assessment is another essential part of the initial psychiatric evaluation (American Psychi - atric Association 2004). It requires synthesizing in formation gathered in the history and mental sta - tus examination and identifying modifiable risk fact ors for suicidal or aggressive behaviors that can serve as targets of intervention in constructing a plan of treatment. Suicidal ideas are common in individuals who have had a psycho tic experience (Bromet et al. 2017). Death due to suicide has been estimated to occur in about 4%-10% of indi viduals with schizophrenia (Drake et al. 1985; Heil\u00e4 et al. 2005; Hor and Taylor 1998; Laursen et al. 2014; Nordentoft et al. 2011; Palmer et al. 2005; Popovic et al. 2014; Tanskanen et al. 2018; Yates et al. 2019), yielding a greater than tenfold increase in standardized mortality ratios (Saha et al. 2007). Among individuals with schizophrenia, suicide attempts and suicide may be more common early in the course of the illness (Popovic et al. 2014) and can occur even before in itial treatment for psychosis (Challis et al. 2013). In individuals with schizophrenia, many of the risk factors that contribute to the risks of suicidal or aggressive behaviors are the same as factors increasing risk in other disorders. For example, in in- dividuals with schizophrenia, an increased risk of suicidal or aggressive behaviors has been associ-ated with male sex, expressed suicidal ideation, a history of attempted suicide or other suicide-related behaviors, and the presence of alcohol use disorder or other substance use disorder (Cassidy et al. 2018; Challis et al. 2013; 2010; \u00d8stergaard et al. 2017; Pompili et al. 2014; Roch\u00e9 et al. 2018; Sariaslan et al. 2016; Singh et al. 2012; Swanson et al. 2006; Witt et al. 2013, 2014). Firearm access is an additional contributor to suicide risk (Alban et al. 2018; Anestis and Houtsma 2018; Siegel and Rothman 2016). Additional factors that have been identified as increasing risk for suicide among individuals with schizophrenia include depressi ve symptoms, hopelessness, agitation or motor restlessness, fear of mental disintegration, recent loss, recency of diagnosis or hospitalization, re - peated hospitalizations, high intelligence, young age, and poor adherence to treatment (Cassidy et al. 2018; Fleischhacker et al. 2014; Hawton et 2014; Pompili et al. 2007; Popovic et al. 2014; Randall et al. 2014). It is not clear whether preserved insight is associated with an increase in suicide risk among individuals with schizophrenia (Hor and Taylor 2010) or The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 15 whether this is an apparent increase that is medi ated by other factors such as hopelessness (L\u00f3pez- Mor\u00ed\u00f1igo et al. 2012). Although reduced risk of suicide was associated with hallucinations in one meta-analysis (Hawton et al. 2005), the presence of auditory command ha llucinations may confer increased risk (Harkavy- Friedman et al. 2003; Wong et al. 2013). Command hallucinations can also be relevant when assessing individuals for a risk of aggressive behaviors (McNiel et al. 2000; Swanson et al. 2006), although the relationship between experiencing commands and ac ting on them is complex (Braham et al. 2004). Persecutory delusions may also contribute to risk of aggression, particularly in the absence of treat- ment or in association with significant anger (Coid et al. 2013; Keers et al. 2 014; Swanson et al. 2006). Among individuals with psychotic illn esses, prior suicidal threats, angry affect, impulsivity, hostil- ity, recent violent victimization, childhood sexual abuse, medication nonadherence, and a history of in- voluntary treatment were also associated with an increased risk of aggressive behavior (Buchanan et al. 2019; Large and Nielssen 2011; Reagu et al. 2013; Swanson et al. 2006; Witt et al. 2013, 2014). Other factors associated with a risk of aggression are similar to findings in individuals without psy- chosis and include male sex, young age, access to firearms, the pres ence of substance use, traumatic brain injury, a history of attempted suicide or other suicide-related behaviors, and prior aggressive behavior, including that associated with legal consequences (Bucha nan et al. 2019; Cassidy et al. 2018; al. 2014; Roch\u00e9 et al. 2018; Sariaslan et al. 2016; Short et al. 2013; Singh et al. 2012; Swanso n et al. 2006; Witt et al. 2013, 2015). Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits In an individual with a possible psychotic disorder , a detailed assessment is important in establish- ing a diagnosis, recognizing co-occurring conditions (including substance use disorders, other psy- chiatric disorders, and other physical health disorders), identifying psychosocial issues, and developing a plan of treatment that can reduce associated symptoms, morbidity, and mortality. Harms* Some individuals may become anxious, suspicious , or annoyed if asked multiple questions during the evaluation. This could interfere with the ther apeutic relationship between the patient and the clinician. Another potential conseque nce is that time used to focus on a detailed assessment (as out - lined in the Practice Guidelines for the Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults , 3rd edition; American Psychi - atric Association 2016a) could reduce time available to address other issues of importance to the pa - tient or of relevance to diagnosis and treatment planning. Patient Preferences Although there is no specific evidence on patient preferences related to assessment in individuals with a possible psychotic disorder, cl inical experience suggests that the majority of patients are co- operative with and accepting of these types of questions as part of an initial assessment. *Harms may include serious adverse events; less serious adve rse events that affect tolerability; minor adverse events; negative effects of the intervention on quality of life; barr iers and inconveniences associ ated with treatment; and other negative aspects of the treatment that may influence decision-making by th e patient, the clinician, or both. APA Practice Guidelines 16 Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statemen t were viewed as far outweighing the potential harms. This recommendation is also consistent with the APA Practice Guidelines for the Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults , 3rd edition (American Psyc hiatric Association 2016a). The level of research ev- idence is rated as low because there is minimal research on the benefits and harms of assessing these aspects of history and examination as part of an initial assessment. Nevertheless, expert opin - ion suggests that conducting such assessments as pa rt of the initial psychiatric evaluation improves the diagnosis and treatment planning in individuals with a psychiatric disorder.

Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members There were no differences of opinion. The writing group voted unanimously in favor of this recom- mendation. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations Relevant guidelines from the following organiza tions were reviewed: British Association for Psy- chopharmacology (BAP), Canadian Psychiatric Association and Schizophrenia Society of Canada, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Royal Australian and New Zealand Col-lege of Psychiatry (RANZCP), Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), World Federa - tion of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP), and Schizo phrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT). Information from them is generally consistent with this guideline statement. Other guidelines on the treatment of schizophrenia inco rporate recommendations related to the need for a comprehensive initial assessment (Addington et al. 2017a; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014), including identi fication of prior and current ps ychiatric symptoms and diagnoses (Addington et al. 2017a; Hasan et al. 2015; National Institute for He alth and Care Excellence 2014), assessment of tobacco use (Addington et al. 2017a; National Institute for Health and Care Excel-lence 2014), assessment of substa nce use (Addington et al. 2017a; Ba rnes et al. 2011; Crockford and Addington 2017; Galletly et al. 2016; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014), phys- ical health history and examination (Addington et al. 2017a; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014), assessment of psychosocial factors (Addington et al. 2017a; Galletly et al. 2016; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014), and mental status examination (Addington et al. 2017a), including assessment of the risk of harm to self or others (Addington et al. 2017a; Hasan et al. 2015; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014). Several other guidelines also provide information on the circumstances in which an electrocardiogram is suggested (Barnes et al. 2011; National Institute for Health and Ca re Excellence 2014; Pr ingsheim et al. 2017). Quality Measurement Considerations For patients with psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, several components of the initial psychiatric evaluation have pote ntial relevance for quality measure development, although such quality measures do not exist at present. A firs t step toward development of scientifically sound quality measures is identification of discrete indicators that signal the delivery of high-quality care. This step may be challenging to accomplish given the breadth of content within the initial psychi - atric assessment and the difficulty in ascertaining evaluation details from chart or administrative data. However, it may still be possible to use available evidence and expert-recommended consen- sus to develop and specify electronic and clinical data registry quality measures. Additionally, as discussed in the APA Practice Guidelines for the Psyc hiatric Evaluation of Adults , 3rd edition (American Psychiatric Association 2016a), qual ity improvement efforts at the local level could assess whether specific aspects of the evaluation such as a risk assessment were completed while still allowing flex- ibility in the documentation of findings. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 17 STATEMENT 2: Use of Quantitative Measures APA recommends (1C) that the initial psychiatric evaluation of a patient with a possible psychotic disorder include a quantitative measure to identify and determine the severity of symptoms and impairments of functioning that may be a focus of treatment. Implementation APA's Practice Guidelines for the Psyc hiatric Evaluation of Adults , 3rd edition (American Psychiatric Association 2016a) provides a general description of the use of quantitative measures as part of the initial psychiatric evaluation. In the assessment of a patient with a possible psychotic disorder, quantitative measures can also be used to help detect and determine the severity of psychosis and associated symptoms. The intent of using a quantitative measure is not to establish a diagnosis but rather to complement other aspects of the screening and assessment process. Depending on the measure, it can aid in treatment planning by providing a structured replicable way to document the patient's baseline symptoms. It can also help to determine which symptoms should be the target of intervention on the basis of such factors as freq uency of occurrence, magnitude, potential for asso - ciated harm to the patient or others, and associated distress to the patient. As treatment proceeds, use of quantitative measures allows more precise tracking of whether nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments are having their intended effect or whether a shift in the treatment plan is needed. This record of a patient's response to treatment is of particular value when the treatment is nonstandard (e.g., comb ination of antipsychotics) or expensive. It can also provide helpful information about the actual ef fects of prior treatments. In addition, patients' ratings can be compared with fami ly members' impressions of treatment effects to clarify the lon- gitudinal course of the patient's illness. Much of the treatment-related research in psychiat ry has used clinician-rated scales to determine patient outcomes; however, patient-rated scales are typically less time-consuming to administer than clinician-rated scales. In addition , they provide important insights into the patient's experience that support person-centered care. The use of anchored, sel f-rated scales with criteria to assess the severity and frequency of symptoms can also help patients become more informed self-observers. However, correlations between patient- and clinician-rated scales are often modest (Harvey 2011; Spitz et al. 2017), suggesting that both types of quantitative measures provid e useful information. If a mis- match is noted in the self-assessment of patients as compared with assessments of other observers, this may provide information relevant to outcomes. The accuracy of self-assessments of ability, skills, performance, or decisions (also termed introspective accuracy) is a better predictor of every- day functional deficits than obje ctive measures of neurocognitive or social cognitive performance (Silberstein and Harvey 2019). The exact frequency at which measures are warranted will depend on clinical circumstances. Use of quantitative measures over time will help assure that key elements of information are collected to guide treatment (Lewis et al. 2 019). Consequently, it is preferable to use a consistent approach to quantitative measurement for a given patient beca use each rating scale defines and measures psy- chosis and other symptoms differently. Although recommending a particular scale, patient- or clinician-rated, is outside the scope of this practice guideline, a number of objective, quantitative rating scal es to monitor clinical status in schizophrenia are available (American Psychiatric Association 2013a; Rush et al. 2008). The Clini- cian-Rated Dimensions of Psyc hosis Symptom Severity (America n Psychiatric Association 2013b), which is included in DSM-5 for further research and clinical evaluation, contains eight domains that are rated on a scale from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe) on the basis of symptoms in the prior 7 days. A 6-item version of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS-6; Bech et al. 2018; \u00d8stergaard et al. 2018b) consists of the PANSS items for delusions, conceptual disorgani- zation, hallucinations, blunted affect, social withdrawal, and lack of spontaneity and flow of con- APA Practice Guidelines 18 versation (Kay et al. 1987). Data on the PANSS-6 sugg est that it correlates highly with scores on the 30-item version of the Positive and Negative Sy ndrome Scale (PANSS-30; \u00d8stergaard et al. PANSS-6 is sensitive to ch anges with treatment and able to identify symp- tom remission with a high degree of accuracy (\u00d8stergaard et al. 2018a, 2018b) if individuals who are performing ratings are appropri ately trained (Opler et al. 2017) . Clinician-rated scales may also be selected to assess specific clinical presentations, such as using the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale for individuals with catatonic features (Bus h et al. 1996a). Other clinician-rated scales are commonly used for monitoring ps ychopathology in research but are likely to be too lengthy for routine clinical use. These include the PANSS-30 (Kay et al. 1987), the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS; Andreasen 1984a), the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS; Andreasen 1984b), and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale MH and Addiction Treatment/First Episode et al. 2005; Overall and Gorham 1962; Ventura et al. 1993). In terms of patient-rated scales, the DSM-5 Se lf-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014 Adult (American Psychiatric Association 2013c) includes a total of 23 items in 13 domains, with only 2 items related to psychosis. Nevertheless, it ma y be useful for identifying and tracking symptoms other than psychosis, including th ose related to co-occurring disorders. DSM-5 also includes 36-item self- and proxy-administered versions of the Wo rld Health Organization Disability Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) for assessing functioning difficulti es due to health and mental health conditions (American Psychiatri c Association 2013d; \u00dcst\u00fcn et al. 2010). Other options for assessing function- ing include the Social and Occupational Function ing Assessment Scale (SOFAS; American Psychi - atric Association 2000) and the Personal and Social Performance scale (Morosini et al. 2000). Several versions of Patient-Reported Ou tcomes Measurement Information Sy stem (PROMIS) scales, which ad- dress social roles and functioning, are also available (www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement- systems/promis). The use of ratings from other in formants is particularly helpful in assessing the patient's level of functioning because individuals with schizophrenia often have a different view of their functioning than do family members or others involved in their lives (Harvey 2011). For a nonspecific measure of quality of life, patients can be asked to rate th eir overall (physical and mental) quality of life in the past month on a scale from 0 (\"about as bad as dying\") to 10 (\"life is per- fect\") (Un\u00fctzer et al. 2002). In individuals with chro nic mental illness, the Satisfaction With Life Scale (Diener et al. 1985) has been developed and used to assess life satisfaction and quality of life. Quality of life can also be measured using a scale develo ped by the World Health Organization, the WHOQOL- BREF et al. 2004; WHOQOL Group 1998) ( http://depts.washington.edu/seaqol/ WHOQOL-BREF). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention He althy Days Measure (HRQOL- 14) and Healthy Days Core Module (HRQOL-4) ( ww w.cdc.gov/hrqol/hrqol14_measure.htm ) have also been used in general population samples to assess physical and emotional symptoms as re- lated to an individual's perceived sens e of well-being (Moriarty et al. 2003). Rating scales should always be implemented in a way that supports developing and maintaining the therapeutic relationship with the patient. Revi ewing scale results with the patient can help fos- ter a collaborative dialogue about progress toward symptom improvement, functioning gains, and recovery goals. Such review may help clinicians, patients, families, and other support persons rec-ognize that improvement is taking place or, conversely, identify issues that need further attention. If more than one quantitative measure is being used, it is important to minimize duplication of questions and avoid overwhelming the patient with an excessive number of scales to complete. In ad-dition, when choosing among available quantitative measures, objectives of scale use (e.g., screening, documenting baseline symptoms, on going monitoring) should be considered. Optimal scale proper- ties (e.g., sensitivity, specificity) will differ depending on the desired purpose, but assessments of scale validity and reliability are typically conducte d cross-sectionally in research contexts. Because many scales ask the pati ent to rate symptoms over seve ral weeks, they may not be sen- sitive to change. This can be problematic in ac ute care settings, where treatment adjustments and The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 19 symptom improvement can occur fairly quickly. Some symptom-based quantitative measures fo- cus either on symptom frequency over the observ ation period or on symptom severity. Although these features often increase or decrease in parallel, that is not invariably the case. Other quantita - tive measures ask the patient to consider both symptom frequency and severity, which can also make the findings difficult to interpret. Other factors that can affect the st atistical reliability and validity of rating scale measures include comorbid illnesses and patient age, language, rac e, ethnicity, cultural ba ckground, literacy, and health literacy. These factors and ot hers can lead patients to misint erpret questions or bias the rat- ings that they record, either unintentionally (e.g., to please the clinician with their progress) or in- tentionally (e.g., to obtain contro lled substances, to support claims of disability). Thus, the answers to questions and the summative scores on quantitati ve measures need to be interpreted in the con- text of the clinical presentation. The type and extent of quantitative measures used will also be mediated by the clinical setting, the time available for evaluation, and the urgency of the situation. In some clinical contexts, such as a planned outpatient assessment , patients may be asked to complete electronic- or paper-based quantitative measures, either prior to the visit or on arrival at the office (Allen et al. 2009; Harding et al. 2011). Between or prior to vi sits, electronic approaches (e.g., mobile phone applications, clin- ical registries, patient portal sites in electronic health records) may also facilitate obtaining quanti-tative measurements (Lewis et al. 2019; Palmier-Claus et al. 2012; K. Wang et al. 2018). In other clin- ical contexts, such as acute in patient settings, electronic modes of data capture may be more cumbersome, and patients may need more assistance in completion of scales. As an alternative, printed versions of scales may be completed by th e patient or a proxy or administered by the clini- cian. In other clinical circumstances, however, prin ted or electronic versions of quantitative scales may not be readily available or information may no t be available to complete all scale items. In emergency settings, use of a quanti tative rating scale may need to be postponed until the acute cri- sis has subsided or until the patient's clinical status pe rmits a detailed examination. Although available information suggests that ambulatory patients ar e generally cooperative, some individuals may be unwilling to complete qu antitative measures (Narrow et al. 2013). Severe symptoms, co-occurring psychiatric conditions, low health literacy, reading difficulties, or cogni- tive impairment may limit some patients' ability to complete self-report inst ruments (Harding et al. 2011; Valenstein et al. 2009; Zimmerman et al. 2011 ). In these circumstances, it may be necessary to place greater reliance on collateral sources of in formation such as family members, other treating health professionals, or staff members of community residence programs, if applicable. If collateral sources of information are not immediately available, treatment may also need to proceed, with ad-justments in the plan, if indicated, as additional knowledge is gained. If time constraints are pres-ent, the clinician may wish to focu s on rating of relevant target symptoms (e.g., on a Likert scale). In emergent circumstances, safety of the patient and others must take precedence; the initial assess- ment may need to be brief, with a more detailed assessment and incorporation of quantitative mea - sures once the acute clinical situation has been stabilized. Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits Clinical decision-making, including but not limi ted to diagnosis and trea tment planning, requires a careful and systematic assessme nt of the type, frequency, and magnitude of psychiatric symptoms as well as an assessment of the impact of thos e symptoms on the patient's day-to-day functioning and quality of life. Intuitively, and by analogy with other medical specialties in which treatment is guided by standardized measurement (e.g., of physiological signs or laboratory tests), the use of a systematic and quantifiable approach to assess ment would seemingly produce better patient out- APA Practice Guidelines 20 comes and greater standardization of care across patients. As electronic health records become more commonly used, electronic ca pture of quantitative measures can facilitate use of computer- ized decision-support systems in guiding eviden ce-based treatment, catalyzing additional im- provements in outcomes and quality of care. Use of a quantitative measure as part of the init ial evaluation can establish baseline information on the patient's symptoms and level of functioning and can help determine specific targets of treat- ment in the context of shared decision-making. When administered through paper-based or elec- tronic self-report and as compared with a clinical interview, a quantitative measure may help the clinician to conduct a more consistent and compre hensive review of the multiplicity of symptoms that the patient may be experiencing. Using system atic measures may also increase the efficiency of asking routine questions and allow more time for clinicians to focus on symptoms of greatest se- verity or issues of most concern to the patient. Such measures may also facilitate collection of infor - mation from the patient's family or other collat eral informants on factors such as symptoms or functioning. When used on a longitudinal basis, quantitative measures can help determine whether nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments are having their intended effect or whether a shift in the treatment plan is needed to address symptoms, treatment-related side effects, level of distress, functioning impairments, or pote ntial for harm to the patient or others. Without the use of a consistent quantitative meas ure, recall biases may confound the ability of patients and clinicians to compare past and curren t levels or patterns of symptoms and functioning. When patients have had substantial improvements in symptoms and functioning, it can be easy to focus on the improvements and overlook residual symptoms or side effects of treatment that are contributing to ongoing impairment or reduced quality of life. Thus, ongoing use of quantitative assessments may foster identification of residual symptoms or impairments and early detection of illness recurrence. Systematic use of quantitative measures can also facilitate communication among treating clinicians and can serve as a basis for enhanced management of populations of pa-tients as well as individual patients. Although mobile apps may be capable of assisting with quan - titative measurement, there is no current evidence on which to base recommendations about use of mobile apps in the treatment of schizophrenia. Harms The harms of using a quantitative measure include the time required for administration and review. The amount of time available for an initial psychi atric evaluation is typica lly constrained by clini- cian availability, cost, and other fa ctors. Under such circumstances, ti me that is used to obtain quan- titative measures could introduce harms by redu cing time available to address other issues of importance to the patient or of relevance to clin ical decision-making. Overreliance on quantitative measures may also cause other aspects of the pati ent's symptoms and clinical presentation to be overlooked. Some patients may view quantitative measures as impersonal or may feel annoyed by having to complete detailed scales, particularly if done freq uently. If a patient feels negatively about quanti- tative measures, this could alter the therapeutic al liance. In addition, some patients may have dif - ficulty completing self-report scales or may interpret questions incorrectly. Patients may also provide inaccurate information about their sympto ms, and relying on inaccurate information can have a negative impact on clinical decision-making, including recommendations for treatment. Systematic use of measures may require changes in workflow or staffing to distribute scales, in - crease time needed to review results with the patient, or lead to unreimbursed costs (e.g., to inte-grate measures into electronic health record system s, to pay to use copyrigh ted versions of scales). Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that the majority of patients are cooperative with and accepting of quantitative measures as part of an initial or subsequent assessment. Most patients will be able to The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 21 appreciate the ways in which the use of quantitative measures will be of benefit to them. For exam - ple, in the testing of the DSM-5 Cross-Cutting Sy mptom Measure as part of the DSM-5 field trials, quantitative measures were found to be acceptable to patients (Clarke et al. 2014; Mo cicki et al. 2013), and only a small fraction of individuals fe lt that measurement of symptoms would not be helpful to their treating clinician (Mo cicki et al. 2013). The fact that the clinician is using a systematic approach to address the patients' symptoms and functioning sends a positive message that could im prove the therapeutic relationship. Especially in developed countries, patients are used to and ex pect digital, computerized information exchange, including for health-related monitoring and commu nication. For these patien ts, the use of quanti- tative measures within the context of an electron ic health record, mobile app, or other computer - ized technology may be more convenient. Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statemen t were viewed as far outweighing the potential harms. This recommendation is also consistent with Guideline VII, \"Quantitative Assessment,\" in the APA's Practice Guidelines for the Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults , 3rd edition (American Psychiat- ric Association 2016a). Although quantitative meas ures have been used for reporting purposes as well as research, the level of research evidence fo r this recommendation is rated as low because it remains unclear whether routine use of these scales in clinical practice improves overall outcomes. Nonetheless, expert opinion suggests that use of quantitative measures will enhance clinical deci- sion-making and improve treatment outcomes. For ad ditional discussion of the research evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 2. There is minimal research on the harms of using qu antitative measures as part of the psychiatric evaluation as compared with assessment as usual. However, expert opinion suggests that harms of assessment are minimal compared with the benefits of such assessments in improving identifica- tion and assessment of psychiatric symptoms. For additional details, see the APA's Practice Guide- lines for the Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults , 3rd edition (American Psychiatric Association 2016a). Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members There were no differences of opinion. The writing group voted unanimously in favor of this recom- mendation. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations Multiple guidelines from other or ganizations were reviewed (Addington et al. 2017a, 2017b; Barnes et al. 2011; Buchanan et al. and Addi ngton 2017; Galletly et al. 2016; Hasan et al. 2012, 2013, 2015; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014; Norman et al. 2017; Pringsheim et al. 2017; Scottish Intercollegiat e Guidelines Network 2013). None of these guidelines specifically recommend using quantitative measures as part of the initial assessment in individuals with schizophrenia, but several guidelin es (Barnes et al. 2011; Galletly et al. 2016) do recommend use of rating scales under some circumstances at ba seline or as part of ongoing monitoring. Quality Measurement Considerations There is insufficient consensus on the most appropri ate quantitative measures (i.e., rating scales) to use in assessing individuals with psychotic disord ers, including schizophrenia. Nevertheless, data do support the use of clinician-reported, symptom- based ratings to guide treatment. Patient-rated scales may be clinically useful in identifying pati ent concerns or subjective experiences (e.g., med- ication side effects). On the basis of these potentia l benefits, a process-focused internal or health sys- tem-based quality improvement measure could dete rmine rates of quantitative measure use, and APA Practice Guidelines 22 quality improvement initiatives could be implemen ted to increase the frequency with which such measures are used in individuals with schizophrenia. STATEMENT 3: Evidence-Based Treatment Planning APA recommends (1C) that patients with schizophrenia have a documented, comprehensive, and person-centered treatment plan that includes evidence-based nonpharmacological and pharmaco- logical treatments. Implementation When treating individuals with schizophrenia, a person-centered treatment plan should be devel- oped, documented in the medical record, and update d with the patient at appropriate intervals. A person-centered treatment plan can be recorded as part of an evaluation note or progress note and does not need to adhere to a defined development process (e.g., face-to-face multidisciplinary team meeting) or format (e.g., time-specified goals and objectives). Depending on the urgency of the ini- tial clinical presentation, the availability of laboratory results, and other sources of information, the initial treatment plan may need to be augmented ov er several visits as more details of history and treatment response are obtained. As treatment proceeds, the treatment plan will require iterative reevaluation and adjustment prompted by such factors as inadequate treatment response, difficulties with tolerability or adher- ence, impairments in insight, changes in presenting issues or symptoms, or revisions in diagnosis. In adapting treatment to the needs of the individual patient, tailoring of the treatment plan may also be needed on the basis of sociocultural or demographic factors, with an aim of enhancing qual- ity of life or aspects of functioning (e.g., social , academic, occupational). Factors that influence med - ication metabolism (e.g., age, sex, body weight, renal or hepatic function, smoking status, use of multiple concurrent medications) may also requir e adjustments to the treatment plan in terms of either typical medication doses or frequency of monitoring. For most individuals with schizophre - nia, it is challenging to piece together a coherent picture of the patient's longitudinal course from medical records. Thus, it is important to note th e rationale for any changes in the treatment plan as well as the specific changes that are being made because an accurate history of past and current treatments and responses to them is a key part of future treatment planning. Aims of Treatment Planning The overarching aims of treatment planning are 1) to promote and maintain recovery, 2) to maximize quality of life and adaptive functioning, and 3) to reduce or eliminate symptoms. To achieve these aims, it is crucial to identify the patient's aspirati ons, goals for treatment, and treatment-related pref - erences. Depending on prevailing state laws, psychiatric advance directives are one approach to en- couraging patients to contemplate and state their preferences about treatment choices (Easter et al. 2017; Kemp et al. 2015; Shields et al. 2014; Wilder et al. 2010). For patients who have completed a psychiatric advance directive, well ness recovery action plan (Copel and 2000), or individualized cri- sis prevention or safety plan (Stanley and Brown 2012, 2019; Stanley et al. 2018), these documents will be important to review with the patient when crafting a person-centered approach to care. Dis- cussions with the patient, other treating health professionals, family members, and others involved in the patient's life can each be vital in developi ng a full picture of the patient and formulating a person-centered treatment plan, using shared decision-making whenever possible. The patient and others may express opinions about specific treatm ent approaches or identify practical barriers to the patient's ability to participate in treatment, su ch as lack of insight, cognitive impairments, dis- organization, or inadequate social resources. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 23 Elements of th e Treatment Plan Depending on the clinical circumstances and input from the patient and others, a comprehensive and person-centered treatment plan will typicall y delineate treatments aimed at improving func- tioning, reducing positive and negative symptoms , and addressing co-occurring psychiatric symp- toms or disorders. In each of these respects, it is essential to consider both nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatment approaches and recognize that a combination of nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments will likely be need ed to optimize outcomes. Other elements of the treatment plan may include the following: determining the most appropriate treatment setting delineating plans for addressing risks of harm to self or others (if present) addressing barriers to adherence engaging family members and others involved in the patient's life providing information to patients, family memb ers, and others involved in the patient's life about treatment options, early sy mptoms of relapse, need for ongoing monitoring, coping strat - egies, case management services, and community resources, including peer-support programs incorporating goals of treatment related to social support networks interpersonal, family, or intimate relationships parenting status living situation past trauma or victimization school or employment financial considerations, including disability income support, when indicated insurance status legal system involvement identifying addi tional needs for history or mental status examination physical examination (either by the evaluating clinician or by another health professional) laboratory testing, imaging, el ectrocardiography (ECG), or othe r clinical studies (if indicated on the basis of the history, exam ination, and planned treatments) collaborating with other treating clinicians (including provision of integrated care) to avoid fragmentation of treatment efforts and assure that co-occurring substance use disorders and physical health conditions are managed Engagement of Family Members and Other Persons of Support Discussions with the patient, family members, and others will typically occur as part of the initial assessment (see Statement 1), and additional inpu t will be needed as treatment proceeds and the treatment plan is updat ed. Family members and othe rs involved in the patient's life may also ex- press specific concerns about the individual's symptoms or behaviors, which, if present, should be documented and addressed. Most individuals welcome involvement of family members and other persons of support (Cohen et al. 2013; Drapalski et al. 2018; Mueser et al. 2015), and family members can be an important part of the care team. Family members can also be provided with educational materials or directed to organizations that offe r education to family members and other persons of support (Mental Health America 2019; Nati onal Alliance on Mental Illness 2019a). Strategies to Promote Adherence Strategies to promote adherence are always important to consider wh en developing a patient-centered treatment plan (Ferrando et al. 2014). Maintainin g adherence to treatment is often challenging APA Practice Guidelines 24 (Acosta et al. 2012; Shafrin et al. 2016; Valenstein et al. 2006), and poor adherence is associated with poor outcomes, including increased risks of relapse, rehospitalization, suicidal and aggressive behav- iors, and mortality (Bowtell et al. 2018; Cassidy et al . 2018; Goff et al. 2017; Hawton et al. et al. 2018; al. 2019; al. 2012; al. et al. 2018; Vermeulen et al. 2017; Witt et al. 2013). Treatment planning to address adherence will depend on the specific contributing factors and whether reduced adherence is related to medication use, missed appoint- ments, or other aspects of treatment. Issues that may influence adherence include, but are not limited to, lack of awareness of illness, forgetting to take doses, difficulties managing complex regimens (e.g., due to cognitive impairment, frequency of doses, or number of medications), side effects that are of particular importance to the patient (e.g., weight ga in, akathisia, sexual dysfunction, effects on cogni- tion), financial barriers (e.g., cost, insurance coverage), perceived risks and benefits of treatment, in- sufficient understanding of medication benefits for symptoms that are important to the patient, ambivalence or suspiciousness of medications or trea tment in general, lack of a perceived need for treatment (e.g., due to feeling good or not viewing self as ill; due to personal, religious, or cultural be- liefs), co-occurring conditions (e.g., depression; al cohol, cannabis, or other substance use disorder), high levels of hostility, persecut ory delusions, prior difficulties with adherence, prior experiences with treatment (e.g., effectiveness, side effects), lim ited geographic availability or accessibility of ser- vices, financial or insurance constr aints on medications or visits, difficulties in the therapeutic rela- tionship, lack of support from significant others for treatm ent, cultural or fam ily beliefs about illness or treatment, and perceptions of stigma about havi ng an illness and taking medication (Acosta et al. Ascher-Svanum et al. 2017; Garc\u00eda et al. 2016; Haddad et al. 2014; Hartung et al. 2017; Hatch et al. 2017; Hi gashi et al. 2013; Kane et al. et et al. 2016; Wade et al. 2017). Adherence with appointments can also be influe nced by financial barriers, diffi- culties scheduling visits around work or school sc hedules, or issues with transportation or with childcare. Addressing these barriers as part of th e treatment plan will require active collaboration and problem-solving between the clinician and pati ent, often with input from the patient's family and others involved in the pati ent's' life (Mueser et al. 2015). When assessing adherence, it is important to take a patient-centered approach in inquiring in a nonjudgmental way whether the individual has ex perienced difficulties with taking medication (Haddad et al. 2014). Obtaining information from pa tient diaries, patient-co mpleted rating scales, pharmacy records, family members, or other collateral sources of information can be useful supple-ments to subjective patient reporting (Acosta et al . 2012; Haddad et al. 2014; Hatch et al. 2017; Kane et al. 2013). Tablet counts, monito ring using electronic pill bottle caps, and drug formulations with implanted sensors have also been used to assess adherence with antipsychotic medications (Acosta et al. 2012; Haddad et al. 2014). It can also be useful to obtain medication blood levels. Levels of clozapine have been best studied, but blood levels of other antips ychotic medications are also avail- able. Although the utility of routine therapeutic monitoring is unclear for antipsychotic medica-tions other than clozapine, blood levels may help in establishing whether a patient is taking the medication (Hiemke et al. 2018; Horvitz-Lennon et al. 2017; Lopez and Kane 2013; Lopez et al. 2017; McCutcheon et al. 2018; Predmore et al. 2018). Ur ine levels of antipsychotic medications can also be used to assess for adhe rence (Velligan et al. 2006). In terms of enhancing adherence, a wide range of approaches have been tried. However, evi- dence on the most effective techniques remains limited (Hartung et al. 2017), and different ap - proaches will likely be needed for different patien ts. A checklist that includ es barriers, facilitators, and motivators for adherence has been developed and may be helpful in promoting discussion and identifying adherence-related factors in individual patients (Pyne et al. 2014). In addition to con- ducting ongoing monitoring of adherence as treatmen t proceeds, it can be helpful to focus on opti- mizing treatment efficacy, addres sing side effects and concerns about treatment, adjusting dosing to minimize side effects while maintaining efficacy, providing information about the illness and its treatments, engaging in shared decision-making, fostering a strong therapeutic alliance, and engag- The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 25 ing family members and other community and social supports, as appropriate (Acosta et al. 2012; Haddad et al. 2014; Hamann and 2019; Kane et al. 2013; Rezansoff et al. 2017). For some patients, the formulation of the antips ychotic medication may influence adherence (see Statement 4, Table 3). For example, r apidly dissolvin g tablets, oral concentrates, or LAI formulations may be preferable for patients who have difficulty swallow ing pills or who are ambivalent about medications and inconsistent in swallowing them. For individuals who have difficulty remembering to take medication, LAI formulatio ns of medications can be used, oral medication regimens can be simplified to reduce the number of pills or daily doses, watches or cell phone alarms can be used as reminders to take medications, pillboxes may be fill ed with the week's medication, and family or sig- nificant others may be enlisted to assist with me dication if cognitive impairments are present. An- other approach that can be used to improve adhere nce is behavioral tailori ng, which involves cuing oneself to take medications by incorporating adhe rence into one's daily routine (Kreyenbuhl et al. 2016; Mueser et al. 2002). If financial issues with medications are affecting adherence, reassessment of the treatment regimen may be needed, or patients' assistance programs may be pursued (e.g., through pharmaceutical company programs or a discount program such as GoodRx, www.goodrx.com ). When a patient does not appear for appointments or is nonadherent in other ways, assertive outreach such as telephone calls or secure messages may be helpful in reengaging the patient in treatment. Addressing Risks for Suicid al and Aggressive Behavior Identifying risk factors and estimating risks for suicidal and aggressive behaviors are essential parts of psychiatric evaluation (American Psychiatric As sociation 2016a and as described in detail in Statement 1, subsection \"Impleme ntation\"). Despite identification of these risk factors, it is not possible to predict whether an individual patient will engage in aggressive behaviors or attempt or die by suicide. However, when an increased risk fo r such behaviors is present, it is important that the treatment plan reevaluates the setting of care and implements approaches to target and reduce modifiable risk factors. Although demographic an d historical risk factors are static, potentially modifiable risk factors may includ e poor adherence, core symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g., halluci- nations, delusions), co-occurring symptoms (e.g., depression, hopelessness, hostility, impulsivity), and co-occurring diagnoses (e.g., depression, alcoho l use disorder, other substance use disorders). Additional elements of the treatment plan can addr ess periods of increased risk (e.g., shortly after diagnosis, during incarceration, su bsequent to hospital discharge). Addressing Tobacco Use and Ot her Substance Use Disorders Individuals with schizophre nia have high rates of nicotine dependence (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020; Cook et al. 2014; de Leon an d Diaz 2005; Dickerson et al. 2018; Hartz et al. 2012; al. 2014; Wium-A ndersen et al. 2015), canna bis use (Brunette et al. 2018; Hartz et al. Hunt et al. 2010; Nesv\u00e5g et al. 2015; Toftdahl et al. 2016), and use of alcohol and other substances (Brunette et al. 2018; Hartz et al. 2014; Hunt et al. 2018; Nesv\u00e5g et al. 2015; Toftdahl et al. 2016). Smokin g is a major contributor to increased mortality in individuals with serious mental illness (Reynolds et al. 2018; Tam et al. 2016), and the adverse health consequences of smoking are well docume nted (Lariscy et al. 2018; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2014; Van Schayck et al. 2017). Thus, smokin g cessation is recom- mended for any individual who smokes. Some studies have assessed smoking cessation ap - proaches targeted to individuals with mental il lnesses, but specific evidence in patients with schizophrenia is still limited (Sharma et al. 2017 ). Thus, smoking cessation approaches will typi- cally follow guidelines for the general populati on (National Cancer Institute 2019; SAMHSA-HRSA Center of Excellence for Integrated Health Soluti ons 2018; Siu et al. 2015; Van Schayck et al. 2017; Verbiest et al. 2017). Although quit rates may be lower in individuals with schizophrenia than in the general population (Lum et al. 2018; Streck et al. 2020), health education and motivational in- APA Practice Guidelines 26 terviewing approaches can be he lpful in those who are ambivalent about stopping cigarette use (Levounis et al. 2017) or who have had prio r unsuccessful attempts at smoking cessation. Rates of cannabis use and other substance use are also increased among indi viduals with schizophre - nia (Hartz et al. 2014; Hunt et al. 2018; Swartz et al. 2006). Cannabis use has been associated with an increased incidence (Nielsen et al. 2017; Vaucher et al. 2018) and earlier onset (Donoghue et al. 2014; Helle et al. 2016; Kelley et al. 2016; Large et al. 2011) of schizophrenia, and it may also contrib- ute to a higher burden of symptoms (Carney et al. 2017; Oluwoye et al. 2018). Other substance use disorders are associated with a poorer prognosis in individuals with schizophrenia (Brunette et al. 2018; Conus et al. 2017; Weibell et al. 2017) and, as noted previously, can contribute to risk of suicide or aggressive behavior. Thus, it is important for the treatment plan to address substance use disor- ders when they are present. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) can be integrated into a range of clinical settings (A gerwala and McCance-Katz 2012; SAMHSA-HRSA Center of Excellence for Integrated Health Soluti ons 2019). Often, a comprehensive integrated treat - ment model is suggested in which the same clinicians or team of clinicians provide treatment for schizophrenia as well as treatment of substance use disorders. However, if an integrated treatment is unavailable, the treatment plan should addres s both disorders with communication and collab- oration among treating clinicians. For patients wh o do not recognize the need for treatment of a substance use disorder, a stagewise motivational approach can be pursued (Catley et al. 2016; Levounis et al. 2017). Addressing Other Concomitant Psyc hiatric Symptoms and Diagnoses Depressive symptoms are common in individuals with schizophrenia and should be addressed as part of treatment planning. The approach to treating depression will be grounded in a careful differ- ential diagnosis that considers the possible contri butions of demoralization, negative symptoms of schizophrenia, side effects of antipsychotic medica tions, substance intoxication or withdrawal, phys- ical health condition, or a co-occurring major depressive episode. Depressive symptoms that occur during an acute episode of psychosis often impr ove as psychotic symptoms respond to treatment. Evidence on the use of antidepressants to trea t depression in individuals with schizophrenia comes from multiple trials, many of which have small sample sizes or factors that increase the risk of bias in the findings (Dond\u00e9 et al. 2018; Gregor y et al. 2017; Helfer et al. 2016). Nevertheless, a meta-analysis suggests that the addition of anti depressant medications results in small beneficial effects on symptoms of depression, quality of life, and response rates as well as on positive symp-toms, negative symptoms, and overall symptoms (Helfer et al. 2016). Th ese effects were more prominent in patients with more severe depressi ve symptoms. Furthermore, antidepressant treat- ment did not appear to be associated with exacerba tion of psychosis or significant differences in ad- verse effects (Helfer et al. 2016). Nonpharmacologic al treatments for depression in schizophrenia have been less well studied but could also be incorporated into treatment planning (Dond\u00e9 et al. 2018; Opoka and Lincoln 2017). Treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (Bra nd et al. 2018; Sin et al. 2017b) and anxiety (Howells et al. 2017) in individuals with schizophrenia have been less well studied. Nevertheless, many individuals with schizophrenia will have ex perienced violent victimization (de Vries et al. 2019; Morgan et al. 2016; Roy et al. 2014) or chil dhood adversity (Bonoldi et al. 2013; Schalinski et al. 2019; Trotta et al. 2015; Varese et al. 2012), and the impact of these experiences needs to be con- sidered as part of a patient-centered treatment plan (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment 2014). When anxiety symptoms are present in individuals with schizophrenia, the possible contributions of psychotic symptoms, medication side effects, subs tance intoxication or withdrawal, or co-occurring anxiety disorders may suggest an approach to treatm ent. Given the relative safety of adjunctive an- tidepressant medications in individuals with schizophrenia and depression, these medications may be considered if otherwise indicated to treat pos ttraumatic stress disorder or an anxiety disorder. On the other hand, studies on the use of benzodi azepines in schizophrenia are limited (Dold et al. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 27 2012), and long-term use of benzodiazepines may be associated with increased risk of poorer out- comes, including side effects (Dold et al. 2013; Fond et al. 2018; Fo ntanella et al. 2016; Tiihonen et al. 2016) or misuse (Maust et al. 2019). Nonpharm acological treatments for posttraumatic stress dis- order in individuals with schizophrenia have been less well studied but may have modest benefits and do not appear to have significant adverse effects as compared with usual care (Brand et al. 2018; Sin et al. 2017b). In terms of the use of stimulants to treat preex isting attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in individuals with schizophrenia, available evidence is also very limited but suggests a potential for worsening of psychotic symptoms as well as potential for development of a stimulant use disorder (Sara et al. 2014; Solmi et al. 2019). Thus, if st imulant medications are us ed, monitoring for these possible adverse effects is warranted as part of the treatment plan. Addressing Other Concomi tant Health Conditions As described in Statement 1, other health conditio ns are more frequent in individuals with serious mental illness in general (Firth et al. 2019; Janssen et al. 2015; McGi nty et al. 2016) and schizophrenia in particular (Henderson et al. 2015). Such disord ers include but are not limited to poor oral health (Kisely et al. 2015), hepa titis C infection (Chasser et al. 2017; Hauser and Kern 2015; Hughes et al. 2016), HIV infection (Hobkirk et al. 2015; Hughes et al. 2016), cancer (Olfson et al. 2015), sleep apnea (Myles et al. 2016; Stubbs et al. 2016b), obesity (Janssen et al. 2015), diabet es mellitus (Vancampfort et al. 2016a), metabolic syndrome (V ancampfort et al. 2015), and cardiovascular disease (Correll et al. 2017c). These disorders, if present, can contribute to mortality or reduced quality of life, and some may be induced or exacerbated by psychiatri c medications. Impairment s in renal and hepatic function, if present, can influence treatment recommendations. Table 2 (see Statement 1) provides a discussion of suggested p hysical and laboratory assessments for patients with schizophre nia as part of initia l evaluation and follow-up assessments. Such assess- ments are important for prevention, early recognition, and treatment of abnormalities such as glu- cose dysregulation, hyperlipidem ia, and metabolic syndrome. It is important that patients have access to primary care clinicians who can work wi th the psychiatrist to di agnose and treat concur- rent physical health conditions (American Psychi atric Association 2016a), but the psychiatrist may also provide ongoing monitoring and treatment of common medical conditions in conjunction with primary care clinicians (Druss et al. 2018). Pregnancy and Postpartum Period Women with childbearing potential and at risk for pregnancy should be assisted in obtaining effec-tive contraception if pregnancy is not desired. For women who are planning to become pregnant or who are pregnant or in the postpartum period, it is essential to collaborate with the patient, her ob - stetrician-gynecologist or other ob stetric practitioner, and, if involved, her partner or other persons of support. For women who are breastfeeding, collab oration with the infant's pediatrician is simi- larly important. The overall goal is to develop a pl an of care aimed at optimizing outcomes for both the patient and her infant. In addition, during pregnancy and postpartum, frequent reassessment will be needed to determine whether any modifications to the treatment plan are indicated. As with any decisions related to the use of ps ychiatric medications prior to conception, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding, it is essential to consider the potential benefits of treatment as well as the potential harms of untreated illness and the potential for negative fetal or neonatal ef - fects. Untreated or inadequately treated maternal psychiatric illness can result in poor adherence to prenatal care, inadequate nutrition, increased alco hol or tobacco use, and disruptions to the family environment and mother-infant bonding (ACOG Committee on Practice Bulletins\u2014Obstetrics 2008; American Academy of Pediatrics and the Am of Obst etricians and Gynecolo- with ch ildbearing potential, de cisions about medications and advice about contraceptive prac tices should consider the potential effects if pregnancy were to APA Practice Guidelines 28 occur. Some medications are best avoided in women with childbearing potential; for example, val- proic acid should be avoided because of its terato genic effects (Briggs et al. 2017) and association with maternal metabolic syndrome. All psychotropic medications studied to date cr oss the placenta, are present in amniotic fluid, and enter human breast milk (American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Ob- stetricians and Gynecologists 2017) . In addition, the period from the third through the eighth week of gestation is associated with greatest risk for teratogenesis (American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gy necologists 2017). If a woman becomes pregnant while taking an antipsychotic medication, consideration should be gi ven to consulting an obstetri- cian-gynecologist or maternal/fetal medicine subspecialist in addition to discussion with the pre - scribing clinician before indicated psychotropic medications are stopped to determine whether the risks of stopping the medication outweigh any possible fetal risks (American Academy of Pediat-rics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2017; U.S. Food and Drug Ad - ministration 2011a). For many women, the eighth week of gestation will already have passed before obstetric care begins, and stopping medication will not avoid or re duce teratogenic risk. Thus, for a woman with schizophrenia, the benefits of continued treatment with an tipsychotic medications in minimizing relapse will generally outweigh the potential for fetal risk (Briggs et al. 2017). Knowledge of the effects of antipsychotic medica tions is limited to observational and registry- based studies. Although limited information is known about newer second-generation antipsy- chotic medications (SGAs), first-generation anti psychotic medications (FGAs) have been in wide use for more than 40 years, and older SGAs have been available for several decades. The available data suggest that these medications have minimal risk in terms of teratogenic or toxic effects on the fetus (ACOG Committee on Practice Bulletins\u2014O bstetrics 2008; Briggs et al. 2017; Chisolm and Payne 2016). There does appear to be a risk of withdraw al symptoms or neurological effects of an - tipsychotic medications in the newborn if an antips ychotic medication is used in the third trimester (Briggs et al. 2017; U.S. Food and Drug Admini stration 2011a). Symptoms may include agitation, abnormally increased or decreased muscle tone, trem or, sleepiness, severe difficulty breathing, and difficulty in feeding (Briggs et al. 2017; U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2011a). Nevertheless, tapering of antipsychotic medication late in pr egnancy is not advisable because of the associated risk of relapse. In some newborns, the symptoms subside within hours or days and do not require specific treatment; other newborns may require longer hospital stays (U.S. Food and Drug Admin-istration 2011a). The possibility of these effects signals the importance of close monitoring of the newborn in conjunction with the infant's pediatri cian. As noted above, however, the benefits of treatment for the mother and the longer-term benefits of treatment for the infant (e.g., enhanced mother-infant bonding, better adherence to prenatal care and nutrition, lesser rates of prenatal al- cohol or tobacco use) will generally favor cont inuing and not tapering antipsychotic treatment. A number of other considerations are relevant when treating women with an antipsychotic med- ication during pregnancy. In general, symptoms sh ould be managed with the lowest effective dose, although it is preferable to maintain efficacy usin g a single medication at a higher dose rather than using multiple medications at lower doses (Ame rican Academy of Pediat rics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2017). If a patient's symptoms are well controlled on a specific medication, it is usually not advisable to switch to a different antipsychotic medication, even if more safety information is available for a different drug (Chisolm and Payne 2016). Chang- ing medications exposes the fetus to two different medications and also increases possibilities for symptom relapse in the patient. As with all women who are pregnant, regular prenatal care is essential to ensuring optimal ma - ternal-fetal outcomes (American Academy of Pediatrics and the Am erican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2017; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2018). Close moni- toring for symptom recurrence and for side effect s is important during pregnancy and in the post- partum period because the physiological altera tions of pregnancy may affect the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of medi cations and may necessitate adjustments in med- The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 29 ication doses (ACOG Committee on Practice Bull etins\u2014Obstetrics 2008; Chisolm and Payne 2016). Women who are taking antipsychotic medications are also at increa sed risk of obesity and hyper- glycemia, and folate supplementation to reduce risk s of neural tube defects and assessment for di- abetes during pregnancy are important elemen ts of prenatal care (Briggs et al. 2017). In terms of breastfeeding, limited information is available, but infants may be exposed to clini- cally significant levels of medication in breast milk, and the long-term effects of such exposure are not known (Sachs et al. 201 3). Accordingly, mothers who wish to breastfeed their infants should re - view the potential benefits of breastfeeding as well as potential risks in the context of shared deci- sion-making (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Committee on Obstetric Practice and the Breastfeeding Expert Work Group 2016; Sachs et al. 2013), with associated moni- toring of growth and development by the in fant's pediatrician (Sachs et al. 2013). Additional information related to the use of antipsychotic medications during pregnancy and while breastfeeding can be found at the websites of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA; www.fda.gov), of Medicine's LactMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501922 ). For women who have been treated with an SGA during pregnancy, enrolling in the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics is sug- gested (MGH Center for Women's Mental Health 2019). Determining a Treatment Setting In determining a treatment setting, considerations for individuals with schizophrenia are similar to those for individuals with other diag noses. Thus, in general, patients should be cared for in the least restrictive setting that is likely to be safe and to allow for effectiv e treatment. If inpatient care is deemed essential, efforts should be made to hospit alize patients voluntarily. However, if hospital- ization is deemed essential but is not accepted volu ntarily by the patient, state or jurisdictional re - quirements for involuntary hospit alization should be followed. Indications for hospitalization usually include the patient posing a serious threat of harm to self or others or being unable to care for himself or herself and needing constant superv ision or support as a result. Other possible indi- cations for hospitalization include psychiatric or other medical problems that make outpatient treatment unsafe or ineffective or new onset of ps ychosis that warrants initial inpatient stabilization to promote reduction of acute symptoms and permit engagement in treatment. For individuals with schizophrenia and other sign ificant health issues, de termination of a treat- ment setting will require weighing the pluses and minuses of possib le settings to identify the opti- mal location for care. For example, individuals who require significant medical or surgical interventions or monitoring that are not typically available on a psychiatric inpatient service will likely be better served on a general hospital unit or in an intensive care setting with input from con- sultation-liaison psychiatrists. Considerable effort s may be needed to help staff who are unfamiliar with psychotic disorders engage with the patient (Freudenreich et al. 2019). In other circumstances, management of the patient on an inpatient psychi atric service in collaboration with consultants of other medical specialties will be optimal. Less restrictive settings may be indicated when a patient does not meet criteria for inpatient treatment but requires more monitoring or assistan ce than is available in routine outpatient care. Such settings and programs may include ACT (Sub stance Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad - ministration 2008), assisted outpatient treatment, intensive outpatient treatment, partial hospital- ization, and day hospitalization. Involuntary Treatment Considerations Under some circumstances, individuals may not wish to participate in treatment or take medica - tions, even if they have severe symptoms. In st ates where psychiatric adva nce directives are avail- able, patients may be able to state their pref erences about treatment choices while they have APA Practice Guidelines 30 capacity in the event of future decompensation and an inability to participate in decision-making. Even in the absence of a psychiatric advance directiv e, patients can often be helped to accept phar- macological treatment over time and with psychotherapeutic interactions that are aimed toward identifying subjectively distressing symptoms that have previously responded to treatment. Fam- ily members and other persons of support can also be helpful in encouraging the patient to engage in treatment. Prevailing state laws will determine other steps to take if an individual lacks capacity but re - quires treatment. Some states have processes by which pharmacological treatment may be admin- istered involuntarily, whereas in other states a ju dicial hearing may be needed to obtain permission to treat a patient who lacks capacity. For a small subgroup of patients with repeated relapses, rehospitalizations, or even reincarcera - tions associated with nonadherence or impairments in insight, involuntary outpatient commitment may warrant inclusion in the treatment plan to improve adherence, prevent psychiatric deteriora- tion, enhance outcomes, and promote recovery (A merican Psychiatric Association 2015; Gaynes et al. 2015; Harris et al. 2019; Segal et al. 2017a, 2017b ; Swartz et al. 2017). Involuntary outpatient com- mitment (which also may be referred to as assi sted outpatient treatment, mandated community treatment, outpatient court-ordered treatment, or a community treatment order) is increasingly available but varies among countries (Burns et al . 2013; Harris et al. 2019) and jurisdictions within the United States (Meldrum et al. 2016) in its cr iteria and implementation . Effective implementation requires adequate resources and individualized treatment planning (Ameri can Psychiatric Associ- ation 2015) if psychiatric (Gaynes et al. 2015; Harris et al. 2019; Segal et al. 2017a; Swartz et al. 2017) and physical health (Segal et al. 2017b) benefits are to be realized. As with any form of involuntary treatment, decisions about involuntary outpatient commitment require balancing ethical consider- ations related to patient autonomy and self-deter mination with considerations about the individ - ual's best interest (American Psychiatric Association 2015). Addressing Needs of Patients With Sc hizophrenia in Correctional Settings Rates of serious mental illness, including schizoph renia, are higher in correctional settings (e.g., prisons, jails, police lockups, detention facilities ) than in the general population (Al-Rousan et al. 2017; Bebbington et al. 2017; al. 2010; Hall et al. 2019; Steadman et al. 2009). Care - ful assessment and treatment planning are essent ial when individuals with schizophrenia are in correctional settings. Although some aspects of tr eatment may need to be adjusted to conform with unique aspects of correctional settings (Tambure llo et al. 2018), many individuals experience gaps in care during incarceration (Fri es et al. 2013; Reingle Gonzalez and Connell 2014; Wilper et al. 2009), and access should be preserved to essential elements of treatment, including antipsychotic medications (American Psychiatric Association 2009b) and treatm ent for concomitant substance use disorders (American Psyc hiatric Association 2007). While in the correctional system, individuals wi th schizophrenia may be withdrawn or disorga - nized or behave in a disruptive manner. These be haviors may result in disciplinary infractions, which may lead the individual with schizophreni a to be placed in a locked-down setting. Such units are often called administrative segregation , disciplinary segregation , or restricted housing units (Krelstein 2002; Semenza and Gros holz 2019) and have been concep tualized as having three main characteristics: social isolation, sensory deprivat ion, and confinement (Zubek et al. 1969). Each of these elements can vary significantly, but inmate s typically spend an average of 23 hours per day in a cell, have limited human interaction and mini mal or no access to programs, and are maintained in an environment that is designed to exert maximum control over the person, which has raised broader ethical considerations ab out the long-term use of such settings (Ahalt and Williams 2016; Ahalt et al. 2017; American Psychiatric Associatio n 2017, 2018; American Public Health Association 2013; Cloud et al. 2015; National Commi ssion on Correctional Health Care 2016). Inmates' responses to the segregation experience differ, and relevant scientific literature is sparse (Kapoor and Trestman 2016; O'Keefe et al. 2013). In addition, mental health clinicians working in The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 31 such facilities frequently report that inmates wi thout preexisting serious mental disorders develop irritability, anxiety, and other dy sphoric symptoms when housed in these units for long periods of time (Metzner 2002). Difficulti es in providing appropriate and adequate access to mental health care and treatment are especially problematic in an y segregation environment and are related to lo - gistical issues that frequently include inadequate office space and limited a ccess to inmates because of security issues (Metzner 2003; Metzner and Fell ner 2010). In addition, because of their inherently punitive structure, such units typi cally provide very little support or access to relevant treatment modalities or a therapeutic milieu. Furthermore, rates of self-injury and suicide appear to be higher in such settings than elsewhere in the correctional system (Baillargeon et al. 2009b; Glowa-Kollisch et al. 2016; Kaba et al. 2014; Way et al. 2005). Co nsequently, persons with schizophrenia should gen- erally not be placed in a 23-hour/day lockdown fo r behaviors that are directly related to schizo - phrenia because such an interven tion is likely to exacerbate rather than reduce psychotic symptoms, as well as increase rather than reduce disruptive behaviors (American College of Cor- rectional Physicians 2013; Americ an Psychiatric Association 2016b , 2017; American Public Health Association 2013; National Commission on Correctional Health Care 2016). Individuals with schizophrenia, like other individu als with serious mental illness, are at increased risk for symptom relapse and gaps in treatment on re lease from a correctional setting. Services are of - ten needed to reduce the likelihood of recidivism and maintain continuity of care for treatment of schizophrenia and concomit ant disorders (e.g., substance use disorders, other medical conditions). Thus, discharge planning is a crucia l aspect of care for inmates with schizophrenia, particularly for those who have been incarcerated for significant pe riods of time. Often, inmates with schizophrenia have been alienated from systems of care and psychosocial supports pr ior to arrest, and this estrange- ment is compounded by incarceratio n. As a result, inmates will likely need assistance around the time of discharge, which can encompass various domains, including housing, treatment needs, financial support, and obtaining supplemental security inco me/social security disabi lity and related Medicaid benefits (American Psychiatric As sociation 2009c; Angell et al. 2014; rrissey et al. 2016; Wenzlow et al. 2011). Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits Development and documentation of a comprehensive, person-centered treatment plan assures that the clinician has considered the available nonpharmacological and pharmacological options for treat- ment and has identified those treatments that are be st suited to the needs of the individual patient, with a goal of improving overall outcome. It may also assist in forming a therapeutic relationship, eliciting patient preferences, perm itting education about possible trea tments, setting expectations for treatment, and establishing a framework for shared decision-making. Documentation of a treatment plan promotes accurate communication among all th ose caring for the patient and can serve as a re - minder of prior discussions about treatment. Harms The only identifiable harm from this recommendat ion relates to the time spent in discussion and documentation that may reduce the opportunity to focus on other aspects of the evaluation. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that patients are coop erative with and accepting of efforts to establish treatment plans. APA Practice Guidelines 32 Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statemen t were viewed as far outweighing the potential harms. The level of research evidence is rated as low because no informat ion is available on the harms of such an approach. There is also minima l research on whether developing and document- ing a specific treatment plan improves outcomes as compared with assessment and documentation as usual. However, indirect evidence, including expert opinion, supports the benefits of compre-hensive treatment planning. For a dditional discussion of the rese arch evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 3.

Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations Information from other guidelines (Addington et al. 2017a, 2017b; Barnes et al. 2011; Buchanan et al. 2010; Crockford and Addington 2 017; Galletly et al. 2016; Hasan et al. 2012, 2013, 2015; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014; Norm an et al. 2017; Pringsheim et al. 2017; Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2013) is generally consistent with this guideline statement in ei - ther explicitly or implicitly recommending deve lopment of a person-centered treatment plan that includes evidence-based nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments. Quality Measurement Considerations It is not known whether psychiatrists and other ment al health professionals typically document a com- prehensive and person-centered treatment plan that includes evidence-based nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments, and there is likely to be variability. Although a well-defined and scientifi- cally sound quality measure could be developed to assess for the implementati on of an evidence-based treatment plan that meets consensu s-based features of person-centered care, clinical judgment would still be needed to determine whether a documented treatment plan is comp rehensive and adapted to individual needs and preferences. Manual review of charts to evaluate for the presence of such a person- centered treatment plan would be burdensome and time-consuming to implement. A quality measure could assess the presence or absence of text in the medical record that would reflect treatment planning. When considering the development of such quality measures, there should be a thorough examination of the potentia l for unintended negative consequences, such as increased documentation burden or overuse of st andardized language that meets the quality mea - sure criteria but would inaccurately reflect what occurred in practice. Pharmacotherapy STATEMENT 4: Antipsychotic Medications APA recommends (1A) that patients with schizophrenia be treated with an antipsychotic medication and monitored for effectiveness and side effects. * *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 33 Implementation Selection of an Antipsychotic Medication General Principles In the treatment of schizophreni a, antipsychotic medication is one important component. The choice of an antipsychotic agent de pends on many factors that are specific to an individual patient. Thus, before initiating treatment with antipsychoti c medication, it is recommended that as part of selecting a medication, the treating clinician gath er information on the patient's treatment-related preferences and prior treatment responses and then discuss with the patient the potential benefits and risks of medication as compared with othe r management options. Ma ny patients will wish family members or other persons of support to be in volved in this discussion. The depth of this dis- cussion will, of course, be determ ined by the patient's condition. Even with agitated patients and patients with thought disorder, however, the therapeutic alliance will be enhanced if the patient and physician can identify target symptoms (e.g., an xiety, poor sleep, and, for patients with insight, hallucinations and delusions) that are subjectively distressing and that antipsychotics can amelio- rate. Mentioning the possibility of acute side effect s (e.g., dizziness, sedation, restlessness) helps pa- tients identify and report side-effect occurrence and also may help maintain a therapeutic alliance. Patients with schizophrenia often have attentio nal and other cognitive impairments that may be more severe during an acute illness exacerbation, so it is helpful to return to the topic of identifica- tion of target symptoms and discussion of acute and longer-term side effects on multiple occasions as treatment proceeds. An evidence-based ranking of FGAs and SGAs or an algorithmic approach to antipsychotic se- lection is not possible because of the significant he terogeneity in clinical trial designs, the limited numbers of head-to-head comparis ons of antipsychotic medications, and the limited clinical trial data for a number of the antipsychotic medications. By the same token, it is not possible to note a preference for either SGAs or FGAs. Although th ere may be clinically meaningful distinctions in response to and tolerability of different antipsycho tic medications in an indi vidual patient, there is no definitive evidence that one antipsychotic will have consistently superior efficacy compared with another, with the possible exception of cloz apine. Although data in first-episode schizophre - nia are more limited, there appears to be no diff erence in response among the SGAs that have been studied (McDonagh et al. 2017; Zhu et al. 2017). Furt hermore, there is no reliable strategy to predict response or risk of side effects with one agent compared with another. Consequently, the choice of a particular antipsychotic agent will typically occu r in the context of discussion with the patient about the likely benefits and possible side effects of medication options and will incorporate patient preferences; the patient's past responses to treatment (including symptom response and tolerabil- ity); the medication's side-effect profile (see Table 6); the presence of physical health conditions that may be affected by medication si de effects; and other medication-r elated factors such as available formulations, potential for drug-drug interactions , receptor binding profiles, and pharmacokinetic considerations (Tables 3-9).

Influencing Choice of an Antipsychotic Medication Available Drug Formulations Medication choice may be influenc ed by available formulations of specific medications, such as oral concentrates or rapidly diss olving tablets for patients who ha ve difficulty swallowing pills or who are ambivalent about medications and inconsistent in swallowing them. Use of ingestible sen- sors with associated monitoring technology may assist in evaluating ingestion, although the FDA notes that improvements in adherence have not yet been shown (U.S. Food and Drug Administra - tion 2017). LAI formulations may be preferred by so me patients (Heres et al. 2007; Patel et al. 2009; Walburn et al. 2001) and may be particularly useful fo r patients with a history of poor or uncertain adherence (see Statement 10). Short-acting parent eral formulations of antipsychotic agents are available for short-term use in individuals who ar e unable to take oral medications or for emer- gency administration in ac utely agitated patients. Drug-Drug Interactions and Metabolism Careful attention must be paid to the potential for interactions of antipsychotic agents with other pre- scribed medications. For example, when multiple me dications are prescribed, side effects (e.g., seda- tion, anticholinergic effects) can be additive. In addition, drug interactions can influence the amount of free drug in the blood that is available to act at receptors. Because most antipsychotic medications are highly bound to plasma proteins, the addition of other prot ein-bound medications will displace drug molecules from proteins, resulting in a greate r proportion of unbound drug in the blood. An- other common cause of drug-drug interactions relates to interactions at metabolic enzymes such 2017; Rowland et al. 2013; Zanger and Schwab 2013). In particular, hepatic metabolism of an tipsychotic medications via CYP enzymes has been widely studied (see Lexicomp 2019; Micromedex 2019). Medications may compete with each other for the same CYP enzyme, or they may induce or i nhibit the activity of CYP enzymes, altering levels of drugs that are metabolized through that route. For antipsychotic medications that have active metabolites, shifts in CYP enzyme activity can in fluence the relative amounts of the active metab- olite. Consequently, when a patient is taking multip le medications, it is useful to check for possible drug-drug interactions using electronic drug interaction software (e.g., Web-based software, drug interaction checking embedded in electronic health record software). In addition to drug-drug interactions, a number of other factors can influence CYP enzymes and thereby affect antipsychotic medication levels in blood. For example, smoking tobacco or marijuana induces CYP1A2, resulting in a co rresponding reduction of levels of drugs that are metabolized through that enzyme, including clozapine and olanzapine (Anderson and Chan 2016; Kroon 2007; Scherf-Clavel et al. 2019). Conversely, with cessation of smoking (either intentionally or with ad-mission to a smoke-free facility), there will be co rresponding increases in the levels of drugs metab - olized via CYP1A2. These shifts in blood levels can be quite significant and contribute to shifts in medication effectiveness or toxicity. Several of the main phytocannabinoids in marijuana (e.g., 9- tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol) are metabolize d via CYP3A4, and cannabidiol may also inhibit CYP2C19 (Anderson and Chan 2016). Furthermore, levels of antipsychotic medications, the relative proportions of active metabolites, and other pharmacokinetic properties such as medication or active metabolite half-life can be influ - enced by genetic differences in metabolic enzyme activity. Polymorphisms of CYP2D6 have been subjected to the most study (Eum et al. 2016; Zhou 2009), show substantial variation in their occur- rence in the population by ethnicity (Bertilsson 2007; Gaedigk et al. 2017), and are likely to have the greatest potential for impact on antipsychotic medication metabolism. Polymorphisms of the ATP- binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) gene , which affects P-glycoprotein membrane trans- port, may influence brain concentrations of drugs, including antipsychotic agents (Moons et al. 2011). Although the applicability of gene polymorphism test ing to the clinical choice of an antipsychotic APA Practice Guidelines 62 medication is still being explored (Bousman and Dunlop 2018; Koopmans et al. 2018; Lagishetty et al. 2016), the FDA has incorporated testing for CYP2D6 polymorphisms into its labeling recommen- dations for dosing of pimozide on the basis of th e increased risk of electrocardiographic changes in poor metabolizers at doses higher than 4 mg/day (0.05 mg/kg/day in children) (Rogers et al. 2012; U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2011b). In addition, product labeling for a number of other an- tipsychotic medications refers to a need for dose adjustments based on metabolizer status (U.S. Food and Drug Administration 20 19). Additional information on th e clinical pharmacogenomics of antipsychotic medications is available through the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (https://cpicpgx.org; Relling and Klein 2011), the Pharmacogene Variation Consor-tium (www.pharmvar.org; et al. 2018), Knowledgebase (www .pharmgkb.org ; Whir l-Carrillo et al. 2012). Ph arm acokinetic Properties The absorption of some antipsychotic medications is affected by the presence of food in the stomach (see Statement 4, Tables 3 and 4) . Some individuals may have diffic ulty in adhering to appropriate meal size or content, which could in fluence choice of these medications. The half-life of an antipsychotic medication is another pharmacokinetic property that may be useful to consider in choosing among antipsychoti c agents. Antipsychotic agents with a short half- life (see Statement 4, Tables 3 and 4) are more like ly to require divided dosing in contrast to anti- psychotic medications with a half-life that is clos er to 24 hours. An oral antipsychotic medication with a longer half-life or an LAI may be preferable for patients who are prone to forget doses or who are intermittently nonadherent to treatment. Nevertheless, if an antipsychotic medication (or active metabolite) half-life is significantly longer than 24 hours, it is important to be aware that steady state may not be reached for some time. Th is can complicate interpreting the patient's re - sponse to adjustments in doses in terms of therapeutic benefits and side effects. Additional caution may be needed when an antipsychotic medication wi th a long half-life is chosen for older individ - uals, for an individual who is taking other medica tions that may affect drug metabolism, or for in- dividuals with renal or hepatic impairment. Older individuals often exhibit additional physiological changes relative to younger persons, in- cluding a reduced cardiac output (and concomitant reduction in re nal and hepatic blood flow), re - duced glomerular filtration rate, possible redu ction in hepatic metabolism, and increased fat content. These changes may alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of medi- cations and may also result in prolonged drug effects and greater sensitivity to medications, in terms of both therapeutic response and side effects (Kaiser 2015). Side-Effect Profile The side-effect profile of an antipsychotic agent is a significant factor in the choice of a specific med- ication (see Statement 4, T able 6). Often, a patient will express concerns about a particular side effect of medication (e.g., weight gain). A specific side effect (e.g., akathisia, weight gain, sedation, ortho- static hypotension, sexual dysf unction) may also have limited a patient's treatment adherence or ability to function in the past. If a patient has a concomitant physical condition (e.g., diabetes, car- diac conduction abnormalities, a seizure disorder), choice of medication will need to consider the likelihood of exacerbating an existing health co ndition. Older individuals may be more sensitive to some medication side effects, such as tardive dyskinesia, orthostatic hypotension, or anticholiner- gic effects of medications. Thus, a medication that has a lower likelihood of these side effects might be preferred. In contrast, there may be circumstances in which a medication side effect may be help - ful. For example, in a patient who is not sleeping well, a more sedating antipsychotic might be cho- sen and administered at bedtime. Regardless of the initial side effect-related considerations in the choice of an antipsychotic medicati on, it is important to continue to monitor for side effects as treat- ment proceeds and to have additional discussions wi th the patient about side effects as they relate to treatment preferences. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 63 Initiation of Trea tment With an Antipsychotic Medication The initial goal of acute treatment with an antips ychotic medication is to reduce acute symptoms, with the aim of returning the individual to his or he r baseline level of functioning. Later, maintenance treatment will aim to prevent recurrence of symp toms and maximize functi oning and quality of life. The initial dose of medication will depend on such factors as the medication formulation, the characteristics of the patient, and whether a prio r trial of antipsychotic medication has occurred. With the exception of clozapine, the dose of most antipsychotic medications can be increased rela- tively quickly to a typical therapeutic dose once an initial dose has been tolerated. For patients who have previously been treated with an oral or LAI antipsychotic medicati on, more rapid resumption of an effective medication dose is often appropri ate. Although as-needed or emergency administra - tion of antipsychotic medication ma y, at times, be useful in indivi duals with acute agitation, it can also reduce tolerability and contribute to a perc eption that premature dose increases are needed. Younger individuals who are experiencing a first episode of psychosis may be more likely to gain weight or develop adverse metabolic effects of antipsychotic medications (Correll et al. 2014; Jensen et al. 2019). This can influence selection of an init ial medication. In such individuals, a lower initial medication dose may help in minimizing acute si de effects of antipsychotic medication and may improve a patient's willingness to continue with tr eatment (Czobor et al. 2015; Gaebel et al. 2010). Because a first episode of psychosis may respond more rapidly and may require a lower medication dose than later episodes do, use of a lower initial me dication dose is also reasonable (Takeuchi et al. 2019). In older individuals, particularly those with concomitant physical health issues who are receiv- ing multiple medications, recommended starting doses of medication are one-quarter to one-half of the usual adult starting dose on the basis of pharmacokinetic considerations (Howard et al. 2000). Determining the optimal dose of antipsychotic medication during acute treatment is compli- cated by the fact that there is usually a delay between initiation of treatment and full therapeutic response. Patients may take between 2 and 4 weeks to show an initial response and longer periods of time to show full or optimal response. Once a therapeutic dose of the antipsychotic medication is reached, overly rapid or premature escalation of medication doses can affect tolerability. Prema- ture dose increases can also create the false impr ession of enhanced efficacy due to a higher dose when the observed response is actually related to elapsed time at a steady state level of medication. Available evidence suggests that patients who have not exhibited at least a 20% reduction in symp - toms (or minimal improvement) by about 2 weeks on a therapeutic dose are unlikely to be much improved at 4-6 weeks as reflected by at least a 50% reduction in symptoms (Samara et al. 2015). Consequently, monitoring of the patient's clinical status for 2-4 weeks is warranted on a therapeu - tic dose unless the patient is ha ving uncomfortable side effects. Initiation of treatment with clozapine is a notable exception to this general approach because it re- quires a slow dose titration to minimize the risk s of seizure, orthostatic hypotension, and excessive sedation (Clozaril 2019). Large, rapid increases in clozapine dosage have led to cardiovascular col - lapse and death, particular ly in patients taking respiratory depressant medications such as benzodi- azepines. From a starting dose of 12.5 mg once or twice daily, the daily clozapine dosage can be in- creased by, at most, 25-50 mg/day to a target dose of 300-450 mg/day (Clozaril 2019). Subsequent dose increases, if needed, should be of 100 mg or less, once or twice weekly. A slower rate of titration may be needed for patients with an initial episode of schizophrenia and in those who are older, se- verely debilitated, or sensitive to side effects. Th ose with a preexisting cent ral nervous system condi- tion, including individuals with 22q11.2 deletion synd rome, also warrant a slower rate of titration and may have an increased risk of seizures at usual do ses. Use of divided doses can be helpful in reducing side effects during initial dose titration, although many patients are ultimately treated with a single dose at bedtime to minimize daytime sedation and facilitate adherence (Takeuchi et al. 2016). Al - though efficacy is often seen at a dosage of 30 0-450 mg/day, some individuals may need higher dos- ages of clozapine, to a maximum daily dose of 900 mg, for full response. Bloo d levels of clozapine can be helpful to obtain if making adjustme nts to clozapine doses (see Statement 7). APA Practice Guidelines 64 With clozapine, safety monitoring during treatment is important in order to minimize the risk of adverse events. The U.S. Clozapine Risk Evalua tion and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program (www.clozapinerems.com )1 includes required training that must be completed by prescribers (Clozapine REMS Program 2019a), resource mate rials (Clozapine REMS 2019b), and a shared patient registry for all clozapine manufacturer s' products that permits tracking of absolute neu- trophil counts (ANCs) and documentation of deci sions about continued treatment. The Clozapine REMS site provides instructions about threshold values for ANCs in hematologically normal individ- uals and in those with benign ethn ic neutropenia, which is most comm on in individuals of African de- scent and is associated with normal ANCs that ar e lower than standard reference ranges (Clozapine REMS Program 2014). The site also describes the required frequencies for ANC monitoring, which vary with ANC values. Because the highest risk of severe neutropenia (ANC<500/ L) occurs within the initial 6 months of clozapine treatment (Alvir et al. 1993; Clozapine REMS Program 2019c; Myles et al. 2018), the frequency of ANC monitoring is also reduced with longer treatment duration. In pa - tients who have stopped or interrupted treatment wi th clozapine for 30 days or more, the initial dose titration for clozapine and the monitoring freque ncy for treatment initiati on should be followed. With clozapine as well as with other antipsychotic medications, some common early side effects such as se dation, postural hypotension, or nausea may improve or resolve after the first several days or weeks of treatment, and patients can be encouraged to tolerate or temporarily ma nage these short- term effects. Other side effects, notably parkinsonism and akathisia, are likely to persist with long-term treatment, and additional approaches to management may be needed (see Statements 12 and 13). If treatment with an LAI antipsychotic medication is planned, a trial of the oral formulation of the same medication is usually given to assure tolerability. The conversion from an oral dose of medication to a corresponding dose of an LAI antipsychotic depends on the specific medication (Meyer 2017), and product labeling for each medi cation describes approximate conversion ratios and whether a period of concomitant oral and LAI medication is needed. Strategies to Address Initial No nresponse or Partial Response to Antipsychotic Treatment If a patient is showing response within several weeks of treatment initiation, continuing with the same medication and monitoring for continued impr ovement is appropriate. However, if there is no significant improvement after several weeks of tr eatment (e.g., <20% improvement in symptoms) or if improvement plateaus before substantial impr ovement is achieved (e.g., >50% improvement in symptoms, minimal impairment in functioning), it is important to consider whether factors are pres- ent that are influencing treatment response. Such factors may include concomitant substance use, rapid medication metabolism, poor medication abso rption, interactions with other medications, and other effects on drug metabolism (e.g., smoking) that could affect blood levels of medication. Difficulties with adherence are a common contri butor to reduced response. (For a detailed dis- cussion of adherence, see Statement 3.) When adhere nce is poor or uncertain, use of an LAI formu- lation of an antipsychotic may improve adherence as well as response. Determination of the blood concentration of the drug may also be helpful if the patient is being treated with a medication (e.g., clozapine) for which blood level has some correlation with clinical response. For other antipsy - chotic medications, a blood level can help to dete rmine if poor adherence or subtherapeutic levels may be contributing to poor response (Bishara et al . 2013; de Oliveira et al. et and Kane 2013; al. 2018; et al. 2010; Uchida et al. 2011b; Van Putten et al. 1991). Depending on th e patient's symptoms, the possibility of another concomitant disorder should be considered. For ex ample, in a patient with negative symptoms, an untreated major depressive disorder may also be present. 1For Canadian prescribers, use the appropriate Canadian clozapine registry, not the U. S. Clozapine REMS Program. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 65 If no factors that would affect treatment response have been identified, raising the dose for a fi- nite period, such as 2-4 weeks, can be tried. Alth ough the incremental efficacy of higher doses has not been established (Samara et al. 2018), some patien ts may show benefit if they are able to tolerate a higher dose of antipsychotic medication without significant side effects. If dose adjustment does not result in an adequate response, a different an tipsychotic medication should be considered. Tables 5 and 6 in Statement 4 can be consulted to identify antipsychotic medications with other receptor binding profiles or different side effects. Because each patient responds differently to antipsychotic medications in terms of therapeutic effects and side effects, adequate trials of multiple antipsy- chotic medications may be needed before antipsychotic treatment is optimized, and it can be help- ful to advise patients of this possibility. If a patient has had minimal or no response to tw o trials of antipsychotic medication of 2-4 weeks' duration at an adequate dose (Howes et al. 2017; Samara et al. 2015), a trial of clozapine is recom- mended (see Statement 7). A trial of clozapine is also recommended for a patient with a persistent risk of suicide that has not responded to other treatments and is suggested for a patient with a per- sistent risk of aggressive behavior that has not re sponded to other treatments (see Statements 8 and 9). A trial of clozapine may also be appropriate in individuals who show a response to treatment (i.e., have more than a 20% reduction in symptoms ) yet still have significant symptoms or impair - ments in functioning (Howes et al. 2017). In fact , clozapine is often (Carruthers et 2016; Latimer et al. 2013; Olfson et al. 2016; Stroup et al. 2014; Tang et al. 2017), and many patients would benefit from earlier consid eration of clozapine initiation. For individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia who are unable to tolerate clozapine or are not interested in pursuing a trial of clozapine, the limited available evidence suggests no benefit from high doses of antipsychotic medication, and treatment-related side effects are likely to be in- creased (Dold et al. 2015). However, a trial of a different antipsychotic medication may be helpful, particularly if there is no response or only a part ial response to the most recently used medication. Augmentation treatment can also be considered, al though a trial of clozapine should not be de- layed by multiple attempts at augmentation therap y. Particularly for patients with negative symp- toms or depression, augmentation of antipsychoti c therapy with an antidepressant medication may also be helpful (Helfer et al. 2016; Stroup et al . 2019). Use of a benzodiazepine, such as lorazepam, is also suggested in patients who exhibit catatoni a (Bush et al. 1996b; Fink 2013; Pelzer et al. 2018; approaches (e.g., antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, benzodiaze - pines, lithium) have also been studied, although evidence is mixed and primarily from small, short- term open-label studies (Correll et al. 2017b; Galling et al. 2017; Ortiz-Orendain et al. 2017). For com- bination therapy with two antipsychotic medication s, data from a large na tionwide cohort study suggest that emergency visits and rehospitalizatio n rates may be reduced in individuals receiving polypharmacy as compared with monotherapy (Tiihonen et al. 2019). In addition, there is no evi - dence that combining drugs is any more harmful th an using a single medication, beyond the common side effects from each drug. Nevertheless, if multip le drugs are used, monitoring for benefits and side effects is important, and it is preferable to limit chan ges in dose to one drug at a time. In addition, if a patient experiences an exacerbation of symptoms while on a stable dose of medication, a reconsider - ation of the treatment plan is warranted rather than simply adding medications to the existing regimen. Monitoring During Treatment Wi th an Antipsychotic Medication During treatment with an antipsychotic medication, it is important to monitor medication adherence, therapeutic benefits of treatment, and treatment-rela ted side effects. The patient's clinical status can also be affected by changes in physical health, adjustments to other psychotropic and nonpsycho-tropic medications, and other factors, such as cessation or resumption of smoking. Adherence to antipsychotic treatment is a common problem that affects treatment outcomes. There are many barriers to treatment adherence as well as facilitators and motivators of adherence, each of which will differ for an individual patient (Hatch et al. 2017 ; Kane et al. 2013; Pyne et al. 2014). Thus, it is important to take a patient-ce ntered approach in inqu iring in a nonjudgmental APA Practice Guidelines 66 way whether the individual has expe rienced difficulties with taking medication since the last visit. (For a detailed discussion of factors related to adherence, see Statement 3.) Monitoring of treatment response is also essential for identifying whether there are reductions in the severity of functional impairments or ta rget symptoms, including positive symptoms, nega- tive symptoms, and other symptoms that are a focu s of treatment. Use of a quantitative measure (see Statement 2) can assist in determining whethe r the a ntipsychotic medication is producing ther- apeutic benef its, including reductions in symptom severity and improvements in functioning. If a lack of response or a partial response is noted, additional assessment will be needed to identify and address possible contributors as described in the subsection \"Strategies to Address Initial Nonre- sponse or Partial Response to Antipsychotic Treatm ent.\" If an antipsychotic medication dose is be- ing decreased, monitoring can help detect a return of symptoms prior to a more serious relapse. Monitoring for the presence of side effects is also important throughout the course of antipsychotic treatment. Some side effects (e.g., sedation, nausea ) are prominent with treatment initiation but dissi- pate, at least to some extent, with continued treatm ent. Other side effects (e.g., hypotension, akathisia) may be present initially and increase in severity with titration of the medication dose. Still other side effects emerge only after longer periods of treatment (e.g., tardive dyskinesia) or become more notice-able to patients as their acute symptoms are bette r controlled (e.g., sexual dysfunction). Table 2 in Statement 1 gives suggestions for baseline assessments and monitoring frequencies for some side ef - fects, clinical measurements, and la boratory studies. Specific attention may need to be given to clini- cal workflow to assure that indicated monitoring is conducted because rates of follow-up testing and screening for metabolic side effects of treatment appear to be low (Morrato et al. 2009). Patients should also be asked about othe r common side effects of antipsychotic medications, which may vary with the specific medication that is prescribed (see Statement 4, Table 6). Use of rating scales can help assure that patients are asked about side effects in a systematic fash- ion. Although the clinician-rated Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU) Side Effect Rating Scale (Lingjaerde et al. 1987) is often used to assess side effects of antipsychotic medications in clinical trials (van Strien et al. 2015), it can be time-c onsuming to administer. However, a self-rated ver - sion of the UKU Side Effect Rating Scale (Lindstr\u00f6m et al. 2001) is also available (http://scnp.org/ fileadmin/SCNP/SCNP/UKU/UKU-Pat-%20English%20.pdf). Another self-rating scale, the Glasgow Antipsychotic Side-effect Scale, has two versions: one for use in patients treated with clozapine (www.sussexpartnership.nhs.uk/sites/default/files/docume nts/gass_for_clozapine .pdf ) (Hynes et al. 2015) and one for patients treated with other antipsychotic medications (www.southernhealth.nhs.uk/_resources/assets/inline/full/0/38222.pdf) (Waddell and Taylor 2008). Other rating scales are aime d at identifying and assessing the severity of a specific type of side effect. For example, the clinician-administered Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS; www.aacap.org/App_Themes/AACAP/docs/member _resources/toolbox_for_clinical_practice_ and_outcomes/monitoring/AIMS.pdf) (Guy 1976) or (DISCUS; https:// portal.ct.gov/-/medi a/DDS/Health/hcsma20002b.pdf) (Kalachnik and Sprague 1 993) can complement clinical assessment in identifying and monitoring tardive dyskinesia and other abnormal movements. An other example, the self-rated Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (www.dbsalliance.org/wp-conten t/uploads/2019/02/Restoring_Intimacy_CSFQ_ Handout.pdf) (Clayton et al. 1997a, 1997b; Depressi on and Bipolar Support Alliance 2019; Keller et al. 2006), can help to identify sexual side effects of antipsychotic treatment, wh ich is an issue that pa- tients may find difficult to discuss yet can lead them to discontinue treatment. Treatment-Emergent Side Effect s of Antipsycho tic Medications As with most medications, antipsychotic medications have been associated with a number of side effects that can develop as treatment proceeds. Ta ble 6 in Statement 4 shows the relative tendencies for antipsychotic medications to be associated with specific side effe cts. In addition, each of these side effects is described in further detail below. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 67 Early in the course of treatment, common side effects include sedation; orthostatic changes in blood pressure; and anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, and difficulty with urination. Of the side effects related to dopamine D2 receptor antagonist effect s of antipsychotics, acute dystonia also appears early in treatment. It is particularly common with high-potency antipsy- chotic medications (e.g., haloperidol, fluphenazine if associated with laryngospasm. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS ) can also be life-threatening because of as- sociated hyperthermia and autonomic instability. It typically occurs within the first month of anti- psychotic treatment, with resumption of treatment, or with an increase in the dose of antipsychotic medication. Akathisia and medication-induced park insonism can also occur in the initial weeks of treatment or after increases in medication doses. Hyperprolactinemia, related to D2 receptor antag - onism in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, can lead to breast enlargement, galactorrhea, sexual dys - function, and, in women, menstrual disturbances. These elevations in prolactin also occur in the initial weeks to months of treatment. On the ot her hand, tardive syndromes, including tardive dys- kinesia, develop later, often months or even years after treatment initiation. Side effects related to metabolic syndrome are comm on. Generally, they are observed in the initial months of treatment, but they can also occur later in treatment. These side effects include weight gain; hyperlipidemia; and glucose dy sregulation, including development of diabetes mellitus. Clozapine treatment is associated with a number of side effects that are less commonly seen with other antipsychotic medications. Severe neutropenia is most often seen early in treatment and is po- tentially life-threatening; however, with current regulatory requirements for monitoring ANC levels during treatment, it is rare. When seizures occur wi th clozapine, it is typically with very high doses or blood levels of clozapine, rapid increases in cloz apine dose, or shifts in medication levels (related to drug-drug interactions or effects of smoking on drug metabolism). Myocarditis is infrequent and generally occurs early in treatmen t. Cardiomyopathy is rare and ge nerally occurs later in the treat- ment course. Gastrointestinal effects of clozapine can also be significant, and in some patients it is as- sociated with fecal impaction or paralytic ileus. Sialorrhea and tachycardia are each commonly observed during treatment with clozapine bu t can generally be managed conservatively. Allergic and Dermatological Side Effects Cutaneous allergic reactions occur infrequently with antipsychotic medicati ons, but hypersensitiv- ity can manifest as maculopapular erythematous ra shes, typically of the tr unk, face, neck, and ex- tremities. Medication discontinuation or administra tion of an antihistamine is usually effective in reversing these symptoms. In terms of other dermatological side effects, on rare occasions, thioridazine treatment is noted to be associated with hyperpigmentation of the skin . Dermatological reactions, including hyperpigmen - tation and Photosensitivity reactions, resulting in severe sunburn, are also most commonly observed with low-potency phenothiazine medications. A blue- gray discoloration of the skin in body areas exposed to sunlight has been reported in patients receiv-ing long-term chlorpromazine treatment. Consequently, patients who are taking these medications should be instructed to avoid ex cessive sunlight and use sunscreen. Cardiovascular Effects Hyperlipidemia There is some evidence that certain antipsychotic medications, particularly clozapine and olanzapine, may increase the et al. 2013a). However, ther e is also a suggestion that some patients may have a dyslipidemia prior to star ting on antipsychotic treatment (M isiak et al. 2017; Pillinger et al. 2017b; Yan et al. 2013). Some patients develop an el evation of triglyceride levels in association with APA Practice Guidelines 68 antipsychotic treatment that rarely is sufficiently high as to be associated with development of pan- creatitis (Alastal et al. 2016). It is unclear whethe r triglyceridemia with antipsychotic treatment is a direct result of the medication or an indirect result of increased triglycerides in the blood with con- comitant diabetes (Yan et al. 2013) . In any patient with hyperlipidemia, it is also important to assess for other contributors to metabolic syndrome (Mit chell et al. 2012, 2013b) and ensure that the pa - tient is receiving treatment with a lipid-lowering agent, as clinically indicated. Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have been reported in some patients treated with clozapine and have resulted in death in some individuals. The et iology of these cardiac ef fects is unclear, although an immune-mediated mechanism has been suggested (R\u00f8ge et al. 2012). For myocarditis, the re - ported incidence has varied from 0.015% to 8.5% (Bellissima et al. 2018). For reasons that are un - clear, the highest rates have been reported in Au stralia (Ronaldson et al. 2015); rates elsewhere appear to be much lower. For example, an early study using th e U.S. Clozaril National Registry found 17 confirmed cases of myocar ditis in a total of 189,405 indivi duals who had received clozap- ine (La Grenade et al. 2001). A recent national re gistry study of outpatients in Denmark found 1 of 3,262 (0.03%) clozapine-treated patients developed myocarditis in the initial 2 months of treatment (Rohde et al. 2018). These authors estimated th at a maximum of 0.28% of patients treated with clozapine would experience fatality due to clozapine-associated myocarditis, which is comparable to rates of cardiac adverse effe cts with other antipsychotic medi cations. For cardiomyopathy, the reported incidence is even less clear but appears to be considerably lower than rates of clozapine- associated myocarditis (Higgins et al. 2019; Khan et al. 2017; Rohde et al. 2018; Ronaldson et al. 2015). Although cardiomyopathy has been reported thro ughout the course of clozapine treatment, the onset of myocarditis typically occu rs during the first month of treatment and is heralded by short- ness of breath, tachycardia, and fever (Bellissima et al. 2018; Ronaldson et al. 2015). Other features can include fatigue, chest pain, palpitations, and peripheral edema. Diagnosis can be challenging because of the nonspecific nature of these symp toms. For example, primary tachycardia is common with clozapine treatment without signifying unde rlying cardiac disease. Fever can also occur with clozapine initiation yet often resolves quickly an d without evidence of myocarditis (Bruno et al. 2015; Lowe et al. 2007; Pu i-yin Chung et al. 2008). Recommendations for monitoring have varied, but there is no evidence or consensus that pre- emptive screening is necessary or helpful. However, if myocardi tis or cardiomyopathy is sus- pected, a recent systematic review suggests seekin g cardiology consultation as well as monitoring C-reactive protein and troponin (I and T subtypes) and obtaining an electrocardiogram as indicated (Knoph et al. 2018). Cardiac magnetic resonance im aging may also be indicated in some individuals. In patients who do develop myocarditis or card iomyopathy in conjunction with clozapine treat- ment, clozapine is typically discontinued. Subseq uent decisions about resuming clozapine are in- dividualized and should be based on the benefits and risks of tr eatment as compared with other therapeutic alternatives. Orthostatic Hypotension Orthostatic hypotension, a drop in blood pressu re when changing from lying down or sitting to standing, is dose-related and due to the -receptor-blocking effects of antipsychotic medications. When severe, orthostatic hypotension can cause syncop e, dizziness, or falls. Older or severely debil- itated patients, patients in the dose-titration phas e of clozapine therapy, and patients with peripheral vascular disease or a compromised cardiovascular status may be at particular risk. Patients who ex- perience orthostatic hypotension must be cautioned to sit on the edge of the bed for a minute before standing up, to move slowly when going from lyin g down or sitting to standing, and to seek assis- tance when needed. Management strategies for orthostatic hypotension in clude using supportive measures (e.g., use of support stockings, increase d dietary sal t and fluid in take); reducing the speed The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 69 of antipsychotic dose titration; decreasing or di viding doses of antipsychotic medication; switching to an antipsychotic medication with out antiadrenergic effects; and, as a last resort, administration of the salt/fluid-retaining corticoste roid fludrocortisone to increase intravascular volume (Mar and Raj 2018; Shen et al. 2017). For patients who are rece iving concomitant antihype rtensive treatment, ad- justments to the dose of thes e medications may be needed. QT c Prolongation The QT interval on the electrocardiogram reflects the length of time required for ventricular repo- larization and varies with heart ra te (Funk et al. 2018). Several approaches exist for calculating a QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc). Although the Bazett formula remains the one most widely used for drug monitoring and research, alternative correction formulas, such as the Fridericia and Framingham formulas, have been shown to most accurately correc t for rate and improve prediction of mortality. In order to accurately predict risk, clinicians should be familiar with an alternative cor- rection formula (Aytemir et al. 1999; Rautaharju et al. 2009; Vandenberk et al. 2016). Significant pro- longation of the QTc interval is associated with increased risk for a ve ntricular tachyarrhythmia, torsades de pointes (TdP), which can lead to life -threatening consequences (e.g., ventricular fibrilla- tion, sudden death). When the QTc interval is onged, a decision about the antipsychotic medica - tion choice or changes requires a comprehensive ri sk-benefit assessment. A QTc interval >500 msec is sometimes viewed as a threshold for concern; however, \"there is no absolute QTc interval at which a psychotropic should not be used\" (Funk et al. 2018, p. 2). Studies that have examined the risks of QTc prolongation with antipsychotic treatment have varied in study quality, sample sizes, and the physical heal th of study subjects. Sources are available that cat- egorize medications on the basis of their level of risk for QTc prolongation and TdP (Woosley et al. 2009), but the quality of data that informs such ca tegorizations is also variable (Funk et al. 2018). Nevertheless, among the FGAs, chlorpromazine, droperidol, thioridazine, and pimozide appear to be associated with the greatest risk of QTc prolongation. The FDA recommends that thioridazine be used only when patients have not had a clinically acceptable response to other available antipsy-chotics (U.S. National Library of Medicine 2018b). Pimozide labeling also includes specific instruc- tions related to medication dosing and QTc in terval prolongation (U.S. National Library of Medicine 2018a). Orally administered haloperidol has been associated with only a mild increase in QTc interval length in healthy individuals; however, the risk of QTc interval prolongation and TdP appears to be greater with intravenous administra tion in medically ill individuals (Funk et al. 2018). Most SGAs have also been associated with some QTc interval prolon gation, with ziprasidone and iloperidone appearing to have the greatest likelihood of QTc prolongation. The FDA has re - quired that a warning about QTc prolongation be included with product labeling making a determinati on about selecting or changing antipsychotic medications include whether the patient is taking other medications that are known to prolong QTc intervals; whether the patient ha s factors that would influence drug metabolism, leading to higher blood levels of a drug (e.g., poor metabolizer status, pharmacokinetic dr ug-drug interactions, he- patic or renal disease, drug toxicity); whether the patient is known to have a significant cardiac risk factor (e.g., congenital long QT syndrome, struct ural or functional cardiac disease, bradycardia, family history of sudden cardiac death); and other factors associated with an increased risk of TdP (e.g., female sex; advanced age; personal QTc hypoka lemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypocalcemia) (Funk et al. 2018). For individuals with th ese risk factors, antipsychotic medications with a regulatory warn- ing or those with a known risk of QTc prolongati on are not recommended for use if safer medica- tion alternatives are available. Input from cardiology consultants should be considered when significant cardiac disease or other risk factors for QTc prolongation are present, although routine cardiology consultation is not indicated for patients without cardiac risk factors (Funk et al. 2018). APA Practice Guidelines 70 Tachycardia Tachycardia can be primary (e.g., with clozapine), a reflex response to orthostatic hypotension, or a result of anticholinergic effects. It appears to be particularly common in individuals who are treated with clozapine (Lally et al. 2016a), but it may also be seen in individuals treated with other antipsychotic medications, particularly low-po tency phenothiazines. Although healthy patients may be able to tolerate some increase in resting pu lse rate, this may not be the case for patients with preexisting heart disease. In pati ents with significant tachycardia (heart rates above 110-120 bpm), ECG is warranted, as is an assessment for other potential causes of tachycardia (e.g., fever, anemia, smoking, hyperthyroidism, respiratory disease, ca rdiovascular disorders, caffeine and other stim- ulants, side effects of other medi cations). Early in treatment with clozapine, the possibility of myo- carditis should be considered. Management st rategies for tachycardia with antipsychotic medications include reducing the dose of medicati on, discontinuing medicati ons with anticholiner- gic or stimulant properties, and us ing the strategies descri bed above to reduce any contributing or - thostatic hypotension. Case reports have discussed the use of medications such as -blocking agents for persistent and significant tach ycardia with clozapine. Nevertheless, treatment is not indicated unless the patient is symptomatic or the patient's heart rate is substantially greater than 120 bpm because data from more rigorous studies are not available and these medications can contribute to other side effects, such as orthostatic hypotension (Lally et al. 2016a). If tachycardia is accompanied by pain, shortness of brea th, fever, or signs of a myocardial infarction or heart rhythm problem, emergency assessment is essential. Endocrine Side Effects Glucose Dysregulation and Diabetes Mellitus Evidence from meta-analyses of RCTs, population-based studies, and case-control studies suggests that some antipsychotic medications, clozapine and olanzapine in particular, are associated with an increased risk of hyperglycemia and diabetes (H irsch et al. 2017; Ward and Druss 2015; Whicher et 2018; al. 2017). Complicating the evalua tion of antipsychotic-related risk of diabetes is that some patients with first-episode psychosis s eem to have abnormal glucose regulation that pre- cedes antipsychotic treatment (Gree nhalgh et al. 2017; Perry et 20 16; Pillinger et al. 2017a). In ad- dition, obesity and treatment-related weight gain may contribute to diabetes risk. Nevertheless, there are some patients without other known risk factors who develop insulin resistance early in the course of antipsychotic treatment. In some individuals, diabetic ketoacidosis and nonketotic hy- perosmolar coma have been reported in the abse nce of a known diagnosis of diabetes (Guenette et al. 2013; Kato et al. 2015; Liao and 2014; Polcwiartek et al. 2016; Vuk et al. 2017). the rare occurrence of extreme hyperglycemia, ketoacidos is, hyperosmolar coma, or death and the sugges- tion from epidemiological studies of an increase d risk of treatment-emergent adverse events with SGAs, the FDA has requested that all manufacturer s of SGA medications include a warning in their product labeling regarding hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (Rostack 2003). When individuals with schizophrenia do develop diabetes, management principles should follow current guidelines for any patient with diabetes (Holt and Mitchell 20 15; Scott et al. 2012). Given the existence of fre- quent health disparities for individuals with seriou s mental illness (Mangurian et al. 2016; Scott et al. 2012), clinicians can also help in ensuring th at patients are obtaining appropriate diabetes care and encourage patients to engage in lifestyle in terventions to improve diabetes self-management (Cimo et al. 2012). In any patient with diabetes, it is also important to assess for other contributors to metabolic syndrome (Mitchell et al. 2012, 2013b). Hyperprolactinemia Prolactin elevation is frequent in patients treated with antipsychoti cs (Ajmal et al. 2014; Cookson et 2017a; Leucht et al. 2013; et al. 2016), which in- crease prolactin secretion by blocking the inhibitory actions of dopamine on lactotrophic cells in the The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 71 anterior pituitary. Consequently, hyperprolactinem ia is observed more frequently with the use of antipsychotics that are more potent at bloc king dopamine receptors (Tsuboi et al. 2013). In both men and women, prolactin-related disr uption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis can lead to decreased sexual interest and im paired sexual function (Kirino 2017; Rubio-Abadal et al. 2016). Other effects of hy perprolactinemia may include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, and lactation (Ajmal et al. 2014; Cookson et prolactin also regulates gonadal func- tion, hyperprolactinemia can lead to decreased production of gonadal hormones, including estro- gen and testosterone, resulting in disruption or elimination of menstrua l cycles in women. In addition, in lactating mothers, suppression of pr olactin may be detrimental, and the potential for this effect should be considered. The long-term clinical consequences of chronic elevation of prolactin are poorly understood. Chronic hypogonadal states may increase the risk of osteopenia/osteoporosis and fractures may be increased in individuals with schizophrenia, but a direct link to antipsychotic-induced hyperpro- lactinemia has not been established (Bolton et al . 2017; Stubbs et al. 2014, 2015; Tseng et al. 2015; Weaver et al. 2019). In addition, some concern ha s been expressed about potential effects of hyper- prolactinemia on the risk of breast or endometrial cancer; however, the available evidence suggests that such risks, if they exist, are likely to be smal l (De Hert et al. 2016; Potteg\u00e5rd et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2002). If a patient is experiencing clinical symptoms of prolactin elevation, the dose of antipsychotic med - ication may be reduced, or the medication regimen may be switched to an antipsychotic with less ef - fect on prolactin such as one with partial agonist activity at dopamine receptors (Ajmal et al. 2014; Grigg et al. 2017; Yoon et al. 2016). Administrati on of a dopamine agonist such as bromocriptine may also be considered. Sexual Function Disturbances A majority of patients with schizophrenia report some difficulties with sexual function. Although multiple factors are likely to contri bute and rates vary widely depending on the study, it is clear that antipsychotic treatment contributes to sexual dysfunction (de Boer et al. 2015; La Torre et al. 2013; and 2011; van Dijk et al. 2018). Effects of antipsychotic agents on sexual function may be mediated directly via drug actions on adrenergic and serotonergic recep - tors or indirectly through effects on prolactin gonadal hormones (Kirino 2017; Knegtering et al. et al. 2016). Loss of libido and anorgasmia can occur in men and in women; erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory disturbances also occur in men (La Torre et al. 2013; Marques et al. 2012; et al. 2018). Retrograde ejaculation has also been re - ported with specific antipsychotic medications (e.g., thioridazine, risperidone) (Chouinard et al. 1993; de Boer et al. 2015; Kotin et al. 1976). In addition, it is import ant to note that priapism can also occur in association with antipsychotic treatment, particularly in individuals with other underlying risk factors such as sickle cell disease (B urnett and Bivalacqua 2011; Sood et al. 2008). Despite the high rates of occurrence of sexual dysfunction with antips ychotic medication, many patients will not spontaneously report such difficul ties. Thus, it is importan t to ask patients specif - ically about these side effects. St ructured rating scales also exist to assess sexual side effects during antipsychotic treatment, and thes e can be used to supplement information obtained via interview (Clayton et al. 1997a, 1997b; de Boer et al. 2 014; Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance 2019; Keller et al. 2006). Education about se xual side effects of medication can also be provided to the pa- tient to communicate that these symptoms may occur but can be addressed (de Boer et al. 2015). When sexual side effects of antipsychotic therapy are of significant concern to the patient, a reduc- tion in medication dose or change in medication may be considered in addition to an assessment of other potential contributing fact ors (e.g., hyperprolactinemia, othe r medications, psychological fac- tors) (de Boer et al. 2015; La Torre et al. 2013). Pria pism, if it occurs, requires urgent urological con- sultation. APA Practice Guidelines 72 Gastrointestinal Side Effects The most common gastrointestinal side effects of antipsychotic medication s are related to anti- cholinergic side effects and include dry mouth and constipation, as noted in the subsection \"Treatment-Emergent Side Effects of Antipsycho tic Medications.\" Patients and families should be educated about monitoring for constipation, and, if present, constipa tion should be reported promptly to clinicians. With cl ozapine in particular, gastrointe stinal hypomotility can be severe and can result in fecal impaction or paralytic ile us (Every-Palmer and Elli s 2017; Leung et al. 2017; Palmer et al. 2008). Thus, if constipation is seve re or does not resolve, the patient should obtain urgent medical care. To prevent development of constipation in patients at increased risk (e.g., older patients, patients treated with clozapine), it is us eful to minimize the doses and nu mber of contributory medications such as other anticholinergic medications and opioid s. A stool softener (e.g., docusate [Colace]) can be started. Activity and exercise should be encouraged to stimulate motility. If constipation does develop, in itial treatment can include stool softeners (e.g., docusate [Colace]) If constipation persists, an enema (e .g., Fleet) should be considered. A combination of treatments may be needed to treat constipation and then to prevent its recurrence. Hepatic effects have also been reported with antipsychotic medi cations, including elevation of liver enzyme levels and cholestatic jaundice (U.S . Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. National Library of Medicine 2017b). Cholestati c jaundice is rare and has been reported primar- ily with chlorpromazine (U.S. Department of Heal th and Human Services and U.S. National Library of Medicine 2017a). It usually occurs within the fi rst month after the initiation of treatment and gen- erally requires discontinuation of treatment. Ho wever, given the relative infrequency of antipsy- chotic-induced jaundice, other etiologies for ja undice should be evaluated before the cause is judged to be antipsychotic medication. Hematological Effects Hematological effects are of greatest concern with clozapine; however, they have also been reported with other antipsychotic agents and may include inhibition of leukopoiesis, pu rpura, anemia, and ; al. 2019; 1969). For example, with chlorpromazine, transi ent benign leukopen ia (white blood cell count <3,500/mm3) is com- mon, and severe neutropenia has been reported in 0.08% of patients, typica lly within the first few months of treatment (Pisciotta 1969). There is no clear etiology of severe neutropeni a or agranulocytosis with antipsychotic medica - tions. With clozapine, a complex polygenic trait appears likely, perhaps involving the human leu- kocyte antigen locus or a group of hepatic transpor ter genes (de With et al. 2017; Legge et al. 2017). Initial estimates suggested that severe neutropenia would develop in 1%-2% of patients treated with clozapine, with fatal agranulocytosis in appr oximately 15% of those individuals (Alvir et al. 1993; Honigfeld et al. 1998). However, data from th e initial 5 years of monitoring through clozapine registries showed a rate of severe neutropenia of 0.38%, with death occurring in only 3.1% of those cases (Honigfeld et al. 1998). A recent meta-analy sis suggested an incidence of severe neutropenia in 0.9% of clozapine-treated patients, with a case fatality rate for individuals with severe neutrope- nia of 2.1% (Myles et al. 2018). For clozapine-treate d patients as a group, the incidence of death due to severe neutropenia was 0.013% (Myles et al. 201 8), suggesting that clozapine is quite safe with appropriate monitoring. Nevertheless, patients who are receiving clozapine should be advised to report any sign of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever, weakness, lethargy) i mmediately so that a deci- sion can be made about obta ining additional evaluation. If severe neutropenia does develop, it is usual ly reversible if clozapine is discontinued immedi - ately and secondary complications (e.g., sepsis) ar e given intensive treatment. Granulocyte colony- The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 73 stimulating factor has been used to accelerate granulopoietic function and shorten recovery time (Lally et al. 2017c; Myles et al. 2017). Although there have been reports of successful resumption of clozapine after severe neutropenia, the risk of recurrence remains high (Lally et al. 2017b; Manu et al. 2018). For patients with a good clinical response to clozap ine after multiple unsuccessful trials of other antipsychotic medications, the benefits and risks of rechallenge require thorough co nsideration and discussion with the patient and in- volved family members. Under such circumstances, case reports have suggested using granulocyte col- ony-stimulating factor to reduce the risk of recurren ce, although evidence is limited (Lally et al. 2017b). Neurological Side Effects Acute Dystonia Medication-induced acute dystonia is defined in DSM-5 as [a]bnormal and prolonged contraction of the muscles of the eyes (oculogyric crisis), head, neck (torticol - lis or retrocollis), limbs, or trunk developing within a few days of st arting or raising the dosage of a medication (such as a neuroleptic) or after reducing the dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyra- midal symptoms. (American Psychi atric Association 2013a, p. 711) A dystonic spasm of the axial muscles along the spinal cord can result in opisthotonos, in which the head, neck, and spinal column are hyperextended in an arched position. Rarely, acute dystonia can also present as life-threatening laryngospasm, which results in an inability to breathe (Ganesh et al. 2015; Koek and Pi 1989). Acute dystonia is sudden in onset and painful and can cause patients great distress. Because of the dramatic appearance of acute dystonia, health professionals who are unfa - miliar with the condition may incorrectly attribute these reactions to catatonic signs or unusual be- havior on the part of patients, and oculogyric cr ises can sometimes be misinterpreted as indicative of seizure activity. In individuals treated with FGAs, it is estimated that up to 10% of patients may experience an acute dystonic episode, and with SGAs, rates of ac ute dystonia may be less than 2% (Martino et al. 2018; Miller et al. 2008; Satterthwai te et al. 2008). Additional factor s that increase the risk of acute dystonia with antipsychotic medication include young age, male sex, ethnicity, recent cocaine use, high medication dose, and intramuscular route of medication administration (Gray and Pi 1998; Spina et al. 1993; van Harten et al. 1999). For furthe r discussion of acute dystonia, including its treat- ment, see Statement 11 . Akathisia acute akat is defined in DSM-5 as [s]ubjective complaints of restlessness, often accompanied by observed excessive movements (e.g., fid - gety movements of the legs, rocking from foot to foot, pacing, inability to sit or stand still), developing within a few weeks of starti ng or raising the dosage of a medication (such as a neuroleptic) or after re - ducing the dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms. (American Psychiatric As - sociation 2013a, p. 711) Akathisia is sometimes difficult to distinguish from psychomotor agitation associated with psycho- sis, leading to a cycle of increasing doses of anti psychotic medication that lead to further increases in akathisia. Even in mild forms in which the pati ent is able to control most movements, akathisia is often extremely distressing to patients and is a frequent cause of nonadherence with antipsy- chotic treatment. If allowed to persist, akathisia can cont ribute to feelings of dysphoria and, in some instances, suicidal behaviors. The reported rates of akathisia vary from 10%-15% to as many as one- third of patients treated with antipsychotic medi cation, even when SGAs are used (Juncal-Ruiz et 2017; et al. 2018; Mentzel et al. 2017; Mi ller et al. 2008). For furt her discussion of akathi- sia, including its treatment, see Statement 13. APA Practice Guidelines 74 Parkinsonism Medication-induced parkinsonism, which is term parkinsoni sm in as [p]arkinsonian tremor, muscular rigidi ty, akinesia (i.e., loss of moveme nt or difficulty initiating move- ment), or bradykinesia (i.e., slowing movement) deve loping within a few weeks of starting or raising the dosage of a medication (e.g., a neuroleptic) or after reducing the dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms. (American Psychiatric As sociation 2013a, p. 709) These symptoms of medication-induced parkinso nism are dose-dependent and generally resolve with discontinuation of antipsychotic medication. It is important to appr eciate that medication- induced parkinsonism can affect emotional and cognitive function, at times in the absence of de - tectable motor symptoms. As a result, it can be difficult to distinguish the negative symptoms of schizophrenia or concomitant depression from medication-induced parkinsonism. In addition, emotional and cognitive features of medication-i nduced parkinsonism can be subjectively un- pleasant and can contribute to poor medication adherence (Acosta et al. 2012; Ascher-Svanum et al. 2006). For further discussion of medication-induced parkinsoni sm, including its treatment, see Statement 12. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome NMS is characterized by a classic triad of rigidity, hyperthermia (>100.4\u00b0F/38.0\u00b0C on at least two occasions, measured orally), and sympathetic nervous system lability, including hypertension and tachycardia, in the context of exposure to a dopa mine antagonist (or withdrawal of a dopamine ag- onist), typically within 72 hours of symptom development (American Psychiatric Association 2013a; Gurrera et al. 2011, 2017). In addition, NMS is associated with an elevated level of serum cre- atine kinase (typically, at least four times the u pper limit of normal), tachypnea, change in mental status (e.g., delirium, stupor), and lack of another identified etiology for the symptoms. Notably, however, the onset and clinical features of NMS can vary and may make recognition more difficult. If misdiagnosed and mistreated, NMS can be fa tal (Berman 2011; Rosebush and Stewart 1989; Strawn et al. 2007). Other diagnostic considerations in patients pr esenting with possible NMS include malignant catatonia, malignant hyperthermia (in association wi th anesthetic administration), heat stroke (for which patients treated with antipsychotics have a heightened susceptibili ty), serotonin syndrome (in patients also taking serotone rgic drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), benign elevations in the level of serum creatine kinase, fe ver in association with or sedative withdrawal, with use and hallucinogens, central nervous system infections, limbic encephalitis, and inflammatory or autoimmune conditions (American Psychiatric Association 2013a; Berman 2011; Rosebush and Stewart 1989; Strawn et al. 2007). NMS has been reported with almost all medications that block do pamine receptors, but a greater risk of occurrence appears to be associated with high-potency FGAs (Schneider et al. 2018; St\u00fcbner et al. 2004). Risk also may be in creased by use of short-acting in tramuscular formulations of anti- psychotic medications, use of higher total drug dosages, or rapid increases in the dosage of the an - tipsychotic medication (Keck et al. 1989; Sachdev et al. 1997; Viejo et al. 2003). Additional risk factors for NMS include acute agitation, dehydratio n, exhaustion, iron deficiency, physical illness, preexisting neurological disability, and a prior episode of NMS (American Psychiatric Association 2013a; Keck et al. 1989; Sachdev et al. 1997; Strawn et al. 2007). Because NMS is rare, with an estimated incidenc e of 0.01%-0.02% among individuals treated with antipsychotics (Schneider et al. 2018; St\u00fcbner et al. 2004), most evidence regarding NMS treatment comes from single case reports or case series. An tipsychotic medications should always be discontin- ued, and supportive treatment to maintain hydratio n and to treat the fever and cardiovascular, renal, The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 75 or other symptoms should be provided (Ameri can Psychiatric Association 2013a; Berman 2011; Strawn et al. 2007). NMS is usually self-limited, with resolution within a week of medication discon- tinuation in the majority of patients; however, pr olonged symptoms of NMS do occur and may be as- sociated with use of LAI antipsychotic medications (Caroff and Mann 1988; Caroff et al. 2000). In addition to antipsychotic discontinuation an d supportive care, a number of approaches have been used to treat NMS, although evidence is limi ted to case reports and case series (Pileggi and Cook 2016; Strawn et al. 2007). Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, have been used because of their benefits in treating catatonia and the para llels between malignant ca tatonia and NMS. As a postsynaptic D2 receptor agonist, bromocriptine has been used to counteract the dopamine antag- onist effects of the antipsychotic medication. Dantrolene, a direct-acting sk eletal muscle relaxant, has also been used, particularly in severe cases of NMS, because of its benefits in treating malignant hyperthermia. When NMS has not responded to th ese interventions or when catatonic symptoms persist after the resolution of NMS, case reports suggest that ECT can be beneficial (Caroff et al. 2000; Pileggi and Cook 2016; Strawn et al. 2007; Wittenauer Welsh et al. 2016). Assistance with emergency management of NMS is recommended and can be obtained through NMSContact (www.mhaus.org/nmsis/nmscontact). Once NMS has resolved, caution is needed when re suming an antipsychotic medication because re - currence has been reported (Rosebush and Stewart 1989; Strawn et al. 2007; Susman and Addonizio 1988). Generally, when treatment is resumed, dose s are increased gradually, and a medication other than the precipitating agent is used, typically one with a lower potency at blocking dopamine D2 receptors. Seizures Among the antipsychotic medications, clozapine is as sociated with the greatest likelihood of a sei- zure, and patients with a history of an idiopathic or medication-induced seizure may have a higher risk (Alldredge 1999; De vinsky and Pacia 1994; Wong and Delv a 2007). Although generalized tonic- clonic seizures are most frequent, other types of seizures may occur. Seizures may also be preceded by myoclonus or drop attacks. The seizure risk with clozapine is increased by rapi d increases in dose as we ll as at high blood levels or doses of the drug. The overall seizure rate is 2.8%; with low-dose trea tment (<300 doses (300-599 mg/day) the risk is 2.7%, and with high doses (>599 mg/day) the risk is 4.4% (Devinsky et al. 1991). Therefore, a sl ow initial titration of clozapine dose is essential, and patients should be cautioned not to drive or engage in other potentially hazardous activities while clozapine is being titrated. In individuals at high risk of seizure, prophylactic treatment with an anticonvulsant medication can be considered. FGAs can also lower the seizure threshold in a dose-related manner and result in the development of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (Alldredge 1999). Nevertheless, at usual dose ranges, seizure rates are below 1% for all FGAs. In patients who do experience a seizure while taking clozapine or another antipsyc hotic medication, neurological consultation will be important for delineating the risks of a further seizure, determining whether anticonvulsant therapy (e.g., valproate) is indicated, and coll aborating with the clinician in de- termining whether the patient's antipsychotic syndromes are persistent abnormal involunt ary movement disorders caused by sustained ex- posure to antipsychotic medication, the most common of dys- begin later treatm ent than acute dystonia, akathisia, or medication-induced parkinsonism, and they persist and may even increase, despite re- duction in dose or discontinuation of the antipsychotic medication. choreiform move ments (lasting at least a few weeks) generally of the tongue, lower face and jaw, and extremities (b ut sometimes involving th e pharyngeal, diaphrag- APA Practice Guidelines 76 matic, or trunk muscles)\" (American Psychiatric As sociation 2013a, p. 712), whereas tardive dysto - nia and resemble thei r acute counterparts in phenomenology. Tardive dyskinesia has been reported after exposu re to any of the available antipsychotic medi- cations (Carbon et al. 2017, 2018). It occurs at a ra te of approximately 4%-8% per year in adult pa - tients treated with FGAs (Carbon et al. 2018; Woods et al. 2010), a ri sk that appears to be at least three times that observed with SGAs (Carbon et al. 2018; O'Brien 2016; Woods et al. 2010). Various factors are associated with grea ter vulnerability to tardive dyskinesia, including age greater than 55 years; female sex; white or Af rican race/ethnicity; presence of a mood disorder, intellectual dis- ability, or central nervous system injury; and past or current akathisia, clinically significant parkin - sonism, or acute dystonic on-Lomba et al. 2019; Solmi et al. 2018a). Although the majority of patients who develop tardive dyskinesia have mild symptoms, a small proportion will develop symptoms of moderate or severe degree. Tardive dyskinesia can have sig- nificant effects on qualit y of life and can be associated with social withdrawal (McEvoy et al. 2019). Although the impact appears to be influenced by the severity of tardive dyskinesia, individuals with mild symptoms can also experience negative effects on quality of life. Evaluation of the risk of tardive dyskinesia is co mplicated by the fact that dyskinetic movements may be observed with a reduction in antipsychotic medication dose, whic h is termed a withdrawal-emergent dyskinesia (American Psychiatric Association 2013a). Fluctuations in symptoms are also common and may be influenced by such factors as psychosoci al stressors. Furthermore, spontaneous dyskinesias, which are clinically indistin guishable from tardive dyskinesia, have been described in elderly patients before the advent of antipsychotic medications an d in up to 20% of neve r-medicated patients with chronic schizophrenia (Blanchet et al. 2004; Crow et al. 1982; Fenton et al. 1997; Saltz et al. 1991). In longer-term studies, findings are often confounded by the sequential or concomitant use of more than one antipsychotic medication and the lack of system atic prospective assessments for the presence of a movement disorder (Tarsy and Baldessarini 2006). Nevertheless, evaluation for the presence of tardive syndromes is important in order to identify them, minimize worsening, and inst itute clinically indicated treatment. For further discussion of tardive syndromes, including their treatment, see Statement 14. Ophthalmological Effects The most common ophthalmological effects of antips ychotic medications are re lated to the anticholin- ergic effects of these agents and include blurred and exacerbation of open-angle glaucoma. Pig- mentary retinopathies op can with chronic ad ministration of the low-potency medications thioridazine and chlorpromazine, particularly at high dose s (e.g., more than 800 mg/day of thioridazine) (Matsuo et al. 2016). With SGAs, including quetiapine, evidence does not suggest any increase in the likelihood of cataract development (Laties et al. 2015; Pakzad-Vaezi et al. 2013). If pa - tients do undergo cataract surgery, however, there ha ve been case reports of intraoperative floppy-iris syndrome in individuals treated with antipsychoti c medications, a complicat ion that has been asso- ciated with use of medications that block 1-adrenergic receptors (Chatziralli and Sergentanis 2011). Although adverse ophthalmological effects of antipsychotic medications are infrequent, encouraging regular eye care is important to maintaining good vi sion for individuals with schizophrenia (Vierti\u00f6 et al. 2007), particularly because of high rates of diabetes and other health conditions that can affect sight. Other Side Effects Anticholinergic Effects The anticholinergic effects of some antipsychotic me dications (along with the anticholinergic effects of antiparkinsonian medications, if concurrently administered) can produce a variety of peripheral side effects, including dry mouth, blurred vision, co nstipation, tachycardia, urinary retention, and ef - fects on thermoregulation (e.g., hyperthermia in ho t weather) (Nasrallah and Tandon 2017; Ozbilen and Adams 2009). Central anticholinergic effects can include impaired learning and memory and slowed cognition (Ang et al. 2017; Vinogradov et al. 2009). The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 77 Because most anticholinergic side effects are mild and tolerable, they are often overlooked. Never- theless, they can have multiple im plications for patients, including impaired quality of life and signif - icant health complications (Salahudeen et al. 2015). For example, dry mouth is associated with an in - creased risk for multiple dental complications (Singh and Papa s 2014), and drinking high-calorie fluids in response to dry mouth can contribute to weight gain. The muscar inic receptor antagonist properties of antipsychotic drugs can be particul arly problematic in older individuals and can con- tribute to problems such as urinary retention, confusion, fecal impaction, and anticholinergic toxicity (with delirium, somnolence, and hallucinations) Anticholinergic 2007), although pa tients with treated glaucoma seem to be able to tolerate these medications with ca reful monitoring (Bower et al. 2018). The propensity of an antipsychotic medication to cause anticholinergic effects should be consid- ered when choosing an antipsychotic agent initially, particularly in older individuals or those with physical conditions that may confer a greater risk of anticholinergic compli cations. In selecting a medication, it is also important to keep in mind the total anticholinergic burden from antipsychotic medications, antiparkinsonian and other with anticholin- ergic side effects. For this reason, antiparkinsonian me dications with antichol inergic properties are not typically administered on a prophylactic basis. When anticholinergic side effects do occur, they are often dose-related and thus may improve with lowering of the dose or administering the med-ications that have anticholinergic properties in di vided doses. For additional discussion of anticho- linergic properties of antiparkisonian medications, see Statement 12. Fever Fever (>38\u00b0C) should prompt assessment for possibl e etiologies, including NMS or infection. In hot weather, the possibility of heat stroke should be considered in patients who do not have access to air-conditioned environments due to the increased risk of heat-related ev ents in individuals with psychiatric illness (Bouchama et al. 2007) and the effects of some an tipsychotics and anticholinergic agents on thermoregulation (Martin-Latry et al. 2007). In patients who are treated with clozapine, a brief self-limiting fever may occur during the first few weeks of treatment and responds to sup- portive measures (Bruno et al. 2015; Lowe et al. 200 7; Pui-yin Chung et al. 2008). However, it is also essential to assess for the presence of potentially life-threatening complications, including NMS, se- vere neutropenia, and myocarditis. Sedation Sedation is a of antips ychotic medications (Citrome 2017a; Leucht et al. 2013). This effect may be related to antagonist ef fects of those drugs on histamine, adrenergic, and dopamine receptors (Michl et al. 2014). Sedation is most pronounced in the initial phases of treat- ment, and many patients develop so me tolerance to the sedating ef fects with continued administra- tion. For agitated patients, the sedating effects of these medications in the initial phase of treatment can have therapeutic benefits. Bedtime sedation can also be desirable for patients who are having dif - ficulty sleeping. However, persistent sedation, in cluding daytime drowsiness, increased sleep time, and reduced cognitive acuity, can interfere with social, recreational, and vocational function. Lowering of the daily dose, consolidation of divided doses into one evening dose, or changing to a less sedating antipsychotic medication may be effective in reducing the severity of sedation. Coffee or other caffeine can be helpful in the morning but can also interact with medications (e.g., contribute to tachycardia; raise blood levels of medications, including clozapine). Adding a stimu - lant medication is not typically helpful and can lead to additional side effects. If sedation or the risk of sedation is significant (e.g., during initial cl ozapine titration), patients should be cautioned not to drive or engage in potentially hazardous activities. APA Practice Guidelines 78 Sialorrhea Sialorrhea (or hypersalivation) is a frequent side effect of clozapine (Maher et al. 2016) but can also be observed with other antipsychotic medications (Ess ali et al. 2013). The etiolo gy of sialorrhea is un- clear but may relate to decreased saliva clea rance, although actions on muscarinic or -adrenergic receptors have also been postulated (Ekstr\u00f6m et al . 2010). Sialorrhea can contribute to reductions in quality of life and can also be associated with complications such as aspiration pneumonia (Dzahini et al. 2018; Kaplan et al. 2018; Stoecker et al. 2017). During the day, patients can be encouraged to chew sugarless gum, which stimulates the swal- lowing reflex. Because sialorrhea may be more bo thersome at night, pati ents may be advised to place a towel on their pillow and change to a clean towel in the middle of the night to minimize discomfort. Pharmacological approaches to address sialorrhea come from small studies and case re - ports and include use of low-dose or topical anticholinergic medications, such as glycopyrrolate or sublingual ophthalmic atropine 1% drops (Bird et al. 2011; Liang et al. 2010; Man et al. 2017). Di- phenhydramine has also been studied (Chen et al . 2019); however, because clozapine and other an- tipsychotics can have significant anticholinergic properties themselves and anticholinergics have small effects on sialorrhea, the use of agents wi th added anticholinergic effects should be ap - proached cautiously. Terazosin and, in severe refr actory cases, botulinum to xin have also been used (Bird et al. 2011; Liang et al. 2010; Man et al. 2017). Weight Gain Weight gain occurs with most antipsychotic agents and appears to relate to actions of these medi- cations as histamine H1 receptor antagonists, although actions on serotonin and muscarinic recep- tors may also play a role (He et al. 2013; Kroeze et al. 2003; Michl et al. 2014; Olten and Bloch 2018). Reviews and meta-analyses have compared average weight gains with antipsychotic treatment and the proportion of patients who gain 7% or more of body weight (Bak et al. 2014; Leucht et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2013). Nevertheless, there is substantial variability in the amount of weight gain that will occur in an individual patient who is treate d with a specific antipsychotic medication. Typi - cally, weight gain is progressive over the first 6 months of treatment, although some patients con- tinue to gain weight inde finitely (Alvarez-Jimenez et al. 2008). In addition, younger individuals who are experiencing a first episode of psychosis ma y be more likely than older individuals to gain weight with antipsychotic medication (Correll et al. 2014; Jensen et al. 2019). In identifying individ - uals with schizophrenia who experience weight ga in with antipsychotic treatment, self-reported awareness may be less effective than ob jective measurement (Gao et al. 2016). Obesity, in general, can contribute to an increa se in risk for mortality and morbidity, including increased rates of cardiovascular disease, hypert ension, cancers, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and sleep apnea (Aune et Bellou et al. 2016; Stringhini et al. 2017). Consequently, weight gain with antipsycho tic medications is also likely to contribute to an increase in physical health conditions and mort ality. Prevention of weight gain should, thus, be a high priority because weight loss is difficult for most patients. Efforts should be made to intervene proactively with weight gain of 5-10 pounds because people who are obese rarely lose more than 10% of body weight with weight loss regimens. A number of studies have evaluate d the effectiveness of specific interventions to prevent or treat antipsychotic-induced weight gain (Caemmerer et al. 2012; Das et al. 2012; de Silva et al. 2016; Gierisch et al. et al. 2010; Vancampfort et al. 2019; Zheng et al. 2015). Nutritional interventions have shown small but consistent benefits (Bonfioli et al. 2012), although patients who are wi lling to enroll in and are able to adhere to such studies may not be representati ve. Nevertheless, nutritional approaches may be suggested for their be nefits for overall health as well as for weight. Such approaches include specialized behavioral health interventions, in-person community interventions ( e.g., Weight Watchers), services that include meal delivery (e.g., Jenny Craig), and Internet-based in terventions (e.g., Omada Health). In The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 79 addition, some programs have begun to integrat e dietitians into the treatment team, given the nutritional challenges that exist for many individual s with serious mental illness (Teasdale et al. 2017). Other nonpharmacological approaches that have been studied include exercise and cognitive- behavioral therapy approaches (Bonfioli et al. 2012; Caemmerer et al. 2012; Das et al. 2012). In collaboration with the patient's primary care clinician, medication strategies for weight loss can be considered. Of the pharmacological treatments that have been assessed, metformin has been studied most often. It has been shown to be safe in individuals without hyperglycemia, shows mod - est benefits on weight (with average weight loss of 3-4 kg), and can reverse metabolic abnormalities in patients with obesity or other metabolic problems (Das et al. 2012; de Silva et al. 2016; McGinty et al. 2016; et al. al. 201 et al. 2019; Zheng et al. 2015; Zhuo et al. 2018). However, most studies have been sm all, and follow-up periods have not been longer than 6 months. Modest benefit has also been seen in several studies of glucagon-like peptide-1 re - ceptor agonists (Siskind et al. 2019) small studies of (Mahmood et al. 2013; Mizuno et al. 2019; Zhuo et al . 2018). Other medications have been examined in small trials or case series, with less consistent findings (Miz uno et al. 2014). This limited evidence and the modest benefit of these pharmacological trea tments need to be considered in light of po - tential adverse effects. Another consideration for a patient who has experienced significant weight gain with antipsy- chotic treatment is to change or augment treatm ent with a medication with lower weight-gain lia- bility (Vancampfort et al. 2019). When possible, other medications that can cause weight gain (e.g., valproate) should be tapered and discontinued. Such decisions need to consider the extent of the patient's response to the current medication regime n, the risks to the patient if relapse occurs with a medication change, and the likelihood that a medi cation change will be beneficial in terms of weight loss or other side effects (Manu et al. 2015; Mukundan et al. 2010; Newcomer et al. 2013; Vancampfort et al. 2019). In any patient with weight gain, it is also important to assess for other con- tributors to metabolic syndrome (Mitchell et al. 2012, 2013b). The benefits of exercise appear to be small in terms of weight loss in indi viduals with schizophrenia (Firth et al. 2015; 2014; Vancampfort et al. 2017, 2019 ). Nevertheless, many individuals with schizophrenia do not engage in physical activity (Stubbs et al. 2016a; Vancampfort et al. 2016b), and exercise can be suggested for its benefits to overall health, improved cardiorespiratory fitness, and other aspects of functioning (Dauwan et al. 2016 ; Firth et al. 2015, 2017; Vancampfort et al. 2017, 2019). Health promotion coaching interventions focused on individuals with mental illness, such as the In SHAPE program, can also be pursued and may be associated with weight loss and reduced cardio- vascular risk (Bartels et al. 2015; Naslund Van Citters et al. 201 0; Verhaeghe et al. 2013). Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits Use of an antipsychotic medication in the treatment of schizophrenia can improve positive and neg- ative symptoms of psychosis (high strength of re search evidence) and can also lead to reductions in depression and improvements in quality of life and functioning (moderate strength of research evidence). A meta-analysis of double-blind, rand omized, placebo-controlled trials showed a me- dium effect size for overall efficacy (Leucht et al . 2017), with the greatest effect on positive symp- toms. The rates of achievin g any response or a good response we re also significantly greater in pa- tients who received an antipsychotic medication. In addition, the proportion of individuals who dropped out of treatment for any reason and for lack of efficacy was significantly less in those who were treated with an antipsychotic medication. Research evidence from head-to-head comparison studies and network meta-analysis (McDonagh et al. 2017) showed no consistent evidence that fa- vored a specific antipsychotic medication, with the possible exception of clozapine. APA Practice Guidelines 80 Harms The harms of using an antipsychotic medication in the treatment of schizophrenia include sedation, side effects mediated through dopamine receptor blockade (e.g., acute dystonia, akathisia, parkin- sonism, tardive effects, weight gain, glucose abnormalit ies, hyperlipidemia, tachycardia, and QTc prolongation. Clozapine has ad ditional harms associated with its use, includ - ing sialorrhea, seizures, neutropenia (which can be severe and life-threate ning), myocarditis, and cardiomyopathy. Among the antipsychotic medication s, there is variability in the rates at which each of these effects occurs, and no specific medica tion appears to be devoid of possible side effects. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that many patients are cooperative with and accepting of antipsychotic medications as part of a treatment plan. A survey of patient preferences reported that patients viewed an ability to think more clearly and an ability to st op hallucinations or parano ia as important efficacy- related reasons to take an antipsychotic medication (Achtyes et al. 2018). However, patients also re - ported concerns about side effects, particularly weight gain, sedation , and restlessness, as reasons that they might not wish to take antipsychotic medicati ons. Some patients might also choose not to take an antipsychotic medication when they are feeling well or if they do not view themselves as having a condition that requires treatment. Some patients may also prefer one medication over another med- ication on the basis of prior treatment experiences or other factors. Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statemen t were viewed as far outweighing the potential harms. Although harms of antipsychotic medication s can be significant, the impact of schizophre - nia on patients' lives is also substantial, and co nsistent benefits of an tipsychotic treatment were found. Harms of treatment can be mitigated by selecting medications on the basis of individual characteristics and preferences of patients as well as by choosing a medication on the basis of its side-effect profile, pharmacological characteristics, and other factors. For clozapine, the additional benefits of treatment were viewed as outweighin g the additional rare but serious harms and the need for ANC monitoring to reduce the likelihood of severe neutropenia. For additional discussion of the research evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 4. Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members There were no differences of opinion. The writing group voted unanimously in favor of this recom-mendation. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations Information from other guidelines is consistent wi th this guideline statement. Other guidelines on the treatment of schizophrenia (BAP , Canadian Schizophrenia Guidelines [CSG], NICE, PORT, RANZCP , SIGN, WFSBP) all recommend use of an antipsychotic medication in the treatment of schizophrenia, with the selection of a specific medication on an individualized basis with consid - eration of medication characterist ics, patient characteristics, and patient preferences (Addington et al. 2017a, 2017b; Barnes et al. 201 1; Buchanan et al. 2010; Crockf ord and Addington 2017; Galletly et al. 2016; Hasan et al. 2012; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014; Pringsheim et al. 2017; Remington et al. 2017; Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2013). Each guideline also recommends monitoring during the course of treatment to assess th erapeutic response and treatment-related side effects. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 81 Quality Measurement Considerations In clinical practice, almost all individuals with schizophrenia are offered an antipsychotic medica - tion. Thus, a quality measure is unlikely to enhance outcomes if it examines only whether an indi - vidual with schizophrenia is offered or receives an initial prescription for antipsychotic treatment. An existing National Quality Forum-endorsed me asure, \"Adherence to An #1879 , www.qualityforum.org/QPS/1879 ), is aimed at assessing whether an antipsychotic medication is continued once it is begun. For individuals who are at least 18 years old and who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, this measure assesses the percentage who have been dispensed an antipsychotic medication (as re - flected by at least two such pr escriptions being filled) and who had a proportion of covered days of at least 0.8 during a 12 consecutive month measurement period. By requiring ongoing prescrib - ing of antipsychotic medication, th is measure is more likely to be associated with improvements in outcomes for patients. Nevertheless, this measure does have several limitations. It uses pharmacy claims data or electronic prescription orders to examine whether a medication has been prescribed, but such measures do not guarantee treatment adherence. For instance, a prescriber could submit an antipsychotic medication prescr iption and the patient could fill the prescription at the pharmacy, but the patient might not actually take the medica tion. This measure also does not determine the adequacy of the medication or the medication do se and could be met through continuous prescrip- tions of a subtherapeutic dose or clinically ineffective antipsychotic. Another limitation is the diffi- culty in determining the proportion of covered days in a 12 consecutive month period, particularly when patients have transitions in care between settings or treating clinicians. Quality measures, quality improvement initiatives, or electronic decision supports may be ap- propriate for monitoring side effects of antipsyc hotic treatment. Evidence suggests that rates of guideline concordant monitoring are low for metabolic risk factors, including lipids, diabetes, and weight (Mitchell et al. 2012; Morrato et al. 2009) . Several measures endorsed by NQF address such monitoring. NQF #1932, \"Diabetes Screening for Pe ople With Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder Who Are Using Antipsychotic Medications\" (www.qualityforum.org/QPS/1932) measures the percentage of patients ages 18-64 years with sc hizophrenia or bipolar disorder \"who were dis - pensed an antipsychotic medication and had a diabetes screening test during the measurement year.\" Because this measure is focused on screening, it excludes monitoring of individuals who had diabetes in the measurement year or in the preceding year. NQF #1927, \"Cardiovascular Health Screening for People With Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder Who Are Prescribed Antipsychotic Medications\" (www.qualityforum.org/QPS/1927) measures the percentage of individuals ages 25-64 years with sc hizophrenia or bipolar disorder \"who were pre- scribed any antipsychotic medication and who rece ived a cardiovascular health screening during the measurement year,\" where cardiovascular health screening consists of \"one or more LDL-C screenings performed during the measurement year.\" Individuals are excluded from this screening measure for having evidence of preexisting cardiova scular disease as defined by precise criteria in the measure text. Presently, the specific elements of these criteria can often be challenging to deter- mine from unstructured electronic health records. Two monitoring, res pectively, for individuals with preexisting cardio vascular disease or diabetes. Each of these mea- sures is limited to individuals who are ages 18-64 years. The cardiovascular monitoring measure requires that individuals receive \"an LDL-C test performed during the measurement year,\" whereas the diabetes monitoring measure requires \"[o]ne or more HbA1c tests and one or more LDL-C tests performed during the measurement year.\" These measures have been tested for feasi- bility, usability, reliability, and validity at the he alth plan, integrated deli very system, and popula - tion levels; however, before holding individual clin icians or facilities acco untable for the delivered quality of care, the measures would need additional testing at these levels. APA Practice Guidelines 82 STATEMENT 5: Continuing Medications APA recommends (1A) that patients with schizophrenia whose symptoms have improved with an antipsychotic medication continue to be treated with an antipsychotic medication.* Implementation For individuals with a di agnosis of schizophrenia whose sympto ms have improved with an anti- psychotic medication, there are a number of benefi ts to maintenance treatment, including reduced risks of relapse (Bowtell et al. 2018; Goff et al. 2 017; Hui et al. 2018; Kishi et al. 2019; Leucht et al. 2012; Thompson et al. 2018), rehospitalization (Tiiho nen et al. 2018), and death (Tiihonen et al. 2018; Vermeulen et al. 2017). When administered on a long-term basis, however, antipsychotic medications are also associated with a greate r incidence of weight gain, sedati on, and movement disorders (Leucht et al. 2012). In addition, some studies have rais ed questions about whethe r long-term antipsychotic treatment might be associated with other adverse ef fects on functioning or health, including loss of brain volume (Davidson 2018; Goff et al. 2017). These data are heterogeneous, and when compared with withholding treatment, there was minimal evid ence to suggest negative effects of maintenance treatments on outcomes (Goff et al. 2017; Huhtaniska et al. 2017). In addition, it may be possible to mit - igate these risks by preventive interventions (e.g., early intervention for weight gain, screening for lipid and glucose abnormalities) and carefu l monitoring for side effects of medication. Nevert heless, as treat- ment proceeds, the pluses and minuses of continuing treatment with an antips ychotic medication should be reviewed with the patient in the context of shared decision-making. It will typically be beneficial to include family members or other persons of support in such discussions (Hamann and Heres 2019). Despite the benefits of continued antipsychotic tr eatment for the majority of patients, maintain- ing adherence to an antipsychotic medication can be difficult (Acosta et al. 2012; Shafrin et al. 2016; Valenstein et al. 2006). Barriers to, facilitators of , and motivators of treatm ent adherence will differ for each patient. Engaging family members or other persons of support can be helpful in fostering adherence (Mueser et al. 2015). Other approaches to assessing and enhanc ing adherence are de- scribed in detail in Statement 3. For some patients, the formulation of the antips ychotic medication may influence adherence (see Statement 4, Table 3). For example, rapidly dissolvi ng tablets or oral concentrates may be preferable for patients who have difficulty swallowing pill s or who are ambivalent about medications and in- consistent in swallowing them. LA I formulations may be preferred by some patients (Heres et al. 2007; Patel et al. 2009; Walburn et al. 2001) and may be particularly useful fo r patients with a history of poor or uncertain ad herence (see Statement 10). It is also important to assess the ongoing benefits and side effects of treatment that may indicate a need for adjustments to medication doses or chan ges in medications. The use of quantitative mea- sures can be helpful in systematically assessing ea ch of these realms (see Statement 2). The optimal dose of medication is one that provides the best me dication benefits yet is tolerable in terms of med- ication side effects. For some patients, adjustments in dose will be required during the course of treatment to maintain this balance (Essock et al. 2006). Such factors as addi tion or discontinuation of interacting medications, changes in smoking status, changes in patient body mass, changes in re- nal or hepatic status, or changes in drug absorpti on (e.g., with bariatri c surgery) may influence medication pharmacokinetics and require increase s or decreases in medication dose. In order to minimize the risk of extended side effects, when medications with a long ha lf-life are used and par- ticularly when LAI antipsychotic medications are used, considerations about changes in dose need to consider the extended actions of these medications. *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 83 Evidence on the rationale and approach to planned reductions of medication doses is limited. Unless a medication requires emergent discontinuation, gradual reductions in doses are preferable, with close monitoring for recurrent symptoms. Shared decision-making discussions with the pa tient should consider the patient's recovery goals, the potential benefits of medication changes or dose reductions in terms of changes or dim- inution of side effects, and the potential harms of medication changes or dose reductions (Davidson 2018). The longitudinal course of the patient's epis ode and the certainty of the diagnosis should also be considered. There may be some individuals with a brief episode of psychosis or uncertain psy - chotic diagnosis (e.g., possible substance-induce d psychosis or mood-related psychosis) who may not require continuing antipsychotic treatment. On the other hand, individuals with chronic symp- toms, repeated relapses, and clear diagnostic features of schizophrenia will likely have poorer out- comes if medications are stopped. In addition to symptom recurrence and relapse, medication ces- sation may be associated with hospitalization, legal difficulties, reduced likelihood of response with reinstatement of treatment, or poorer psychosocial outcomes (Correll et al. 2018; Hui et al. 2018; Takeuchi et al. 2019; Wilper et al. 2009). It will typically be beneficial to include family mem- bers or other persons of support in discussion s of medication changes or dose reductions. Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits Use of an antipsychotic medication that has alre ady been associated with symptom response can maintain improvements in symptoms as well as promote enhanced functioning and quality of life (high strength of research evidence). Long-term treatment with an antipsychotic medication has also been associated with a redu ction in mortality as compared wi th no antipsychotic treatment in individuals with schizophrenia. In contrast, discontinuation of antipsychotic treatment can be as- sociated with increases in symptoms and risk of hospitalization and poorer long-term outcomes, including greater mortality in the long te rm (low strength of research evidence). Harms The harms of continuing use of an antipsychotic medication can vary depending on whether the patient is experiencing any significant side effect s from the medication that would have long-term untoward effects. For patients whose medications are well tolerated, long-term risks include tar-dive syndromes from antipsychotic medications. For other patients, long-term risks will vary ac-cording to the specific side effect, with metaboli c effects of antipsychotic medication serving as a possible contributor to long-term health risks. Some studies have raised concerns about changes in brain region volumes with antipsychotic treatmen t, but these findings are heterogeneous and in- consistent. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that many patients are cooperative with and accepting of antipsy- chotic medications as part of a treatment plan. This is particularly true when the medication has been associated with a response in symptoms. Inde ed, a survey of patient preferences reported that patients viewed an ability to think more clearly an d an ability to stop hallucinations or paranoia as important efficacy-related reasons to take an an tipsychotic medica tion (Achtyes et al. 2018). Pa- tients are also likely to value the long-term bene fits that have been shown with continued antipsy- chotic treatment, including reductions in rela pses, hospitalizations, and mortality. However, patients also report concerns about side effects, particularly weight gain, sedation, and restlessness, that can make them reluctant to take antipsychoti c medications on a long-term basis. In addition, APA Practice Guidelines 84 some patients may choose not to take an antipsycho tic medication when they are feeling well or if they do not view themselves as having a condition that requires treatment. Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statemen t were viewed as far outweighing the potential harms. Although harms of antipsychotic medications can be significant and the long-term effects of antipsychotic medications are no t well studied, the impact of sc hizophrenia on patients' lives is also substantial, and consistent benefits of continued antipsychotic treatment were found. Overall, rates of mortality appear to be reduced by ongo ing treatment with an antipsychotic medication as compared with no treatment. In addition, harms of treatment can be mitigated by using the lowest effective dose; by selecting medications on the basi s of individual characteristics and preferences of patients; and by choosing a medication on the basis of its side-effect profile, pharmacological char- acteristics, and other factors. For additional discussion of the research evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 5. Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members There were no differences of opinion. The writing group voted unanimously in favor of this recom- mendation. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations Information from other guidelines is consistent wi th this guideline statement. Other guidelines on the treatment of schizophrenia (BAP , NICE, PORT , SIGN, WFSBP) recommend continued use of an antipsychotic medication in th e treatment of schizophrenia on ce symptom response has been achieved (Barnes et al. 2011; Buchanan et al. 2010; Hasan et al. 2013; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014; Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2013). Other guidelines ( R A N Z C P, B A P, S I G N , N I C E ) a l s o s u g g e s t t h e u s e of LAI antipsychotic medications on the basis of patient preference or when adherence has been poor or uncertain (Barnes et al. 2011; Galletly et al. 2016; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014; Scottish In tercollegiate Guidelines Network 2013). Use of a gradual reduction in dose, including a gradual cross-taper when changing medications, is noted by several guidelines (BAP , NICE, SIGN) along with an emphasis on close monitoring for signs of relapse (Barnes et al. 2011; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014; Scottish Intercollegiat e Guidelines Network 2013). Quality Measurement Considerations See Statement 4 for a discussion of quality measures rela ted to initiation and ongoing use of an an - tipsychotic medication. STATEMENT 6: Continuing the Same Medications APA suggests (2B) that patients with schizophreni a whose symptoms have improved with an antipsychotic medication continue to be tr eated with the same ant ipsychotic medication.* Implementation As noted in Statement 5, it is important for treatm ent with an antipsychotic medication to be main- tained once symptoms have improv ed. Specifically, for individuals wi th a diagnosis of schizophrenia, *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 85 there are a number of benefits to continued treatm ent with an antipsychotic medication, including re - duced risks of relapse (Bowtell et al. 2018; Goff et al. 2017; Hui et al. 2018; Kishi et al. 2019; Leucht et al. 2012; Thompson et al. 2018), rehospitalizatio n (Tiihonen et al. 2018), and death (Tiihonen et al. 2018; Vermeulen et al. 2017). Implicitly, continued treatment with an effective and tolerable medi- cation would be preferable to potential destabilization or treatment discontinuation. This inference is also consistent with clinical observations that individualizing choice of an antipsychotic medica - tion is important. In clinical tr ials, a change to a different medica tion has been associated with ear- lier discontinuation of treatment as compared with continuation of the same antipsychotic medication (Essock et al. 2006; Stroup et al. 2011). For these reasons, it will be optimal to continue on the same medication for most patients. Nev - ertheless, under some circumstances, it may be necessary to consider a change from one antipsy-chotic medication to another one. For example, a patient may have experienced some degree of response to initial treatment but may still have s ignificant symptoms or difficulties in functioning that would warrant a trial of a different medicati on. Another reason to change medications would be to initiate treatment with an LAI antipsychotic if the current oral medication is unavailable in an LAI formulation (see Statement 10) . A medication change may also be considered because of pa- tient preferences, medication availability, or side effects. Given the long-ter m health risks of meta - bolic syndrome and obesity, weight gain and development of diabetes or metabolic syndrome are common reasons that a change to a different medication may be discussed. In a randomized study that examined the effect s of switching from olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone to aripiprazole to reduce metabolic risk, a change to aripiprazole was associated with improvements in non-HDL cholesterol, serum trigly cerides, and weight as well as a small reduc- tion in 10-year risk of coronary heart disease but no difference in the odds of having metabolic syn- drome (Stroup et al. 2011, 2013). Individuals who sw itched to aripiprazole, as compared with those who remained on their initial medication, had a hi gher rate of discontinuing treatment but showed no significant increases in symptoms or hospitalizations. In addition, the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) showed th at individuals who experi enced issues with med- ication efficacy or tolerability in an early phase of the trial could still go on to do well with a differ-ent medication in a subsequent phase of the trial (McEvoy et al. 2006; Rosenheck et al. 2009; Stroup et al. 2007, 2009). These findings suggest that a change in medication can be of benefit to patients under some cir- cumstances but also suggest that the possible bene fits and risks of a medication change should be reviewed with the patient in the context of shared decision-making. Such discussions with the pa- tient should consider the patient's recovery goals, the potential benefits of medication changes or dose reductions in terms of changes in or diminution of side effects, and the potential harms of medication changes or dose reductions (Davidson 20 18). It will typically be beneficial to include family members or other persons of support in such discussions. Only a limited amount of research has explored the optimal approach for changing antipsychotic medications when warranted. The typical approach is a gradual cross-taper in which the second an- tipsychotic medication is begun and gradually increased in dose as the initial antipsychotic medi - cation is gradually tapered. However, the few studies that are available do not suggest differences between gradual discontinuation as compared with immediate discontinuation of the first medica - tion (Takeuchi et al. 2017a). In addition, no differences have been seen between st arting the second antipsychotic and discontinuing the first antipsychotic at the same time as compared with starting the second antipsychotic and waiting before disc ontinuing the first antipsychotic agent (Takeuchi et al. 2017b). Regardless of the approach that is taken, careful monitoring is essential to avoid the risks of reduced adherence and clinical destabiliz ation if a change in medications is undertaken. Depending on the pharmacological properties of the medications, including pharmacokinetic and receptor binding profiles (see Statement 4, Tables 4 and 5), side effects of medications may also emerge (e.g., insomnia with a shif t to a less sedating medication, wi thdrawal dyskinesia with a shift to a medication with le ss pr ominent dopamine D 2 receptor blockade) (C erovecki et al. 2013). APA Practice Guidelines 86 Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits Use of an antipsychotic medication that has alre ady been associated with symptom response can maintain improvements in symptoms as well as promote enhanced functioning and quality of life. In contrast, changes in antipsychotic treatment can be associat ed with early treatment discontinu- ation, increases in symptoms, clinical destabili zation, and worsening of treatment tolerability. Harms The harms of continuing use of the same antipsyc hotic medication can vary depending on whether the patient is experiencing any significant side ef fects from the medication that would have long- term untoward effects. Continuing the same medi cation could lead to greater long-term risks such as metabolic effects or tardive syndromes from antipsychotic medications, but this would depend on the side-effect profile of the medication. In some instances, changing to a different medication could worsen long-term side-effect risk rather than reduce such risks. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that most patients pr efer to continue to take an antipsychotic medica - tion that has led to a response in symptoms. Once they have found a medication that is effective and well tolerated, many individuals experience anxiety if they are unable to continue with that medication because of realistic concerns about a po ssible return of symptoms, reductions in func- tioning, risk of hospitalization, and other potent ial consequences of medication changes. However, other patients may not wish to remain on a giv en antipsychotic medication because of concerns about side effects or othe r factors that make continued treatment difficult. Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statement were viewed as likely to outweigh the potential harms. Although most patients prefer to continue taking the same medication once their symptoms have responded, there are reasons that a change in medication may be indicated, and factors such as medication side-effect profiles, medication avai lability, and patient preferences for specific med- ications also may play a role in decisions to continue with the same medication. For additional dis- cussion of the research evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 6. Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members There were no differences of opinion. The writing group voted unanimously in favor of this suggestion. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations Information from other guidelines is consistent wi th this guideline statement. Other guidelines on the treatment of schizophrenia (SIGN, WFSBP) no te that treatment should usually continue with the same antipsychotic medication that led to the best response and had the best individual side- effect profile, given the risk of destabilization with switching an antipsychotic regimen (Hasan et al. 2013; Scottish Intercollegi ate Guidelines Network 2013). Quality Measurement Considerations As a suggestion, this guideline statement is not a ppropriate for use as a quality measure or for elec- tronic decision support. However, health plans may wish to implement internal process measures The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 87 to assess and reduce rates at which changes to stable medication regimens are made on the basis of nonclinical factors such as pre-authoriz ation requirements or formulary changes. STATEMENT 7: Clozapine in APA recommends (1B) that patients with treatment-resi stant schizophreni a be treated with clozapine.* Implementation Identification of Treatme nt-Resistant Schizophrenia Clozapine is recommended for individuals with treatment-resistant schizophreni a, but there is consid - erable variation in definitions of treatment-resistan t schizophrenia in clinical trials and in practice (Howes et al. 2017). For the purpose of future research trials, the Treatment Response and Resistance in Psychosis (TRRIP) Working Group conduc ted a detailed systematic review of clinical trials in treatment- resistant schizophrenia and used a consensus-based approach to es tablish minimum and optimum cri- teria for identifying treatment-resist ant schizophrenia (Howes et al. 201 7). In addition to a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the identification of treatment-resistant schizophrenia re sts on the persis tence of signifi- cant symptoms despite adequate ph armacological treatment (Howes et al. 2017). More specifically, the TRRIP Working Group recommended that symptoms be of at least 12 weeks' duration in total, be of at least moderate severity, an d be associated with at least moderate functional impairment as determined by validated rating scales (e.g., PANSS, BPRS, or SANS and SAPS for symptoms and a score <60 on the SOFAS as a measure of functioning). If a prospective me dication trial of at leas t 6 weeks at adequate dose has not led to symptom reduction of more than 20%, th is provides additional evidence of treatment re - sistance. It is helpful to note wh ether the persistent symptoms includ e positive, negative, or cognitive symptoms because responses to th ese symptom domains may differ. In terms of treatment adequacy, the TRRIP Work ing Group recommended that at least two anti- psychotic trials should be conducted with differen t antipsychotic medications with at least 6 weeks at a therapeutic dosage of medication for each and with adherence of at least 80% of prescribed dos- ages (Howes et al. 2017). A therapeutic dosage of medication was defined as the midpoint of the target range for acute treatment of schizophrenia according to the manufacturer's product labeling or the equivalent of at least 600 mg of chlorpromazine per day (Howes et al. 2017). (For tables of dose equivalents, see College of Psychiatric an d Neurologic Pharmacists 2019; Leucht et al. 2014, 2015; Rothe et al. 2018.) The consen sus criteria include at least one antipsychotic blood level to as- sess adherence, obtaining information on adherence from at least two sources (e.g., pill counts, dis- pensing chart reviews, patient/ carer reports), and obtaining information on past treatment response from patient/carer reports and other sources. For clinical purposes, a common definition is th at a patient's symptoms have shown no response or partial and suboptimal response to two antipsyc hotic medication trials of at least 6 weeks each at an adequate dosage of medication, and some definitions specify using medications from differ- ent classes (e.g., SGA vs. FGA). However, if there is no significant improvement after several weeks of treatment (e.g., <20% improv ement in symptoms), the likelihoo d of substantial improvement (e.g., >50% improvement in symptoms) is small (How es et al. 2017; Samara et al. 2015), and a longer trial of the medication may not be warranted. It should also be noted that a medication trial cannot be viewed as adequate if truncated in terms of dura tion or dosage because of poor tolerability or if limited by poor adherence. Accordingly, some experts suggest a trial of an LAI antipsychotic med-ication before deciding that a patien t's symptoms are treatment-resistant. *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. APA Practice Guidelines 88 Initiation of Treatm ent With Clozapine After a patient is identified as having treatment-resistant schizophrenia, the clinician should en - gage the patient in discussion about clozapine treatment. A trial of clozapine may also be appropri - ate in individuals who show a response to treatment (i.e., have at least a 20% reduction in symptoms) yet still have significant symptoms or impairments in functioning (Howes et al. 2017). In fact, clozapine is often underu (Carruthers et 2016; Latimer et al. 2013; Olfson et al. 2016; Stroup et al. 2014; Tang et al. 2017), and many pa tients would benefit from earlier consideration of clozapine initiation. Discussion of clozapine should emphasize principles of shared decision-making; including fam- ily members or other persons of support in such discussions is often beneficial. In terms of a pa-tient's recovery goals, most individuals va lue an ability to think more clearly and stop hallucinations or delusions when deciding about medication changes (Achty es et al. 2018). In ad- dition, most patients who receive clozapine view it positively. For example, one large survey of in - dividuals with schizoph renia or schizoaffective disorder who were taking an antipsychotic medication found that the vast majority of thos e taking clozapine adhered to treatment and found it helpful, whereas only approximately 5% found it not helpful (Siskind et al. 2017a). In contrast, most other antipsychotic medications were viewed less positively (Siskind et al. 2017a). Neverthe - less, it is important to identify patient concerns about clozapine and address them insofar as is pos- sible. For example, patients may express concerns about the burdens of required blood work and may encounter logistical barriers such as access to transportation (Farooq et al. 2019; Gee et al. 2017; Verdoux et al. 2018). However, they may be willing to consider clozapine if logistical barriers can be overcome or if given the information that blood monitoring requirements become less frequent over time. Concerns about other side effects, such as weight gain or somnolence, may also contrib- ute to a reluctance to switch to clozapine (Achtyes et al. 2018). It can be helpful to have an open dis- cussion of these side effects and a well-defined plan for monitoring as treatment proceeds. Peer-run support groups that directly address living with side effects can help patients develop strategies for coping with side effects. Clinicians may also have concerns about clozapin e that can serve as a barrier to treatment. For example, many clinicians have limited experience in using clozapine and sometimes express con-cerns about paperwork burdens, patient adherence with monitoring, and side effects (Daod et al. 2019; Farooq et al. 2019; Gee et al. 2017; Kelly an d Love 2019; Kelly et al. 2018; Leung et al. 2019; Verdoux et al. 2018; Warnez and Alessi-Severini 2014). Many clinicians overestimate the likelihood of severe neutropenia and are reluctant to begin clozapine on an outpatient basis (Farooq et al. 2019). Education about the use of clozapine and its side effects can be useful in addressing clinician- related prescribing barriers. When initiating treatment with cl ozapine, a slow dose titration is essential to minimize the risks of seizure, orthostatic hypotension, and excessive sedation (Clozaril 2019). Large, rapid increases in clozapine dosage have led to cardio vascular collapse and death, particularly in patients taking respi- ratory depressant medications such as benzodiazepines. From a starting dosage of 12.5 mg once or twice daily, the dosage of clozapine can be increased by, at most, 25-50 mg/day to a target dosage of 300-450 mg/day (Clozaril 2019). Subsequent dose increases, if needed, should be of 100 mg or less, once or twice weekly. Although efficacy is often seen at a dosage of 300-450 mg/day, some individ- uals may need higher dosages of clozapine, to a maximum daily dose of 900 mg, for full response. A slower rate of titration may be needed for pati ents with an initial episode of schizophrenia and in those who are older, severely debilitated, or sens itive to side effects. Those with a preexisting cen- tral nervous system condition, including individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, also warrant a slower rate of titration and may have an increased risk of seizures at usual doses. Use of divided doses can be helpful in reducing side effects duri ng initial dose titration, although many patients are ultimately treated with a single dose at bedtime to minimize daytime sedation and facilitate ad - herence (Takeuchi et al. 2016). The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 89 Monitoring for therapeutic benefits and side ef fects of clozapine should occur throughout the dose titration phase (see Statement 4 ). Because titr ation of clozapine proceeds slowly, the therapeu- tic benefits may not be noticed immediately, and si de effects may be more prominent than benefits. Thus, it can be helpful to provide patients with education and reassurance about the expected time- table of therapeutic effects of clozapine. If clozapine is being resumed after a gap in treatm ent of 48 hours or more, it should be restarted at 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If that dosage is well tolerated, the dose may be increased to a ther- apeutic range more quickly than recommended for in itial treatment. If a decision is made to stop clozapine, it is best to taper the dose unless the medication is being stopped for medically urgent reasons (e.g., severe neutropenia, myocarditis, NMS). Use of Clozapine Levels Duri ng Treatment With Clozapine While the dose of clozapine is being titrated, it is useful to obtain blood le vels of clozapine and its major active metabolite, norclozapine ( N-desmethylclozapine) (Couchma n et al. 2010). Blood levels can also be helpful if there are questions about medi cation adherence, less ef ficacy or more side ef - fects than expected, potential medication interactions, or other factors that may be influencing clozapine levels. Although there is substantial variation between individuals, clozapine levels on a specific dosage will generally be greater in nonsmokers than in smokers, in heavy caffeine users than in nonusers, in women than in men, and in older individuals than in younger individuals (Carrillo et al. 1998; Ismail et al. 2012). In addition, changing between different generic forms of clozapine can lead to a 5%-10% difference in blood levels. Levels of clozapine should be drawn at steady state (3 days or more after a dose change) and at a trough in medication levels (about 12 hours after the last dose). Typically, patients will receive a bedtime dose of clozapine and then have a level drawn the following morning before receiving an additional dose. There is not an absolute level of clozapine that is associated with ei ther efficacy or toxicity (Remingt on et al. 2013; Spina et al. 2000; Stark and Scott 2012; Suzuki et al. 2011; VanderZwaag et al. 1996). In most patients, efficacy will be highest at levels greater than 350 ng/mL of clozapin e, but some patients will show response or pre- vention of relapse at levels as low as 200 ng/mL. The risk of developing seizures increases with the blood level of clozapine. As with the results of any labora tory test, interpretation of clozapine levels should consider the clinical context. For example, if a clozapine level is much higher than expected, assess for dose-related side effects and clinical evidence of toxicity. If th e patient's clinical status does not suggest signs of clozapine toxicity, then determine the timing of the level (e.g., peak vs. trough) and identify any po- tential for drug interactions, change s in smoking status, or incorrect specimen labeling. If levels are much lower than expected, such factors as poor adherence, rapid metabolism, drug interactions, or changes in smoking status may also be relevant. Typically, the level of norclozapine will be report ed along with the blood level of clozapine. Nor - clozapine is the major active metabolite of clozapin e and appears to differ from clozapine in efficacy and side effects. Nevertheless, the value of norclozapine levels in guiding clinical decisions is unclear. Because the half-life of norclozapine is greater than the half-life of clozapin e, a clozapine:norclozapine ratio less than 0.5 can suggest poor adherence over the previous day or rapid metabolism of clozapine (e.g., via CYP1A2 induction). A clozapine:norclozapine ratio grea ter than 3.0 could suggest that metabolic pathways are saturated or inhibited by a concomitant me dication. Shifts in the ratio of clozapine to norclozapine can also result from other drug-drug interactions or if nontrough levels are obtained (Couchman et al. 2010; Ellison and Dufresne 2015). Monitoring for Side Effects Du ring Treatment With Clozapine With clozapine, safety monitoring during treatmen t is important to minimi ze the risk of adverse events. The Clozapine REMS Program (www.clozapinerems.com)1 is required for prescribing of APA Practice Guidelines 90 clozapine in the United States. The REMS program in cludes required training that must be completed by prescribers (Clozapine REMS Program 2019a), resource materials (Clozapine REMS Program and a shared patient registry for all clozapine manufacturers' products that permits tracking of ANCs and documentation of decisions about co ntinued treatment. The Cl ozapine REMS site pro - vides instructions about threshold values for ANCs in hematologically normal individuals and in those with benign ethnic neutropenia, which is mo st common in individuals of African descent and is associated with ANCs that are lower than standard reference ranges (Clozapine REMS Program 2014). It also describes the required frequencies for ANC monitoring, which vary with ANC values. In patients who have stopped or interrupted treatm ent with clozapine for 30 da ys or more, the initial dose titration for clozapine and the monitoring freq uency for treatment initiation should be followed. Because the highest risk of severe neutropenia (ANC <500/ L) occurs within the initial 6 months of clozapine treatment (Alvir et al. 1993; Clozapine REMS Program 2019c; Myles et al. 2018), ANC mon - itoring is more frequent early in tr eatment and is required less often with longer treatment duration. The need for ANC monitoring can be a common practical issue for patients because of the time and trans- portation needed to obtain blood tests at a laborato ry. The availability of point-of-care testing for white blood cell counts may mitigate th ese barriers for patients and fa cilitate treatment with clozapine. In addition to neutropenia, clozapine treatment ca n be associated with several other important side effects. Potentially serious cardiac complications of clozapine treatment in clude myocarditis and car- diomyopathy. Myocarditis is infrequent and genera lly occurs during the first month of treatment, whereas cardiomyopathy is rare and generally occurs later in the treatment course (Bellissima et al. 2018; Ronaldson et al. 2015). Myocarditis usually is heralded by shortness of breath, tachycardia, and fever, but diagnosis can be challenging because of the nonspecific nature of other symptoms, which can include fatigue, chest pain, palpitations, peripheral edema, and hypereosinophilia. In patients who do develop myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in conjunction with clozapine treatment, clozapine is typically discontinued. Subsequent decisions ab out resuming clozapine are individualized and are based on the benefits and risks of treatment as compared with other therapeutic alternatives. In patients who are treated with clozapine, a brief self-limiting fever (>38\u00b0C) may also occur during the first few weeks of clozapine treatmen t; this fever responds to supportive measures (Bruno et al. 2015; Lowe et al. 2007; Pui-yin Chung et al. 2008). However, in a febrile patient, it is essential to assess for the presence of potentially life-threatening complications, including NMS, se- vere neutropenia, infection, and myocarditis. Other potentially serious side effects of clozap ine treatment include seizures, orthostatic hypo- tension, and gastrointestinal effects. When seizur es occur with clozapine, they typically occur with very high doses of clozapine, rapid increases in cl ozapine dose, or shifts in medication levels (re- lated to drug-drug intera ctions or effects of smoking on drug metabolism) (Devinsky et al. 1991). Therefore, a slow initial titration of clozapine dose is essential, and patients should be cautioned not to drive or engage in other potentially hazardous activities while clozapine is being titrated. If a sei-zure does occur with clozapine, dose adjustment may be needed, or adjunctive anticonvulsant med- ication (e.g., valproate) may be considered in unction with neurological consultation (Alldredge 1999; Wong and Delva 2007). Orthostatic hypotension can also occur with cloz apine and is most common with treatment initi- ation. Older patients and patients with peripheral vascular disease or a compromised cardiovascular status may be at particular risk. When severe, or thostatic hypotension can cause syncope, dizziness, or falls. Patients who experience orthostatic hypotens ion must be cautioned to sit on the edge of the bed for a minute before standing up, move slowly when going from lying down or sitting to stand - ing, and seek assistance when needed. Manageme nt strategies for orthostatic hypotension include supportive measures (e.g., use of support stockings, increased dietary salt and fluid intake), reduc-ing the speed of clozapine dose titration, and decreasing or dividing doses of clozapine. As a last re - 1For Canadian prescribers, use the appropriate Canadian clozapine registry, not the U. S. Clozapine REMS Program. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 91 sort, administration of th e salt/fluid-retaining corticosteroid fludrocortisone can be considered to increase intravascular volume, but it is importan t to be mindful of the potential for immunosup- pressive effects and development of diabetes with this medication (Mar and Raj 2018; Shen et al. 2017). For patients who are receiving concomitant antihypertensive treatmen t, adjustments to the dose of these medications may be needed. Gastrointestinal effects of clozapine can also be significant and in some patients are associated with fecal impaction or paralytic ileus (Every-Pal mer and Ellis 2017; Leung et al. 2017). Thus, the patient should obtain urgent medical care if experiencing constipation that is severe or does not re - solve. To prevent development of constipation, it is useful to minimize the doses and number of con- tributory medications such as ot her anticholinergic medications an d opioids. Activity and exercise should be encouraged to stimulate motility. A stool softener (e.g., docusate [Colace]) can be started for patients at increased risk (e.g., older patients). If constipation does deve lop, initial treatment can include stool softeners (e.g., docusate [Colace]) or osmotic glycol [Miralax], cascara, sodium picosulfate). If constipation persists, an enema (e.g., Fleet) should be considered. A combination of treatments may be needed to treat constipation and then to prevent its recurrence. Side effects related to metabolic syndrome are common and generally are observed in the initial months of treatment but can also occur later in treatment. These side effects include weight gain (Alvarez-Jimenez et al. 2008; Leucht et al. et al. 2013a); and glucose dys- regulation, including development of diabetes me llitus (Hirsch et al. 2017; Ward and Druss 2015; Whicher et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2017). Monitoring of bo dy mass index, hemoglobin A1c, and lipid levels is important during clozapine treatment, as outlined in Statement 1, T able 2 . If diabetes or hyperlip idemia is identified, it should be treated, typically by the patient's primary care clinician. When weight gain occurs, it is usually progressiv e over the first 6 months of treatment, although some patients continue to gain weight indefinitely (Alvarez-Jimenez et al. 2008). Prevention of weight gain should, thus, be a high priority because weight loss is difficult for most patients. Efforts should be made to intervene proactively with weig ht gain of 5-10 pounds, and other medications that can cause weight gain (e.g., valproate) should be tapered and discontinued when possible. Dietary interventions, such as specialized behavioral he alth interventions, in-person community interven- tions (e.g., Weight Watchers), services that include meal delivery (e.g., Jenny Craig), or Internet-based interventions (e.g., Omada Health), should be suggested (Bonfioli et al. 2012). In collaboration with the patient's primary care clinician, metformin or nonstimulant medica- tions for weight loss can be considered. Metformin has been shown to be safe in individuals with- out hyperglycemia and can reduce body weight an d reverse metabolic abnormalities in patients with obesity or other metabolic pr oblems (Das et al. 2012; de Silva et al. 2016; McGinty et al. et al. 2019; Zheng et al. 2015; Zhuo et al. 2018). Fewer studies have been done with glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist medications, but the available data suggest that body weight and metabolic risk factors are reduced by these medications as com- pared with placebo (Siskind et al. 2019). The bene fits of exercise appear to be small in terms of weight loss in individuals with schizophrenia (Firth et al. 2015; Pearsall et al. 2014; Vancampfort et al. 2017, 2019). Nevertheless, many individuals with schizophrenia do not engage in physical activ- ity (Stubbs et al. 2016a; Vancampfort et al. 2016b), and exercise can be sugges ted for its benefits for overall health, improved cardiorespiratory fitness, and other aspects of functioning (Dauwan et al. 2016; Firth et al. 2015, 2017; Vancampfort Sedation, sialorrhea, and tachycardia are ea ch commonly observed during treatment with clozapine but can generally be mana ged conservatively. Sedation is most pronounced in the initial phases of treatment with clozapin e, and many patients d evelop some tolerance to the sedating ef - fects with continued administration. However, pe rsistent sedation, including daytime drowsiness and increased sleep time, can interfere with social , recreational, and vocational function. Lowering APA Practice Guidelines 92 of the daily dose, consolidating divided doses into one evening dose, or changing to a less sedating antipsychotic medication may be effective in reducing the severity of sedation. Coffee or other forms of caffeine can be helpful in the morning bu t can also interact with medications (e.g., contrib- ute to tachycardia; raise blood levels of medications, includin g clozapine). Adding a stimulant medication is not typically helpful and can lead to additional side effects. If sedation or the risk of sedation is significant (e.g., during initial clozap ine titration), patients should be cautioned not to drive or engage in potentially hazardous activities. Sialorrhea (or hypersalivation) is also a frequent side effect of clozapine that can contribute to reductions in quality of life an d complications such as aspiration pneumonia (Dzahini et al. 2018; Kaplan et al. 2018; Stoecker et al. 2017). Because sialorrhea may be more bothersome at night, pa- tients may be advised to place a towel on their pi llow and change to a clean towel in the middle of the night to minimize discomfort. During the day, patients can be encouraged to chew sugarless gum, which stimulates the swallowing reflex. Ph armacological approaches to address sialorrhea come from small studies and case reports and in clude use of low-dose or topical anticholinergic medications, such as glycopyrrolate or sublingual ophthalmic atropine 1% drops (Bird et al. 2011; Liang et al. 2010; Man et al. 2017). Diphenhydramin e has also been studied (Chen et al. 2019); how- ever, because clozapine and other antipsychotics can have significant anticholinergic properties themselves and anticholinergics have small effects on sialorrhea, the use of agents with added an- ticholinergic effects should be approached cautiously . Terazosin and, in severe refractory cases, bot- ulinum toxin have also been used (Bird et al. 2011; Liang et al. 2010; Man et al. 2017). Healthy patients can usually tolerate some increase in resting pulse rate, although this may not be the case for patients with preexisting heart di sease. In patients with significant tachycardia (heart rates above 110-120 bpm), an ECG is warranted, as is assessment for other potential causes of tachycardia (e.g., fever, anemia, smoking, hyperthyroidism, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disorders, caffeine, other stimulants, and side effe cts of other medications). Early in treatment with clozapine, the possibility of myocarditis should be considered. If tachycardia is accompanied by pain, shortness of breath, fever, or signs of a myoc ardial infarction or heart rhythm problem, emer- gency assessment is essential. Management strate gies for tachycardia with any antipsychotic med- ication include reducing the dose of medication; discontinuing medications with anticholinergic or stimulant properties; and addressing orthostatic hypotension, if present. Case reports have dis-cussed the use of medications such as -blocking agents for persistent and significant tachycardia with clozapine. Nevertheless, treatment is not in dicated unless the patient is symptomatic or the patient's heart rate is substantially greater than 120 bpm because data from more rigorous studies are not available and these medicati ons can contribute to other side effects such as orthostatic hy- potension (Lally et al. 2016a). Side effects related to dopamine D 2 receptor antagonism (e.g., acute dystonia, akathisia, medication- induced parkinsonism, NMS, tardive syndromes, occur but are less frequent with clozapine than with many ot her antipsychotic medications. For additional information on the rec- ognition and management of these side effects, see Statement 4, subsection \"Treatment-Emergent Side Effects of Antipsyc hotic Medications.\" Other Approaches to Treat ment-Resistant Schizophrenia For all patients with treatment-resistant schizophre nia, it is important to conduct a review of the treatment plan at periodic intervals (see Statement 3). In addition to a re view of prior medication trials, it is essential to review the psychosocial treatments that a patient has received and whether addition of one or more psychosocial intervention s would be of benefit. For example, some patients may not have received cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp) as recommended in Statement 16 or initial benefits of CBTp may have faded if CBTp was stopped. Under such circum - stances, treatment with CBTp may be warranted (Bur ns et al. 2014; Morrison et al. 2018). Engaging families or persons of support in CBTp can also be helpful (Turkin gton and Spencer 2019). A similar review of potential additions to the treatment pl an can occur with other psychosocial treatments. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 93 Optimizing Treatment With Clozapine Although studies suggest that at least one-third of individuals with treatmen t-resistant schizophrenia will respond to clozapine (Kahn et al. 2018; McEvoy et al. 2006), some patients will not have a com - plete response. Before concluding that a patient has not responded to clozapine, it is important to as- sure that an adequate target dose has been reache d (typically 300-450 mg/day) and that steady state levels of clozapine and norclozapine appear suffic ient to produce therapeutic benefit. Although no absolute level of clozapine is associated with effica cy (Remington et al. 2013; Spina et al. 2000; Suzuki et al. 2011; VanderZwaag et al. 1996) , if no response is evident and clozapine is well tolerated, the clozapine dose should be increased to achieve a clozapine level of greater than 350 ng/mL. In gen- eral, this dose of medication should be continued for at least 8 weeks to determine response, al- though further increases in dose can also be made, as tolerated. If there continues to be no evidence of benefit, as for any patient treated with clozapin e, the value of the medication should be assessed periodically in terms of the patient's response, the medication side effects, and the availability of any newer treatment options. Longitudinal use of a quantitative measure (see Statement 2) can be helpful in assessing functioning and overall respon se and identifying specific symptoms that have or have not responded to treatment. Continuing Clozapine and Augmenting With Another Medication For individuals who do not respond to clozapine alone, the evidence base for other treatments is lim- ited, although a number of options have been tried. Augmentation of clozapine with another medi- cation has shown no significant benefit in double -blind trials, although some benefit was noted in open-label trials and meta-analyses of trials that were generally of low quality (Barber et al. 2017; Correll et al. 2017b; Galling et al. 2017; Sinclair and Adams 2014; Siskind et al. 2018; Veerman et al. 2014; Wagner et al. 2019a). antipsychotic medica- tions (FGAs and SGAs), anticonvulsants, and other medications. If a trial of augmentation therapy is undertaken, it is important to consider the po tential additive effects of the medications on side effects and the potential for drug-drug interactions. Periodic review of the patient's medication reg- imen is also important in order to identify and reduce or discontinue medications that are not ef - fective, that are no longer necessary, or that are contributing to an inordinate burden of side effects. As noted in the previous subsection, longitudinal use of a quantitative measure can assist in mak- ing such determinations. Augmenting Clozapine or Another Antipsychotic Medication With Electroconvulsive Therapy There is also evidence for benefits of ECT in comb ination with clozapine as compared with clozapine alone in most (Ahmed et al. 2017; Grover et al. 2015 ; Lally et al. 2016b; Petr ides et al. 2015; Pompili et al. 2013; G. Wang et al. 2018), but not all (Melzer-Ribeiro et al. 2017), studies. Rates of headache and reports of memory impairment were more frequent with clozapine plus ECT than with clozapine alone; however, symptomatic improvement and rates of remission at the end of treatment were sig- nificantly greater in the group that received adjunctive ECT. For this reason, ECT could be consid- ered for clozapine-resistant schizo phrenia, particularly in patients who also have catatonia or sig- nificant suicide risk or who require a rapid respon se because of the severity of their psychiatric or medical condition. For individuals who show a resp onse to ECT, treatment with ECT on a mainte- nance basis could be considered as an adjunct to clozapine. Some studies have shown evidence for benefits of ECT in combination with antipsychotic med- ications other than clozapine (Ahmed et al. 2017; i et al. 2019; Pompili et al. 2013; Sinclair et al. 2019; Zheng et al. 2016). Particularly in patients who also have catatonia or significant suicide risk or who require a rapid response due to the severity of their psychiatric or medical condition, ECT could be considered. For individuals who show a re sponse to ECT, treatment with ECT on a main- tenance basis could be considered. APA Practice Guidelines 94 Although studies have also been done with TM S for treatment of hallucinations and for treat - ment of negative symptoms, at present there is in sufficient evidence of benefit to suggest use of TMS in individuals with schizoph renia (Dollfus et al. 2016; Dougall et al. 2015; He et al. 2017). Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits Use of clozapine in individuals wi th treatment-resistant schizophrenia can be associated with re - ductions in psychotic symptoms, higher rates of treatment response, and lower rates of treatment discontinuation due to lack of effi cacy (low to moderate strength of research evidence) as well as lower rates of self-harm, suicide attempts, or hosp italizations to prevent suicide (moderate strength of research evidence). Overall rates of hospitalization are also reduced during treatment with clozapine as compared with other oral antipsychotic medications (low strength of research evi- dence). All-cause mortality is also reduced in in dividuals treated with cl ozapine as compared with other individuals with treatment-resistant schizoph renia (moderate strength of research evidence). Harms Although overall rates of adverse events do not differ with clozapine as compared with risperidone (low strength of research evidence), clozapine does have a higher risk of study withdrawal due to ad- verse events than some other SGAs (low strength of research evidence). Specific harms of using clozapine include rare but serious effects, includ ing severe neutropenia, myocarditis, cardiomyopa - thy, and NMS. These harms cannot be eliminated , but risks of severe neutropenia are lessened by required ANC monitoring. Early attention to and recognition of NMS and cardiac complications of clozapine use may also reduce risk. Seizures are al so more frequent with clozapine than other an- tipsychotics but can be minimized by slow titration of the clozap ine dose, avoidance of very high clozapine doses, and attention to pharmacokinetic fa ctors that may lead to rapid shifts in clozapine levels. Constipation can also be significant with clozapine and in some patients is associated with fecal impaction or paralytic ileus. Other side ef fects that are more common with clozapine than other antipsychotic medications in clude sialorrhea, tachycardia, fever, dizziness , sedation, and weight gain. Rates of hyperglycemia and diabetes may also be increased. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that many patients are cooperative wi th and accepting of clozapine as part of a treatment plan; however, other patients may express concerns about the burdens of re- quired blood work, including logistical barriers such as access to transportation (Farooq et al. 2019; Gee et al. 2017; Verdoux et al. 2018). Concerns about other side effects, such as weight gain or som - nolence, may also contribute to a reluctance to switch to clozap ine (Achtyes et al. 2018). On the other hand, when deciding about medication change s, most patients value an ability to think more clearly and stop hallucinations or delusions (Achty es et al. 2018; Kuhnigk et al. 2012; Levitan et al. 2015), and most patients who receive clozapine view it positively. For example, one large survey of individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were taking an antipsychotic med - ication found that the vast majority of those taking clozapine adhered to treatment and found it helpful, whereas only approximately 5% found it not helpful (Siskind et al. 2017a). In contrast, most other antipsychotic medications were viewed less po sitively (Siskind et al . 2017a). In addition, in study, clozapine and combination antips ychotic treatment regimens were frequently se- lected by patients who st opped a previous medication because of inadequate therapeutic effect and by those with relatively severe symptoms (Stroup et al. 2009). The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 95 Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statemen t were viewed as far outweighing the potential harms. For individuals with treatment-resistant schi zophrenia, the risks of inadequately treated ill- ness are substantial in terms of reduced quality of life (Kennedy et al. 2014) and increased mortality (Cho et al. 2019; Vermeulen et al. 2019; Wimberley et al. 2017) as well as negative effects for informal caregivers (Brain et al. 2018). Even in individuals who have had an inadequate response to other antipsychotic medications, a substa ntial fraction shows a clinically relevant response to clozapine. With careful monitoring to minimize the risk of harm s from clozapine, the benefits of clozapine in pa - tients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia were viewed as significantly outweighing the harms of treatment. For additional discussion of the research evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 7. Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members There were no differences of opinion. The writing group voted unanimously in favor of this recom- mendation. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations (BAP , CSG, NICE, RANZCP , in recommend- ing clozapine for individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (Barnes et al. 2011; Buchanan et al. 2010; Galletly et al. 2016; Hasan et al. 2012; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014; Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2013). In terms of other therapies for treatment- resistant schizophrenia, several guidelines (SIGN, WFSBP , BAP) recommend augmentation treat- ment with an antidepressant for treatment-resi stant illness associated with negative symptoms (Barnes et al. 2011; Hasan et al. 2012; Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2013). For indi- viduals with catatonia, the WFSBP recommends benzodiazepines and ECT (Hasan et al. 2012). In ad-dition, ECT is mentioned in several guidelines (e .g., SIGN, RANZCP , WFSBP) as being appropriate in individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Quality Measurement Considerations Studies suggest that clozapine is underused and that a significant proportion of individuals with treat- ment-resistant schizophrenia do not receive treatment with clozapine, although there is significant vari- ation between and within countries (Addington et al. 2012; Bachmann et al. 2017; Carruthers et al. 2016; Keller et al. 2014; Olfson et al. 2016; Stroup et al. 2014; Tang et al. 2017). Thus, internal quality improvement programs may wish to focus on ways to increase use of clozapine in individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia an d track rates of clozapine use in this patient population. Inter- nal quality improvement programs could also focu s on increasing use of quantitative measures (i.e., rating scales) to improve identification of individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia and facilitate systematic longitudinal tracking of functioning, symptoms, and side-effect burdens. If quality measures are considered for development at the provider, facility , health plan, integrated delivery system, or population level, testing of fe asibility, usability, reliability, and validity would be essential prior to use for purposes of accountability. Electronic decision support would be challenging to implement and would depend on accurate and consistent entry of structured information. Nevertheless, in combination with rating scale data and prior prescribing histories, electronic decisi on support could help identify individuals with treatment-resistant illness who would benefit from a trial of clozapine. APA Practice Guidelines 96 STATEMENT 8: Clozapine in Suicide Risk APA recommends (1B) that patients with schizophrenia be treated with clozapine if the risk for suicide attempts or suicide remains substantial despite other treatments. * Implementation Treatment with clozapine can be effective in reducing suicidal behavior if risk remains substantial despite other treatments. In addition, treatment with clozapine can be effect ive in reducing rates of suicide attempts and suicide in individuals with schizophrenia, regardless of whether formal crite-ria for treatment resistance have been met. Risk factors for suicidal behavior in individuals with schizophrenia are described in Statement 1, subsection \"Implementation.\" Although demographic and historical risk factors are static, a number of other risk factors are potentially modifiable and can serve as targets of intervention in constructing a plan of treatment (for additional details, see Statement 3). As in other circumstances in which pa tients do not appear to be responding fully to treatment, attention to adherence is crucial (for additional details, see Statement 3). For details of initiating and monitoring clozapine treatment, see Statement 7 , subsections \"Initiation ng Treatment With Clozapine,\" and \"Monitoring for Side Effects During Treatment With Clozapine.\" Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits In individuals with schizophrenia who are at significant risk for suicide attempts or suicide, use of clozapine can be associated with lower rates of self-harm, suicide attemp ts, or hospitalization to prevent suicide (moderate strength of research ev idence). Additional bene fits of clozapine treat- ment include higher rates of treatment response (low to moderate strength of research evidence) and reductions in psychotic symptoms, all-cause mo rtality, overall hospitalization rates, and treat - ment discontinuation due to lack of efficacy (low to moderate strength of research evidence). Harms Although overall rates of adverse events do not di ffer with clozapine as co mpared with risperidone (low strength of research evidence), clozapine do es have a higher risk of study withdrawal due to adverse events than some other SGAs (low strength of research evidence).

The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 97 Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that many patients are cooperative wi th and accepting of clozapine as part of a treatment plan; however, other patients may express concerns about the burdens of re- quired blood work, including logistical barriers such as access to transportation (Farooq et al. 2019; Gee et al. 2017; Verdoux et al. 2018) .

Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this recommendation were viewed as far outweighing the potential harms. For individuals at significant risk for suicide attempts or suicide despite other treatments, the ben-efit of clozapine in reducing suicide-related risk is significant. With careful monitoring to minimize the risk of harms from clozapine, the benefit of clozapine in such patients was viewed as signifi- cantly outweighing the harms of tr eatment. For additional discussion of the research evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 8. Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members There were no differences of opinion. The writing group voted unanimously in favor of this recom-mendation. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations Other guidelines do not specifically mention the use of clozapine for individuals with schizophre-nia who are at substantial risk for suicide attempts or suicide despite other treatment. Guidelines (BAP , CSG, NICE, RANZCP , SIGN, WFSBP , PORT) however, in recommending clozapine for individuals with trea tment-resistant schizophrenia (Barne s et al. 2011; Buchanan et al. 2010; Galletly et al. 2016; Hasan et al. 2012; Nation al Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014; Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2013). Quality Measurement Considerations Studies suggest that clozapine is underused and that a significant proportion of individuals with treat- ment-resistant schizophrenia do not receive treatment with clozapine, although there is significant vari- ation between and within countries (Addington et al. 2012; Bachmann et al. 2017; Carruthers et al. 2016; Keller et al. 2014; Olfson et al. 2016; Stroup et al. 2014; Tang et al. 2017). Given low utilization of clozapine in general (Addington et al. 2012; Bachmann et al. 2017; Carru thers et al. 2016; Keller et al. 2014; et al. 2016; Stroup et al. 2014; Ta ng et al. 2017) and the high rates of suicidal ideas among individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (Kennedy et al. 2014), it is likely that many individuals at significant suicide risk are no t receiving treatment with clozapine. Thus, internal quality improvement programs may wish to focus on ways to increase and track use of clozapine in individuals with schizophrenia who have significant suicide risk th at persists despite other treat- ments. Internal quality improvement programs could also focus on increasing the use of quantitative measures to improve identification and monitoring of individuals with risk factors for suicide. APA Practice Guidelines 98 If quality measures are considered for developmen t at the provider, facility, health plan, inte- grated delivery system, or population level, testing of feasibility, usability, reliability, and validity would be essential prior to use for purposes of acco untability. In particular, it is currently not pos- sible to identify from most admini strative data people at increased risk for suicide. Clinical assess- ment or patient self-report data are likely to be required. Electronic decision support using passive alerts may be able to prompt clinicians to consider clozapine; however, such prompts would be cha llenging to implement because they would depend on accurate and consistent entry of structured in formation about diagnosis, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. Nevertheless, in combination with rating scale data, elec tronic decision support could help identify individuals with schizophreni a and significant suicide risk who would benefit from a trial of clozapine. STATEMENT 9: Clozapine in Aggressive Behavior APA suggests (2C) that patients with schizophrenia be treated with clozapine if the risk for aggressive behavior remains subs tantial despite other treatments. * Implementation Treatment with clozapine can be effective in reducing aggressive behavior if risk remains substantial despite other treatments. As in other circumstances in which patients do not appear to be responding fully to treatment, attention to adherence is crucia l (for additional details, see Statement 3). Risk fac- tors for aggressive behavior in individuals with schizophrenia are described in Statement 1, subsec- tion \"Implementation.\" Although demographic and historical risk factors are static, a number of other risk factors are potentially mo difiable and can serve as targets of intervention in constructing a plan of treatment (for additional details, see Stat ement 3). Fo r de tails of initiating and monitoring clozapine treatment, see Statement 7, subsections \"Initiation of Treatment With Clozapine,\" \"Use of Clozapine Levels During Treatment With Clozapine, \" and \"Monitoring for Side Effects During Treat- ment With Clozapine.\" Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits In individuals with schizophrenia who are at significant risk for aggressive behavior, use of clozapine may reduce the likelihood of aggressive behaviors (low strength of research evidence). Additional benefits of clozapine treatment include higher rate s of treatment response (low to moderate strength of research evidence); reductions in psychotic symptoms, all-cause mortality, overall hospitalization rates, and treatment discontinuation due to lack of ef ficacy (low to moderate strength of research ev- idence); and lower rates of self-har m, suicide attempts, or hospitaliz ations to prevent suicide (moder- ate strength of research evidence). Harms Although overall rates of adverse events do not differ with clozapine as compared with risperidone (low strength of research evidence), clozapine does have a higher risk of study withdrawal due to ad- verse events than some other SGAs (low strength of research evidence). Specific harms of using clozapine include rare but serious effects, includ ing severe neutropenia, myocarditis, cardiomyopa - *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 99 thy, and NMS. These harms cannot be eliminated, but risks of severe neutropenia are lessened by required ANC monitoring. Early attention to and recognition of NMS and cardiac complications of clozapine use may also reduce risk. Seizures are al so more frequent with clozapine than other an- tipsychotics but can be minimized by slow titration of the clozap ine dose, avoidance of very high clozapine doses, and attention to pharmacokinetic fa ctors that may lead to rapid shifts in clozapine levels. Constipation can also be significant with clozapine and in some patients is associated with fecal impaction or paralytic ileus. Other side ef fects that are more common with clozapine than other antipsychotic medications include sialorrhea , tachycardia, fever, dizziness, se dation, and weight gain. Rates of hyperglycemia and diabetes may also be increased. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that many patients are cooperative wi th and accepting of clozapine as part of a treatment plan; however, other patients may express concerns about the burdens of re- quired blood work, including logistical barriers such as access to transportation (Farooq et al. 2019; Gee et al. 2017; Verdoux et al. 2018) . Concerns about other side effects, such as weight gain or som- nolence, may also contribute to a reluctance to switch to clozapine (Achtyes et al. 2018). On the other hand, when deciding about medication change s, most patients value an ability to think more clearly and stop hallucinations or delusions (Achty es et al. 2018; Kuhnigk et al. 2012; Levitan et al. 2015), and most patients who receive clozapine view it positively. For example, one large survey of individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were taking an antipsychotic med - ication found that the vast majority of those taking clozapine adhered to treatment and found it helpful, whereas only approximately 5% found it not helpful (Siskind et al. 2017a). In contrast, most other antipsychotic me dications were viewed less posi tively (Siskind et al. 2017a). Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statement were viewed as likely to outweigh the potential harms. For individuals at significant risk for aggr essive behavior despite other treatments, there ap- pears to be some benefit of clozapine in reducing aggression risk. In a ddition, clozapine may lead to indirect reductions in the risk of aggressive behavior by reducing other contributory risk factors for aggression such as hallucinations and delusi ons. Thus, with consideration of patient prefer- ences and careful monitoring to minimize the risk of harms from clozapine, the benefit of clozapine in such patients was viewed as li kely to outweigh the harms of treatment. For additional discussion of the research evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 9. Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members There were no differences of opinion. The writing group voted unanimously in favor of this sug- gestion. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations Information from other guidelines is consistent with this guideline statement. The SIGN, RANZCP , BAP , and PORT guidelines all suggest consideration of clozapine for individuals with hostility or aggressive behaviors that do not respond to other interventions (Barnes et al. 2011; Buchanan et al. 2010; Galletly et al. 2016; Hasan et al. 2012; Scotti sh Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2013). In ad- CSG, NICE, RANZCP ing clozapine for individuals with treatment-resi stant schizophrenia (Barnes et al. 2011; Buchanan et al. 2010; Galletly et al. 2016; Hasan et al. 2012; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014; Scottish Intercollegiat e Guidelines Network 2013). APA Practice Guidelines 100 Quality Measurement Considerations As a suggestion, this guideline statement is not appropriate for use as a quality measure for pur- poses of accountability. Electronic decision support using passive alerts may be able to prompt cli- nicians to consider clozapine; however, such pr ompts would be challenging to implement because they would depend on accurate and consistent entry of structured information about diagnosis and risk factors for aggression. Nevertheless, in combin ation with rating scale data, electronic decision support could help identify individuals with sc hizophrenia and significant aggression risk who may benefit from a trial of clozapine. STATEMENT 10: Long-Acting Injectable Antipsychotic Medications APA suggests treatment with a long-acting injectable antipsy- chotic medication if they prefer such treatment or if they ha ve a history of poor or uncer- tain adherence.* Implementation LAI formulations of antipsychoti c medications can provide a number of benefits for patients, fam - ilies, and clinicians, yet they are often underutili zed (Brown et al. 2014; Correll et al. 2016; Lawson et al. 2015; Sultana et al. 2019). Racial differences al so exist in the proportion of individuals who are treated with LAI antipsychotic medications, with gr eater use of these formulations in Black patients than in white patients (Brown et al. 2014; Lawson et al. 2015). With LAI antipsychotic medications, there is grea ter assurance that a patient will receive medi- cation continuously because there are fewer opport unities to miss a medication dose and clinicians will be immediately aware of a missed visit or injection, yielding greater time for intervention be-fore symptoms recur (Correll et al. 2016; Velligan et al. 2010; West et al. 2008). Presumably due to improved adherence, advantages of LAI antipsychotics include the potential for a decreased risk of mortality; reduced risk of hospitalization; and decreased rates of treatment discontinuation, includ - ing discontinuation due to inefficacy (see Appendix C, St atement 10). Other be nefits fo r patients in- clud e a subjective sense of better symptom control, greater convenience as a result of needing to take fewer medications daily, and reduced conflict with family members or other persons of sup- port related to medication-related reminders (Carol i et al. 2011; Correll et al. 2016; Iyer et al. 2013; Yeo et al. 2019). Although some patients may not wi sh to experience the discomfort associated with receiving injections of medications, this is not a major barrier for most patients. In addition, discom- fort can often be minimized by using SGA LAIs rather than FGA LAIs, which have sesame oil- based vehicles, or by using an LAI with a small in jection volume or lower administration frequency (Correll et al. 2016). Consistent with principles of patient-centered care, it may be preferable to educate patients about the availability of LAI antipsychotic medica tions when discussing other aspects of antipsy- chotic treatment. Indeed, many patients will accept and may prefer LAIs if provided with informa - tion about the pluses and minuses of LAIs in the context of shared decisi on-making (Caroli et al. 2011; Heres et Taylor 2009; Weiden et al. 2015; Yeo et al. 2019). Preference rates for LAIs are even higher among individuals who have personal experience in receiving an LAI formulation of an antipsychoti c medication (Heres et al. 2007; Patel et al. 2009; Waddell and Taylor 2009). *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 101 Discussions about LAI antipsychotic medications often occur with patients who have had diffi- culty in adhering to oral medications. However, su ch discussions can also take place at other junc- tures. For example, if an individual has not re sponded to treatment with an oral antipsychotic medication, a trial of an LAI may be warranted (Howes et al. 2017; see Statement 4, subsection \"Strategies to Address Initial Nonresponse Pa rtial Response to Antipsychotic Treatment\" ) be- caus e breaks in the continuity of oral medication therapy can be unrecognized (Lopez et al. 2017). An LAI formulation of an antipsychotic may also be considered when patients are transitioning be- tween settings (e.g., at inpatient discharge, on rele ase from a correctional fa cility), when future ad - herence is uncertain and the risk of reduced adherence may be increased. Although LAI antipsychotic medications have typically been us ed in individuals with multiple episodes of schizophrenia, some studies have used an LAI anti psychotic formulation earlier in the course of ill- ness (Kane et al. 2019; Subotnik et al. 2015), when rates of poor adherence may be greater. Earlier discussion of an LAI may also be considered in in dividuals who are at increa sed risk of poor adher- ence due to a limited awareness of needing treatment or a co-occurring substance use disorder (Garc\u00eda et al. 2016; Velligan et al. 2009). If a decision is made to initiate treatment with an LAI, aspects of medication selection are similar to those for selection of an oral medication in te rms of considering prior response, prior tolerability, pharmacological considerations, an d side-effect profiles (see Statement 4). Patients may also have specific preferences and values related to the freque ncy of injection and the ty pe and location of the injection (e.g., IM deltoid or gluteal sites, subcutan eous abdominal site; Heres et al. 2012). Because the oral and LAI formulations of a specific antipsycho tic medication are comparable, a trial of the same oral antipsychotic will typically occur first to assure efficacy and tolerability (SMI Adviser 2019). Pa - tients will experience medication side effects for a longer period of time after drug discontinuation with LAIs than with oral medications because of pharmacokinetic differences in the formulations, but this is not usually a problem if the oral formulation has first been well tolerated. Nevertheless, caution is warranted in a patient who has expe rienced NMS previously (Correll et al. 2016). The conversion from an oral dose of medication to a corresponding dose of an LAI antipsychotic depends on the specific medication (see Statement 4, Tables 7, 8, and 9 ; Meyer 2013, 2017); product labeling for each medication describes appr oximat e conversion ratios and whether a period of con- comitant oral and LAI medication is needed. If the patient is taking an oral medication that lacks a corresponding LAI formulation, a change in antips ychotic medication may be needed if an LAI for- mulation is clinically indicated or preferred (see Statement 6). When administering LAI antipsychotic injections, it is important to follow recommendations for safe injection practices (Cente rs for Disease Control and Prevention 2019a, 2019b) and infection control precautions (Centers for Disease Control an d Prevention 2016, 2019b) as well as instructions from product labeling. Product labeling also cont ains important information on storage and recon- stitution of LAI antipsychotic formulations as well as information on how to handle missed or late doses of medications (see Statement 4, Tables 7 -9). There are several barriers related to the use of LAI formulations of antipsychotic medications. For patients, there may be logistical barriers (e.g., access to transportation, childcare, school or work schedules) that depend on the frequency of appo intments needed to receive an LAI antipsychotic medication. Other logistical barriers for patients may relate to such factors as cost or insurance au - thorizations for LAI antipsychoti c agents. For clinicians, lack of knowledge and limited experience in using LAI antipsychotic medications contribute to underuse (Correll et al. 2016). Skill and expe-rience in administering injections may be lackin g, and nursing staff may not be available to give injections. Additional barriers relate to the decision to su ggest an LAI antipsychotic medication. Clinicians often do not consider LAI anti psychotic medications as a trea tment option (Hamann et al. Kirschner et al. 2013; Weiden et al. 2015), even when such use is appropriate. Fur- thermore, clinicians may overestimate patients' ad herence with oral medications when considering relative benefits of LAIs (Correll et al. 2016; Lopez et al. 2017) or underestimate the acceptability of APA Practice Guidelines 102 LAIs to patients (Hamann et al. 2010; Iyer et al. 2013; Patel et al. 2010a, 2010b; Weiden et al. 2015). At an organizational level, there may be a lack of resources, space, or trained personnel to admin - ister injections (Correll et al. 201 6; Velligan et al. 2011). Thus, workflows may need to be adjusted, partnerships may need to be developed with prim ary care clinicians to administer LAI antipsy- chotic injections, or other concerted efforts may be needed to address logistical and clinical barriers to LAI antipsychotic use. Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits Use of an LAI antipsychotic medication in the tr eatment of schizophrenia may be associated with improved outcomes. Although meta -analyses of head-to-head RCTs comparing LAI with oral an - tipsychotics (McDonagh et al. 20 17) and other meta-analyses of RC Ts (Kishi et al. Ostuzzi et al. 2017) do not sh ow evidence of benefit fr om LAIs relative to oral antipsychotic medications, observational data from nationwide registry data bases (Taipale et al. 2018a, 2018b; Tiihonen et al. 2011, 2017), cohort studies (Kishimoto et al. 2018), and \"mirror image\" studies (Kishimoto et al. 2013) suggest that use of LAI antipsychotic agents as compared with oral antipsychotic medications is associat ed with a decreased risk of mortality, reduced risk of hospital- ization, and decreased rates of study discontinuat ion (including discontinuation due to inefficacy). Harms The harms of using an LAI antipsychotic medication in the treatment of schizophrenia are generally comparable to the harms of using an oral formul ation of the same medication. For some patients, side effects with LAIs may be less problematic because peaks and troughs of medication levels will be less prominent than with or al medications because of the pharmacokinetic differences in the medication formulations. On the other hand, patients may experience medication side effects for a longer period of time with LAIs than with oral medications, again because of pharmacokinetic dif-ferences. In addition, patients may experience injection-related side effects, including pain, swell- ing, redness, or induration at the inje ction site, with LAI antipsychotic agents. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that many patients are cooperative with and accepting of an LAI anti- psychotic medication as part of a treatment plan, particularly when the option of an LAI and the pluses and minuses of an LAI antipsychotic are re viewed in the context of shared decision-making (Caroli et al. 2011; Heres et al. Taylor 2009; Weiden et al. et al. 2019). Attitudes about LAIs are typicall y more positive among patients who have previ- ously received or currently receive an LAI antips ychotic medication than in those who have never been treated with an LAI medication (Patel et al. 2009). Many patien ts prefer the convenience of re - ceiving an infrequent injection rather than needing to remember to take oral medications. They also value the potential benefits of an LAI antipsychoti c medication in terms of better subjective symp- tom reduction or improved long-term outcomes. On the other hand, some patients may not wish to experience the discomfort associated with receiving injections of medications. Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statement were viewed as likely to outweigh the potential harms. The outcomes associated with use of an LA I formulation of an antipsychotic medication are at least as good as using an oral formulation of the medication and may be better, particularly in terms of treatment discontinuatio n, rehospitalization, and mortal ity risk. Many experts infer that The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 103 the relative benefits of LAI antipsychotic medica tions as compared with equivalent oral formula - tions are related to improved adherence (Velligan et al. 2010; West et al. 2008), although specific data to test this supposition are not available. Nevertheless, use of an LAI antipsychotic may have additional advantages in patients who have diffic ulty with adherence or in whom adherence is un- certain. The side effects of treatment with an LA I antipsychotic medication are also comparable to side effects with the corresponding oral medication. For additional discussion of the research evi- dence, see Appendix C, Statement 10. Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members There were no differences of opinion. The writing group voted unanimously in favor of this sug-gestion. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations Information from other guidelines is consistent with this guideline statement (Barnes et al. 2011; Buchanan et al. 2010; Galletly et al. 2016; Hasan et al. 2012; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014; Remington et al. 2017; Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2013). Other guidelines on the treatment of schizophrenia sugges t use of LAIs based on patient preference (BAP , CSG, NICE, PORT, RANZCP , SIGN) or in the contex t of poor or uncertain adherence (BAP , NICE, RANZCP, SIGN). The RANZCP and WFSBP guidelines also note that LAIs should be considered if there has been a poor response to oral medica tion, and the RANZCP guideline notes that LAIs should be offered to patients early in the clinical course of schizophrenia. Quality Measurement Considerations As a suggestion, this guideline statement is not appropriate for use as a quality measure. However, only a small proportion of individuals with schizophrenia receive an LAI antipsychotic medication in clinical practice (Brown et al. 2014; Correll et al. 2016; Lawson et al. 2015; Sultana et al. 2019). Be- cause adherence is poor or uncert ain in many individuals with schi zophrenia, patients may benefit from or prefer to receive an LAI antipsychotic medi cation if one is offered. Consequently, electronic decision support could suggest that clinicians consider an LAI antipsychotic medication if poor ad-herence is documented or with repeated hospital izations or emergency vi sits. In addition, health care organizations may wish to ensure that they will provide treatment with an LAI antipsychotic medication to patients when appropriate. Heal th care organizations and health plans may also wish to implement internal process measures to as sess and increase rates at which LAI antipsychot - ics are used. STATEMENT 11: Anticholinergic Medications for Acute Dystonia APA recommends (1C) that patients who have acute dystonia associated with antipsychotic therapy be treated with an anti cholinergic medication. Implementation Medication-induced acute dystonia is defined in DSM-5 as [a]bnormal and prolonged contraction of the muscles of the eyes (oculogy ric crisis), head, neck (torticollis or retrocollis), limbs, or tr unk developing within a few days of starting or raising the dosage of a med- ication (such as a neuroleptic) or after reducing th e dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms. (American Psychiatri c Association 2013a, p. 711) APA Practice Guidelines 104 A dystonic spasm of the axial muscles along the spinal cord can result in opisthotonos, in which the head, neck, and spinal column are hyperextended in an arched position. Rarely, acute dystonia can also present as life-threatening laryngospasm, which results in an inability to breathe (Ganesh et al. 2015; Koek and Pi 1989). Acute dystonia is sudden in onset and painful and can cause patients great distress. Because of the dramatic appearance of acute dystonia, health professionals who are unfa - miliar with the condition may incorrectly attribute these reactions to catatonic signs or unusual be- havior on the part of patients, and oculogyric cr ises can sometimes be misinterpreted as indicative of seizure activity. In individuals treated with FGAs , it is estimated that up to 10% of patients may experience an acute dystonic episode, and with SG As, rates of acute dystonia may be less than 2% (Martino et al. 2018; Miller et al. 2008; Satterthwait e et al. 2008). Additional factors that increase the risk of acute dystonia with antipsychotic medicati on include young age, male sex, ethnicity, recent cocaine use, high medication dose, and intramuscular route of me dication administration (Gray and Pi 1998; Spina et al. 1993; van Harten et al. 1999). There are a limited number of clinical studies of anticholinergic medica tions in acute dystonia associated with antipsychotic ther apy. Nevertheless, a large amount of clinical experience suggests that acute dystonia can be reversed by administration of diphenhydramine, a histamine receptor antagonist with anticholinergic properties. Typica lly, it is administered intramuscularly to treat acute dystonia, but it can also be administered intravenously in em ergent situations, as with acute dystonia associated with laryngospasm. Alternativ ely, benztropine can also be administered intra- muscularly. Once the acute dystonia has resolved, it may be necessary to continue an oral anticho - linergic medication to prevent recurrence, at leas t until other changes in medications can take place such as reducing the dose of medication or chan ging to an antipsychotic medication that is less likely to be associated with acute dystonia. Typica lly, a medication such as benztropine or trihexy- phenidyl is used for this purpose because of th e shorter half-life of oral diphenhydramine and a need for more frequent dosing. For additional details of dosing and use of these medications, see Statement 12, Table 10. Regardless of the anticholinergic medication that is chosen, it is important to use the lowest dose that is ab le to treat acute dystonia and continue the anticholinergic medica - tion for the shortest time need ed to prevent dystonia from re curring. After several weeks to months, anticholinergic medications can sometime s be reduced or withdrawn without recurrence of dystonia or worsening of other antipsychotic- induced neurological symptoms (Desmarais et al. 2012). Medications with anticholinergic effects can resu lt in multiple difficulties for patients, includ- ing impaired quality of life, impa ired cognition, and significant he alth complications (Salahudeen et al. 2015). Dry mouth due to anticholinergic effects is associated with an in creased risk for multiple dental complications (Singh and Papas 2014), and dr inking high-calorie fluids in response to dry mouth can contribute to weight ga in. Medications with anticholinergic effects can also precipitate acute angle-closure glaucoma (Lachkar and Bouass ida 2007), although patients with treated glau - coma seem to be able to tolerate these medication s with careful monitoring (Bower et al. 2018). Other peripheral side effects of anticholinergic medi cations can include blurred vision, constipation, tachycardia, urinary retention, and effects on ther moregulation (e.g., hyperthermia in hot weather) (Nasrallah and Tandon 2017; Ozbilen and Adams 20 09), and central anticholinergic effects can in- clude impaired learning and memory and slowed cognition (Ang et al. 2017; Vinogradov et al. 2009). Older individuals can be particularly sensit ive to these anticholinergic effects and can de- velop problems such as urinary retention, confus ion, fecal impaction, and anticholinergic toxicity (with delirium, somnolence, and hallucinations) (Nasrallah and Tandon 2017). In addition, it is im-portant to consider the anticholinergic side effect s associated with other medications that a patient is taking, such as antipsychotic medications, some antidepressant medications, urological diphenhydramine). The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 105 Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits In individuals who have acute dystonia associated with antipsychotic therapy, the use of medications with anticholinergic properties (including diphen hydramine, benztropine, and trihexyphenidyl) can be associated with rapid symptom relief. In addition, continuing tr eatment with an anticholinergic medication can prevent the return of dystonia un til other adjustments to the treatment regimen can be made to minimize the risk of recurrence. Harms The harms of using a medication with anticholinergic properties to treat acute dystonia include side ef - fects such as dry mouth, blurred vision, precipitatio n of acute angle-closure gla ucoma, cases retention, effect s on thermoregulation (e.g., hyper- thermia in hot weather), impaired learning and memory, slowed cognit ion, and anticholinergic toxicity (with delirium, somnolence, and hallucinations). These harms are likely to be greater in older individu- als and may be augmented in individuals taking ot her medications with anti cholinergic properties. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that acute dystonia associated with antipsycho tic therapy is very un - comfortable for patients, and most of them are frig htened by it. As a result, patients are typically cooperative with and accepting of acute treatment with an anticholinergic agent. They may also be willing to take one of these medications to preven t the return of dystonia . However, some patients may be troubled by side effects such as blurred vision, dry mouth, and constipation and may wish to avoid more significant side effects as sociated with antich olinergic medications. Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statemen t were viewed as far outweighing the potential harms. For the majority of patien ts who are experiencing acute dy stonia associated with antipsy - chotic therapy, the rapid relief of symptoms with anticholinergic treatment outweighs the side ef - fects associated with these medications, at least on a short-term basis. In patients who experience acute laryngeal dystonia, rapid administration of a medication with anticholinergic properties, such as diphenhydramine, can be lifesaving. Nevertheless, the long -term benefits and harms of an- ticholinergic medications are less clear, and, in this context, harms may outweigh benefits. For ad- ditional discussion of the research evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 11 . Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members Eight writing group members voted to recommend this statement. One wr iting group member dis- agreed with this statement out of concern that a reduction in antipsyc hotic medication dose or a change in medication may be preferable to immediate use of an anticholinergic medication in some situations. In addition, one writing group member expressed concern that the use of the phrase \"anticholinergic medication\" in the statement may be misleading because diphenhydramine is typically viewed as an antihistamine but may be preferab le to other anticholinergic medi cations to treat acute dystonia. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations The guidelines of the WFSBP are in agreement with this recommendation, noting that acute dysto- nia responds dramatically to administration of anticholinergic or antihistaminic medication (Hasan et al. 2013). The guideline of the BAP notes that use for acute dystonia \"should be determined on APA Practice Guidelines 106 an individual basis, taking account of factors su ch as the patient's history of extrapyramidal side effects and the risk of anticholinergic si de effects\" (Barnes et al. 2011, p. 7). Quality Measurement Considerations This guideline statement is not appropriate for use as a quality measure or as part of electronic clin- ical decision support. Even with short-term treatmen t, some patients could have the potential to de- velop significant anticholinergic side effects, whic h would need to be incorporated into exclusion and exemption criteria. With redu ctions in the use of high dose s of high-potency FGAs, the fre- quency of acute dystonia is significantly reduce d. Any measure would apply only to a small num- ber of individuals, which would complicate testing fo r feasibility, usability, reliability, and validity. STATEMENT 12: Treatments for Parkinsonism APA suggests (2C) the following options for patients who ha ve parkinsonism associated with anti- psychotic therapy: lowering the dosage of the antipsychotic medication, sw itching to another anti- psychotic medication, or treating wi th an anticholinergic medication. Implementation Medication-induced parkinsonism, which and parkinsoni sm in as [p]arkinsonian tremor, muscular rigidi ty, akinesia (i.e., loss of moveme nt or difficulty initiating move- ment), or bradykinesia (i.e., slowing movement) deve loping within a few weeks of starting or raising the dosage of a medication (e.g., a neuroleptic) or after reducing the dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms. (American Psychiatric As sociation 2013a, p. 709) These symptoms of medication-induced parkinsoni sm are dose-dependent and generally resolve with discontinuation of antipsychotic me dication. It is important to a ppreciate that medication-induced parkinsonism can affect emotional and cognitive function, at times in the absence of detectable motor symptoms. As a result, it can be difficult to distinguish the negative symptoms of schizophrenia or con- comitant depression from medication-induced pa rkinsonism. In addition, emotional and cognitive features of medication-induced parkinsonism can be subjectively unpleasant and can contribute to poor medication adherence (Acosta et al. 2012; Ascher-Svanum et al. 2006). A number of approaches can be taken when a pa tient is experiencing medication-induced par - kinsonism. A reduction in the dose of the antipsyc hotic medication, if feasible, is often helpful in reducing parkinsonism. In some individuals, it may be appropriate to change the antipsychotic medication to one with a lower likelihood of park insonism (see Statement 4, Table 6 ). For indivi d- uals who are highly sensitive to medication-induced parkinsonism, clozapine may be considered. However, before reducing the dose of medication or changing to another antipsychotic medication, the benefits of reduced parkinsonism should be weighed against the potential for an increase in psychotic symptoms. Careful monitoring for symptom recurrence is always important when mak-ing changes or reducing doses of antipsychotic me dications, and use of quantitative measures can be helpful in this regard, as described in Statement 2. The use of an anticholinergic medication is another option, either on a short-term basis, until a change in dose or a change in medication can occur, or on a longer-term basis, if a change in dose or change in medication is not feasible. In most circumstances, an anticholinergic medication will be started only after parkinsonian symptoms ar e apparent. However, some individuals may be at increased risk of developing parkinsonism (e.g., those with significant parkinsonism with prior treatment), and prophylactic use of an antichol inergic medication may occasionally be warranted. Typically, a medication such as benztropine or tr ihexyphenidyl is used to treat medication-induced parkinsonism because diphenhydramine has a shorter half-life and greater likelihood of sedation. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 107 However, oral or intramuscular diphenhydramine can also be used on an acute basis. Additional details on these medications are provided in Table 10. It should also be noted that different symp- toms of parkinsonism (e.g., rigidity, tremors, akinesia) may have a differential response to anticho-linergic medications, and different treatment appr oaches may be needed to address each of these symptoms. Parkinsonism should also be distinguished from tardive dyskinesia, which can be wors- ened by medications (B ergman and Soares-Weiser 2018; Cogentin 2013). If an anticholinergic medication is used, it is important to adjust the medication to the lowest dose that is able to treat the pa rkinsonian symptoms. In addition, it is also important to use the medication for the shortest time necessary. After several weeks to months, anticholinergic medica- tions can sometimes be reduced or withdrawn with out recurrence of parkinsonism or worsening of other antipsychotic-induced ne urological symptoms (Desmarais et al. 2012). Medications with anticholinergic effects can result in multiple diff iculties for patients, including impaired quality of life, impaired cognition, and si gnificant health complications (Salahudeen et al. 2015). Dry mouth due to anticholinergic effects is associated with an increased risk for multiple dental complications (Singh and Papas 2014), and drinking high-calorie fluids in response to dry mouth can contribute to weight gain. Medications with anticholinergic effects can also precipitate acute angle-closure glaucoma (Lachkar and Bouassida 2007), although pa tients with treated glaucoma seem to be able to tolerate these medications with ca reful monitoring (Bower et al. 2018). Other peripheral side effects of anticholinergic medications can include blurred vision, constipa - tion, tachycardia, urinary retentio n, and effects on thermoregulati on (e.g., hyperthermia in hot weather) (Nasrallah and Tandon 2017; Ozbilen and Adams 2009), an d central anticholinergic effects can include impaired learning and memory and sl owed cognition (Ang et al. 2017; Vinogradov et al. 2009). Older individuals can be particularly sens itive to these anticholinergic effects and can de- velop problems such as urinary retention, confus ion, fecal impaction, and anticholinergic toxicity (with delirium, somnolence, and hallucinations) (Nasrallah and Tandon 2017). In addition, it is im- portant to consider the anticholinergic side effect s associated with other medications that a patient is taking, such as antipsychotic medications, some antidepressant medications, urological an antich olinergic medication to treat medication-induced parkinsonism. Studies of amantadi ne have had small samples, but the available evidence and clin- ical experience suggest that aman tadine may have comparable or somewhat less benefit than anti- cholinergic agents in et al. Mindham et al. 1972; Silver et al. 1995). With the absence of an - ticholinergic properties, side effects, includin g cognitive impairment, are less prominent with amantadine than with anticholinergic agents. Common adverse effects with amantadine include nausea, dizziness, insomnia, nervousness, impaired concentration, fatigue, and livedo reticularis. Hallucinations and suicidal thoughts have also been reported, as has an increased seizure fre- quency in individuals with preexisting seizure disorder (Micromedex 2019). Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits In individuals who have medication-induced pa rkinsonism, a reduction in signs and symptoms such as rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia can be of significant benefit, whether such a reduction is achieved by reducing the dose of antipsychoti c medication, changing to another antipsychotic medication that has less propensity to cause parkinsonism, or using medications with anticholin- ergic properties to treat the parkinsonism.

Harms Reducing the dose of an antipsychotic medication or changing to a different antipsychotic medication can be associated with an increase in psychotic symptoms. The harms of using a medication with an- ticholinergic properties to treat medication-induced parkinsonism include side effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision, precipitation of acute angle- closure glaucoma, constipation (and in some cases fecal impaction), tachycardia, urinary retention, effects on thermoregulation (e.g., hyperthermia in hot weather), impaired learning and memory, slowed cognition, and anticholinergic toxicity (with de- lirium, somnolence, and hallucinations). These harms are likely to be greater in older individuals and may be augmented in in dividuals taking other medications with anticholinergic properties. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that most patients are bothered by medication-induced parkinsonism and would like to minimize or eliminate this side effect of antipsychotic medication. However, APA Practice Guidelines 110 most patients will also want to minimize the chance that psychotic sy mptoms will increase. Many patients are also troubled by side effects such as blurred vision, dry mouth, and constipation and may wish to avoid more significant side effects associated with antichol inergic medications. Con- sequently, the balance of these possible risks an d benefits of different approaches to addressing medication-induced parkinsonism is likely to vary for each individual and his or her risk factors and personal preferences. Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statement were viewed as likely to outweigh the potential harms because medication-induced parkinsonism ca n affect the patient's quality of life, and pa- tients would prefer to address it, if feasible. Ho wever, each of the available options for decreasing or eliminating medication-induced parkinsonism ha s associated risks and characteristics, and pref - erences of each patient need to be taken into consideration. In addition, the long-term benefits and harms of anticholinergic medicati ons are less clear, and harms of long-term use may outweigh ben- efits. For additional discussi on of the research evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 12. Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members Eight writing group members voted to suggest th is statement. One writing group member dis- agreed with this statement, believing that a reduction in antipsychotic medication dose or a change in medication would be preferable to use of an antichol inergic medication. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations Statements from other guidelines vary in their approach to medication-induced parkinsonism. The WFSBP guideline notes that use of SGAs or reduct ions in medication doses should be the primary treatment for medication-induced parkinsonism (Hasan et al. 2013). The BAP guideline notes that decisions about the use of anticholinergic me dications for medication-induced parkinsonism should be made on an individual basis, but these medications should not be given prophylactically (Barnes et al. 2011). The PORT guideline notes that prophylactic use of antiparkinsonian agents is not warranted in patients treated with SGAs but ma y be indicated on an individual basis in patients treated with FGAs (Buchanan et al. 2010). Quality Measurement Considerations As a suggestion, this statement is not appropriate for use as a quality measure. It is also not appro- priate for incorporation into electronic decision support. STATEMENT 13: Treatments for Akathisia APA suggests (2C) the following options for patients who have akathisia associ ated with antipsy- chotic therapy: lowering the dosage of the anti psychotic medication, switching to another antipsy- chotic medication, adding a benzodiazepine medication, or adding a beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Implementation Medication-induced acute akat hisia is defined in DSM-5 as [s]ubjective complaints of restlessness, often accompanied by observed excessive movements (e.g., fid - gety movements of the legs, rocking from foot to foot, pacing, inability to sit or stand still), developing within a few weeks of starti ng or raising the dosage of a medication (such as a neuroleptic) or after re - ducing the dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms. (American Psychiatric As - sociation 2013a, p. 711) The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 111 Akathisia is sometimes difficult to distinguish from psychomotor agitation associated with psycho- sis, leading to a cycle of increasing doses of anti psychotic medication that lead to further increases in akathisia. Even in mild forms in which the pati ent is able to control most movements, akathisia is often extremely distressing to patients and is a frequent cause of nonadherence with antipsy- chotic treatment. If allowed to persist, akathisia can cont ribute to feelings of dysphoria and, in some instances, suicidal behaviors. The reported rates of akathisia vary from 10%-15% to as many as one- third of patients treated with antipsychotic medi cation, even when SGAs are used (Juncal-Ruiz et al. 2017; Martino et al. 2018; Mentze l et al. 2017; Miller et al. 2008). A number of approaches can be taken when a patient is experiencing antipsychotic-induced akathi- sia. A reduction in the dose of the antipsychotic medication, if feasible, is often helpful in reducing akathisia. In some individuals, it may be appropri ate to change the antipsyc hotic medication to one with a lower likelihood of akathisia (see Statement 4, Table 6). However, before reducing the dose of medication or changing to another antipsychotic medication, the benefits of reduced akathisia should be weighed against the potential for an increase in psychotic symptoms. Careful monitoring for symp - tom recurrence is always important when making changes or reducing doses of antipsychotic medica- tions, and use of quantitative measures can be helpful in this regard, as described in Statement 2. Benzodiazepine medications, including lorazepam and clonazepam, can also be helpful in the treatment of akathisia. Among other side effects, somnolence and cognitive difficulties can be asso- ciated with benzodiazepine use (Lexicomp 2019; Mi cromedex 2019). In addition, problems with co- ordination as a result of benzodia zepines can contribute to falls, particularly in older individuals (Donnelly et al. 2017). Although benzodiazepines are much safer th an older sedative agents, respi- ratory depression can be seen with high doses of a benzodiazepine, part icularly in combination with alcohol, other sedating medications, or op ioids (Hirschtritt et al. 2017). Caution may also be indicated in prescribing benzodiazepines to individuals with sleep apnea, although few studies are available (Mason et al. 2015). Individuals who are treated with a benzodiazepine may also take them in higher amounts or more frequently than intended. In some patien ts, a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder may develop, particularly in individuals with a past or current diagnosis of alcohol use disorder or another substance use disorder. Another option for treatment of akathisia is the -adrenergic blocking agent propranolol (Pringsheim et al. 2018), which is typically ad ministered in divided doses, with a total daily dose of 30-120 mg. When using propranolol, it is im portant to monitor blood pressure with increases in dose and recog- nize that taking propranolol with protein-rich food s can increase bioavailability by 50%. In addition, propranolol is metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which can contribute to drug-drug interactions. Some literature also sugge sts that mirtazapine may reduce akathisia in some patients (Perry et al. 2018; Poyurovsky and Weizman 2018; Praharaj et al. 2015 ). In contrast, akathi- sia tends not to respond to anticholinergic agents (Pringsheim et al. 2018; Rathbone and Soares- Weiser 2006). Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits In individuals who have akathisi a associated with antipsychotic medication, a reduction in symp - toms can be of significant benefit, whether such a reduction is achieved by reducing the dose of an- tipsychotic medication, changing to another antipsychotic medicati on that has less propensity to cause akathisia, or usin g a benzodiazepine or a -adrenergic blocking ag ent to treat akathisia. Harms Reducing the dose of an antipsyc hotic medication or changing to a different antipsychotic medication can be associated with an increase in psychotic symptoms. The harms of using a benzodiazepine can APA Practice Guidelines 112 include somnolence, cognitive diffic ulties, problems with coordination, and risk of misuse or develop - ment of a sedative use disorder. In high doses and particularly in combinatio n with alcohol, other se- dating medications, or opioids, respiratory depression may occur. With use of a -adrenergic blocking agent, such as propranolol, the primary harm relates to lowering of blood pressure. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that most patients are bothered by akathisia and, in some instances, very distressed by it. Thus, almost all patients would like to minimize or eliminate this side effect of antipsychotic medication. However, most patien ts will also want to minimize the chance that psychotic symptoms will increase. They may also be concerned about the possible side effects of medications such as benzodiazepines and -adrenergic blocking agents. Consequently, the balance of these possible risks and benefits of different ap proaches to addressing akathisia are likely to vary for each individual and his or her ri sk factors and personal preferences. Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statement were viewed as likely to outweigh the potential harms because akathisia can affect the patient's qual ity of life, and patients would prefer to address it, if feasible. However, each of the available opti ons for decreasing or eliminating akathisia has as- sociated risks and characteristics, and the preferences of each patient need to be taken into consid - eration. For additional discu ssion of the research evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 13. Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members There were no differences of opinion. The writing gr oup voted unanimously in fa vor of this suggestion. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations The WFSBP guideline notes that there is some evid ence that benzodiazepines are effective in the treatment of akathisia and that there is very limi ted evidence to support the use of centrally active -adrenergic blocking agents in the trea tment of akathisia (Hasan et al. 2013). Quality Measurement Considerations As a suggestion, this statement is not appropriate for use as a quality measure. It is also not appro-priate for incorporation into electronic decision support. STATEMENT 14: VMAT2 Medications for Tardive Dyskinesia APA recommends (1B) that patients who have moderate to se vere or disabling tardive dyskinesia as - sociated with antipsychotic therapy be treated th a reversible inhibitor of vesicular mono- amine syndromes are persistent abnormal involu ntary movement disorders caused by sustained exposure to antipsychotic medica tion, the most common dystonia, and tardive akathisia (Frei et al. They begin later in treatment than acute dystonia, akathisia, or medication-induced parkinsonism, and they persist and may even increase, despite re- duction in dose or discontinuation of the antips ychotic medication. lly, tardive dyskinesia presents as \"[i]nvoluntary athetoid or choreiform movements (lasting at least a few weeks) gener- ally of the tongue, lower face and jaw, and extr emities (but sometimes involving the pharyngeal, The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 113 diaphragmatic, or trunk muscles) \" (American Psychiatric Association 2013a, p. 712), whereas tar- dive dystonia and tardive akathisia resemble their acute counterparts in phenomenology. Tardive dyskinesia has been reported after exposu re to any of the available antipsychotic medi- cations (Carbon et al. 2017, 2018). It occurs at a ra te of approximately 4%-8% per year in adult pa - tients treated with FGAs (Carbon et al. 2018; Woods et al. 2010), a ri sk that appears to be at least three times that observed with SGAs (Carbon et al. 2018; O'Brien 2016; Woods et al. 2010). Various factors are associated with grea ter vulnerability to tardive dyskinesia, including age greater than 55 years; female sex; white or Af rican race/ethnicity; presence of a mood disorder, intellectual dis- ability, or central nervous system injury; and past or current akathisia, clinically significant parkin - sonism, or acute dystonic on-Lomba et al. 2019; Solmi et al. 2018a). Evaluation for the presence of tardive syndromes is important in order to identify them, mini- mize worsening, and institute clinically indicated tr eatment. However, evaluation of the risk of tar- dive dyskinesia is complicated by the fact that dyskinetic movements may be observed with a reduction in antipsychotic medication dose, which is termed a withdrawal-emergent dyskinesia (American Psychiatric Association 2013a). Fluctu ations in symptoms are also common and may be influenced by such factors as psychosocial stress ors. Furthermore, spontaneous dyskinesias, which are clinically indistinguishable from tardive dyskin esia, have been described in elderly patients be- fore the advent of antipsychotic medications and in up to 20% of never-medicated patients with chronic schizophrenia (Blanchet et al. 2004; Crow et al. 1982; Fenton et al. 1997; Saltz et al. 1991). Regular assessment of patients for tardive syndromes through clinical examination or through the use of a structured evaluative tool can aid in identifying tardive sy ndromes, clarifying their likely etiology, monitoring their longitudinal course, and determining the effects of medication changes or treatments for tardive dyskinesia (see Statement 1, Table 2). The AIMS and the DISCUS ar e examples of such tools (Guy 1976; Kalachnik and Sprague 1993; Munetz and Benjamin 1988). When using scales such as the AIMS or the DISCUS, it should be noted that there is no specific score threshold that suggests a need for intervention, although ranges of scores are noted to correspond with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms. In addi tion, the same total score can be associated with significantly different clinical manifestations and varying impacts on the patient. Patients, family members, and other persons of support may be able to provide informa tion about the onset of movements; their longitudinal course in relation to treatment or other precipitants; and their im-pact on functioning, health status (inc luding dentition), and quality of life. Although the majority of patients who develop tardive dyskinesia have mild symptoms, a small proportion will develop symptoms of moderate or severe degree. In such circumstances, assessment for other contributors to a movement disorder is also warranted (Jinnah and Factor 2015; Mehta et al. 2015; et al. 2015; Jankovic 2015). In addition to a neurological examin ation and complete history of motor symptoms and past and current medications, history and laboratory testing may include liver function tests, thyroid function tests, se- rum calcium, complete blood count, and antiphos pholipid antibodies. Depe nding on the results of the history and evaluation, additional studies may be indicated (e.g., ceruloplasmin for Wilson's dis- puncture for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis). If dyskinetic movements have begun or have in- creased in the context of antipsychotic dose reductio n, it is important to assess the longitudinal course of symptoms for up to several mo nths because spontaneous reductions or resolution of the dyskinesia may occur. If no contributing etiology is identified and modera te to severe or disabling tardive dyskinesia per- sists, treatment is recommended with a reversible inhibitor of the VMAT2. Treatment with a VMAT2 inhibitor can also be considered for patients with mi ld tardive dyskinesia on the basis of such factors as patient preference, associated impairment, or ef fect on psychosocial functioning. Table 11 shows the characteristics of VMAT2 inhibitors that are currently available in the United States. APA Practice Guidelines 114 TABLE 11.

De tailed information on such issues as dose regimen, dose adjus t- ments, medication administration procedures , handling precautions, and storage can be found in product labeling. It is recommended that readers consult product labeling information fo r authoritative information on these medications. bThe most common U.S. trade names are included for reference only. At the time of public ation, some of these products may be man u- factured only as generic products. cAll VMAT2 inhibitors are contraindicated within 2 weeks of a monoam ine oxidase inhibitor, within 20 days of reserpine, or in pa tients with active suicidal ideas or untreated depression. Tetrabenazin e and deutetrabenazine carry a boxed warning related to depress ion and suicidal ideation in patients with Huntington's disease. Abbreviations . A valbenazine is preferred over tetrabenazine because of the greater evidence base supporting their use. In addition, tetrabenazine has a shorter half-life and greater rates of associated depression when used in the treatment of patients with Huntington's disease. Other factors that may in fluence choice of a VMAT2 inhibitor relate to hepatic or renal function; with hepatic im- pairment, whereas valbenazine is not recommended for use in individuals with severe renal im- pairment. The metabolism of these medications is also somewhat different. Although all of these medications are substrates for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine are ma - jor substrates for CYP2D6, whereas valbenazine is a major substrate for CYP3A4. Consequently, the APA Practice Guidelines 116 patient's CYP2D6 metabolizer status or use of concomitant medications that influence these meta - bolic enzymes may affect the choice of a VMAT2 inhibitor. In terms of side effects, these medica - tions are generally well tolerated, with sedation being most common. In initial studies of tetrabenazine in patients with Huntington's diseas e, significant rates of depression were noted as well as concerns about suicidal ideas and behavior s (Shen et al. 2013). However, in studies of deu - tetrabenazine and valbenazine in patients with tard ive dyskinesia, there were no apparent increases in depression or suicidal ideas ei ther in the randomized portions of the clinical trials or in longer open-label extension periods (Solmi et al. 2018b). Ne vertheless, depression or suicidal ideas could oc- cur during treatment for tardive dyskinesia, and clinicians will want to be alert to this possibility. Small clinical trials and case series have examined other treatments for tardive dyskinesia. A lower dose of antipsychotic medica tion can be considered, although evidence for this approach is minimal (Bergman et al. 2017), and the potential fo r benefit needs to be weighed against the possibil- ity of recurrent symptoms or relapse. Some benefi ts have been noted with benzodiazepines (Bergman et al. 2018a), although the potential for benefits mu st be weighed against the potential side effects of these medications, including somnolence, cognitive difficulties, problems with coordination, and risk of misuse or development of a sedative use disorder. In high doses and particularly in com-bination with alcohol, other seda ting medications, or opioids, respiratory depression may occur. A change in antipsychotic therapy to a lower-pote ncy medication (particula rly clozapine) may also be associated with a reduction in tardive dyskinesia, particularly for individuals with moderate to severe symptoms (Mentzel et al. 2018). Again, howe ver, the potential benefits of changing medica - tion should be considered in light of the possibility of symptom recurrence. In general, giving a higher dose of an antipsychotic may suppress movements of tardive dyski- nesia in the short term but would be expected to escalate further development of tardive dyskinesia in the long term. Nevertheless, there may be life-t hreatening circumstances (e.g., patients with con- stant movement, gagging, or choking) in which rapid suppression of dyskinesia is needed, and ju-dicious use of an antipsychotic may be appropriate. Anticholinergic medi cations do not improve and may even worsen tardive dyskinesia (Bergman and Soares-Weiser 2018; Cogentin 2013) in ad- dition to producing significant side effects. For individuals with other tardive syndromes, ot her approaches may be he lpful on an individual basis. For example, depending on the muscle group th at is affected, injections of botulinum toxin have been used to treat tardive dystonia (Brashear et al. 1998; Jinnah and et al. 1998). In addition, tardive dystonia may respond to -adrenergic blocking ag ents (Hatcher-Martin et al. 2016), and in rare cases of severe intracta ble tardive dystonia, deep brain stimulation might be considered (Paschen and Deuschl 2018). High doses of anticholinergic agents have also been used to treat severe tardive dystonia (Burke et al. 1982; Kang et al. 1986; Wojcik et al. 1991), although these medications are not useful in treating ta rdive dyskinesia (Bergman and Soares-Weiser 2018; Cogentin 2013). Reserpine, which monoamines, should not be used to treat tardive syndromes because it has high rates of associated depression and suicidal ideas and lowers blood pressure (Micromedex 2019). Other treatments, such as vitamin B 6 or vitamin E, are less likely to be associated with harms but do not a ppear to be associated with bene fits in treating tardive dyskine- sia (Adelufosi et al. 2015; Soares-Weiser et al. 2018a). Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits In individuals with moderate to severe or disabling tardive dyskinesia associated with antipsy - chotic therapy, VMAT2 inhibitors can be associated with significant reductions in motor signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. These medication s may also be effective in other tardive syn- dromes. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 117 Harms The harms of treatment with VMAT2 inhibitors include sedation and, with tetrabenazine, extrapy- ramidal effects, akathisia, insomnia, anxiety, naus ea, and falls. Depression and suicidal ideas have been reported in individuals who were administ ered VMAT2 inhibitors for treatment of Hunting- ton's disease. Such effects are possible in indivi duals treated for tardive dyskinesia, although they were not reported in clinical trials. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that most patients with moderate to severe or disabling tardive dyski-nesia wish to have a diminution of their motor signs and symptoms . Most patients would be will- ing to take medication to achieve a reduction in mo tor signs and symptoms, particularly if it is well tolerated. Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statemen t were viewed as far outweighing the potential harms. The majority of individuals with moderate to severe or disabling tardive dyskinesia would have a greater likelihood of experiencing benefi ts of a VMAT2 inhibitor than experiencing harms. Patient preferences to reduce motor signs and sympto ms are also likely to favor treatment. For ad- ditional discussion of the research evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 14. Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members There were no differences of opinion. The writing group voted unanimously in favor of this recom-mendation. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations The WFSBP guideline notes that tetrabenazine migh t have positive effects on tardive dyskinesia (Hasan et al. 2013). It al so notes that the risk of tardive dyskin esia is less with SGAs than with FGAs and that there is limited evidence of benefit with clozapine for tardive dyskinesia. Information on a range of other treatments is noted to be even le ss conclusive. The practice guideline of the Amer- ican Academy of Neurology, which was published before the availability of deutetrabenazine and valbenazine, notes that tetraben azine might be considered as a treatment for tardive syndromes (Bhidayasiri et al. 2013). Quality Measurement Considerations If a quality measure on VMAT2 inhibitor treatment of tardive syndromes is considered at the pro- vider, facility, health plan, integrated delivery system, or population level, testing of feasibility, usabil-ity, reliability, and validity would be essential prior to use for purpos es of accountab ility. However, it may be possible and preferable to incorporate this recommendation into inte rnal facility or health plan initiatives focused on en hanced identification and treatment of tardive syndromes. Electronic decision support using passive alerts may be able to prompt clinicians to consider a VMAT2 inhibitor, although such prompts would depe nd on accurate and consistent entry of struc- tured information about the presence of a tardive syndrome, its severity, and its associated degree of disability. Nevertheless, in combination with ra ting scale data (e.g., AIMS), electronic decision support could help identify individuals with a ta rdive syndrome who may benefit from a trial of a VMAT2 inhibitor. Information from laboratory data, diagnoses, or problem lists would also be helpful to incorporate in terms of potential cont raindications to VMAT2 i nhibitor treatment (e.g., tetrabenazine and in the presence of hepatic impairment; val- benazine is not recommended for use in in dividuals with severe renal impairment). APA Practice Guidelines 118 Psychosocial Interventions STATEMENT 15: Coordinated Specialty Care Programs APA recommends (1B) that patients with schizophrenia who are experiencing a first epi- sode of psychosis be treated in a coordinated specialty care program. * Implementation For individuals with a first episode of psychosis, coordinated specialty care (CSC) programs have been developed that integrate a number of eviden ce-based interventions into a comprehensive treat - ment package. For example, the NAVIGATE progra m, which was developed for the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) Early Trea tment research initiative, uses a collaborative, shared decision-making approach that incorporates family involv ement and educat ion, individual resiliency training, supported employment and educ ation, and individualized medication treatment (Mueser et al. 2015; National Institute of Mental Health 2019a). Similar CSC programs, which are sometimes referred to as team-bas ed, multicomponent interventions, have also been used in other countries for treatment of early psychosis (Anderson et al. 2018; Craig et al. 2004; Secher et al. 2015). These treatment programs often include individuals with diagnoses other than schizophrenia but have been associated with a number of benefits , including lower mortality (Anderson et al. 2018), lower rates of relapse, better quality of life, better global function, and greater likelihood of working or being in school after receiving up to 2 years of treatment (McDonagh et al. 2017). Patients in such programs may also experience a greater sense of empowerment and support for their autonomy (Browne et al. 2017). Programs are also available th at are aimed at early identification and treatment of attenuated psychosis syndrome or related syndromes of high psychosis risk (J. Addington et al. 2017; Cotton et al. 2016); however, these programs are not within the scope of this guideline recom - mendation because they include individuals who do not have a psychiatric diagnosis or who have diagnoses other than schizophrenia at later follow-up times (Fusar-Poli et al. 2016; Iorfino et al. 2019). The main barriers to implementing this recommend ation in practice relate to the limited avail- ability of first-episode, multicomponent treatment programs. For state health agencies, health sys-tems, or organizations that are implementing these programs, barriers include such issues as funding, training, and implementation support. Ho wever, consultation and implementation mate- rials are available to help guide the establishm ent of new programs with evidence-based ap- proaches (National Institute of Mental Health 2019b; NAVIGATE 2019; OnTrackNY 2019). Tools are also available to assess fidelity of CSC programs to intended implementation principles (Add - ington et al. 2016, 2018; Durbin et al. 2019; Essock and Addington 2018). Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits Use of a CSC program for individual s with a first episode of psychosis can be associated with lower mortality, lower rates of relapse, better quality of life, better global function, and greater likelihood of working or being in school after receiving up to 2 years of treatment (low to moderate strength of research evidence). *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 119 Harms The harms of a CSC program for individuals with a first episode of psychosis are not well delin- eated but are likely to be small. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that many patients with a first epis ode of psychosis are cooperative with and accepting of a CSC program; however, other patients may not wish to take part in such a program out of a belief that they do not have a co ndition that requires treatment or because of lo- gistical barriers that influence their ability to a ccess the more intensive treatment provided by such a program. Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statemen t were viewed as far outweighing the potential harms. CSC treatment programs are generally view ed positively by patients, and they improve a number of patient-oriented outcom es with minimal risk of harms. For additional discussion of the research evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 15. Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members There were no differences of opinion. The writing group voted unanimously in favor of this recom-mendation. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations Other guidelines did not specifically address th e use of CSC programs, but they do endorse many of the individual elements of such programs (e .g., family engagement, psychoeducation, supported employment, medication treatment). Quality Measurement Considerations More patients may benefit from CSC programs in th e United States than currently receive it. Conse- quently, state mental health agencies, health plan s, and health organizations may wish to implement initiatives to increase the use of a CSC program among individuals with a first episode of psychosis. This guideline statement would not be appropriat e for a performance-base d quality measure unless it were tested for feasibility, usability, reliability, and validity. Factors such as geographic variations in treatment availability would need to be considered in testing any quality measures related to CSC pro- gram use. It may also be difficul t to determine whether a patient is receiving appropriate CSC services. Electronic decision support using passive alerts may be able to prompt clinicians to consider re- ferral to a CSC program if the presence of a first episode of schizophrenia and the patient's history of prior treatment were accurately and consistently entered into the electronic record as structured data. The electronic record could also incorporate reference information on the location and referral processes for CSC treatment programs in the local area. STATEMENT 16: Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy APA recommends (1B) that patients with schizophrenia be treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp).* *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. APA Practice Guidelines 120 Implementation The use of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for individuals with schizophrenia has a number of potential benefits, including improv ements in quality of life and global, social, and occupational func- tion and reductions in core symptoms of illness, su ch as positive symptoms. However, it is important to appreciate that these benefits have been found in studies of CBT that is adapted to use for individ-uals with psychosis (CBTp), which has some differ ences from CBT that is focused on other indica- tions. More specifically, CBTp focuses on guiding patients to develo p their own alternative explanations for maladaptive cogn itive assumptions that are health ier and realistic and do not per- petuate the patient's convictions regarding the veraci ty of delusional beliefs or hallucinatory experi- ences. Thus, the overall approach with CBTp incl udes developing a collaborative and nonjudgmental therapeutic relationship in which patients can learn to monitor relationships between thoughts, feel-ings, behaviors, and symptoms and to evaluate th e perceptions, beliefs, and thought processes that contribute to symptoms (Beck and Rector 2005; Be ck et al. et al. 2006; Wright et al. 2009). (Videos that demonstrate some of the approaches to CBTp are available at I Can Feel Better, www.icanfeelbett er .org/cbtpskills.) Through this dual focus on monitoring and evalua tion, patients can develop be neficial coping strategies and improve functioning, with behav- ioral self-monitoring serving as a basis for graded task assignments or activity scheduling. In addi- tion, symptoms can be discussed as being within a range of normal experiences (e.g., hearing a loved one's voice in the context of grief), and al ternative explanations for symptoms can be devel- oped that help reduce associated stress (Turkington et al. 2006). CBTp can be started in any treatment setting, in cluding inpatient settings, and during any phase of illness (Turkington et al. 2006), although some initial reduction in symptoms may be needed for optimal participation (Burns et al. 2014; Valmaggia et al. 2008). It can also be conducted in group as well as in individual formats, either in person or via Web-based delivery platforms. CBTp can also be made available to family members or other persons of support (Turkington and Spencer 2019). Although patient preferences and treatment availabi lity may influence choice of a delivery method, there do not appear to be clear-cut differences in the treatment benefits of group as compared with individual CBTp (McDonagh et al. 2017; Wykes et al. 2008). The duration of treatment with CBTp has varied in research and clinical practice, with a range from 8 weeks to 5 years of treatment reported in the literature (McDonagh et al. 2017). However, guidelines from other countries recommend a mini mum treatment duration of 16 sessions of CBTp (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014; Norman et al. 2017; Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2013). Although the available research suggests that treatment benefits are no longer significant when assessed more than 6 mo nths after the end of a CBTp course (McDonagh et al. 2017), it is unclear whether longer durations of treatment with CBTp will result in greater ben- efits or will help in maintainin g treatment-related improvements. Issues with implementation of CBTp have also been examined. Although the methodological rigor of most studies has been low (Ince et al. 2016) , common barriers to CBTp have been identified. For example, some individuals with schizophrenia may be too symptomatic or are experiencing too many side effects (e.g., sedation) to allow effectiv e participation, particularly in inpatient settings. From a patient-centered perspective, CBTp was so metimes viewed as more emotionally challenging and requiring more effort (e.g., homework) than other psychological therapies (Wood et al. 2015). However, engagement strategies, such as motivation al interviewing, can be useful in helping patients explore whether CBTp might have potential benefits for them that would offset such concerns. Attitudinal barriers of staff and organizational management were also found to be common and included a lack of understanding of CBTp and nega tive expectancies about its value. In addition to inadequate availability of trained staff, staff reported difficulty in identifying patients who were most likely to benefit from CBTp as well as a lack of dedicated time to provide CBTp. Insufficient initial training and insufficient reinforcement of training were also common. Thus, for CBTp to be The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 121 effective, individuals who are providing CBTp shou ld have appropriate trai ning using established approaches, supervision in CBTp techniques, and ex perience in treating in dividuals with schizo- phrenia. In addition, concerted efforts may be need ed to foster positive attitudes and assure ade- quate time to deliver CBTp. At organizational or health system levels, attention to enhancing the availability of CBTp is also important given the li mited availability of CBTp in the United States. Stepped-care approaches, learning collaborative models, and other approaches to best-practice consultations show promise as ways to enhance delivery of CBTp in community settings (Creed et al. 2014; Kopelovich et al. 2019a, 2019b; Stirman et al. 2010). Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits Use of CBTp in the treatment of schizophrenia can be associated with overall reductions in core ill- ness symptoms, such as positive symptoms (moder ate strength of research evidence). CBTp can also be associated with short-term improvements (e.g., for up to 6 months) in quality of life (low strength of research evidence) an d global, social, and occupational function (moderate strength of research evidence). Harms The harms of CBTp in the treatment of schizophreni a are not well delineated or systematically stud- ied but are likely to be small based on the small number of reported harms in clinical trials. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that many patients are cooperative wi th and accepting of CBTp as part of a treatment plan; however, other patients may no t wish to participate in CBTp, may be reluctant to adhere to assignments between sessions, or may experience logistical barriers (e.g., time, access to transportation, childcare, co st) to attending CBTp sessions. Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statemen t were viewed as far outweighing the potential harms. Specifically, the potential fo r modest benefits in important patient-centered outcomes during and for periods of up to 6 months after CBTp treatment seemed to outweigh the minimal harms of CBTp treatment. For additional discussion of the research evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 16. Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members There were no differences of opinion. The writing group voted unanimously in favor of this recom- mendation. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations Statements from other practice guidelines are consistent with this recommendation. The RANZCP and NICE guidelines recommend the use of CBTp for all individuals with schizophrenia (Galletly et al. 2016; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014), whereas the SIGN, CSG, and PORT guidelines recommend CBTp for individuals who have persistent symptoms despite treat- ment with an antipsychotic medication (Dixon et al. 2010; Norman et al. 2017; Scottish Intercolle- giate Guidelines Network 2013). The NICE, SIGN, and CSG guidelines note that CBTp should include at least 16 planned sessions (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014; Norman et al. 2017; Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2013). APA Practice Guidelines 122 Quality Measurement Considerations This guideline statement may not be appropriate for a performance-based quality measure because of the impact of logistical barriers to CBTp, includ ing geographic variations in availability of CBTp, and the difficulty in identifying whether delivered psychotherapy is CBTp. Reminders about CBTp are also not well suited to incorporation into elec tronic health record clinical decision support. An- ecdotal observations suggest that use of CBTp is infrequent in the United States (Kopelovich et al. 2019b). Consequently, health organizations and he alth plans may wish to implement programs to increase the use of CBTp among individuals with schizophrenia. STATEMENT 17: Psychoeducation APA recommends (1B) that patients with schizoph renia receive psychoeducation.* Implementation Elements of psychoeducation are an integral part of good clinical prac tice. For example, APA's Prac- tice Guidelines for the Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults emphasizes the importance of involving patients in treatment-related decision-making and recommen ds providing the patient with education about the differential diagnosis, risks of untreated illness, treatment options, and benefits and risks of treat-ment (American Psychiatric Associ ation 2016a). In addition, these in formal approaches to psycho- education have been expanded into formal, system atically delivered programs of psychoeducation that have been evaluated through clinical trials (Pekkala and Merinder 2002; Xia et al. 2011). The psychoeducational programs that have been studied have varied in their format, duration, and scope. Some psychoeducational programs are de livered on an individual basis, whereas others are delivered in a group format, often in conjun ction with family members or other individuals who are involved in the patient's life. In clinical trials, a 12-session program of psychoeducation is the norm; however, briefer psychoeducation programs of 10 sessions or fewer have also been stud - ied (Pekkala and Merinder 2002; Xia et al. 2011). Ty pically, psychoeducation is conducted on an out - patient basis, but elements of formal psychoeducation programs can also be incorporated into care in inpatient settings. Information that is commonly conveyed in a psychoeducation program includes key informa- tion about diagnosis, symptoms, psychosocial interventions, medications, and side effects as well as information about stress and coping, crisis pl ans, early warning signs, and suicide and relapse prevention (B\u00e4uml et al. 2006). Teaching of il lness management or self-management strategies (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Admi nistration 2010a), as discussed in Statement 21, is often incorporated into psychoeducation. In addition to conveying empathy and respect for the in-dividual, psychoeducation is delivered in a manner that aims to stimulate hope, reassurance, resil- ience, and empowerment. Typically, psychoeducation incorporates multiple educational modalities, such as workbooks (McCrary et al. 2019), pamphlet s, videos, and individual or group discussions in achieving the goals of psychoeducation. Information that may be useful to patients and families as a part of psychoeducation is available through SMI Adviser (https://smiadviser.org). Barriers to providing psychoeducation as a part of the treatmen t plan relate primarily to program availability. Online delivery of psychoeducation may be one approach to enhancing availability. *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 123 Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits Use of psychoeducation in the treatment of schizophrenia can be associated with a number of po- tential benefits, including improvements in global function (low strength of research evidence) and reductions in relapse rates (moderate strength of research evidence). Enhancements in treatment adherence and improved satisfaction with mental health services have also been noted in some studies. Harms The harms of psychoeducation are likely to be mini mal on the basis of results from clinical trials that show no differences in the rate of harms experienced by individuals treated with psychoedu- cation as compared with usual care (low strength of research evidence). Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that most patients are interested in receiving information about their diagnosis and potential treatments as part of thei r care. In addition, most patients are accepting of more formal and systematic approaches to psyc hoeducation. However, some patients may not wish to participate in psychoeducation or may ex perience logistical barriers (e.g., time, access to transportation, childcare, costs) in attending psychoeducation sessions. Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statemen t were viewed as far outweighing the potential harms. Specifically, any minimal harms of psychoed ucation seem to be outweighed by the potential for modest benefits in important patient-centered outcomes such as improv ements in global func- tion and reductions in relapse rates. For additional discussion of the research evidence, see Appen- dix C, Statement 17 . Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members There were no differences of opinion. The writing group voted unanimously in favor of this recom-mendation. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations Guidelines from other organizations, including CSG, RANZCP , and SIGN, note the value of psy - choeducation for individuals with schizophrenia, including information about diagnosis (Galletly et al. 2016; Norman et al. 2017; Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2013). Quality Measurement Considerations This guideline statement may not be appropriate for a performance-based quality measure because of the diversity of psychoeducational approaches and services and uncertainty regarding linking specific patient needs for psychoeducation with ma rkers of delivery of psychoeducation. Remind- ers about psychoeducation are also not well suited to incorporation into electronic health record clinical decision support. However, health organizations and health plans may wish to implement quality improvement efforts to increase the use of formal psychoeducational programs among in - dividuals with schizophrenia. APA Practice Guidelines 124 STATEMENT 18: Supported Employment Services APA recommends (1B) that patients with schizophreni a receive supported employment ser- vices.* Implementation Supported employment differs from other vocational rehabilitation services in providing assistance in searching for and maintaining competitive employment concurrently with job training, embed- ded job support, and mental health treatment (B ecker and Drake 2003; Frederick and VanderWeele 2019; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2010b). In contrast, other voca- tional rehabilitation approaches focus on training before plac ement and put greater emphasis on placement in sheltered and transi tional employment rather than in a competitive employment set- ting (Marino and Dixon 2014). For individuals whose goals are related to educational advancement prior to pursuit of employment, supported educational services may also be pursued (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Serv ices Administration 2012b). Of approaches to supported employment, the bulk of studies involve individual placement and support (IPS; Becker and Drake 2003; Frederick an d VanderWeele 2019; McDonagh et al. 2017; Sub- stance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administ ration 2010b). In addition to a focus on rapid attainment of competitive employ ment, IPS emphasizes patient preferences in the types of jobs sought, the nature of the services that are delivere d, and the outreach that occurs with potential em- ployers (Marino and Dixon 2014). Patient preferences also guide whether to disclose the presence of a psychiatric illness to the employer, with more than half of individuals choosing to disclose this information (DeTore et al. 2019). Services are offere d to anyone who is interested, with no exclusion criteria for participation. Additional principles of IPS include individualized long-term job support and integration of employment specialists with th e clinical team. Employment specialists also de - velop relationships with communi ty employers and provide personalized benefits counseling to participants. Evidence consistently shows that supported employ ment is associated with greater rates of com- petitive employment than transitional employment or prevocational training, although prevoca- tional training is superior to no vocational intervention at all (Marshall et al. 2014; McDonagh et al. 2017; Metcalfe et al. Hoffmann 2019; Suijkerbuijk et al. 2017). Augmenting supported employment with symptom-related skills tr aining, training in workplace fundamentals, or cognitive training may assist in gaining and maintaining competitive employ- ment (Dewa et al. 2018; Suijkerbuijk et al. 2017) Other benefits of suppo rted employment include greater number of hours worked per week, a longer du ration of each job, a longer duration of total employment, and an increase in earnings (McDonagh et al. 2017). Individuals receiving supported employment are also more likely to obtain job- related accommodations th an individuals with men- tal illness who are not receiving supported employment (McDowell and Fossey 2015). Such accom- modations typically relate to assistance from the supported employme nt coach but may also include flexible scheduling, reduced hours, modified job duties, and modified training and super-vision. In addition to job-related benefits of su pported employment, there is some evidence of mod- est reductions in symptoms and a reduced risk of hospitalization associated with obtaining a job (Bouwmans et al. 2015; Burns et al. 2007; Charzy ska et al. 2015; Hoffmann et al. 2014; Luciano et al. 2014). Among individuals who receive supported employme nt, factors that may be associated with a greater likelihood of success include lower levels of symptoms, higher levels of cognitive function- *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 125 ing (e.g., attention, memory, executive functioning, psychomotor speed), greater work success in the past, higher levels of educational attainme nt, and greater interest in obtaining employment (Kirsh 2016). Peer support and support from families and others in the patient's social network may also be associated with better outcomes, although these factors ha ve been less well studied (Kirsh 2016). Even when individuals do not experience initial success with supported employment, addi- tion of cognitive remediation may improve vo cational outcomes (McGurk et al. 2015, 2016). There are a number of barriers to supported employment, including economic and regulatory fac- tors (Kirsh 2016; Metcalfe et al. 2018; Modini et al. 2016) and the limited number of available programs (Marshall et al. 2014; Sherman et al. 2017). Although data are limited, empl oyers may be reluctant to participate in supported employment out of concern about the impact of providing work-related ac- commodations and because of discrimination and bi as toward individuals with serious mental illness (Kirsh 2016). Treating clinicians may also serve as a barrier by having in appropriately limited ex- pectations (Kirsh 2016) and being unaware that some individuals with schizophrenia are able to function at high levels of occupa tional achievement (Cohen et al. 2017). In addition, concerns about losing disability benefits or health insurance ma y lead some individuals to forgo supported em- ployment opportunities (Kirsh 2016). Such concerns are not entirely unrealis tic because many of the competitive jobs that individuals do obtain are entry-level and/or part-time positions without health insurance benefits (Kir sh 2016). Within supported employ ment programs, organizational barriers to success have included poor fidelity to supported employment principles (Marshall et al. 2014); insufficient time devoted to leading and management of the programs; and insufficient train-ing, skills, and business and public relations knowledge of program staff (Kirsh 2016; Swanson et al. 2013). Each of these barriers is important to ad dress at individual, systems, and policy levels so that more patients can benefit from supported employment interventions. For clinicians and organizations wishing to learn more about supported employment or develop supported employment programs, additional in formation is available through SMI Adviser (https://smiadviser.org) , NAVIGATE (https://navigateconsul tants.or g/manuals), and the Boston University Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation (https://cpr.bu.edu ). Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits Use of supported employment as part of the treatm ent of schizophrenia can be associated with sig- nificantly better employment outcomes, including a significantly greater likelihood of obtaining competitive employment, a significantly greater likelihood of working more than 20 hours per week, more weeks of employment, and greater earnings relative to vocational training or no voca - tional interventions (moderate strength of research evidence). Harms The harms of supported employment in the treatment of schizophrenia are not well delineated or systematically reported bu t are likely to be small. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that few patients are currently receiving supported employment, but a significant number of individuals ma y be interested in supported employment if it were readily avail- able and offered to them. However, some individuals may be in scho ol, have responsibilities at home, or already be employed. Others would rather not seek employment or may have concerns about losses of benefits or health insurance if they did pursue competitive employment. Logistical barriers (e.g., ac- cess to transportation, childcare) may also affect pa tient preferences related to supported employment. APA Practice Guidelines 126 Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statemen t were viewed as far outweighing the potential harms. Specifically, the potential for benefits in important patient-centered outcomes related to em- ployment seemed to outweigh the minimal harm s of supported employme nt programs. For addi- tional discussion of the research evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 18. Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members There were no differences of opinion. The writing group voted unanimously in favor of this recom- mendation. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations Guidelines from other organizations are generally consistent with this recommendation. NICE and PORT recommend that supported employment be offered to individuals with schizophrenia who wish to find or return to work (Dixon et al. 2 010; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014), and RANZCP recommends IPS services for individuals with first-episode psychosis (Galletly et al. 2016). RANZCP , NICE, and CSG also emphas ize the appropriateness of other occupational or educational activities for individuals with schizoph renia (Galletly et al. 2016; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014; Norman et al. 2017). Quality Measurement Considerations This guideline statement may not be appropriate for a performance-based quality measure because of the barriers to supported employment, including variations in availability, and difficulty identi- fying when patients desire competitive employ ment. Reminders about supported employment are also not well suited to incorporation into electr onic health record clinical decision support. How- ever, given the infrequent availabi lity of supported employment in the United States, health orga - nizations and health plans may wish to implem ent programs to increase the use of supported employment among individu als with schizophrenia. STATEMENT 19: Assertive Community Treatment APA recommends (1B) that patients with schizophrenia receive assertive community treat- ment if there is a history of poor engagement with services leading to frequent relapse or social disruption (e.g., homelessness; lega l difficulties, including imprisonment). * Implementation ACT , sometimes referred to as programs of as sertive community treatment, is a multidisci- plinary, team-based approa ch in which care outside a formal clin- ical setting. Thus, individuals may be engaged in their homes, workplaces, or other community locations. Continuity of care is enhanced becaus e individuals work with an assigned team, which has 24/7 availability, rather than being assigned to a designated clinician for care. Team members typically include a psychiatrist, nu rse, and social worker or case manager. Peer specialists, voca- tional specialists, and clinicians with expertise in substance use treatment are often part of the team as well. Other features of ACT include its provision of pers onalized and flexible care that addresses the pa- tient's needs and preferences without time limits or ot her constraints on services. Particularly in rural *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 127 areas, some ACT teams are augmenting face-to-face visits with telepsychiatry visits, although re - search will be needed to determine whether such an approach alters the benefits of ACT (Swanson and Trestman 2018). ACT teams also work with a smaller number of individuals than traditional outpatient clinicians or case managers do, which contributes to the ability to provide frequent visits and a more personalized and comprehensive approach to care. For these reasons, ACT is often used in individuals who have a history of poor engageme nt with services that leads to frequent relapse or social disruption (e.g., homelessness; legal diff iculties, including imprisonment), although it can also be used for individuals who are better engaged but still have high rates of service utilization. Many individuals who are referred for ACT are al so at risk for poor adherence and may benefit from consideration of an LAI antips ychotic medication (see Statement 10). Studies of ACT suggest that it is associated with symptom improvement comparable to other treatment delivery approaches and that individual s who receive ACT are more likely to be domi- ciled, living independently, and working and less likely to be hospitalized as compared with indi - viduals who receive treatment as usual (McDonagh et al. 2017). Although ACT has multiple strengths that would make it an attractive approa ch in individuals with co-occurring disorders and schizophrenia, the impact of ACT on physical heal th has not been well studied (Vanderlip et al. 2017). Also, in individuals with a concomitant su bstance use disorder, research to date has not shown associated improvements in functioning, mortality, or substanc e use as compared with usual care (McDonagh et al. 2017). In terms of implementation barriers, there is often limited availability of ACT programs. Fund - ing these programs can be challenging because the comprehensive and multidisciplinary nature of ACT services is not well aligned with payment mo dels in the U.S. health care delivery system (Monroe-DeVita et al. 2012) . Effective delivery of ACT services is also dependent on having a high level of fidelity to ACT program standards (Monro e-DeVita et al. 2012; Th orning et al. 2016), and this requires considerable training as well as ongoing mentoring, collaboration, and consultation with individuals who are skilled in ACT implem entation. Attention to outcomes and organiza- tional culture is also important in providing a te am-based approach that is warm, flexible, prag- matic, collaborative, and supportive of patients' recovery (Monroe-DeVita et al. 2012). For organi- zations or state mental health systems that are implementing ACT programs, a number of resources are available (Center for Evidence-Based Practi ces 2019; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Ser- vices Administration 2008; Thorning et al. 2016). Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits Use of ACT in the treatment of schizophrenia can be associated with a number of benefits as com- pared with treatment as usual, including a greater likelihood of being domiciled, living inde - pendently, or working and a lower likelihood of being hospitalized (low to moderate strength of research evidence). Harms The harms of ACT in the treatment of schizophreni a are not well delineated but are likely to be small. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that most patients are cooperative with and accepting of ACT, partic- ularly once they have engaged wi th treatment. In some circumstan ces, patients may be reluctant to accept ACT services because of impaired awareness of a need for treatment. In this context, ACT may be used as one component of court-mandated care (e.g., assisted outpatient treatment, com- APA Practice Guidelines 128 munity treatment order, outpatient commitment). However, in the few studies that have examined patient perceptions, ACT is generally viewed as supporting patients and building relationships in a recovery-oriented fashion (Appelbaum and Le Melle 2008; Morse et al. 2016). Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statemen t were viewed as far outweighing the potential harms. ACT is generally viewed positively by patients, and it improves a number of patient-oriented outcomes with minimal risk of harm s.

The writing group voted unanimously in favor of this recom-mendation. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations This guideline recommendation is consistent with the SIGN recommendation to offer assertive out- reach to individuals with schizophrenia who \"mak e high use of inpatient services, who show re - sidual psychotic symptoms and who have a history of poor engagement with services leading to frequent relapse and/or social breakdown (for example homelessness)\" (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2013, p. 8). The PORT guideline also notes that ACT should be included in sys - tems of care that serve individuals with schizophrenia and that it \"should be provided to individ- uals who are at risk for repeated hospitalizations or have recent homelessness\" (Dixon et al. 2010, p. 49). In addition, RANZCP recommends the use of ACT \"after initial contact, during crises and after discharge from hospital\" in individuals wi th schizophrenia (Galletly et al. 2016, p. 29). Quality Measurement Considerations This guideline statement may not be appropriate for a performance-based quality measure because of the impact of logistical barriers to ACT, including geographic variations in availability. Remind - ers about ACT are also not well suited to incorporat ion into electronic health record clinical deci - sion support because of the multip le patient-specific fa ctors that may contribute to a decision to recommend ACT. However, anecdotal observations suggest that more patients may benefit from ACT in the United States than currently receive it. Consequently, state mental health agencies, health plans, and health organizations may wish to implement programs to increase the use of ACT among individuals with schizophrenia who have ha d a history of poor engagement with services, leading to frequent relapse or social disruption (e.g., homelessness; legal difficulties, including im - prisonment). STATEMENT 20: Family Interventions APA suggests (2B) that patients with schizophrenia who have ongoing contact with family receive family interventions.* Implementation An important aspect of good psychiatric treatmen t is involvement of family members, person(s) of support, and other individuals who play a key role in the patient's life. In addition to spouses, par- *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 129 ents, children, or other biological or nonbiological relatives, such individuals may include people who reside with the patient, intimate partners, and close friends who are an integral part of the pa- tient's support network. Such individuals benefit from discussion of such topics as diagnosis and management of schizophrenia, types of support that are available, and ways to plan for and access help in a crisis. Other goals include helping indivi duals repair or strengthen their connections with family members and other members of their support system. Family interventions are systematically delivered, extend beyond conveying of information, and focus on the future rather than on past events (M ueser et al. 2013). The family interventions that are suggested in this guideline statement go beyond the basics of family involvement and illness edu-cation that are important for good clinical care. They may include structured approaches to prob- lem-solving, training in how to cope with illness symptoms, a ssistance with improving family communication, provision of emotional support, and strategies for reducing stress and enhancing social support networks (McDonagh et al. 2017; McFarlane 2016; Mues er et al. 2013). Family inter- ventions can be particularly important early in the course of schizophrenia (McFarlane 2016) but can also be helpful during any phase of treatment. Most patients want family to be involved in th eir treatment (Cohen et al. 2013). Nevertheless, even when a patient does not wish for a specific pers on to be involved in his or her care, the clinician may listen to information provided by that individual, as long as confidential information is not pro- vided to the informant (American Psychiatric Associ ation 2016a). Although some health profession- als may be unsure about legal or regulatory aspe cts of sharing informatio n, general information that is not specific to the patient can be provid ed (e.g., common approaches to treatment, general information about medications and their side effe cts, available support and emergency assistance). Also, to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent thre at to the health or safety of the patient or oth- ers, the \"Principles of Medical Ethics\" (American Psyc hiatric 2013f) and HIPAA (Office for Civil Rights 2017a, 2017b) permit clinicians to disclose necessary information about a patient to family members, caregivers, law enforcement, or other persons involved with the patient. HIPAA also permits health care providers to disclose necessary information to the patient's family, friends, or other persons involved in the patient's care or payment for care when such disclosure is judged to be in the best interests of the patient and the pa tient is not present or is unable to agree or object to a disclosure because of incapacity or emerge ncy circumstances (Office for Civil Rights 2017b). The family interventions that ha ve been studied include a vari ety of formats and approaches (McDonagh et al. 2017; McFarlane 2016). Interventi ons may or may not include the patient and can be conducted with a single family or a multifamil y group. In many early studies, family interven- tions included the patient and were led by a member of the patient's clinical care team. This ap- proach allowed a liaison to develop among the care team, the patient, members of the family, and other person(s) of support. Other studies have been conducted independent of the patient's care team. In terms of approach, some family interven tions focus on psychoeducation, whereas other in- terventions incorporate other treatment elements (e.g ., motivational interviewing, goal setting, cog- nitive-behavioral intervention, behavioral fam ily therapy, support groups, social network development, communication training, role-playing, stress management, relaxation training). Given the diversity of options for family interventi ons, the selection of a specific approach should consider the preferences of the patient and family in collaboration with the clinician. Benefits of family interventions include reductions in core symptoms of illness and reductions in relapses, including rehospitalization (McDonagh et al. 2017). Some studies have also shown ben-efits for family members such as reductions in levels of burden and distress or improvements in re- lationships among family members (McFarlane 2 016; Sin et al. 2017a). Evidence suggests that benefits of family interventions are greatest when more than 10 treatment sessions are delivered over a period of at least 7 months (McDonagh et al. 2017). However, the Family-to-Family interven- tion available through the National Alliance on Me ntal Illness has shown significant benefits using a 12-week program consisting of weekly sessions of 2-3 hours each (Dixon et al. 2011; Lucksted et al. 2013; Marcus et al. 2013; Toohey et al. 2016). APA Practice Guidelines 130 A common barrier to implementing family interv entions relates to program availability. How- ever, guidance is available on developing family intervention programs focused on psychoeduca - tion (Glynn et al. 2014; Substance Abuse and Ment al Health Services Administration 2009). In addition, the National Alliance on Mental Illne ss has reduced this barrier through its Family-to- Family program, which has led to a significant expansion in the availability of family interventions (National Alliance on Mental Illn ess 2019b). Additional barriers include constraints of family mem- bers (e.g., work schedules, access to transportati on, childcare, health issu es) that may limit their ability to be involved in frequent family sessions . Similar logistical barrie rs can exist for patients when family interventions incorp orate patient participation. Othe r implementation barriers in- clude organizational and clinician-focused barriers such as time and cost constraints and insuffi- cient understanding of the potential benefits of family intervention (Ince et al. 2016). Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits Use of family interventions in th e treatment of schizophrenia can re duce the likelihood of relapse (low to moderate strength of research evidence) and reduce core illness symptoms (low strength of research evidence). Harms The harms of family interventions in the treatmen t of schizophrenia are not well documented but appear to be minimal. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that many patients are cooperative with and accepting of family inter- ventions as part of a treatment plan; however, othe r patients may have had difficulties in relation- ships with family members in the past and may no t want family members to be involved in their treatment. Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statement were viewed as likely to outweigh the potential harms. For patients who have ongoing contact with their families, including relatives and signifi - cant others, there are distinct benefits to family interventions. However, some patients may not be in favor of family involvement even when they do have some ongoing contact with family mem- bers, and, for this reason, the statement was suggested rather than being recommended for all in- dividuals. For additional discussion of the research evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 20. Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members Eight writing group members voted in favor of this suggestion. One writing group member dis - agreed with this statement as wo rded and felt that it would be preferable for the guideline state- ment to make specific mention of other persons of support who may be involved with the patient and are commonly included in such interv entions in addition to family members. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations This guideline statement is consistent with guidelines from other or ganizations. CSG, NICE, RANZCP , SIGN, and PORT guidelines all recommend offering family interventions when an individ- ual with schizophrenia reside with or are in close contact with family (Dixon et al. 2010; Galletly et The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 131 al. 2016; National Institute for Health and Care Ex cellence 2014; Norman et al. 2017; Scottish Inter- collegiate Guidelines Network 2013). These guide lines also emphasize the importance of providing information to family and others involved in the pa tient's care on such topi cs as diagnosis and man- agement of schizophrenia, types of support that ar e available, and ways to access help in a crisis. Quality Measurement Considerations As a suggestion, this guideline statement is not appropriate for use as a performance-based quality measure or for incorporation into electronic de cision support. Nevertheless, given the potential benefits of this approach, health care organizatio ns and health plans may wish to track the avail- ability and utilization of family interventions. STATEMENT 21: Self-Management Skills and Recovery-Focused Interventions APA suggests (2C) that patients with schizophrenia receive intervention s aimed at devel- oping self-management skills and e nhancing person-oriented recovery. * Implementation Illness self-management training programs have been applied to help ad dress many chronic con- ditions and are designed to improve knowledge about one's illness and management of symptoms (Grady and Gough 2014). Goals include reducing the risk of relapse, recognizing signs of relapse, developing a relapse prevention plan, and enhancin g coping skills to address persistent symptoms, with the aim of improving quality of life and social and occupational functioning. In the studies in- cluded in the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017), self-management training was generally deliv-ered in a group setting with sessions of 45-90 minu tes each, and the number of intervention sessions ranged from 7 to 48 sessions. However, the evidence suggested better outcomes in patients who par-ticipated in at least 10 self-management interventi on sessions. Self-management sessions were typi- cally facilitated by clinicians, although peer-facilit ated sessions have also been used. In addition, some studies have used individually targeted interv entions, either face-to-fa ce or via computer-based formats (Lean et al. 2019). Self-management approach es have also been used to address co-occurring medical conditions in individuals with serious mental illness, including schizophrenia, with benefits that included increased patient ac tivation and improved health-related quality of life (Druss et al. 2010; Goldberg et al. 2013; Muralidharan et al. 2019). Recovery-focused interventions have also been de veloped that focus on fostering self-determination in relation to a patient's personal goals, needs, and strengths. Such approaches may include ele- ments of self-management skill development, psyc hoeducation, and peer-based interventions but also include components and activities that allow participants to share experiences and receive sup- port, learn and practice strategies for success, an d identify and take steps toward reaching personal goals. Studies of peer-based interventions are limi ted (Castelein et al. 2015; Chien et al. 2019), and studies of recovery-focused interventions have al so been small in number. Nevertheless, the avail - able information suggests that these interventions may promote increased recovery, hope, and em- powerment among individuals with serious mental illn esses (Le Boutillier et al. 2011; Mueser et al. 2013; Thomas et al. 2018). The most common barrier to impl ementing this guideline statemen t is the availability of programs for developing self-management s kills and enhancing person-oriented recovery. However, a toolkit for developing illness management and recovery-based programs in mental health is available through the *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia.

Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits Use of interventions aimed at developing self-management skills and enhancing person-oriented recovery in individuals with schizophrenia can be associated with reductions in symptom severity and risk of relapse and an increased sense of hope and empowerment (low to moderate strength of research evidence). Self-managem ent approaches that are aimed at addressing co-occurring medi- cal conditions in individuals with serious mental illness also have benefits that include increased patient activation and improved health-related quality of life. Harms The harms of interventions aimed at developing self-management sk ills and enhancing person-oriented recovery in the treatment of schizophrenia are not well studied but are likely to be minimal. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that most patients ar e cooperative with and accepting of interventions aimed at developing self-management skills and enhancing person-oriented recovery. However, some patients may not wish to take part in such interventions because of personal preferences or logistical barriers to attending group sessions (e.g., access to transportation, childcare).

Nevertheless, given the potential ben- The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 133 efits of such interventions, health care organizati ons and health plans may wish to track the availabil- ity and utilization of programs to develop self -management skills and enhance person-oriented recovery. STATEMENT 22: Cognitive Remediation APA suggests (2C) that patients with schizophreni a receive cognitive remediation.* Implementation Cognitive remediation approaches are intended to address cognitive difficulties that can accom- pany schizophrenia, with the aim of enhancing func tion and quality of life. A number of different cognitive remediation approaches have been used, typically in group or computer-based formats, in an effort to enhance cognitiv e processes such as attention, memory, executive function, social cognition, or meta-cognition (D elahunty and et al. 2016; Wykes et al. 2011). Some programs have focused on improving cognitive flexibility (e.g., shifting cognitive sets), working memory (e.g., sequenci ng, multitasking, delayed recall), and planning (e.g., sequencing and chunking, active coding), whereas meta-cognitive approaches have at- tempted to teach patients how and when particular strategies that bypass specific cognitive limita- tions can be used. Some programs add aspects of social and communication skills to neurocognitive elements of remediation (Pentaraki et al. 2017). Although this variability in program format and co ntent confounds interpretation of the evidence, cognitive remediation does seem to result in improvements in cogn ition, symptoms, and function in individuals with schizophrenia, at least on a shor t-term basis (Harvey et al. 2018; McDonagh et al. 2017; Revell et al. 2015). Although long-term follow-up studies of cognitive remediation are not available in individuals with schizophrenia, data from healthy older individuals show long-term improvements as a result of cognitive training (Rebok et al. 2014). Beneficial effects on psychosocial outcomes seem particularly robust when cognitive remediation is used as a component of or ad- junct to other forms of psychiatri c rehabilitation rather than being delivered as a stand-alone inter- vention (McGurk et al. 2007; van Duin et al. 2019; Wykes et al. 2011). However, some apparent improvements in cognitive performa nce may result from practicing specific tasks and may not produce generalizable changes in other contexts. Furthermore, the specific elements of a particular cognitive remediation program may influence the benefits that are observed (Cella and Wykes 2019). The primary barriers to use of cognitive remediation are related to program availability. Online delivery of cognitive remediation may be one wa y to overcome these barriers. Information and training on developing cognitive remediation prog rams are available (Medalia 2019; Medalia et al. 2018). In addition, Web-based programs have been used in clinical trials and may provide options for patients without access to in-person cognitive remediation programs (Jahshan et al. 2019; Kukla et al. 2018). Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits Use of cognitive remediation is associated with mo derate improvements in specific aspects of cog- nition (Harvey et al. 2018; Wykes et al. 2011) as well as small positive effects on social, occupational, *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia.

Harms The harms of cognitive remediation in the treatmen t of schizophrenia are not well studied but are likely to be small. Patient Preferences Evidence from research trials suggests that patients are likely to be cooperative with and accepting of cognitive remediation as part of a treatment plan (Reeder et al. 2016); however, other patients may not wish to participate because of logistical barriers (e.g., time, cost, access to transportation, childcare). Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statement were viewed as likely to outweigh the potential harms, which were viewed as minimal. Differences in patient preferences, variability in the appro- priateness of cognitive remediation for individuals with schizophrenia, and the unclear durability of benefits led to suggesting cognitive remediat ion rather than recommen ding it. For additional discussion of the research evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 22. Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members There were no differences of opinion. The writing group voted unanimously in favor of this suggestion. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations The RANZCP guideline recommends that cognitive remediation be available to individuals with schizophrenia if cognitive impairment is present and should be specifically \"offered when cogni- tive deficits are affecting recovery and function \" (Galletly et al. 2016, p. 20). The SIGN and CSG guidelines note that cognitive remediation \"may be considered for individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia who have persisting problems associ ated with cognitive difficulties\" (Norman et al. 2017, p. 621; Scottish Intercollegiat e Guidelines Network 2013, p. 28). Quality Measurement Considerations As a suggestion, this guideline statement is not appropriate for use as a performance-based quality measure or for incorporation into electronic decision support. STATEMENT 23: Social Skills Training APA suggests (2C) that patients with schizophrenia who have a therapeutic goal of en- hanced social functioning re ceive social skills training.* Implementation Social skills training in the treatment of schizoph renia can improve social fu nction, core illness symp- toms, and negative symptoms more than usual care can (McDonagh et al. 2017). Reductions in relapse rates, including rehospitalization ra tes, have also been noted in some studies (McDonagh et al. 2017). *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 135 Social skills training has an overarching goal of improving interpersonal and social skills but can be delivered using a number of approaches (Almerie et al. 2015; Kopelowicz et al. 2006; Turner et al. 2018). These cognitive- behavioral, social-cognitive, inte rpersonal, and functional adap- tive skills training. Social skills training is de livered in a group format and includes homework as- signments to facilitate skill acquisition. Other spec ific elements of the intervention will vary with the theoretical emphasis of the trai ning. However, examples of techni ques that can be used in social skills training include role-playing, modeling, an d feedback approaches to enhance interpersonal interactions; behaviorally oriented exercises in assertiveness, appropriate contextual responses, and verbal and nonverbal communication; and instruction and practice with social and emotional perceptions (Almerie et al. 2015; Kopelowicz et al . 2006; Turner et al. 2018). These techniques are aimed at generating improvements in typical social behaviors such as making eye contact, smiling at appropriate times, actively listening to others, and sustaining conversations. In some social skills training programs, group sessions are augmente d with video or techno logically based interven- tions, in vivo community trips to practice social skills (Glynn et al. 2002; Mu eser et al. 2010), and involvement of support people who are accessible, pleasant, and knowledgeable about the local en-vironments' resources and limitations (Mue ser et al. 2010; Tauber et al. 2000). As with other psychosocial interven tions, availability of social skills training is a common barrier to its incorporation into treatment. However, information about social skills training is available for organizations that wish to develop such programs (Bellack and Goldberg 2019; Bellack et al. 2004; Granholm et al. 2016). Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits Social skills training in the treatment of schizo phrenia can improve social function, core illness symptoms, and negative symptoms more than usual care can (low strength of research evidence). Harms The harms of social skills traini ng in the treatment of schizophrenia have not been well documented but appear to be minimal. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that many patients are cooperative wi th and accepting of social skills training as part of a treatment plan ; however, other patients may not wi sh to take part in social skills training because of logistical barriers (e.g., time, cost, access to transportation, childcare) or having goals for treatment that are unrelated to social skills. Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statement were viewed as likely to outweigh the potential harms. Although the harms appear to be minimal, there is a low strength of research evidence for benefits, and patient preferences may differ in terms of desiring to focus on social skills as a part of treatment. Consequently, this guideline statement was rated as a suggestion. For additional discus- sion of the research evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 23. Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members There were no differences of opinion. The writing group voted unanimously in favor of this sug- gestion. APA Practice Guidelines 136 Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations Other guidelines are generally consistent with this guideline statement. The PORT, RANZCP , CSG, and SIGN guidelines suggest offering social skills training to individuals with schizophrenia who have deficits in social skills (B uchanan et al. 2010; Galletly et al . 2016; Norman et al. 2017; Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Netw ork 2013). However, the NICE guid eline notes that social skills training should not be routinely offered to individuals with schizophrenia (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014). Quality Measurement Considerations As a suggestion, this guideline st atement is not appropriate for us e as a performance-based quality measure or for incorporation into electronic decisi on support. Nevertheless, given the potential ben- efits of such an approach for so me patients, health care organizations and health plans may wish to track the availability and utilization of social skills training for individuals with schizophrenia. STATEMENT 24: Supportive Psychotherapy APA suggests (2C) that patients with schizophrenia be treated with supportive psychotherapy. * Implementation Supportive psychotherapy is comm only a part of the treatment plan in individuals with schizo- phrenia who are not receiving other modes of psychotherapy (e.g., CBTp). Because the evidence re- lated to its benefits is limited, supportive psychotherapy should not take precedence over other evidence-based psychosocial treatments (e.g., CS C, CBTp, psychoeducation). When compared with treatment as usual, no advantage was seen for supp ortive psychotherapy in terms of global or so - cial function (L. A. Buckley et al. 2015; McDonagh et al. 2017); however, thes e findings are difficult to interpret given the frequent use of supportive psychotherapy techniques as part of usual care. When compared with insight-oriented psychotherapies, a small number of early studies suggested that supportive psychotherapy might be associated with better outcomes in coping skills, adher- ence, and relapse (Fenton 2000; Hogarty et al. 1997; Stanton et al. 1984). The focus of supportive psychotherapy is realit y based and present centered (Kates and Rockland 1994; Novalis et al. 1993; Winston 2014; Winston et al. 2012). It commonly aims to help patients cope with symptoms, improve adaptive skills, and enhance self-esteem, although descriptions of the goals of supportive psychotherapy have varied. Examples of techniques used to foster these goals style of communica tion. Many of the com- mon elements that have been identified in effective psychotherapies, including a positive therapeutic alliance, are also integral to su pportive psychotherapy (Frank and Frank 1991; Wampold 2015). Typically, supportive psychotherap y is conducted in conj unction with medication management at a frequency that can vary from weekly to every few months depending on the needs of the individual patient. Ot her psychosocial treatments can also be used as part of the treat- ment plan in conjunction with these modalities. *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 137 Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Guideline Statement Benefits Use of supportive psychotherapy in the treatment of schizophrenia was not as sociated with relative benefits in global or social function as compared with treatment as usual (low strength of research evidence). However, treatment as usual already incorporates supportive psychotherapy under most circumstances. In addition, clinical experi ence suggests that supportive psychotherapy may be associated with such benefits as strengthen ing the therapeutic allianc e, reducing demoraliza- tion, and developing practical coping strategies in the treatment of individuals with schizophrenia. Harms The harms of using supportive psychotherapy in the treatment of schizophrenia appear to be small, although evidence is limited. However, if suppor tive psychotherapy is used preferentially instead of a treatment that is associated with more robust evidence of benefit, there may be indirect nega- tive effects. Patient Preferences Clinical experience suggests that most patients are cooperative with and accepting of supportive psychotherapy as part of a treatment plan, even when they are reluctant to engage in other psycho- social interventions. However, some patients ma y not wish to engage in psychotherapy or may have logistical barriers (e.g., time, access to tran sportation, financial considerations) that make it difficult to attend psychotherapy sessions. Balancing of Bene fits and Harms The potential benefits of this guideline statement were viewed as likely to outweigh the potential harms. In clinical practice, the use of supportive psychotherapy is commonplace as part of the treat- ment of schizophrenia, which makes it challengin g to interpret the research comparisons of sup- portive psychotherapy versus treatment as usua l. Given the limited evidence of any harms of supportive psychotherapy, the potential benefits of supportive psychotherapy appear to be greater than the harms. For additional di scussion of the research evidence, see Appendix C, Statement 24. Differences of Opinion Am ong Writing Group Members There were no differences of opinion. The writing group voted unanimously in favor of this sug-gestion. Review of Available Guidelin es From Other Organizations The NICE guideline notes that supportive psychoth erapy should not be offered routinely to indi - viduals with schizophrenia if othe r psychosocial treatments that ha ve greater efficacy are available (National Institute for Health an d Care Excellence 2014 ). However, the NICE guideline also notes that patient preferences should be taken into acco unt, particularly if other psychosocial interven- tions are not available locally. Quality Measurement Considerations As a suggestion, this guideline statement is not appropriate for use as a performance-based quality measure or for incorporation into electronic decision support. APA Practice Guidelines 138 Areas for Further Research in Individuals With Schizophrenia Overall Improve the generalizability of study populations Enhance study recruitment approaches and use a priori specification of subgroup analyses to obtain data on treatment effects in inpatients, minority groups, women, older individuals, indi- viduals with multiple psychiatric or physical health conditions, and individuals with severe and/or treatment-resistant illness Assure that sample sizes are adeq uate to achieve statistical power Assure that studies report data in a consiste nt fashion and prespecify outcomes of interest Assure that studies identify the magnitude of chan ge in scale scores that constitutes a clinically meaningful difference Increase collection of data on patient-centered ou tcomes (e.g., quality of life, social functioning, physical health, recovery) Improve systematic collection of information on harms, including in studies of psychosocial in-terventions Identify approaches (e.g., pharmacogenomics, bi omarkers, symptom clusters, and other predic- tive variables) for optimi zing treatment selection Determine efficient, valid, and reliable appr oaches to quantitative measurement of positive symptoms, negative symptoms, functioning, qualit y of life, and treatment-related side effects Determine ways in which demographic or soci ocultural factors influence treatment outcomes Determine the durability of tr eatment effects and potential for long-term harms through long- term studies (e.g., at least 1 year of trea tment with follow-up assessments at 3-5 years) Determine the benefits, harms, and appropriate use of treatments in individuals with co-occurring disorders (e.g., stimulants in co-occurring AD HD; benzodiazepines with co-occurring anxiety; smoking interventions, including medication and nonmedication approaches with co-occurring nicotine dependence) Identify methods that will allow information from mobile technologies, wearable technology, and large-scale data analytics to inform assessment, treatment, and future research Determine optimal monitoring frequencies and a pproaches to detect treatment-related benefits and side effects Identify optimal approaches to improving physic al health in individuals with schizophrenia Identify optimal approaches to treatment of co -occurring substance use disorders in individuals with schizophrenia Identify approaches to redesigning workflows and models of care delivery to improve the use of best practices in the treatment of schizophrenia Identify approaches to determining the optimal sett ing of care (e.g., inpatient, partial hospital, intensive outpatient, psychosocial rehabilitation, Clubhouse models) Identify optimal approaches to integrate recove ry-based and peer-based programs into other models of care delivery Identify optimal approaches to care coordina tion and case management, including intensive case management 139 Medications and Other Somatic Interventions Determine the comparative effectiveness of newer SGAs (including LAI formulations) versus comparable doses of other SGAs and some FGAs Determine the comparative harms of antipsyc hotic medications, incl uding long-term harms and rare but serious harms Determine optimal antipsychotic treatment approa ches for individuals with suicidal or aggres- sive behaviors, including additional studies of clozap ine for aggressive behavior Identify risks and benefits of using other medicati ons (e.g., lithium, anti convulsants, antidepres- antipsy- chotic medications to address specific target symptoms or treatment nonresponse Identify risks and benefits of concomitant us e of more than one an tipsychotic medication Identify risks and benefits of strategies to mini mize or treat side effect s of antipsychotic medi- cations, including use of concomitant medications, reductions in antipsychotic dose, or chang- ing to a different an tipsychotic medication Determine optimal approaches to making medication changes (i.e., swit ching from one antipsy- chotic to another) to minimize risk of relapse an d reduce potential for trea tment-related side effects Identify optimal clinical approaches for determ ining when a treatment trial is adequate and when treatment resistance is present Determine relationships between blood levels of antipsychotic medications (including active metabolites) and therapeutic response that can be used to guide dose titration and determina -

The process is fully described in a document available on the American Psychiatric Association (APA) website at www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/clinical- practice-guidelines/guideline-development-process. Management of Potential Conflicts of Interest Members of the Guideline Writing Group (GWG) are required to disclose all potential conflicts of interest before appointment, before and during gu ideline development, and on publication. If any potential conflicts are found or disclosed during the guideline development process, the member must recuse himself or herself from any relate d discussion and voting on a related recommenda - tion. The members of both the GWG and the System atic Review Group (SRG) reported no conflicts of interest. The \"Disclosures\" section includes more detailed disclosure information for each GWG and SRG member involved in the guideline's development. Guideline Writing Group Composition The GWG was initially composed of eight psychiatrists with general research and clinical expertise and a psychiatric resident (A.D.). This non-topic-sp ecific group was intended to provide diverse and balanced views on the guideline topic in order to minimize potential bias. One psychiatrist (P .B.) and one psychologist (M.F.L.) were added to provide su bject matter expertise in schizophrenia. An addi- tional member (A.S.Y.) provided input on quality measure The vice-chair of the GWG (L.J.F.) provided methodological expertise on such topics as appraising the strength of research evi - dence. The GWG was also diverse and balanced with respect to other characteristics, such as geo- graphic location and demographic background. Th e National Alliance on Mental Illness, Mental Health America, and the Schizophrenia and Rela ted Disorders Alliance of America reviewed the draft and provided perspective from patients, families, and ot her care partners. Systematic Review Methodology The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) systematic review, Treatments for Schizophrenia in Adults (McDonagh et al. 2017), served as the predominant source of information for this guideline. APA also conducted a search of additional systematic reviews and meta-analyses to include consideration of placebo-controlled trials that were not part of the AHRQ review. An addi - tional search was conducted in MEDLINE (PubMed) and PsycINFO on treatments for neurological side effects of antipsychotic medications, includ ing acute dystonia, parkinsonism, akathisia, and tardive syndromes. The search terms, limits used, and dates of these searches are available in Ap- pendix B. Results were limited to English-language, adult (18 and older), and human-only studies. These titles and abstracts were reviewed for rele vance by one individual (L.J.F.). Available guide- lines from other organizations were also reviewed (Addington et al . 2017a, 2017b; Barnes et al. 2011; Buchanan et Crockford and Addington 2017; Galletly et al. 2016; Hasan et al. 2012; Na - 143 tional Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014; Pringsheim et al. 2017; Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2013). Rating the Strength of Supporting Research Evidence Strength of supporting research evidence describes the level of confidence that findings from scientific observation and testing of an effect of an interven tion reflect the true effect. Confidence is enhanced by such factors as rigorous study design and minimal potential for study bias. Ratings were determined, in acco rdance with the AHRQ's \"Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews\" (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 2014), by the methodologist (L.J.F.) and reviewed by members of the SRG and GWG. Available clinical trials were assessed across four primary domains: risk of bias, consistency of findings across studies, di- rectness of the effect on a specific health outc ome, and precision of the estimate of effect. The ratings are defined as follows: High (denoted by the letter A)=high confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is very unlikely to change ou r confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate (denoted by the letter B)=moderate confid ence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research may change our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low (denoted by the letter C)=low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is likely to change our confidence in th e estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. The AHRQ has an additional category of insufficient for evidence that is unavailable or does not permit estimation of an effect. APA uses the low rating when evidence is insufficient because there is low confidence in the conclusi on and further research, if conducted, would likely change the es- timated effect or confidence in the estimated effect. Rating the Strength of Guideline Statements Each guideline statement is separately rated to indicate strength of recommendation and strength of supporting research evidence. Strength of recommendation describes the level of confidence that potential benefits of an interventi on outweigh potential harms. This level of confidence is a consen- sus judgment of the authors of the guideline and is informed by available evidence, which includes evidence from clinical trials as well as ex pert opinion and patient values and preferences. There are two possible ratings: recommendation or suggestion. A recommendation (denoted by the numeral 1 after the guideline statem ent) indicates confidence that the benefits of the intervention clearly outweigh harms. A suggestion (denoted by the numeral 2 afte r the guideline statement) indi- cates greater uncertainty. Although the benefits of the statement are still viewed as outweighing the harms, the balance of benefits and harms is more difficult to judge, or the benefits or the harms may be less clear. With a suggestion, patient values and preferences may be more variable, and this can in- fluence the clinical decision that is ultimately made. These strengths of recommendation correspond to ratings of strong or weak (also termed conditional ) as defined under the Grading of Recommenda- tions Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method for rating recommendations in clinical practice guidelines (descr ibed in publications such as Guyatt et al. 2008 and others available on the website of the GRADE working group at www.gradeworkinggroup.org). When a negative statement is made, ratings of strength of recommendation should be under - stood as meaning the inverse of the above (e.g., recommendation indicates confidence that harms clearly outweigh benefits). 144 APA Practice Guidelines The GWG determined ratings of strength of re commendation by a modified Delphi method us- ing blind, iterative voting and discussion. In order for the GWG members to be able to ask for clar- ifications about the evidence, the wording of statem ents, or the process, the vice-chair of the GWG served as a resource and did not vote on stat ements. All other formally appointed GWG members, including the chair, voted. In weighing potential benefits and harms, GWG members considered the strength of supporting research evidence, their own clinical experiences and opinions, and patient preferences. For recom- mendations, at least 10 out of 11 members must have voted to recommend the intervention or as- sessment after three rounds of voting, and at most 1 member was allowed to vote other than \"recommend\" the intervention or assessment. On the basis of the discussion among the GWG members, adjustments to the wording of recommendations could be made between the voting rounds. If this level of consensus was not achiev ed, the GWG could have agreed to make a sugges- tion rather than a recommendation. No suggestion or statement could have been made if 3 or more members voted \"no statement.\" Differences of op inion within the GWG about ratings of strength of recommendation, if any, are described in the subsection \"Balancing of Potential Benefits and Harms in Rating the Strength of the Gu ideline Statement\" for each statement. Use of Guidelines to Enhance Quality of Care Clinical practice guidelines can he lp enhance quality by synthesizing available research evidence and delineating recommendations for care on the basis of the available evidence. In some circumstances, practice guideline recommendations will be appropriate to use in developing quality measures. Guideline statements can also be used in other ways, such as educational activities or electronic clin- ical decision support, to enhance the quality of ca re that patients receive. Furthermore, when avail- ability of services is a major barrier to implemen ting guideline recommendations, improved tracking of service availability and prog ram development initiatives may n eed to be implemented by health organizations, health insurance plans, federal or state agencies, or other regulatory programs. Typically, guideline recommendati ons that are chosen for deve lopment into quality measures will advance one or more aims of th e Institute of Medicine's report on Crossing the Quality Chasm (Institute of Medicine Committee on Quality of He alth Care in America 2001) and the ongoing work guided by the multistakeholder-integrated, AHRQ-l ed National Quality Strategy by facilitating care that is safe, effective, patient ce ntered, timely, efficient, and equita ble. To achieve these aims, a broad range of quality measures (Watkins et al. 2015) is needed that spans the entire continuum of care (e.g., prevention, screening, assessment, treatment, continuing care), addr esses the different levels of the health system hierarchy (e.g., system-wide, orga nization, program/department, individual clini- cians), and includes measures of different types (e .g., process, outcome, patient-centered experience). Emphasis is also needed on factors that influe nce the dissemination and adoption of evidence- based practices (Drake et al. 2008; Greenhalg h et al. 2004; Horvitz-Lennon et al. 2009). Measure development is complex and requires detailed development of specification and pilot testing (Center for Health Policy/Center for Prim ary Care and Outcomes Research and Battelle Me - morial Institute 2011; Fernandes-Taylor and Harris 2012; Iyer et al. 2016; Pincus et al. 2016; Watkins et al. 2011). Generally, however, measure developm ent should be guided by the available evidence and focused on measures that are broadly relevant and meaningful to patients, clinicians, and pol - icy makers. Measure feasibility is another crucial aspect of measure development but is often de-cided on the basis of current data availability, which limits opportunities for development of novel measurement concepts. Furthermore, innovation in workflow and data collection systems can ben- efit from looking beyond practical limitations in th e early development stages in order to foster de- velopment of meaningful measures. Often, quality measures will focus on gaps in ca re or on care processes and outcomes that have significant variability across specialties, health ca re settings, geographic areas, or patients' demo- The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 145 graphic characteristics. Administrative databases, registries, and data from electronic health re - cords can help to identify gaps in care and ke y domains that would benefit from performance im- provements (Acevedo et al. 2015; Patel et al. 201 5; Watkins et al. 2016). Nevertheless, for some guideline statements, evidence of practice gaps or variability will be based on anecdotal observa- tions if the typical practices of psychiatrists and other health professionals are unknown. Variability in the use of guideline-recommended approaches may reflect appropriate differences that are tai - lored to the patient's preferences, treatment of co-o ccurring illnesses, or othe r clinical circumstances that may not have been studied in the available research. On the other hand, variability may indi - cate a need to strengthen clinician knowledge or ad dress other barriers to adoption of best practices (Drake et al. 2008; Greenhalgh et al. 2004; Horv itz-Lennon et al. 2009). When performance is com- pared among organizations, variability may reflect a need for quality improvement initiatives to improve overall outcomes but could also reflect ca se-mix differences such as socioeconomic factors or the prevalence of co-occurring illnesses. When a guideline recommendation is considered for development into a quality measure, it must be possible to define the applicable patien t group (i.e., the denominator) and the clinical ac- tion or outcome of interest that is measured (i.e., the numerator) in validated, clear, and quantifiable terms. Furthermore, the health system's or clinician's performance on the measure must be readily ascertained from chart review, pa tient-reported outcome measures, registries, or administrative data. Documentation of quality measures can be challenging and, depending on the practice set - ting, can pose practical barriers to meaningful interpretation of quality measures based on guide-line recommendations. For example, when reco mmendations relate to patient assessment or treatment selection, clinical judg ment may need to be used to determine whether the clinician has addressed the factors that merit emphasis for an individual patient. In other circumstances, stan-dardized instruments can facilitate quality measurem ent reporting, but it is difficult to assess the appropriateness of clinical judgment in a validated, standardized manner. Furthermore, utilization of standardized assessments remains low (Fortney et al. 2017), and clinical findings are not rou- tinely documented in a standardized format. Many clinicians appropriately use free text prose to describe symptoms, response to treatment, discus sions with family, plans of treatment, and other aspects of care and clinical decision-making. Re viewing these free text records for measurement purposes would be impractical, and it would be diff icult to hold clinicians accountable to such mea- sures without significant increases in electronic medical record use and advances in natural lan- guage processing technology. Conceptually, quality measures can be developed for purposes of accountability, for internal or health system-based quality improvement, or both . Accountability measures require clinicians to report their rate of performance of a specified proc ess, intermediate outcome, or outcome in a spec- ified group of patients. Because these data are used to determine financial incentives or penalties based on performance, accountability measures must be scientifically validated, have a strong evi - dence base, and fill gaps in care. In contrast, in ternal or health system-b ased quality improvement measures are typically designed by and for indivi dual providers, health systems, or payers. They typically focus on measurements that can suggest ways for clinicians or administrators to improve efficiency and delivery of services within a particular setting. Internal or health system-based qual - ity improvement programs may or may not link performance with payment, and, in general, these measures are not subject to strict testing and validation requirements. Quality improvement activities, including perfor mance measures derived from these guidelines, should yield improvements in quality of care to justify any clinician burden (e.g., documentation burden) or related administrative costs (e.g., for manual extraction of data from charts, for modifi - cations of electronic medical record systems to capture required data elements). Possible unin - tended consequences of any derived measures also need to be addressed in testing of a fully specified measure in a variety of practice settings. For example, highly specified measures may lead to overuse of standardized language that does not accurately reflect what ha s occurred in practice. If multiple discrete fields are us ed to capture information on a pape r or electronic record form, data APA Practice Guidelines 146 will be easily retrievable and reportable, but oversimplification is a possible unintended conse- quence of measurement. Just as guideline develope rs must balance the benefits and harms of a par- ticular guideline recommendation, developers of performance measures mu st weigh the potential benefits, burdens, and unintended consequences in optimizing quality measure design and testing. External Review This guideline was made available for review in May-June 2019 by stakeholders, including the APA membership, scientific and clinical experts, allied organizations, and the public. In addition, a number of patient advocacy organizations were invited fo r input. A total of 98 individuals and 20 organiza - tions submitted comments on the guideline (for a lis t of the names, see the section \"Individuals and Organizations That Submitted Comments\"). The chair and co-chair of the GWG reviewed and ad-dressed all comments received; substant ive issues were reviewed by the GWG. Funding and Approval This guideline development project was funded and supported by the APA without any involve- ment of industry or external funding. The guid eline was submitted to the APA Assembly and APA Board of Trustees and approved on November 17, 2019 and December 15, 2019, respectively. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 147 Glossary of Terms Adequate dose The dose of a medication at which therapeutic effects occurred when tested in clinical trials in a comparable population of subjects. This dose will differ for each medication and may need to be adjusted in an individual patient to address factors that would influence drug absorption, metabolism, elimination, or other pharmacokinetic properties. Adequate response A reduction in symptoms as a result of treatment that is associated with clinically sig - nificant benefit in functioning and/or quality of life. A reduction in symptoms of 50% or more is sometimes used as a threshold for adequacy of response. Antipsychotic medication One of a group of medication s used in the treatment of psychosis. Some of the antipsychotic medications are also appr oved for use in other conditions su ch as mood disorders or Tourette's syndrome. The first-generation antipsychotic (F GA) medications, sometimes referred to as typical antipsy- chotic medications, were the initial medications to be discovered. The FGAs include, but are not some- times referred to as atypical antipsychotic medications, include, but ar e Nomenclature (www.nbn2.org), antipsychotic medications are and group is significant variability in the pharmacological prop-erties and side-effect profiles of specific drugs. Assessment The process of obtaining information about a patient through any of a variety of methods, including face-to-face interview, re view of medical records, physical examination (by the psychiatrist, an- other physician, or a medically trained clinician), diagnostic testing, or history taking from collateral sources (American Psychiatric Association 2016a). Capacity for decision making The ability of an individual, when faced with a specific clinical or treatment- related decision, \"to communicate a choi ce, to understand the relevant information, to appreciate the medical consequences of the situation, and to reason ab out treatment choices\" (Appelbaum 2007, p. 1835). Comprehensive and person-centered treatment plan Aplan of treatment that is developed as an outgrowth of the psychiatric evaluation and is modified as clinically indicated. A comprehensive treatment plan can include nonpharmacological treatments, pharmacological treatments, or both. It is individualized to the patient's clinical presentation, safety-related needs, concomitant medical conditions, personal background, 149 relationships, life circumstances, and strengths and vu lnerabilities. There is no prescribed format that a comprehensive treatment plan must follow. The breadth and depth of the initial tr eatment plan will depend on the amount of time and ex tent of information that are available, as well as the needs of the patients and the care setting. Additions and modifications to the treatment plan are made as additional information accrues (e.g., from family, staff, medical records, and other collateral sources) and the patient's responses to clinical interventions are observed. Contraindication A situation in which a drug or procedure shou ld not be used because it may be harmful to the patient. Delusion A false belief based on incorrect inference about ex ternal reality that is firmly held despite what almost everyone else believes and despite what constitutes incontrovertible and obvious proof or evidence to the contrary. The belief is not ordinarily accepted by other members of the person's culture or subculture (i.e., it is not an article of religi ous faith) (American Psychiatric Association 2013e). The content of a delusion may include a variety of themes (e.g., persecutory, re ferential, somatic, religious, grandiose) (American Psychiatric Association 2013a). Disorganized thinking Disorganized thinking (also referred to as formal thought disorder) is typically in - ferred from the individual's speech and must be severe enough to substantially impair effective communi - cation. The individual may switch fr om one topic to another (derailment or loose associations), provide answers to questions in an obliquely related or comple tely unrelated fashion (tange ntiality), or exhibit se- verely disorganized and nearly incomprehensible speech that resembles receptive aphasia in its linguistic disorganization (incoherence or \"w ord salad\") (adapted from American Psychiatric Association 2013a). Grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior Grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior may manifest itself in a variet y of ways, ranging from childlike \"silliness\" to unpredictable agitation. Problems may be noted in any form of goal-directed behavior, leading to difficulties in performing activities of daily living. Catatonic behavior is anothe r manifestation of abnormal motor behavior and can range from resis- tance to instructions (negativism); to maintaining a ri gid, inappropriate, or bizarre posture; to a complete lack of verbal and motor responses (mutism and stupor). It can also include purposeless and excessive motor activity without obvious ca use (catatonic excitement). Other featur es are repeated stereotyped movements, staring, grimacing, mutism, and the echoing of spee ch (adapted from American Psychiatric Association 2013a). Hallucination Perception-like experiences that occur without an external stimulus. Hallucinations are vivid and clear, with the full force and impact of normal perceptions, and not under voluntary control. They may occur in any sensory modality (Ame rican Psychiatric Association 2013a). Hepatic failure Deterioration of liver function that results in coagulation abnormalit y (usually an interna - tional normalized ratio greater than or equal to 1.5) and any degree of mental al teration (encephalopathy). Although there is no identifiable cause in approximatel y 15% of cases of acute hepatic failure, typical etiol- ogies include drug-induced liver injury, viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, and shock or hypoperfu-sion (Lee et al. 2011). Hepatic impairment Inability of the liver to function normally ; typically defined in severity according to laboratory values and clinical characteristics as reflected by the Child-Pugh score or the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score (Ghany and Hoofnagle 2018; U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2003). Hopelessness Feeling of despair about the future out of the belief that there is no possibility of a solution to current problems or a positive outcome. 150 APA Practice Guidelines I2 A statistical estimate of the proportion of the variance that is due to heterogeneity. Impulsivity Acting on the spur of the moment in response to immediate stimuli, acting on a momentary basis without a plan or consideration of outcomes, difficulty establishing and following plans, or having a sense of urgency and exhibiting se lf-harming behavior under emotiona l distress (American Psychiatric As- sociation 2013f). Initial psychiatric evaluation A comprehensive assessment of a patient that has the following aims: identify the reason that the patient is presen ting for evaluation; establish rapport with the patient; understand the patient's background, relationships, current life circum stances, and strengths and vulnerabilities; establish whether the patient has a psychiatric condition; collect information needed to develo p a differential diagnosis and clinical formulation; identify immediate concerns for patient safety; and develop an initial treatment plan or revise an existing plan in collaboration with the patient. Rele vant information may be obtained by interviewing the patient; reviewing prior records; or obtaining collateral information from treating clinicians, family members, or others involved in the patient's life. Physical examin ation, laboratory studies, imaging, psychological or neuropsychological testing, or other assessments may also be included. The psychiatric evaluation may occur in a variety of settings, includin g inpatient or outpatient psychiatric settings and other medical settings. The evaluation is usually time inte nsive. The amount of time spent depends on the com- plexity of the problem, the clinical setting, and the patient's ability and willingness to cooperate with the assessment. Several meetings with the patient (and family or others) over time may be necessary. Psychiatrists may conduct other types of evaluations that have other go als (e.g., forensic evaluations) or that may be more focused and circumscribed than a psychiatric evaluation as defined he re. Guidelines are not intended to address such evaluations (America n Psychiatric Association 2016a). Negative symptoms Negative symptoms can be prominent in sc hizophrenia and can include diminution of emotional expression (eye contact; intonation of sp eech; and movements of the hand, head, and face), de- crease in motivated self-initiated purposeful activities (avolition), di minution of speech output (alogia), decrease in the ability to experience pleasure from positive stimuli (anhedonia), or apparent lack of interest in social interactions (asociality) (adapted from American Psychiatric Association 2013a). Over-the-counter medications or supplements Drugs or supplements that can be bought without a prescription. Person-centered care Care that is respectful of and responsive to individual preferences, needs, and values and ensures that an individual's values guide all clinic al decisions; sometimes refe rred to as patient-centered care (Institute of Medicine Committee on Quality of He alth Care in America 2001). In person-centered care, patients, families, and other persons of support are pr ovided with information that allows them to make informed decisions (Institute of Me dicine 2006). Evidence-based interv entions should be adapted to meet individual needs and preferences wh ere possible (van Dulmen et al. 2015), and shared decision-making and self-management approaches are encouraged (Institute of Medicine 2006). Person-centered care is achieved through a dynamic and collaborative re lationship among individuals, familie s, other persons of support, and treating clinicians that supports the individual's realistic health and life goals and informs decision-making to the extent that the individual desires (American Geriatri cs Society Expert Panel on Person-Centered Care 2016). Renal impairment Inability of the kidney(s) to function normally, typically described in terms of reductions in creatinine clearance or estimate d glomerular filtration rate (eGF R). An eGFR of 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 indicates reduced kidney functi on; an eGFR of 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2 kidney function; an eGFR of 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m2 indicates severely reduced kidney function; and an eGFR of less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 indicates a very severe reduction in kidney function or end-stage renal disease (Kidney Disease: Improving Glob al Outcomes [KDIGO] CKD Work Group 2013). The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 151 Suicidal ideas Thoughts of serving as the agent of one's own death. Suicide Death caused by self-directed injurious behavior wi th any intent to die as a result of the behavior (Crosby et al. 2011). Suicide attempt A nonfatal, self-directed, potentially injurious be havior with any intent to die as a result of the behavior. A suicide attempt may or may not result in injury (Crosby et al. 2011). It may be aborted by the individual or interrupted by another individual. Suicide intent Subjective expectation and desire for a self-injurious act to end in death. Suicide means The instrument or object used to engage in se lf-inflicted injurious behavior with any intent to die as a result of the behavior. Suicide method The mechanism used to engage in self-inflicted injurious behavior with any intent to die as a result of the behavior. Suicide plan Delineation of the method, means, time, place, or other details for engaging in self-inflicted injurious behavior with any intent to die as a result of the behavior. Therapeutic alliance A characteristic of the relationship between the patient and clinicia n that describes the sense of collaboration in pursuing therapeutic goals as we ll as the patient's sense of attachment to the clinician and perception of whether the clinician is helpful (Gabbard 2009). Trauma history A history of events in the patient's life with the potential to have been emotionally traumatic, including but not limited to exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, illness, or sexual violence. Exposure may occur through direct experience or by observing an event in person or through technology (e.g., television, audio or video record ing) or by learning of an event that occurred to a close family member or close friend. Trauma could also include early adversity, neglect, ma ltreatment, emotional abuse, physical abuse, or sexual abuse occurring in childhood; exposure to natural or man-made disasters; exposure to combat situations; being a victim of a violent crime; involvement in a serious motor ve hicle accident; or having serious or painful or pr olonged medical experiences (e.g ., intensive care unit stay). Treatment as usual Treatment that is consistent with care received for a specific condition in a real-world nonresearch context. Treatment as usual, sometimes referr ed to as usual care or standard care, is often used as an active comparison condition for studies of ne w interventions. Elements of treatment as usual are heterogeneous and differ with each study but can in clude medication treatment, medication management, case management, rehabilitation services, and psychotherapy (McD onagh et al. 2017).

Clinical Questions The following key questions formed the basis of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review: 1a. What are the comparative benefits and harms of pharmacological treatments for adults with schizophrenia? 1b. How do the benefits and harms of pharmacological trea tm ents for adults with schizophrenia vary by patient characteristics? 2a. What are the benefits and harms of psychosocial an d other nonpharmacological treatments for adults with schizophrenia? 2b. How do the benefits and harms of psychosocial an d other nonpharmacological treatments for adults with schizophrenia vary by patient characteristics (e.g., age, sex, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, time since illness onset, prior treatment history, co-occurring psychiatric disorders, pregnancy)? The following key questions formed the basis of searches related to neurological side effects of antipsychotic medications: 1. What are the comparative benefits and harms of phar macological treatments for acute dystonia associated with antipsychotic therapy? 2. What are the comparative benefits and harms of ph armacological treatments for parkinsonism associated with antipsychotic therapy? 3. What are the comparative benefits and harms of phar macological treatments for akathisia associated with antipsychotic therapy? 4. What are the comparative benefits and harms of ph armacological treatments for tardive syndromes asso- ciated with antipsychotic therapy? 201 Appendix B. Search Strategies, Study Selection, and Search Results AHRQ Review The Agency for Healthcare Research an d Quality's (AHRQ) systematic review Treatments for Schizo- phrenia in Adults (McDonagh et al. 2017) served as the pr edominant source of information for this guideline. Databases that were searched are Ovid MEDLINE\u00ae (PubMed\u00ae), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and PsycINFO\u00ae. Re- sults were limited to English-language, adult ( 18 and older), and human-only studies. The search varied by key question because high-quality system atic reviews were used as a starting point for the review. For key question 1, search dates for first-generation antipsychotic medications (FGAs) versus second-generation antipsychotic medicati in 2011 and for SGAs versus SGAs began in 2013. Key question 2 did not restri ct the start date. All searches were conducted through February 1, 2017. The search strategies used can be found in Appendix A of the AHRQ re - view (McDonagh et al. 2017). The AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017) adhe red to the procedures outlined in the AHRQ Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparativ e Effectiveness Reviews (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 2014). Recent, comprehensiv e, good- or fair-quality systematic reviews served as a primary source of evidence, supplemented by information from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published since the systematic reviews or when no systematic reviews were available. For assessment of harms of treatment, systematic reviews of observational trials were also in- cluded. Eligibility for inclusion and exclusion of ar ticles adhered to preestablished criteria. Specif - ically, the AHRQ review included articles that had at least 12 weeks of follow-up and were conducted in outpatient settings in countries that were relevant to the United States' health care system. Articles that addressed bene fits of treatment were included if at least 90% of the sample had a diagnosis of schizophrenia (or schizophreniform disorder), with a schizophrenia spectrum disor- der in at least 50% of the sample (minimum sample size >50) for studies of harms of treatment. For key questions that related to antipsychotic treatment, all of the SGAs were included; for FGAs, studies on fluphenazine, nazine were included. Only head-to-head com- parison studies were included. For studies of psyc hosocial and other nonpharmacological interven- tions, studies were included if they compared us ual care, standard care, treatment as usual, or a waitlist control group to active treatment with assertive community treatment, cognitive adaptive training, cognitive-behavioral therapy, cognitive remediation, early interventions for first-episode psychosis, family interventions, intensive case management, illness self-management training, in-terventions for co-occurring schizophrenia and substa nce use, psychoeducation, social skills train- ing, supported employment, or supportive psychotherapy. Using these criteria, titles and abstracts were reviewed by two individuals (McDonagh et al. 2017). Full-text articles were retrieved if either reviewer felt inclusion was warranted. Full-text ar- ticles were also evaluated by two reviewers, an d disagreements about inclusion were resolved by consensus. Included studies are listed in Appendix B of the AHRQ review, and excluded studies 203 (with the reason for exclusion) are listed in Appendix C of the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017). For key question 1 on antipsychotic treatmen t, 698 citations were identified, 519 of which were excluded on the basis of title and abstract re view, yielding 179 full-text articles that were re - viewed, of which 38 were included in the final AHRQ review. For key question 2 on psychosocial and other nonpharmacological interventions, 2,76 6 citations were identified, 1,871 of which were excluded on the basis of title and abstract review, yielding 895 full-text articl es that were reviewed, of which 53 were included in the final AHRQ review. Additional summary information about the included studies is shown in Table B-1, and additional details can be found in the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017). For included studies, abstracted information wa s verified for accuracy and completeness by a second individual and included citation, year, st udy design, setting, funding source, country, sam- ple size, eligibility criteria, clinical characterist ics, and other characteristics of the study design, population, intervention, and outcomes (McDonagh et al. 2017). In addition, individual controlled trials and systematic reviews were assessed by two team members with pr edefined criteria for study quality, yielding ratings of \"good,\" \"fair,\" or \"poor,\" with disagreements resolved by consen- sus (McDonagh et al. 2017). Included systematic re views were generally of good quality, whereas additional included studies were generally of fair quality. Treatment of Neurological Side Effects of Antipsychotic Medications Additional searches were undert aken to supplement the AHRQ review and to identify studies that addressed approaches to treatment of neurological side effects of antipsyc hotic medications. Search strategies for MEDLINE (PubMed) and Cochrane Library are shown in Tables B-2 and B-3, respec - tively. For each search, all available citations were identified from the inception of the database to July 29, 2018, the date when the searches were conducted. A search of MEDLINE yielded 2,980 ci- tations, and a search of the Cochrane Library yiel ded 2,450. After duplicate citations were removed, titles and abstracts for 4,196 articles were screened by one reviewer (L.J.F.) to identify articles in hu - mans, 18 years of age or older, published in English, that inve stigated Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were used as a primary source of evidence, and if multiple Cochrane reviews on a topic had been done, only the most recent review was included. For topics on which no systematic review was available, RCTs with a sample size of at least 20 sub - jects and observational studies with a sample of at least 50 individuals were included. Included studies had a follow-up period of at least 1 week for acute dystonia or neuroleptic malignant syn- drome and 8 weeks for other side effects.

For tardive dyskinesia, 12 system atic reviews were available, with 2 reviews of multiple treatment approaches and 1 review each related to anticholinergic medication, cholinergic medication, benzodiazepines, vitamin B6, vitamin catecholaminergic drugs, and antipsychotic reduction or cessation. For akathisia, 3 recent systematic reviews were available, with 1 review each related to -adrenergic blocking agents, anticholinergi c agents, and mirtazapine. No additional RCTs or observational studies met inclusion criteria for other treatments of akathisia (e.g., benzo- diazepines). For medication-induced parkinsonism , 1 systematic review was available, but evi- dence was insufficient to draw any definitive conc lusions. For acute dystonia, 1 systematic review, 1 RCT, and 1 nonrandomized prospective study exam ined effects of anticholinergic medications in reducing the likelihood of acute dystonia; howeve r, no studies meeting inclusion criteria examined use of anticholinergic agents as a treatment of acute dystonia. In addition, no studies meeting in - clusion criteria were found that addressed treatment of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. APA Practice Guidelines 208 Appendix C. Review of Research Evidence Supporting Guideline Statements Assessment and Determination of Treatment Plan STATEMENT 1: Assessment of Possible Schizophrenia APA recommends (1C) that the initial assessment of a patient with a possi ble psychotic dis- order include the reason the individual is pr esenting for evaluation ; the patient's goals and preferences for treatment; a review of psychiatric symptoms and trauma history; an assessment of tobacco use and other substance use; a psychiatric treatment history; an as- sessment of physical health; an assessment of psychosocial and cultural factors; a mental status examination, including cognitive asse ssment; and an assessment of risk of suicide and aggressive behaviors, as outlined in APA's Practice Guidelines for the Psychiatric Evalu- ation of Adults (3rd edition). Evidence for this statement comes from general principles of assessment and clinical care in psy - chiatric practice. Expert opinion suggests that conducting such asse ssments as part of the initial psychiatric evaluation improves diagnostic accura cy, appropriateness of treatment selection, and treatment safety. For additional details, see Guid eline I, \"Review of Psyc hiatric Symptoms, Treatment Guid eline II, \"Substance Use Assessment,\" Suicide Risk,\" Guideline IV , \"Assessment of Risk for Aggressive Behaviors,\" Guideline V , \"Assessment of Cultural Factors,\" and Guideline VI, \"Assessment of Medical Health,\" in the APA Practice Guidelines for the Psyc hiatric Evaluation of Adults , 3rd Edition (American Psychi- atric Association 2016a). A detailed systematic revi ew to support this statement is outside the scope of this guideline; however, less comprehensive se arches of the literature did not yield any studies related to this recommendation in the context of schizophrenia treatment. Consequently, the strength of research evidence is rated as low. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Assessment of Possible Schizophrenia On the basis of the limitations of the evidence for assessment of possible schizophrenia, no grading of the body of research evidence is possible. STATEMENT 2: Use of Quantitative Measures APA recommends (1C) that the initial psychiatric evalua tion of a patient with a possible psychotic disorder include a quantitative me asure to identify and determine the severity of symptoms and impairments of functioning that may be a focus of treatment. 209 Evidence for this statement comes from general principles of assessment and clinical care in psy - chiatric practice. Consequently, the strength of re search evidence is rated as low. Expert opinion suggests that conducting such asse ssments as part of the initial psychiatric evaluation improves di- agnostic accuracy, appropriateness of treatment se lection, and longitudinal assessment of patient symptoms and treatment effects. This recommenda tion is also consistent with Guideline VII, \"Quantitative Assessment,\" as part of the APA Practice Guidelines for the Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults , 3rd Edition (American Psychiatric Association 2016a). Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Use of Quantitative Measures On the basis of the limitations of the evidence for use of quantitative measures, no grading of the body of research evidence is possible. STATEMENT 3: Evidence-Based Treatment Planning APA recommends (1C) that patients with schizophre nia have a documented, comprehen - sive, and person-centered treatment plan th at includes evidence-based nonpharmacolog- ical and pharmacological treatments. Evidence for this statement comes from general principles of assessment and clinical care in psy - chiatric practice. A detailed systematic review to support this statement was outside the scope of this guideline; however, less comprehensive searches of the literature did not yield any studies that directly related to this recommendation in the context of schizophrenia treatment. Consequently, the strength of research evidence is rated as low. Nevertheless, in the bulk of the literature reviewed in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qual ity (AHRQ) report (McDonagh et al. 2017), phar- macotherapy was included in all treatment arms in the studies of psychosocial interventions. In- variably, in studies of pharmaco therapies, some additional fo rm of clinical intervention is incorporated into treatment and can include elemen ts of patient education, supportive psychother- apy, and other brief interventions. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Evidence-Based Treatment Planning On the basis of the limitations of the evidence for evidence-based treatment planning, no grading of the body of research evidence is possible. Pharmacotherapy STATEMENT 4: Antipsychotic Medications APA recommends (1A) that patients with schizophrenia be treated with an antipsychotic medication and monitored for effectiveness and side effects. * Evidence for this statement comes from the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017) as well as from other high-quality meta-analyses that examined fi ndings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antipsychotic medications in schizophrenia (Huhn et al. 2019; Leucht et al. 2017). The data from *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. 210 APA Practice Guidelines placebo-controlled trials are essential in making an initial determination of whether the benefits of antipsychotic medication s outweigh the harms of antipsycho tic medications. Placebo-controlled trial data as well as findings from head-to-head comparison studies and network analyses provide additional information on whethe r the benefits and harms of spec ific antipsychotic medications suggest preferential use (or nonuse) as compar ed with other antipsyc hotic medications. The strength of the research evidence is rated as high in demonstrating that the benefits of treatment with an antipsychotic medication outweigh the harms, although harms are clearly present and must be taken into consideration. Primary evidence for placebo-controlled antipsycho tic trial data came from the systematic review, Bayesian meta-analysis, and meta-regression conducted by Leucht et al. (2017), which included 167 studies (total N = 28,102) published from 1955 to 2016 that were randomized and double-blinded with placebo control groups. The authors excluded studies of acute treatmen t with short-acting in- tramuscular antipsychotic medicati ons in- jectable [LAI] antipsychotic agents). Studies of clozapine were excluded because of possible superior efficacy, and studies conducted in China were excluded because of concerns about study quality. Studies were also excluded if subjects had primarily negative symptoms or significant comor-bidity in either psychiatric or physical health conditions. The median study duration was 6 weeks, with almost all studies lasting 12 weeks or less in terms of primary study outcomes. None of the stud- ies was focused on first-episode or treatment-resist ant samples of subjects, and the mean illness du- ration was 13.4 years (standard deviation [SD] 4.7) , with a mean subject ag e of 38.7 (SD 5.5). The number of studies available on each drug was highly variable, with chlorpromazine, haloperidol, olanzapine, and risperidone being most often studied, and limited information was available on some antipsychotic medications. Results are provided in Table C-1. The authors found a moderate benefit of antipsyc hotic medications, with positive symptoms im- proving the most but improvements in negative symptoms, depression, quality of life, and social functioning also noted with treatment (Leucht et al . 2017). Side effects were also present but dif - fered substantially among medications. The authors also found, however, that effect sizes for anti-psychotic medications have decreased with time over the past 60 years. This seems to result from increasing placebo response rates rather than decreasing medication response, although the benefit of haloperidol as compared with placebo has de creased with time. Not su rprisingly, these trends are likely to confound comparisons of newer versus older medications. Although industry spon- sorship was associated with a lower effect size as compared with studies funded by other mecha- nisms, publication bias was observ ed because of the tendency to avoid publishing studies with no effect of treatment. In the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017), few head-to-head comparison studies were avail - able for most of the antipsychotic medications. In terms of functioning, the strength of evidence (SOE) was not differ in terms of global functioning or employment rates, although social functioning with risperidon e in an LAI formulation was better than with que- tiapine in a single study (Rouillon et al. 2013). Meas ures of quality of life also showed no difference among older SGAs or between older SGAs and FGAs (specifically, haloperidol and perphenazine) on the basis of a low to moderate SOE. In terms of response rates (McDonagh et al. 2017), there was no difference between haloperidol and risperidone (16 RCTs, N =3,452; low SOE). However, response with olanza pine was significantly better than with halo- peridol (14 RCTs, N=4,099; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.96; low SO E). In addition, a network meta-analysis of 46 head-to-head RCTs showed a significantly greater likelihood of response with olanzapine (odds ratio [OR] 1.71, 95% CI 1.11 -2.68) and CI than quetiapine (low SOE). Olanzapine was also as sociated with higher remission rates as compared with haloper- The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 211 APA Practice Guidelines TABLE C-1.

In terms of core illness symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, disorgan ized thinking), all SGAs that were studied were superior to placebo (stand ardized mean difference [SMD] -0.33 to 95% CI 0.44-4.18) were associated with greater improvements in total Positive and Nega tive Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score as compared with haloperidol (moderate SOE), but no differences were noted in other comparisons of FGAs and SGAs (low SOE). With comparisons among SGAs, clozapine improved core illness symptoms more than other SGAs except for olan zapine (network meta-analysis of 212 RCT s; SMDs low SOE); olanzapine and core illness symptoms more than the othe r SGAs except for each other and paliperidone (SMDs -0.13 to -0.26; low SOE); and paliperidone lur- asidone and iloperidone (SMDs -0.17; et haloperidol was less effective than olanzapine (5 RCTs, N=535; MD based on the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms scores 2.56, 95% CI 0.94-4.18; moderate the latter findings based on nega tive symptom scores of the PANSS and having a low SOE. Other comparisons of FGAs versus SGAs show ed no effects on negative symptoms (low SOE). In an additional network meta-analysis of 32 an tipsychotic medications, Huhn et al. (2019) in- cluded 402 placebo-controlled and head-to-head rand omized controlled trials that included a total of 53,463 adult participants with acute symptoms and a diagnosis of schizophrenia or a related dis- order. Not included were studies that focused on individuals with a first episode of psychosis or treatment resistance and studies in which indivi duals had concomitant medical illnesses or a pre- dominance of negative or depressive symptoms. For the majority of antipsychotic medications, treatment was associated with a st atistically significant reduction in overall symptoms as compared with placebo, and there were few significant diff erences between individual drugs. With antipsy- chotic medications that did not differ significantl y from placebo, there were numerical differences favoring the antipsychotic medication, and the nu mber of subjects in the network meta-analysis was small, yielding a wide credible interval (CrI). Only clozapine, amisulpr ide, zotepine, olanzapine, and risperidone exhibited greater efficacy than many other antips ychotic medications for overall symptoms, with the greatest benefit noted with clozapine (SMD -0.89, 95% CrI -1.08 paralleled the fi ndings for treatment efficacy (Huhn et al. 2019). In terms of positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and depressive symptoms , the majority of the medications showed a statistically significant difference from placebo, with the exception of several antipsychotic agents for which sample sizes were small and CrIs were wide. Few studies had as- sessed effects of antipsychotic medications on social functioning. As in the Leucht et al. (2017) meta- analysis, side-effect profiles differed considerably among the antipsychotic medications. Few studies assessed effects of antipsychotic me dications on self-harm, but among patients at high risk, the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT; Meltzer et al. 2003) found that clozapine was superior to olanzapine in preventing significant suicide attempts or hospitalization to prevent suicide (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.58-0.97; low SOE). In terms of dose-response effects on antipsychotic medication effectiveness, standard doses of antipsychotic medications are superior to low or very low dose treatment in reducing the risk of relapse (Uchida et al. 2011a). In addition, there is evidence of a dose-response relationship for many antipsychotic medications in sh ort-term trials of acute effi cacy (Davis and Chen 2004). Overall discontinuation rates and time to disconti nuation r eflect whether a treatment is effective but also whether it is tolerable. In this regard , a network meta-analysis of 111 studies (McDonagh et al. 2017) found that rates of discontinuatio n were lower with the following medications: The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 213 Olanzapine and clozapine as compared to 0.69 for clozapine Clozapine as compared with monthly done palmitate LAI (OR 0.56, 95% CI LAI, or (ORs (ORs 0.61-0.77). Risperidone and monthly as compared with iloperidone (ORs 0.52 and 0.62, respectively) Findings on time to discontinuation are more limited and need replication (low SOE), but they sug- gest that olanzapine may have a longer time to discontinuation than quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone (4 months on the basis of trial data; 1.5-2.2 months shorter on the basis of observational data); clozapine may have a longer time to olanzapine, risperidone, or queti - Phase 2E of the Clinical Antipsychotic Tria ls of Intervention Effectiveness [CATIE] study); and risperidone LAI may have a long er to discontinuat than aripiprazole, clozapine, (McDonag h et al. 2017), which used data from 90 head-to-head trials of greater than 6 weeks' duration, found the risk of withdrawals due to adverse events was less with the following medications: Risperidone LAI as compared wi th and ziprasidone 95% 0.13-0.91) These findings had a low SOE, and head-to-head comparison data were not available for all available antipsychotic medications. For haloperido l, withdrawals due to adverse events were sig- nificantly higher than with SGAs (moderat 95% 1.26-2.23; I2=0%). Overall adverse event rates also favored SGAs as compared with haloperidol (moderate SOE), specifically 95% CI 1.03-1.23; I2=31%). Among comparisons between SGAs, no differences in overall adverse events were noted (low to moderate SOE). In terms of mortality, comparisons were difficul t because of the short duration of most studies and the small number of reported events in these clinical trials (incidence rates 0%-1.17%). Never- theless, there were no significant mortality differences found between asenapine versus olanzapine (2 RCTs; RR e (monthly) versus risperidone LAI (2 RCTs; RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.21-7.49; low SOE). Additional fi ndings from retrospective cohort studies found APA Practice Guidelines 214 no significant difference in the risk of all-cause (1 study, N=48,595) or cardiovascular (2 studies, N=55,582) mortality between risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine (low SOE). For the additional harms data described in th e AHRQ report (McDonag h et al. 2017), evidence was relatively limited and did not adjust for known factors that confound risk. Data on cardiac dis- ease are mixed. A large, good-quality retrospectiv e cohort study found no significant differences in the risk of cardiovascular death, acute coronary syndrome, or ischemic stroke between risperidone and olanzapine or quetiapine in patients ages 18-64 years within the first ye ar of starting the drug. However, a large adverse event database study fo und that clozapine was significantly associated with myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, whereas olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone were not. In contrast, other limited evidence suggested an incr eased risk of cardiac arrest and arrhythmia with risperidone compared with clozapine, and data from CATIE suggested a higher estimated 10-year risk of coronary heart disease with olanzapine co mpared with risperidone. As compared with FGAs, the SGA aripiprazole showed a lower likelihood of cardiomyopat hy or coronary heart disease. Findings on neurological side effects such as ak athisia and parkinsonism also showed significant variability among the head-to-head comparison stud ies, which makes it difficult to draw overall conclusions about side-effect rates or risk. For ne w-onset tardive dyskinesia, overall rates were low (3% of subjects treated with risperidone as co mpared with 1%-2% for other medications). Never- theless, findings from observational trials suggeste d a significant increase in risk with risperidone as compared with olanzapine (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.35-2.14). Metabolic effects varied with study duration, but clinically important weight gain (defined as a 7% or more increase from baseline) was greater wi th olanzapine than with aripiprazole (RR 2.31), asenapine (RR 2.59), clozapine (RR 1.71), quetiapine (RR 1.82), risperidone (RR 1.81), and ziprasidone (RR 5.76) across 3.7-24 months. Olan zapine had a significantly greate r risk of metabolic syndrome than risperidone (pooled OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.10-2.21; I 2=0%; follow-up of 6 weeks to 3 months) or ar - ipiprazole (pooled OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.32-4.76; mo nths). In adults, obser- vational evidence indica ted an increased risk of new-onset diabetes with olanzapine compared with risperidone (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.03-1.31). A single study found diabetic ketoacidosis to be in- creased with olanzapine compared with risperidon e (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.7-7.9), but a second study found no difference in diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemia, or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state between risperidone and olanzapine, regardless of age group, but a significantly lower risk with quetiapine compared with risperidone in older patients (adjusted HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53-0.90). Taken together, the findings of the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017) complement the meta- analyses of Leucht et al. (2017) and Huhn et al. (2019) in showing efficacy of antipsychotic medi - cations, particularly for core illness symptoms but also for other outcomes. Furthermore, research evidence demonstrates no clear and consistent superiority of one antipsychotic medication as com-pared with other antipsychotic medications, with th e exception of clozapine. In addition, the system- atic reviews suggest considerable variability in side-effect profile s among antipsychotic medications, without a clear continuum of risk for individual medications when all side effects are considered. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Efficacy of Antipsychotic Medications Magnitude of effect: Moderate . The magnitude of effect varies among individual antipsychotic med- ications but is moderate overall on the basis of findings from meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials. Risk of bias: Medium. Studies are RCTs that are summarized in multiple good-quality meta- analyses. Although the risk of bi as of individual RCTs varies, mo st have some limitations, and, in older trials, reporting of study design featur es is often incomplete. Among head-to-head com- parison trials, some studies are observational trials and are associated with a higher risk of bias. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 215 Applicability: The included trials all involve individu als with schizophrenia. Some studies also include individuals with other diagnoses such as schizoaffective disorder. The studies include subjects from countries around the world, with the exception of China. The doses of medication used are representative of usual clinical practice. Directness: Direct. Studies measure functioning, quality of life, core illness symptoms, negative symptoms, and response to treatment. Consistency: Consistent . When multiple studies that included a given comparison are available, results are generally consistent. In addition, the overall direction of effects is generally consis - tent among antipsychotic medications in placebo-controlled trials. Precision: Variable . For many comparisons, particularly when multiple RCTs are available, find - ings are precise. However, for other comparisons, imprecision is present because of wide confi- dence intervals that often cross the threshold for clinically significant benefit of the intervention. Dose-response relationship: Present. There is evidence of a dose-response relationship in acute treatment trials as well as in studies of antipsychotic medi cations for relapse placebo-controlled trials, effe ct sizes have decreased over the past 60 years, apparently due to increases in pl acebo response rates; these trends are likely to confound comparisons of older and newer medications. Publication bias: Suspected . Among placebo-controlled trials, st udies with no effect of treatment appear to have had lower rates of publication. Overall strength of research evidence: High . There are a large number of randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled trials of antipsychotic medication as well as a smaller number of head-to-head comparison RCTs. Although many studies have a medium risk of bias and publication bias appears to be present, there is also consis tency in overall study findings and a dose-response relationship is present, strengthen ing confidence in the conclusions. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Harms of Antipsychotic Medications Magnitude of effect: Small to moderate . The magnitude of effect for harms of antipsychotic med- ication differs by drug and by side ef fect but is small to moderate overall. Risk of bias: Medium to high . Studies are RCTs that are summarized in multiple good-quality meta-analyses. Particularly in older clinical trials, side effects tend not to be assessed or reported as systematically as efficacy an d effectiveness-related outcomes. Applicability: The included trials all involve individu als with schizophrenia. Some studies also include individuals with other diagnoses such as schizoaffective disorder. The studies include subjects from around the world, with the except ion of China. The doses of medication used are representative of usual clinical practice. Directness: Variable . Most studies measure overall adverse events, and some measure specific adverse effects, each of which is a direct meas ure. Other studies measure study withdrawal rates due to adverse effects, which is an indirect measure. Consistency: Consistent . In studies that compare the same me dication with placebo, side effect- related outcomes are generally consistent in th eir direction and relative degree. Head-to-head comparison data are less consistent. Precision: Precise . Confidence intervals are narrow for comparisons in which multiple studies with good sample sizes are available. For compar isons with a small number of studies or small samples, imprecision is present because of wide confidence intervals. Head-to-head compari-sons also have imprecision due to outcomes th at cross the threshold fo r clinically significant harms of the intervention. Dose-response relationship: Suspected . There is less systematic information available on dose- response relationships for side effects of antips ychotic medication; howeve r, the available evidence suggests that greater doses are as sociated with a greater degree of medication-related side effects. APA Practice Guidelines 216 Confounding factors: Present . Cohort effects that are present in efficacy and effectiveness stud- ies of antipsychotic medication are also likely to be relevant when assessing harms of antipsy- chotic medication. Publication bias: Suspected . Among placebo-controlled trials, st udies with no effect of treatment appear to have had lower rates of publication. Overall strength of research evidence: Moderate . Available studies are RCTs that are generally of moderate quality and have g ood sample sizes. Findings are consistent, with narrow confi- dence intervals for many comparisons, and are likely to exhibit a dose-response relationship. Antipsychotic Medications in First-Episode Schizophrenia In subgroup analyses, the AHRQ review (McDonag h et al. 2017) found that patients experiencing a first episode of schizophrenia did not show sign ificant differences in response or remission when treated with olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, aripiprazole, or paliperidone. An- (Zhu et al. 2017) in indi viduals with a first episod e of schizophrenia found that amisulpride, olanzapine, zi prasidone, and risperidone reduced overall symptoms more than haloperidol, but the evidence was noted as being of very low to moderate quality, and only 13 stud- ies were available to address this clinical question. Treatment Approaches to Partial Response or Nonresponse High Doses of Antipsychotic Medication A limited amount of evidence suggests no benefit from high doses of an antipsychotic medication in individuals who have not responded to typical doses of the medication. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Dold et al. (2015) found 5 trials, which included a total of 348 patients and studied this question with FGAs or SGAs. Dose escalation was not found to confer any benefits in terms of study attrition, response rates, or symptoms (as measured by PANSS or BPRS). A subsequent system- atic review and meta-analysis by Samara et al. (2 018) found 10 relevant RCTs , which included a total of 675 participants. Although no clear differences in response were noted between subjects who re- ceived the same dose of medication as compared with those who received a higher dose, many of the studies had a medium to high risk of bias. There we re also no differences in other outcomes, including the proportion of individuals who left the study ea rly because of adverse effects or for any reason. Augmentation Pharmacotherapy A number of pharmacotherapies have been studied as augmentation strategies in individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Evidence has been primarily from small short-term, open-label studies that have yielded mixed findings. Correll et al. (2017b) conducted a systematic search for meta-analyses that addressed the effects of combining an antipsychotic medication with another pharmacotherapy in individuals with schizophrenia. They foun d 29 meta-analyses that together encompassed 19,833 subjects in 381 trials and that evaluated 42 augmentation strategies. Although 14 of these augmentation therapies showed better outcomes than comparison treatment, the meta- analyses with the highest effect sizes had the lowest quality of included studies, undermining con- fidence in the benefits of augmentation. In terms of augmentation of clozapine, Siskind et al. (2018) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation st rategies for individuals with cl ozapine-refractory schizophrenia and found 46 studies of 25 interventions. They no ted possible benefits of memantine for negative symptoms and aripiprazole, fluoxetine, and sodium valproate for overall psychotic symptoms but found that many of the studies had a poor study quality and short periods of follow-up, which lim- ited the ability to draw conclusions. Wagner et al. (2019a) conducted a systematic meta-review of 21 meta-analyses that examined st rategies for augmenting treatment with clozapine. Although the best evidence was available for combination treatmen t of clozapine with FGAs or SGAs for psychotic The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 217 symptoms and with antidepressants for persistent negative symptoms, these authors also concluded that additional high-quality clinical trials are essential before making definitive statements about clozapine augmentation. Furthermore, their findings are consistent with those of Correll et al. (2017b), who did not identify any combination medica tion strategies with clozapine that led to bet - ter outcomes than comparator treatments and found that available studies were of low quality. Other meta-analyses have also examined the effect s of using more than one antipsychotic medication as compared with antipsyc hotic monotherapy . Galling et al. (2017) found a possible benefit of aripip- razole augmentation in terms of greater improvement in negative symptoms and reductions in prolac - tin levels and body weight. Howe ver, they noted that the appare nt benefits of antipsychotic augmentation in reducing total symp toms were no longer seen when the analysis was restricted to dou - ble-blind trials of higher quality. A Cochrane review of antipsychoti c combination treatments for schizo- phrenia (Ortiz-Orendain et al. 2017) also found that evidence on combinations of antipsychotic medications was of very low quality. Nevertheless, data from a large nationwi de cohort study in Fin- land suggested that use of two different antipsyc hotic medications may have some benefits as com- pared with monotherapy. Tiihonen et al. (2019) studied 62,250 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and compared hospital ization rates within th e same individual during periods of anti- psychotic monotherapy and periods with use of more than one antipsychotic medicati on. They found that rehospitalization rates with clozapine were lower th an with other monotherapies and that individ- uals receiving more than one antipsychotic medication had a 7%-13% lo wer risk of psychiatric rehospi- talization than individuals treated with monotherapy ( P<0.001). Use of multiple antipsychotic medications was also associated with a reduction in secondary outcomes (e.g., all-cause hospitalization, nonpsychiatric hospitalization, mo rtality). Thus, there is weak and inconsistent evidence suggesting possible benefits of combined tr eatment with more than one antips ychotic medication, but more re - search is needed. On the other hand, augmentation of antipsychotic therapy with an antidepressant medication may be helpful, particularly for patients with negative symptoms or depression. Stroup et al. (2019) used U.S. Medicaid data on 81,921 adult outpatients ag es 18-64 years who had a diag nosis of schizophrenia. The authors employed propensity score matching an d weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models to examine the effect of adding an antidepressant, a benzodiazepine, a mood stabilizer, or an- other antipsychotic medicati on to existing treatment with an an tipsychotic medicati on. These authors found that the addition of an antidepressant medication was associated with a reduced risk for psychi- atric hospitalization or em ergency visits. In addition, Helfer et al. (2016) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the addition of antidepressant medication to antipsychotic trea tment. Data from 82 RCTs that included 3,608 subjects indicated th at antidepressant augmenta tion was associated with improvements in quality of life (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.57 to -0.06) and rates of response (risk ratio 1.52, 95% CI 1.29-1.78; NNT=5, 95% CI 4-7) as well as reductions symptoms (SMD -0.25, 95% -0.09). STATEMENT 5: Continuing Medications APA recommends (1A) that patients with schizophre nia whose symptoms have improved with an antipsychotic medication continue to be treated with an antipsychotic medication.* Evidence in support of this statement is based primarily on the evidence for antipsychotic effi - cacy in improving symptoms and quality of life as well as promoting functioning (see Statement 4 earlier in the appendix). Thus, the strength of research evidence is rated as high. *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. APA Practice Guidelines 218 Additional evidence supporting this statement comes from registry database studies and from discontinuation studies. For example, in a nationwide prospective registry study (N =6,987) with a 5-year follow-up of individuals with first-onset schizophrenia (K iviniemi et al. 2013), there was a significant decrease in all-cause mortality in individuals taking SGAs as compared with individuals who were not taking antipsychotic medication (OR 0.69; P=0.005). Another nationwide study ( N=8,719) using prospectively collected registry data found that the lowest rates of rehospitalization or death occurr ed in individuals who received continuing treat- ment with an antipsychotic medica tion for up to 16.4 years (Tiiho nen et al. 2018). Individuals who discontinued antipsychotic medicati on had a risk of death that was 174% higher than that in con- tinuous users of antipsychotic me dications (HR 2.74, 95% CI 1.09-6.89), whereas the risk of death was 214% higher (HR 3.14, 95% CI 1.29-7.68) in no nusers of antipsychotic medications as compared with continuous users. Rates of treatment failu re, which included rehospitalization as well as death, were also lower in indi viduals who received continuous treatment with an antipsychotic medication. More specifically, 38% of those who di scontinued treatment experienced treatment fail- ure as compared with a matched group of continuous users of an antipsychotic medication, in which the rate of treatment failure was 29.3%. Fo r nonusers of antipsychotic medication, treatment failure occurred in 56.5% as compared with 34.3 % of a matched group of continuous antipsychotic medication users. Several meta-analyses have examined mortality-related data with antipsychotic treatment. A meta-analysis of studies with follow-up periods of at least 1 year found that mortality was in - creased in individuals who did not receive antips ychotic medication as compared with those who were treated with an antipsychotic medication (pooled risk ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.46-0.76; P<0.001 based on 22,141 deaths in 715,904 patient years in 4 cohort studies) (Vermeulen et al. 2017). With con - tinuous treatment with clozapine, mortality was fo und to be lower in long-term follow-up (median 5.4years) as compared with treatment with other antipsychotic medications (mortality rate ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.36-0.85, P =0.007 based on 1,327 deaths in 217,691 patient years in 24 studies) (Vermeulen et al. 2019). On the basis of 10 RCTs (total N=776) with mean study duration of 18.6\u00b15.97 months, a meta- analysis of discontinuation studies (Kishi et al. 201 9) concluded that relapse rates were lower in indi - viduals with schizophrenia who continued treatmen t with an antipsychotic medication as compared with those who discontinued treatment (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35-0.62; P<0.00001; I 2=31%; NNT=3). An additional meta-analysis (Tho mpson et al. 2018), using somewhat different inclusion and exclu- sion criteria for studies, also found that relapse rates were lower in individuals who received main - tenance treatment ( N=230; 19%; 95% CI 0.05%-37%) as compared an- tipsychotic medication ( N=290; 53%; 95% CI 39%-68%). Although caution may be needed in interpreting these results becaus e of methodological considerations (Moncrieff and Steingard 2019), the findings align with expert opinion on th e benefits of maintenance treatment with an an - tipsychotic medication (Goff et al. 2017). Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for the Efficacy of Continuing Treatm ent With an Antipsychotic Medication Magnitude of effect: Large . The magnitude of effect is large in terms of lower relapse rates and lower mortality for individuals who received ma intenance treatment with antipsychotic medi- cations as compared with of of bias: Medium . Studies include RCTs of antipsycho tic discontinuation and observational studies using registry data. Although the registry studies have a greater risk of bias than RCTs, they use prospectively collected data an d have good observational study designs. Applicability: The included trials all involve individuals with schizophrenia. Some studies also include individuals with other diagnoses such as schizoaffective disorder. The doses of medica- The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 219 tion used are representative of usual clinical practice. The observational studies include data from a nationwide registry and have broad genera lizability, in contrast to RCTs with more re- strictive inclusion and exclusion criteria. However, the applicability of registry data from Nordic countries may be reduced by differences in the health care delivery system as compared with that of the United States. Directness: Direct . Studies measured relapse rates and mortality. Consistency: Consistent . Findings showing benefits of maintenance antipsychotic treatment are consistent among the different studies and study designs. Precision: Variable . Most meta-analyses have narrow confid ence intervals that do not cross the threshold for clinically significant benefit of tr eatment; however, some studies have wider con- fidence intervals. Dose-response relationship: Not assessed . Confounding factors: Unclear . It is possible that missing data or cohort-related effects may in - fluence the results from multiyear registry databases. For long-term follow-up studies, which are needed to assess long-term effects of antipsyc hotic medication, loss of individuals to follow- up and changes in treatment over time may also confound data interpretation. Publication bias: Not assessed. Overall strength of research evidence: High . Available studies include RCTs with a medium risk of bias. These RCTs are complemented by pr ospective registry studies with very large sam- ple sizes. Confidence intervals for most outcomes are relatively narrow, and findings are consis-tent in showing substantial benefit for co ntinued antipsychotic medication treatment. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for the Harms of Continuing Treatment With an Antipsychotic Medication See Statement 4, subsection \"Grading of the Ov erall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Harms of Antipsychotic Medications,\" earlier in the appendix. STATEMENT 6: Continuing the Same Medications APA suggests (2B) that patients with schizophreni a whose symptoms have improved with an antipsychotic medication continue to be tr eated with the same ant ipsychotic medication. * Evidence in support of this statement includes the evidence described for antipsychotic efficacy (see Statement 4 earlier in the appendix) and the evidence for continuing wi th antipsycho tic treat- ment (see Statement 5 earlier in the appendix). Ad diti onal evidence that specifically addresses this guideline statement comes fr om randomized trials of a change in antipsychotic medication. On the basis of these studies, the strength of research evidence is rated as moderate. The CATIE study provided important findings on medication changes (Essock et al. 2006). At the time of randomization, some individuals happene d to be randomly assigned to a medication that they were already taking, whereas other individu als were assigned to a different antipsychotic medication. Individuals who were assigned to change to a different antipsychoti c medication (N=269) had an earlier time to all-cause treatment discontinuation than those assigned to continue taking the same antipsychotic medication ( N=129; Cox proportional HR 0.69; P=0.007). Although a change from olanzapine to a different antipsycho tic medication was benefi cial in terms of weight gain, there were no other differences in outcom e measures for individuals who switched medica- tions as compared with those who continued with the same treatment (Rosenheck et al. 2009). *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. APA Practice Guidelines 220 Additional evidence comes from an RCT aimed at reducing the metabolic risk of antipsychotic treatment by changing medication from olanzapi ne, quetiapine, or risperidone to aripiprazole (Stroup et al. 2011). Individuals were followed for 24 weeks after being assigned to continue taking their current medication ( N=106) or to switch to aripiprazole ( N=109). Although the two groups did not differ in the proportion of individuals with medication efficacy (as measured by the PANSS total score or change in Clinical Global Impression [CGI] severity score), individuals who switched medication were more likely to stop medication (43.9% vs. 24.5%; P=0.0019), and treatment discon- tinuation occurred earlier in those who switched medication as compared with those who did not (HR 0.456, 95% CI 0.285-0.728; P=0.0010). However, modest but stat istically significant changes did occur in weight, serum non-high-density lipoprotei n cholesterol, and serum triglycerides in indi - viduals who switched to aripiprazole as compared with those who continued with olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone. Together, these findings suggest that changes in antipsychotic medications may be appropriate for addressing significant side effects such as weight or metabolic consid erations, but switching medications may also confer an increased risk of medication discontinuation, with associated risks of increased relapse and increased mortality. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for the Efficacy of Continuing th e Same Antipsychotic Medication Magnitude of effect: Moderate . Evidence from two RCTs sugges ts that a change in medication is associated with a moderate risk of earlier treatment discontinuation compared with continu - ing the same medication. Risk of bias: Medium . Studies are RCTs with a medium risk of bias based on their descriptions of randomization, blinding pr ocedures, and study dropouts. Applicability: The included trials all involve individuals with schizophrenia. Some studies also include individuals with other diagnoses such as schizoaffective disorder. The studies were con- ducted in the United States. Doses of medication used are representative of usual clinical prac- tice. The available RCTs examine changes in medi cation aimed at reducing metabolic effects of treatment, and a change from a high metabolic risk medication to a low metabolic risk medica- tion may not be representative of other medication changes. Directness: Indirect . Studies measure all-cause treatment discontinuation, which combines ef - fects due to inefficacy an d lack of tolerability. Consistency: Consistent . The two studies are consistent in showing benefits of continuing with the same antipsychotic medication. Precision: Precise. Confidence intervals are narrow and do not cross the threshold for clinically significant benefit of the intervention. Dose-response relationship: Not assessed . Confounding factors: Absent . Publication bias: Unable to be assessed . Overall strength of research evidence: Moderate . The two RCTs that assess changing from one antipsychotic to another have g ood sample sizes and a medium ri sk of bias. Their findings are consistent with each other and with the result s of studies discussed for Statements 4 and 5 on the benefits of antipsycho tic medication treatment. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for the Harms of Continuing the Same Antipsychotic Medication See Statement 4, subsection \"Grading of the Ov erall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Harms of Antipsychotic Medications,\" earlier in the appendix. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 221 STATEMENT 7: Clozapine in Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia APA recommends (1B) that patients with treatment-resi stant schizophrenia be treated with clozapine.* Evidence on clozapine comes from multiple RCTs, observational studies (including clinical trials and studies using administrative databases), and meta-analyses. In some instances, the studies were limited to individuals with treatment-resist ant schizophrenia, whereas in other studies a for- mal determination of treatment resistance was not reported or possible. Nevertheless, most infor- mation about clozapine will be of relevance to patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia because, in current practice, most individuals rece ive clozapine only after a lack of response to other treatments. In comparisons of SGAs, the AHRQ report (McD onagh et al. 2017) found that, independent of prior treatment history, clozapine improved core illness symptoms more than other SGAs (except for olanzapine) and was associated with a lower risk of suicide or suicide attempts than olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone (low SOE). In addition , in treatment-resistant patients, clozapine treat - ment was associated with a lower rate of treatment discontinuation due to lack of efficacy than the other SGAs that were studied. It is not clear whether rates of overall treatment discontinuation with clozapine may be influenced by the increased frequency of clinical interactions related to the more intensive monitoring with clozapine as compared with other antipsychotic medications. The AHRQ review drew on several meta-analyse s related to treatment-resistant schizophrenia (Ranasinghe and Sin 2014; Samara et al. 2016; Souz a et al. 2013); however, some additional studies are also relevant to this guideline statement. A meta-analysis by Siskind et al. (2016b) had consider- able overlap with the meta-analysis of Samara et al . (2016) in terms of the included studies. Despite this, the findings of the two meta-analyses were some what different, likely due to differences in the inclusion criteria and analytic approach (Samara and Leucht 2017). Samara et al. (2016) found few significant differences in outcomes and did not find clozapine to be significantly better than most other drugs in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Siskind et al. (2016b) found no difference for clozapine compared with other antipsychotic medications in long-term studies but did find clozapine to be superior to other medications in short-term studies and across all studies in reducing total psychotic symptoms (24 studies, N=1,858; P<0.005). Similarly, in terms of response to treatment (as reflected by a 20%-30% reduction in symptoms), clozapine showed higher rates of response than comparators in short-term studies of treatment-resistant schizophrenia (8 studies, total N=598 for clozapine, 620 for comparators; RR 1.17, 95% CI absolute risk reduction 12.48%, 95% CI 7.52-17.43; NNT=9). Again, however, studies that assessed long-term response showed no difference between clozapine and comparators. A greater benefit of clozapine than comparators was also seen when the analysis was limited to non-industry-funded trials (6 studies, N= 208; RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.20-2.35 ; P=0.002). In a subsequent meta-analysi s using data from the same studies, Siskind et al. (2017b) found that 40.1% of treatm ent-resistant individuals who received clozapine had a response, with a reduction of PANSS scores of 25.8% (22 points on the PANSS) from baseline. In an additional network meta-analysis of 32 antipsychotic medications, Huhn 402 head-to-head RCTs that included a total of 53,463 adult participants with acute symptoms and a diagnosi s of schizophrenia or a related disorder. Studies that focused on individuals with a first episode of psychosis or tr eatment resistance were excluded, as were studies in which individuals had concomitant medical illne sses or a predominance of negative or depressive symptoms. Only clozapine, amisulpride, zotepine, olanzapine, and risperidone exhibited greater efficacy than many other antipsychotic medications for overall symp toms, with the greatest benefit *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. APA Practice Guidelines 222 noted with clozapine (SMD -0.89, 95% CrI -1.08 to -0.71). Clozapine also was statistically better than placebo and the majority of the other antips ychotic medications in te 95% CrI -0.82 to -0.23). Findings from studies using administrative data bases also suggest benefits of treatment with clozapine. For example, a prospective nationwide study conducted over a 7.5-year period in Sweden (Tiihonen et al. 2017) found significantly reduced rates of rehospitalization with the use of clozapine as compared with no antipsychotic treatment (HR 0. 53, 95% CI 0.48-0.58). In addition, the reduction in rehospitalization with clozapin e was comparable to reductions in rehospitalization with LAI anti- psychotic medications, whereas other oral formulatio ns of antipsychotic medications had higher risks of rehospitalization. In comparison with oral olan zapine, clozapine had a lower rate of treatment fail- ure (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.53-0.63) that was comparable to the rate of treatment failure with LAI antipsy- chotic medications (range of HRs 0.65-0.80). Similar benefits of clozapine were found in analysis of prospective registry data from Finland ob- tained for all persons with schizophrenia who rece ived inpatient care from 1972 to 2014 (Taipale et al. 2018a). Of the 62,250 individual s in the prevalent cohort, 59% we re readmitted during follow-up time of up to 20 years (median follow-up durati on 14.1 years). Among oral antipsychotic medica - tions, clozapine was associated with the lowest risk for psychiatric read mission compared with no antipsychotic use (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.49-0.53) CI 0.58- 0.61). For the 8,719 individuals with a first episode of schizophrenia, risks of psychiatric readmission and all-cause readmission were also reduced (HR 0. 45, 95% CI 0.40-0.50 and HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.47- 0.56, respectively). A meta-analysis that examined effects of clozap ine on hospital use also found benefits for clozapine (Land et al. 2017). Although the vast ma jority of studies in the meta-analysis were obser - vational studies, use of clozapin e as compared with other antipsychotic medications was associated with a significant decrease in the proportion of individuals who were hospitalized (22 studies, N=44,718; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.69-0.80; P<0.001), although the time to re hospitalization did not differ. In terms of suicide risk, subjects in the InterSeP T study (Meltzer et al. 2003) who met criteria for treatment-resistant schizophrenia sh owed benefits of clozapine that were comparable to the bene - fits seen in the overall sample. For the sample as a whole, clozapine was superior to olanzapine in preventing significant suicide attempts or hospitalization to prevent suicide in high-risk patients (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58-0.97). Fewer clozapine-treated ( P=0.01) to prevent suicide; or required concomitant treatment ( P=0.01) or with anxiolytics or soporifics (P=0.03). Subjects treated with clozap ine were also less likely to have CGI severity of suicidality scale ratings of \"much worse\" or \"very much worse\" (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61-0.99) than subjects treated with olanzapine. In terms of mortality risk, a popu lation-based cohort study of 2,370 patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia found a higher rate of self-harm in individuals treated with non-clozapine antipsy- chotic medications than in those treated with cl (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.04-1.78) (Wimberley et al. 2017). There was also a higher rate of all-cause mortality in pa tients not receiving clozapine than in those treated with clozapine (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.16-3.05); however, the comparator group in- cluded individuals who were no t taking any antipsychotic medica tion. When the study subjects were limited to those who were adhering to trea tment, the higher mortality during treatment with other antipsychotic medications did not reach statistical significance. In the year after clozapine dis- continuation, an increase in mortality was observ ed (HR 2.65, 95% CI 1.47-4.78), consistent with benefits of clozapine treatment in reducing overall mortality. Another cohort study also found sig-nificant benefits of clozapine on all-cause mortality in individual s (adjusted HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38-0.97; P=0.04) (Cho et al. 2019). These findings are also consistent with results of a meta-analysis that showed significantly lower rates of long-term crude The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 223 mortality in patients who received continuous tr eatment with clozapine as compared with patients treated with other antipsychotic medications (mortality rate ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.36-0.85; P=0.007) (Vermeulen et al. 2019). In terms of side effects with clozapine, a network meta-analysis conducted as part of the AHRQ report (McDonagh et al. 2017) showed that clozap ine had a higher risk of study withdrawal due to adverse events than some other SGAs (low SOE) but did not show differences in overall rates of adverse events as compared with risperidone (low SOE). In the meta-analysis by Siskind et al. (2016b), individuals treated with clozapine had a higher likelihood of experiencing sialorrhea (P<0.001; number needed to NNH=19) than individuals treated with comparator antipsychotic medications. In the meta-analysis by Leucht et al. (2013), all- cause treatment discontinuation was less likely with clozapine than placebo (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.32- 0.65), as were extrapyramidal side effects (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.17-0.62). In contrast, weight gain (SMD 0.65, 95% CI 0.31-0.99) and sedati on (OR 8.82, 95% CI 4.72-15.06) we re more likely with clozapine than placebo. In an Australian national survey of 1,049 people with a diagnosis of sc hizophrenia or schizoaf - fective disorder who reported taking any antipsyc hotic medication (Siskind et al. 2017a), the pro- portion of individuals with diab etes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome was higher in individuals taking clozapine as compared with other antipsyc hotic medications (adjusted addition, clozapine ated with a greater proportion of in- dividuals with dry or watery mouth (adjusted OR 2.721; P<0.001), difficulty swallowing (adjusted OR 1.754; palpitations (adjusted OR 1.543; P<0.05). The proportion of individuals who re - ported trembling or shaking was significantly less in those treated with clozapine as compared with other antipsychotic agents (adjusted OR 0.581; P<0.01). In the network meta-analysis by Huhn et al. (2019), individuals treated with clozapine were less likely to require use of an anti parkinsonian medication (SMD 0. 46, 95% CrI 0.19-0.88) than those treated with other antipsychotic agents or placebo. However, clozapine was associated with a greater degree of weight gain (SMD 2.37, 95% CrI CrI 1.26-3.47) than placebo. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Efficacy of Clozapine in Tr eatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Magnitude of effect: Moderate . The magnitude of clozapine's effect varies with the study design and inclusion criteria. Some meta-analyses of RC Ts show no difference for clozapine, but most studies show significant benefit, at least in th e short term. Observational studies also show a magnitude of effect that is at least moderate. Risk of bias: Medium . Studies include RCTs and observationa l studies, primarily registry stud- ies. Most studies have some limitations based on their descriptions of randomization, blinding procedures, and study dropouts. Applicability: The included trials all involve individu als with schizophrenia. Some studies also include individuals with other diagnoses such as schizoaffective disorder. Most individuals who receive treatment with clozapine have had at least one trial of another antipsychotic med- ication, and most would meet usual clinical criteria for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, even when this is not well specified in the study description. The doses of medication used are rep- resentative of usual clinical practice. Directness: Variable . Studies measure psychotic symptoms, response to treatment, all-cause treatment discontinuation, psychi atric hospitalization, all-cause hospitalization, depression, APA Practice Guidelines 224 and mortality. Some of these outcomes are directly related to the review questions, and some are indirectly related. Consistency: Inconsistent. Although most meta-analyses and observational studies show bene - fits for clozapine, not all meta-analyses show superiority of clozapine to other antipsychotic medications in individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Precision: Variable . Some confidence intervals are narrow without overlapping the threshold for clinically significant benefits, whereas other confidence intervals are wide or overlapping. Dose-response relationship: Present . Increases in dose and corresponding increases in blood lev- els of clozapine appear to be related to improved clinical efficacy in nontoxic ranges of dosing. Confounding factors: Present . Confounding factors may increa se the observed effect. Addi- tional monitoring and an increased frequency of clinical contacts with clozapine may enhance the effects of the medication relative to other an tipsychotic medications, at least in observational studies. Publication bias: Unclear . Although publication bias for clozapine-specific studies was not tested, publication bias is relatively common in studies of psychopharmacology because of non- publication of negative studies. Overall strength of research evidence: Moderate . The available studies include RCTs of moder- ate quality and good sample sizes. The effect sizes for clozapine vary among meta-analyses and outcomes. However, most studies, including RC Ts and prospective observational studies, show benefits of clozapine as compared with other antipsychotic medications. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Harms of Clozapine Magnitude of effect: Moderate . The magnitude of effect is mode rate overall but varies with the specific side effect. As compared with other antipsychotic medications, clozapine is associated with a greater risk of weight gain, sialorrhea, se dation, metabolic effects, seizures, constipation, anticholinergic side effects, tachycardia, and di zziness but a lower risk of all-cause treatment discontinuation, extrapyramidal side effects, or need for anticholinergic medication. Risk of bias: Medium . Studies include RCTs and a large observational study of patient-reported side effects. RCTs are of low to medium risk of bias based on their descriptions of randomiza - tion, blinding procedures, and study dropouts, whereas the observational study has a high risk of bias. Applicability: The included trials all involve individuals with schizophrenia. Some studies also include individuals with other diagnoses such as schizoaffective disorder. The doses of medica-tion used are representative of usual clinical practice. Directness: Variable . Studies measure observed and reported side effects of clozapine, as well as treatment discontinuation (all cause and due to adverse effects). Consistency: Consistent . Study findings are consistent in the relative magnitude and direction of effects for specific side effect s and for treatment discontinuation. Precision: Precise. Confidence intervals are narrow and do not cross the threshold for clinically significant benefit of the intervention. Dose-response relationship: Not assessed . However, clinical observations suggest that many side effects do increase in occurrence or severity with the dose of clozapine. Confounding factors: Unclear . Not all studies assess side effects in a systematic fashion, and pa- tients may be less likely to report some side effects if they are not directly assessed. Publication bias: Not assessed . Nevertheless, publication bias is relatively common in studies of psychopharmacology because of nonp ublication of negative studies. Overall strength of research evidence: Low to moderate . Available studies include RCTs and an ob- servational study. Data from several meta-analyse s suggest a moderate strength of research evi- The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 225 dence for outcomes relate d to clozapine harms, but the AHRQ review found a low strength of re - search evidence in a network meta-analysis, and the observational study also has a high risk of bias. Other Interventions for Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Use of Antipsychotic Medica tions Other Than Clozapine The network analysis conducted as part of the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017) found that treatment-resistant patients had a small benefit with olanzapine over other older SGAs in core ill- ness symptom improvement and negative symptoms , whereas response rates and all-cause treat- ment discontinuations were not di fferent. Negative symptoms were also significantly reduced with olanzapine as compared with haloperidol (N =2,207; MD 1.28, 95% CI 0.11-2.44), and patients treated with ziprasidone showed better response than those treated with haloperidol ( N=120; RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.19-2.00). Electroconvulsive Therapy Some studies have shown evidence for benefits of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in combination with antipsychotic medications. Pompili et al. (2013) conducted a systematic review that included RCTs and observational studies, includ ing case-control studies, and concluded that ECT in combination with antipsychotic medications may be helpful for a subgroup of individuals who have treatment re- sistance, catatonia, aggression, or suicidal behavior, particularly when rapid improvement is needed. Zheng et al. (2016) conducted a systematic revi ew and meta-analysis of RCTs comparing anti- psychotic medications other than clozapine with antipsychotic medication in combination with ECT in patients with treatment-re sistant schizophrenia. In the 11 studies, which included 818 pa- tients, the addition of ECT was associated with greater improvements in symptoms (SMD -0.67; P<0.00001) and greater rates of st udy-defined P<0.0001; NNT=6) and remission (RR 2.18; P=0.0002; NNT=8) as greater rates of P=0.02; NNH=6) and memory impairment ( P=0.001; NNH=3). ECT augmentation of clozapine in tr eatment-resistant schizophrenia, Petrides et al. (2015) conducted a randomized, single-blind, 8- week trial in which patients who had not re - sponded to clozapine alone received a constant do se of clozapine or clozapine plus bilateral ECT (three times per week for 4 weeks and then twice w eekly for 4 weeks for 20 total treatments). Fifty percent of the 20 patients treate d with ECT plus clozapine experi enced a reduction in psychotic symptoms of at least 40% and also achieved a CGI improvement rating of \"much improved\" and a CGI severity rating of \"borderline mentally ill\" or \"not at all ill.\" This contrasts with 19 patients who received clozapine but not ECT in the randomized phase of the trial, none of whom showed response by these criteria. When the latter group of patients received ECT in the unblinded cross- over phase of the trial, the rate of response was 47%. Global cognitive outcomes did not differ for the two randomized groups. In contrast, in another randomized trial of 23 patients who received 12 sessions of ECT as compared with sham ECT, no differences were found in PANSS score reduc- tions, although both groups showed improvemen t during the study (Melzer-Ribeiro et al. 2017). Lally et al. (2016b) conducted a systematic review and found 5 trials (4 open-label studies plus the study by Petrides and colleagues, with a total of 71 subjects) in which the pooled response rate to clozapine plus ECT was 54%. When cohort stud ies, nonblinded randomiz ed trials, case series, and case reports were considered, the overall response rate for clozapine plus ECT was 76% (83 of 126 patients), even though clozapine doses and serum levels were relatively high (mean serum clozapine level of 772.6 ng/mL at a mean daily dose of 506.9 mg for the 52 pa tients with an available clozapine level; mean daily dose 412. 3 mg for the sample as a whole). G. Wang et al. (2018) conducted a systematic re view and meta-analysis of RCTs of ECT augmen - tation of clozapine for clozapine-resistant schizophrenia that included Chinese and non-Chinese studies. Findings from 18 RCTs that included 1,769 subjects showed benefits of adjunctive ECT com- APA Practice Guidelines 226 pared with clozapine alone for symptomatic impr ovement at Signific benefits of adjunctive ECT were also seen in study-defined response rates and in remission rates at both assessments (P<0.00001, NNT=3 and NNT=4, respectively, for response and P0.0001, NNT=13 and NNT=14, respectively, for remission); however, subjective me mory issues and headache were more frequent in the group that received adjunctive ECT ( P<0.0001, NNH=4 and P=0.005, NNH =8, respectively). These studies and meta-analyses suggest a beneficial effect of ECT in combin ation with antipsychotic medication in individuals with tr eatment-resistant schizophrenia and clozapine-resistan t schizophrenia despite the small number of studie s and low quality of observational trials. The increases in reported rates of headache and memory impa irment, however, suggest a need to weigh the potential benefits and risks of ECT for the individual pati ent as compared with the risks of treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Studies have also been done with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for treatment of hallu- cinations and for treatment of negative symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia. He et al. (2017) conducted a meta-analysis of studies publishe d in English or Chinese that studied low (1 Hz) or high (10 Hz) frequency TMS in individuals with schizophrenia. In 13 studies of 1 Hz TMS, audi- tory hallucinations showed greater improvement with active TMS as compared with sham treat - ment, but publication bias was noted, and sensitivit y analysis also indicated that the meta-analytic finding was unstable and likely to change with additional research. In 7 studies of 10 Hz TMS, there was no effect of active treatment on negative symptoms as compared with sham TMS. Aleman et al. (2018) conducted a meta-analysis of studies of TMS applied to the dorsolateral pre - frontal cortex as compared with sham TMS for treatment of negative sy mptoms and found a mean weighted effect size of 0.64 (0.32-0.96, total N=827); however, sham TMS showed a significant im- provement of negative symptoms from baseline to posttreatment, with a mean weighted effect size of 0.31 (0.09-0.52, total N=333). Interpretation of the findings was also complicated by the use of sev- eral different coil placements (i.e., right, left, bilateral) and variability in other stimulation parameters (e.g., frequency, intensity, number of stimuli per session, duration of treatment). A meta-analysis by Dollfus et al. (2016) of 13 parallel design trials of TMS for treatment of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia also showed a significant placebo effe ct, which was greatest with the 45\u00b0 position coil and was viewed as introducing substantial bias in determining TMS efficacy. In terms of addition of TMS to clozapine, Wagner et al. (2019b) used data from the TMS for the Treatment of Negative Symptoms in Schizophrenia (RESIS) trial and examined a subgroup of patients who received treatment with clozapin e with the addition of active ( N=12) or sham ( left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 3 weeks, with five treatment sessions per week. There was no effect of active TMS on negative symptoms, although there was significant benefit of TMS on secondary outcomes (i.e., PANSS positive symptom and general subscales; total PANSS). These findings on benefits of TMS may change with further research using larger samples and rigorous study designs; however, at present, there is limited evidence for benefits of TMS in reduc- ing either auditory hallucinations or negative symptoms, and findings are confounded by signifi- cant placebo effects and publication biases. STATEMENT 8: Clozapine in Suicide Risk APA recommends (1B) that patients with schizophrenia be treated with cloz apine if the risk for suicide attempts or suicide remains substantial despite other treatments.* *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 227 For individuals with schizophrenia who are at subs tantial risk for suicide, evidence on the use of clozapine comes from retrospective cohort studies and a large pragmatic, open-label RCT (N=980). Consequently, the strength of research evidence is rated as moderate. On the basis of findings from th e InterSePT study (Meltzer et al. 2003), theAHRQ report (McDonagh et al. 2017) concluded that clozapine was superior to olanzapine in preventing significant suicide at- tempts or hospitalization to prev ent suicide in high-ris k patients (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58-0.97; moderate SOE). Fewer clozapine-treate d patients in the InterSeP suicide ( P=0.03); required concomitant treat- or soporifics ( P=0.03). Although there was not a significant difference in suicide deaths (5 for cl ozapine and 3 for olanzapine) , Kaplan-Meier life table estimates indicated a significant reduction in th e 2-year event rate in the clozapine group ( P=0.02), with an NNT of 12. Data from other RCT s, in which suicide-related outcomes were reported as adverse events, showed very low event rates and no differences among antipsychotic medications. One large retrospective study (Kiviniemi et al. 2013) used a nationwide registry to follow up with patients presenting with a fi rst episode of schizophrenia ( N=6,987). At 5 years, the risk of suicide in patients treated with clozapine was significantly reduced (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.14-0.63), whereas suicide risk in those treated with risperidone, ol anzapine, or quetiapine was comparable to the risk with no antipsychotic treatment. Another large nationwide study (N =9,567) of patients newly start - ing treatment with SGAs found lower rates of suic ide attempts in those beginning with clozapine as compared with other drugs studied (Bitter et al. 201 3). Suicide attempt rates were 1.1% at 1 year in those treated with clozapine in contrast to suicide attempt rates that ranged from 2.1% to 3.7% for other SGAs at 1 year. The suicide attempt rate with clozapine treatment was also reduced as com-pared with the 6 months prior to clozapine initia tion (2.2% prior to clozapine as compared with 1.1% after clozapine initiation). For a discussion of the evidence related to the side effects of clozapine, see Statement 7 earlier in the appendix. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Efficacy of Clozapine in Individu als With Substantial Risk Factors for Suicide Attempts or Suicide Magnitude of effect: Moderate to large . In the randomized controlled InterSePT study, moderate effects are present for clozapine as compared with olanzapine in reducing suicide attempts and hospitalizations to prevent suicide. As compared with other antipsychotic medications, larger effects of clozapine on suicide attempts and suicide are found in observational registry studies with longer periods of follow-up and larger sample sizes. Risk of bias: Medium . Studies include an RCT and observational studies. There is low risk of bias in the RCT on most outcomes but a medium to high risk of bias for the observational studies because of their lack of randomization, lack of blinding, and retrospective study design. Applicability: The included trials all involve individu als with schizophrenia. Some studies also include individuals with other diagnoses such as schizoaffective disorder. Doses of clozapine used in the RCT are representative of usual clinical pr actice. In addition, the RCT includes individuals with an increased risk of suicide, whereas the observational studies assessed suicide-related out- comes without preselecting for high-risk individuals. Neverthe less, rates of suicide are in- creased among individuals with schizophrenia, making the observational study findings of relevance to routine clinical practice. Directness: Variable . In the RCT, studies measured suicide attempts and deaths due to suicide, but mortality was infrequent, making statistical comparisons invalid. For the observational studies, suicide attempts and deaths from suicide were also studied. Nevertheless, observational study findings are indirect because of the lack of se lection of patients at high risk of suicide. APA Practice Guidelines 228 Consistency: Consistent . Reductions in suicide attempts are consistent in the RCT and in obser- vational studies. The reduction in suicide deaths in larger samples with longer follow-up periods is consistent with the reduction in suicide attempts. Precision: Precise. Confidence intervals are narrow and do not cross the threshold for clinically significant benefit of the intervention. Dose-response relationship: Not assessed . Confounding factors: Present . In the RCT, effects on suicide deaths may be reduced by the need to intervene with increased monitori ng, hospitalization, or study withdrawal if suicidal risk is sig- nificant. Additional monitoring and an increased frequency of clinical contacts with clozapine may enhance the effects of the medication relative to other antipsychotic medications, at least in observational studies. Publication bias: Unable to be assessed . The small number of relevant studies makes assessment of publication bias impossible. Overall strength of research evidence: Moderate . In terms of clozapine effects on suicidal behav- iors and suicide, available studies include an RCT and several observational studies with large samples and long periods of follow-up. Confidence intervals are relatively narrow, and the find- ings are consistent. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Harms of Clozapine in Individua ls With Substantial Risk Factors for Suicide Attempts or Suicide See Statement 7, subsection \"Grading of the Ov erall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Harms of Clozapine,\" earlier in the appendix. STATEMENT 9: Clozapine in Aggressive Behavior APA suggests (2C) that patients with schizophrenia be treated with clozapine if the risk for aggressive behavior remains subs tantial despite other treatments. * Evidence for the use of clozapine for individuals wi th substantial aggressive behavior is limited, and the strength of research evidence is rated as low. A systematic review on pharmacological management of persistent hostility and aggression in persons with schizophrenia spectrum disorders found 92 ar- ticles with sufficient methodological information to evaluate, although none were at low risk of bias (Victoroff et al. 2014). The authors found two studies (1 RCT, N=157; 1 open-label, N=44) showing that in inpatients with sp ectrum disorders, clozapine was su perior to haloperidol in reducing scores on the Overt Aggression Scale (Conley et al. 2003; Ratey et al. 1993). tive inpatients ( N=100) to haloperidol or olan- zapine in reducing scores on the Overt Aggression Scale (Krakowski et al. 2006, 2008). In reducing hos - tility (as measured by PANSS or BPRS hostility items), 4 RCTs (3 in inpatients, 1 in outpatients) reported superiority of clozapine as compared with FGAs. Two of these studies ( N=48 and with chlorpromazine (Claghorn et al. 1987; Niskanen et al. 1974), and the other 2 studies (N=167 and N=71) compared clozapine with haloperidol (Citrome et al. 2001; Kane et al. 2001). These findings support the opinions of many expert s in viewing clozapine as beneficial in patients at substantial risk of aggressive behaviors. Nevertheless, additional evidence from well-designed clinical trials is needed. For a discussion of the ev idence related to the side effects of clozapine, see Statement 7 earlier in the appendix. *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 229 Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Efficacy of Clozapine in Individu als With Substantial Risk Factors for Aggressive Behaviors Magnitude of effect: Unclear . Available studies report statistical superiority, but there are no good estimates of the magnitude effect either within or among studies. Risk of bias: High . Most of the available studies, includin g RCTs and open-label studies, have a significant risk of bias and a lack of reported details about randomization, blinding, and other features of study design. Applicability: The included trials all involve individu als with schizophrenia. Some studies also include individuals with other diagnoses such as schizoaffective disorder. Most studies are fo-cused on inpatients, including forensic psychiat ry populations, who exhibit physically assaul - tive behavior. The doses of medication used are within normal to high dose ranges for usual clinical practice. Directness: Variable . Studies measure multiple different outcomes, including hostility items on PANSS or BPRS, time in restraint, episodes of restraint, and episodes of assaultive behavior. Consistency: Consistent . Studies generally report reductions in hostility or aggressive behavior. Precision: Unknown . Confidence intervals are not reported in all studies or in the available meta- analysis. Nevertheless, a lack of precision is likely due to the small samples in most studies. Dose-response relationship: Not assessed . Confounding factors: Present . In observational outpatient studies, additional monitoring and an increased frequency of clinical contacts with clozapine may enhance medication effects rela- tive to other antipsychotic medications. The high risk of bias in many of these studies suggests that confounding factors may be present but unrecognized. Publication bias: Unable to be assessed . The relatively small number of studies and the heteroge- neity of study designs make it difficult to assess publication bias. However, publication bias seems possible because of the tendency for negati ve clinical trial results to go unpublished. Overall strength of research evidence: Low. The available studies include RCTs and open-label studies with a high risk of bias. Although the findings are consistent, the applicability to typical clinical practice is limited. Other sources of possible bias were unable to be assessed but are likely to be present.

STATEMENT 10: Long-Acting Injectable Antipsychotic Medications APA suggests treatment with a long-acting injectable antipsy- chotic medication if they prefer such treatment or if they ha ve a history of poor or uncer- tain adherence.* *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. APA Practice Guidelines 230 Evidence for this guideline statement comes fr om the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017) as well as from other RCTs, registry database studies, cohort studies, \"mirror image\" studies, and meta-analyses of such trials. The findings from these studies are mixed because RCTs show few dif - ferences in outcomes between LAI antipsychoti c medications and oral antipsychotic agents, whereas observational trials show consistent bene fits of LAI formulations. There are a number of possible explanations for these apparent disparities related to the design of the studies and differ- ences in study populations (Correll et al. 2016; Fagiolini et al. 2017). Indi viduals who are agreeable to participating in a randomized clinical trial are more likely to be adherent to treatment than a broader population of individuals with a particular diagnosis. A greater focus on adherence-related questions and a greater frequency of visits may occur in an RCT as compared with treatment as usual, which may also influence adherence or ou tcomes. Consequently, the possible advantages of LAIs over oral formulations in promoting or assuring adherence may be less salient in RCT s as compared with observational trials. Although each type of study has advantages and disadvan-tages, observational trials that use registry da tabases are also able to examine outcomes among large numbers of individuals over many years of follow-up in contrast to the smaller numbers and shorter follow-up periods of RCTs. In the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017), the ability to draw conclusions about the compar- ative effectiveness of LAI antips ychotic medications is limited by the relatively small number of head-to-head comparison studies among LAI antipsychotic medications or for LAI formulations as compared with oral agents. Few studies assessed differences in symptoms with treatment, but clozapine was noted to be superior to aripiprazole LAI (monthly or every 6 weeks), olanzapine LAI, paliperidone LAI (monthly and every 3 months), and risperidone LAI, whereas paliperidone LAI every 3 months was superior to oral lurasidone (low SOE). For the few comparisons where data on response were available, no differences were found (low SOE). Risperidone LAI was significantly better than quetiapine in social function over 24 months but did not differ from quetiapine on mea- sures of quality of life (low SOE). No difference in social function was found between monthly pal - iperidone palmitate LAI and biweekly risperidone LAI (low SOE). In terms of quality of life, oral aripiprazole and monthly aripiprazole LAI did not differ from one another with up to 2 years of follow-up (low SOE). In terms of findings on harms, a network meta -analysis of 90 head-to-head RCTs showed that risperidone LAI had a significantly lower risk of withdrawal due to adverse events than clozapine (OR 0.27, 0.40, 95% CI 0.20-0.82). No differences in overall adverse events were found between aripiprazole as compared with monthly aripiprazole LAI or between paliperidone or monthly paliperidone palmitate LAI as compared with risperidone LAI (low SOE). In addition, no differences in extrapyramidal side effects were seen in a 28-week trial of aripiprazole and mont hly paliperidone LAI or a network meta-analysis comparing monthly and 4- to 6-week aripiprazole LAI. However, monthly aripiprazole LAI had a greater incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (RR 1.88) and worse akathisia than oral aripipra - zole in the short term but not at 1 year. For mort ality, no significant difference was found between monthly paliperidone palm itate LAI versus risperidone LAI (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.21-7.49) on the ba - sis of 2 RCTs of 4-24 mont hs' duration (low SOE). A number of other meta-analyses of RCTs are also available and provide complementary infor- mation to the findings in the AHRQ review. Ostuzzi et al. (2017) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs that compared the oral an d LAI formulations of the same antipsychotic med- ication and included risperidone (6 studies), olanza pine studies), aripiprazole (3 studies), zuclo- penthixol (1 study), fluphenazine (7 studies), and haloperidol (2 studies). There was a small benefit for aripiprazole LAI (2 studies, N =986; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.95; hi gh with oral aripiprazole for all-cause discon tinuation, a small benefit for or al olanzapine as compared with olanzapine LAI for discontinuation due to inefficacy (2 studies, N=1,445; RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.12-2.07; low SOE), and a small benefit for risperidone LAI as compared with oral risperidone for hyperpro- The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 231 lactinemia (5 studies, N=891; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68-0.98; mo derate SOE). The other comparisons showed no differences for these outcomes, and there were also no differences noted for nonre - sponse rate, relapse rate, dropouts for adverse ev ents, extrapyramidal symptoms, or weight gain. Kishimoto et al. (2014) examined the relative ef ficacy of LAI antipsychotic medications as com- pared with oral antipsychotic medi cations in relapse prevention and found that LAIs were similar to oral agents in outpatient studies lasting 1 year (12 studies; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.71-1.07; P=0.31) and at the longest study time poin t across all settings (21 studies, N=4,950; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.80- 1.08; P=0.35). When analyzed by drug, fluphenazine LAI showed greater benefit than oral antipsy- chotic agents in preventing relapse (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.96; P=0.02); however, the authors note that this may be mediated by a cohort effect rath er than a drug-specific effect because all of the fluphenazine studies predated 1992. For drug ineffi cacy, calculated as the sum of relapses plus dis- continuations due to inefficacy, fluphenazine LAI was again superi or to oral antipsychotic (8 studies, N=826; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66-0.91; P=0.002), whereas antipsychotic ( N=1,445; RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.12-2.07; P =0.007). In preventing hospitalization, fluphenazine LAI was also superior to oral antips ychotic agents studies, N=197; RR 0.82, , P=0.04); however, pooled data for LAIs as compared with oral antipsychotic agents showed no statistically significant effects (10 studies, N=2,296; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75-1.03; P=0.09). No differences in all-cause discontinuation were noted in pooled analyses or for individual the efficacy of pali peridone LAI or risper- idone LAI as compared with oral antipsychotic agents in patients with a recent-onset psychotic dis-order. Although there was significant heterogene ity in the study findings, LAIs and oral agents were comparable overall in relapse prevention (3 studies; N=875). The LAIs did have fewer study discontinuations because of in efficacy (RR 0.34, NNT=-50) or nonadherence (RR 0.30, NNT=-33), but LAIs also had a higher incidence of tremor (RR 2.38) or at least one adve rse effect (RR 1.13). In terms of mortality with LAIs as compared with oral antipsychotic agents, another meta-analysis of 52 RCTs (Kishi et al. 2016a) found no difference between LAIs and placebo or oral antipsychotics in all-cause death or death due to suicide (total N=17,416; LAI antipsychotics=11,360, oral antipsychotics=3,910, and placebo= Another RCT, the Preventing Relapse Oral Anti psychotics Compared to Injectables Evaluating Efficacy (PROACTIVE) study (P. F. Buckley et al. 2015), was a multis ite trial conducte d at 8 academic centers in the United States. The researchers random ly assigned patients with schizophrenia or schi- zoaffective disorder to risperidone LAI or the physic ian's choice of an oral SGA for up to 30 months. Subjects were outpatients who were neither resist ant to treatment nor experiencing a first episode of psychosis. Approximately half of the subjects ( 161 of 305) discontinued treatment before the end of the trial. There was no significant difference noted in the proportion with a relapse (42% for risperidone LAI vs. 32% time to hospi- talization In addition, no sign ificant differences between risperidone LAI and oral SGAs were noted for the bulk of symptom ratings (anx iety-depression, negative symptoms, excitement, affective flattening, avolition, asociality-anhe donia, CGI severity and CGI improvement). How- ever, changes in symptom scores did differ between the treatment arms, with lower Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) alogia scores with oral SGAs and greater improvement in psychotic symptoms and BRPS total scores with risperidone LAI. In patients followed after an initial relapse, 32 (11%) had two relapses, and 13 (4%) had three relapses, with no significant differ-ences in the rate or time to successive relapse between those treated with risperidone LAI and those treated with oral SGAs (Buckley et al. 2016). In contrast to the findings from RCTs, observational studies often find benefits of LAI antipsychotic formulations as compared with oral antipsychotic formulations. Tiihonen et al. (2017) used a pro-spective national database in Sweden (with indivi duals as their own controls) to examine the risk of treatment failure, which was defined as psychiatric rehospitalization, admissi ons due to a suicide at- APA Practice Guidelines 232 tempt, discontinuation of antipsychotic medication or switch to another antipsychotic medication, or death. Of the 29,823 patients, 43.7% were rehospit alized, and 71.7% met criter ia for treatment failure. The LAI formulations of antipsychotic medications we re associated with a 20%-30% lower risk of re- hospitalization as compared with oral formulatio ns of an antipsychotic (HR 0.78, 95% CI the total cohort; HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.86 for the incident cohort). For specific LAI antipsy- chotic medications as compared with no use of an tipsychotic medication, rehospitalization risk was lowest with (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44-0.77). Of the oral medications, re hospitalization rates were lowest with clozapine (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.48-0.58). Rates of treatment fa ilure were also lowest with clozapine (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.53-0.63 ) and with LAI antipsychotic formulations as compared with other oral formula - tions (HR values for LAI formulations: perphena and risperidone LAI Tiihonen et al. (2011) also comp ared LAI antipsychotics with their equivalent oral formulation in a nationwide cohort of 2,588 consecutive patients in Finland who had an initial admission with a diagnosis of schizophreni a. Of those individuals, only 58.2% used an antipsychotic medication af - ter discharge, and 45.7% of the cohort continued to take an antipsychotic for at least 30 days. For rehospitalization as well as for all-cause discon tinuation, LAI antipsychotic had a lower adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) than the equivalent oral formulation (aHR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17-0.75; P=0.007 and aHR P=<0.0001, respectively). For each LAI antipsychotic as compared with its oral equivalent, rehospitalization was lower with haloperidol LAI (aHR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01-1.13; P=0.06) but not LAI (aHR (aHR 0.30-1.08; P=0.09). Use of an LAI antipsychotic wa s also associated with lower rates of all-cause discontinuation for haloperidol LAI, pe rphenazine LAI, and risperidone LAI as compared with their oral equivalents (aHR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08-0.88; P=0.03; CI 0.31-0.62; P=<0.0001, respectively). Zuclopenthixol LAI showed no difference from its equivalent oral formulation in either rehospitalization or all-cause discontinuation. Taipale et al. (2018a) used the sa me nationwide Finnish health care registry to assess the long- term effectiveness of antipsychotic medications on the risk of psychiatry rehospitalization over fol- low-up periods of up to 20 years (median of 14.1 years). The sample included a prevalence cohort of 62,250 individuals as we ll as 8,719 individuals who were foll owed prospectively after a first ep- isode of psychosis. The risk of psychiatric rehospitalization was lower with LAI antipsychotic med-ications than with oral antipsychotic formulations (LAI FGAs CI FGAs 95% CI 0.53- 0.61) in first-episode patients, as was risk of all-cause hospitalization (LAI FGAs HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.69, 95% CI 0.66-0.73), with similar patterns noted in the prevalence cohort. A nationwide registry was also used by Taipale et al. (2018b) to examine all-cause mortality and its relationship to medication treatment among patients with schizophrenia in Sweden. Informa- tion was available on 29,823 indivi duals between 2006 and 2013, of wh ich 4,603 patients were in the incident cohort. For LAI SGAs, the cumulative mo rtality rate was about one-third lower than the mortality rate for equivalent oral antipsychotics in pairwise analyses (aHRs 0.67, 95% CI 0.56-0.80). Those taking an LAI formulation of an SGA had the lowest cumula tive mortality (7.5%), with me- dian follow-up of 6.9 years. Corresponding rates of cumulative mortality were 8.5% for oral SGAs, 12.2% for oral FGAs, 12.3% for LAI FGAs, and 15.2% in those who were not taking an antipsychotic medication. As compared with LAI SGAs, corresponding aHRs were 1.52 (95% CI 1.13-2.05) for oral FGAs, and 3.39 (95% CI 2.53-4.56) in those who were not taking an antipsychotic medication. MacEwan et al. (2016b) used a multistate databa se of U.S. Medicaid patients to examine the probability of rehospitalization after an index admission with LAI antipsychotic treatment as com- The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 233 pared with oral antipsychotic treatment. Using multivariate logistic regression with propensity score matching for 1,450 patients with a diagnosi s of schizophrenia, an LAI antipsychotic medica - tion was associated with a lower probability of readmission at 60 days postdischarge (adjusted OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.90) but not at 30 days postdischarge. Kishimoto and colleagues conducted meta-analyses of cohort studies and mirror image studies to compare the effectiveness of LAIs versus oral antipsychotic agents in terms of hospitalization and treatment discontinuation (Kishimoto et al. 2013, 2018). On the basis of 42 prospective and ret - rospective cohort studies (total N=101,624; mean follow-up18.6\u00b110.0 months), LAIs were found to be superior to oral antipsychotics in term s of all-cause discontinuations (10 studies, risk ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.67-0.91 ; P=0.001) and hospitalization rates (1 studies, 68,009 person-years; rate ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.93 ; P<0.001) but not hospitalization risk or days of hospitalization (Kishimoto et al. 2018). However, the patients treated with an LAI antipsychotic medication had longer illness durations than those treated with oral formulations of an tipsychotic medication, which may have influenced the findings. In 25 mirror image studies that followed patients for at least 6 months before and after a transition betw een medication formulations, LAI antipsychotic med- ications were superior to oral antipsychotic medi cations in preventing hospitalization (16 studies, N=4,066; risk ratio 0.43, 95% CI 0.35-0.53; P<0.001) and in decreasing th e number of hospitalizations (15 studies, 6,342 person-years; rate ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.28-0.51; P<0.001) (Kishimoto et al. 2013). Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for the Efficacy of LAI Antipsychotic Medications Magnitude of effect: Variable . In RCTs, there are few differences in outcomes between LAI and oral formulations of antipsychotic medications. However, significant be nefits with a moderate magnitude of effect are noted in observational studies, including prospective registry database studies and mirror image studies. Risk of bias: Medium . Studies include RCTs that have some limitations in study design or re- porting of features such as randomization or blinding. Observational studies based on prospec- tive registry data are well designed but have at least a medium risk of bi as because of a lack of randomization or blinding. Applicability: The included trials all involve individu als with schizophrenia. Some studies also include individuals with schizoaffective disorder. The doses of medication used are not always stated but appear to be representative of usual clinical practice. The observational studies in- clude data from a nationwide registry and have broad generalizability, in contrast to RCTs with more restrictive inclusion and exclusion criter ia. However, the applicability of registry data from Nordic countries may be reduced by differences in the health care delivery system as com- pared with that of the United States. Directness: Variable . Most studies measure direct outcomes , including differences in symptoms, quality of life, functioning, relapse prevention, and rehospitalization. However, some studies as-sess indirect outcomes, including all-cause treatment discontinuation. Consistency: Inconsistent . RCTs generally show little or no benefit of LAI as compared with oral formulations of antipsychotic medications, whereas observational studies show moderate ben- efits. However, findings are consistent for different types of observational studies, including prospective registry database st udies and mirror image analyses. Precision: Imprecise . For RCTs, confidence intervals cross the threshold for clinically significant benefit of the intervention. Dose-response relationship: Not assessed . Confounding factors: Unclear . may be pres ent for the observational stud- ies because of the lack of randomization. Individuals with poor adherence or more severe symp - toms may be more likely to receive an LAI, wh ich would give LAI-treate d patients a greater risk of relapse or rehospitalization. APA Practice Guidelines 234 Publication bias: Not suspected. Publication bias was not detected in the meta-analyses that spe- cifically examined this question. Overall strength of research evidence: Moderate . Available evidence includes data from several types of observational studies, each of which shows consistent benefits for LAI as compared with oral formulations of antipsychotic medicati on. The potential benefit of LAI formulations in assuring adherence may not be ob servable in RCTs in which patients are already selected for high adherence. Although trials are of varying qu ality, most have good sample sizes. When ben- eficial effects are noted, most confidence interv als are narrow. There is some variation from drug to drug, but registry data show better outcomes with LAI formulations as a group as compared with oral formulations of antipsychotic medication as a group. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for the Harms of LAI An tipsychotic Medications Magnitude of effect: Variable . In general, there appear to be few differences between harms of LAI antipsychotic medications and oral formulations of antipsyc hotic medications, particularly when LAI and oral formulations of the same drug are compared. When differences are noted in rates of specific side effects, the magnitude of those effects is small. Risk of bias: Medium . In RCTs, some limitations in study design are present. In other studies, harms of treatment were not systematically assessed. Applicability: The included trials all involve individuals with schizophrenia. Some studies also include individuals with other diagnoses such as schizoaffective disorder. The doses of medica- tion used are not always stated but appear to be representative of usual clinical practice. The ob- servational studies include data from a nationwi de registry and have broad generalizability, in contrast to RCTs with more restrictive inclusio n and exclusion criteria. However, the applicabil - ity of registry data from Nordic countries may be reduced by differences in the health care de - livery system as compared with that of the United States. Directness: Variable . When assessments of adverse effects are conducted, studies measure spe- cific side effects. However, other studies measure study withdrawals due to adverse effects. Consistency: Inconsistent. Some comparisons show differences between LAI and oral formula- tions on specific side effects, but these are no t consistent among medications or meta-analyses. Precision: Imprecise . Confidence intervals cross the threshold for clinically significant benefit of the intervention. Dose-response relationship: Not assessed . Data from studies of oral medications suggest that in- creases in dose are likely to be associated with increases in medication side effects. Confounding factors: Unclear . Adverse effects are not always assessed in a systematic fashion, and reporting biases may be present. Publication bias: Not suspected. Publication bias was not detected in the meta-analyses that spe- cifically examined this question. Overall strength of research evidence: Low. Available studies include RCTs that assess side ef - fects of LAI and oral formulations of antips ychotic medications. Me ta-analyses and network meta-analyses are also available that include head -to-head comparison tria ls. In terms of ascer - tainment and reporting of information on side effects, studies have at least a medium risk of bias, and there is significant inconsistency in the findings among the available studies, making it difficult to draw conclusions with any degree of confidence. STATEMENT 11: Anticholinergic Medications for Acute Dystonia APA recommends (1C) that patients who have acute dyst onia associated wi th antipsychotic therapy be treated with an anticholinergic medication. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 235 This recommendation is based on expert opinion and is supported by studies of the prophylactic use of anticholinergic medications to reduce the risk of acute dystonia in the initial phases of anti- psychotic therapy. The strength of research evidence for this guideline statement is rated as low. No studies were found that specifically examined the treatment of acute dystonia with anticholinergic medications in a randomized or controlled manne r, although intramuscula r administration of an anticholinergic agent is widely vi ewed as the treatment of choice for acute dystonia associated with antipsychotic therapy (Sta nilla and Simpson 2017). Information on the use of anticholinergic medica tions to prevent acute dystonia associated with antipsychotic therapy comes from a review of 9 studies (Arana et al . 1988), of which 4 were random- ized, blinded trials (total N=232); 2 were open trials (total N=856); and 3 were retrospective studies (total N=278). On the basis of data from all of these studies, prophylactic use of an anticholinergic medication was associated with 1. 9-fold reduction in risk of acut e dystonia (14.8% without prophy- laxis vs. received a high-potency antipsychotic agent (e.g., haloperidol), the benefits of pr ophylactic anticholinergic medication were even more pronounced (5.4-fold reduction in risk; 46.8% without prophylaxis vs. 8.7% with prophylaxis). A subsequent study of consecut ive psychiatric admissions ( N=646) showed a lower rate of acute dystonia in patients who receiv ed anticholinergic prophylaxis anticholinergic prophylaxis), and rates of acute dystonia were greater in in- dividuals treated with a high-pot ency antipsychotic agent 1993). A small RCT ( N=29) showed a decrease in acute dystonia associated with antipsychotic therapy in patients who received benztropine as compared with placebo, but the results did not reach statistical signif - icance (Goff et al. 1991). These studies suggest th erapeutic effects of anti cholinergic medications in acute dystonia associated with antipsychotic therapy, and although the studies were conducted in patients who received FGAs, they likely would also apply to acute dystonia when it occurs with use of SGAs. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Anticholinergic Medications for Acute Dystonia On the basis of the limitations of the evidence for anticholinergic medica tions for acute dystonia, no grading of the body of research evidence is possible. STATEMENT 12: Treatments for Parkinsonism APA suggests (2C) the following options for patients who have parkinsonism associated with antipsychotic therapy: lowering the do sage of the antipsychotic medication, switch - ing to another antipsychotic medication, or tr eating with an anticholinergic medication. This statement is based on expert opinion, and, consequently, the strength of research evidence is rated as low. Knowledge of pharmacology and pharmacokinetics suggests that side effects such as parkinsonism may be diminished by reducing th e dose of a medication or changing to a medi- cation with a different side-effect profile and a lesser propensity for treatment-related parkinson- ism. Clinical experience also suggests that an anticholinergic medication can be used to treat antipsychotic-associated parkinsonism (Stanilla and Simpson 2017). A good-quality systematic re - view assessed the use of anticholinergic medication compared with placebo for parkinsonism asso-ciated with antipsychotic therapy (Dickenson et al . 2017). Although many studies of anticholinergic treatment for parkinsonism were conducted decade s ago and suggested benefits of anticholiner- gics, few of these studies met the systematic review's inclusion criteria. In addition, sample sizes in the two included studies were small, and no definitive conclusions could be drawn from the sys- tematic review. APA Practice Guidelines 236 Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Treatments for Parkinsonism On the basis of the limitations of the evidence fo r treatments for parkinsonism, no grading of the body of research evidence is possible. STATEMENT 13: Treatments for Akathisia APA suggests (2C) the following options for patients who have akathisia associated with antipsychotic therapy: lowering the dosage of the antipsychotic me dication, switching to another antipsychotic medication, adding a be nzodiazepine medication, or adding a beta- adrenergic blocking agent. This statement is based on expert opinion, and, consequently, the strength of research evidence is rated as low. Knowledge of phar macology and pharmacokinetics sugge sts that side effects such as akathisia may be diminished by reducing the dose of a medication or changing to a medication with a different side-effect profile and a lesser propensi ty for treatment-related akathisia. A good-quality systematic review identified some benefits of be nzodiazepines for akathisi a associated with anti- psychotic therapy (Lima et al. 2002), but only 2 studies (total N=27) met the inclusion criteria. An- other good-quality systematic review assessed the use of -adrenergic blocking agents in akathisia and also found insufficient evidence to draw conc lusions about therapeutic benefits (3 RCTs, total N=51; Lima et al. 2004). In addition, no reliable evidence was found to support or refute the use of anticholinergic agents as compared with placebo fo r akathisia associated with antipsychotic therapy (Rathbone and Soares-Weiser 2006). The literature search did not identify well-designed trials pub- lished after these systematic reviews that shed addi tional light on any of th ese treatment approaches. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Treatments for Akathisia On the basis of the limitations of the evidence fo r treatments for akathisia, no grading of the body of research evidence is possible. STATEMENT 14: VMAT2 Medications for Tardive Dyskinesia APA recommends (1B) that patients who have moderate to severe or disabling tardive dys- kinesia associated with antipsychotic therapy be treated with a reversible inhibitor of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). This statement is based on information from a good-quality systematic review (Solmi et al. 2018b) on deutetrabenazine and valbenazine trea tment; information on tetrabenazine comes from less robust clinical trials. The strength of resear ch evidence for this guideline statement is rated as moderate. For deutetrabenazine, data were available from 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs (Anderson et al. 2017; Fernandez et al. 2017) that enrolled su bjects with moderate to severe tardive dyskinesia. Each trial lasted 12 weeks, and the dosage of deutetrabenazine was 12-48 mg/day. Treatment with deutetrabenazine was associated with a significant decrease in total Abnormal Involuntary Move- ment Scale (AIMS) scores to -2.19, P<0.001) and significantly greater rates of response (defined as an AIMS score reduction of at least 50%; RR The rate of treatment respon se increased with treatment The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 237 duration during the open-label extension phase of the study (Hauser et al. 2019). Deutetrabenazine was well tolerated, with trial completion rates and rates of adverse effects similar to rates with pla - cebo (Solmi et al. 2018b). For valbenazine, data were available from 4 do uble-blind, placebo-controlled trials (total N=488) of 4-6 weeks each valbenazine dosage of 12.5-100 mg/day 2017b; Correll et al. 2017a; Factor et 2017; Hauser et al. 2017; Josiassen et al. 2017; Kane et al. 2017; O'Brien et al. 2015). Treatment with valbenazine was associ- ated with a significant decrea to -3.05, P<0.001) and significantly greater response 1.81-5.11, benazine, as with deutetrabenazine, the rate of treatment response increased with treatment dura - tion during the open-label exte nsion phase of the study (Factor et al. 2017). Furthermore, in the randomized KINECT 3 study, a dose-response rela tionship was observed, with greater benefit at dosages of 80 mg/day as compared with 40 mg/day (Hauser et al. 2017). Valbenazine was well tol- erated, with trial completion rate s and rates of adverse effects that were similar to rates with pla - cebo (Solmi et al. 2018b). For tetrabenazine, prospective pl acebo-controlled data are more limited and include a single- blind trial of 20 subjects (Ondo et al. 1999), a do uble-blind crossover tria l of 6 subjects (Godwin- Austen and Clark 1971), and another double-blind cr ossover trial of 24 subjects (Kazamatsuri et al. 1972). Although benefits of tetrabenazine were seen at dosages of up to 150 mg/day, the quality of evidence is not sufficient to draw robust conc lusions or conduct meta-analyses (Leung and Breden 2011; Solmi et al. 2018b). Adverse effects that were more frequent with tetrabenazine than placebo included drowsiness, sedation or somnolence, pa rkinsonism, insomnia, an xiety, depression, and akathisia. Although this statement specifically relates to th e use of a reversible inhibitor of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) (e.g., deutetrabenazine, tetrabenazine, valbenazine), the guide- line writing group also reviewed evidence for other possible treatments for tardive dyskinesia. Amantadine has been mentioned in the literature as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia, but evi- dence for its use is extremely limited. One randomized double-blind crossover trial (Angus et al. 1997) included only 16 patients and had significant attrition. Another randomized double-blind crossover trial (Pappa et al. 2010) also had a small sample ( N=22), and the period of treatment was only 2 weeks. Thus, data from these trials are insufficient to support use of amantadine for treat - ment of tardive dyskinesia. Other studies of treatm ents for tardive dyskinesia have been discussed in systematic reviews, as summarized in Table C-2. On the basis of these findings, th ere is insuffi- cient evidence to s upport a guideline statement on use of these treatments in individuals with tar- dive dyskinesia.

The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 239 Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Efficacy of VMAT2 Inhibitors Magnitude of effect: Moderate . Effects are at least moderate in terms of the proportion of indi- viduals who are much improved or very much improved with valbenazine or deutetrabenazine as compared with placebo. Statistically signific ant differences are also found for rates of re - sponse and for decreases in total AIMS scores. Fewer data are available for tetrabenazine, and its magnitude of effect is unclear. Risk of bias: Low to medium . Studies are RCTs with a low to medium risk of bias based on their descriptions of randomization, blin ding procedures, and study dropouts. Applicability: The included trials all involve individuals with moderate to severe tardive dys- kinesia, although some studies include individu als with diagnoses other than schizophrenia. The doses of medication used are repres entative of usual clinical practice. Directness: Direct . Studies measure changes in signs of tardive dyskinesia on the AIMS and pro- portions of individuals who show ed at least 50% response or who were much improved or very much improved on a global measure of benefit. Consistency: Consistent . Studies are consistent in showing be nefits of valbenazine and deutetra - benazine. Studies of tetrabenazine are more limi ted in number, sample size, and design but also show benefit in individuals with tardive dyskinesia. Precision: Imprecise . Confidence intervals are wide but do not cross the threshold for clinically significant benefit of the intervention. Dose-response relationship: Present . Valbenazine and deutetrabenazine show an increase in clinical benefit with an increase in dose. Confounding factors: Unclear . No specific confounding factors are noted for valbenazine or deutetrabenazine, but confoundin g factors may be present for tetrabenazine because of weak- nesses in study methodologies. Publication bias: Unable to be assessed . The small number of available studies precludes assess- ment of publication bias. Overall strength of research evidence: Moderate . The available studies of valbenazine and deu- tetrabenazine are of good quality with good samp le sizes. However, not all confidence intervals are narrow. In addition, the duration of the random ized phase of the trials was relatively short, as little as 4-6 weeks in some studies. The long-term follow-up data are based only on open-label ex- tension phases of these RCTs. Data on tetrabenazi ne have a higher risk of bias, smaller samples sizes, and inadequate blinding, yielding a low strength of research evidence. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Harms of VMAT2 Inhibitors Magnitude of effect: Minimal to small . For deutetrabenazine and valbenazine, there are no signif - icant differences from placebo in rates of adverse effects. For tetrabenazine, some adverse effects are more frequent than with placebo, but the magn itude of the difference is still relatively small. Risk of bias: Medium to high . Studies of valbenazine and deut etrabenazine determine adverse events in a systematic fashion, but the duration of the randomized phase of the clinical trials is relatively short, and the open-label extension phas es have a greater risk of bias. Studies of tetra - benazine have a greater number of limitations in study design, with a high risk of bias overall. Applicability: The included trials all involve individuals with moderate to severe tardive dys- kinesia, although some studies include individu als with diagnoses other than schizophrenia. The doses of medication used are repres entative of usual clinical practice. Directness: Direct . Studies measure occurrence of specific side effects. APA Practice Guidelines 240 Consistency: Variable . Studies of deutetrabenazine and va lbenazine are consistent in showing negligible side effects as compared with placebo. Studies of tetrabenazine generally show greater rates of some side effects than placebo. Precision: Imprecise . Confidence intervals cross the threshold for clinically significant benefit of the intervention. Dose-response relationship: Not assessed . Although effects of dose on side effects were not eval- uated, dose-response relationships are noted for efficacy of deutetrabenazine. Confounding factors: Unclear . No specific are noted for valbenazine or deutetrabenazine, but confoundin g factors may be present for tetrabenazine because of weak- nesses in the study methodologies. Publication bias: Unable to be assessed . The small number of available studies precludes assess- ments of publication bias. Overall strength of research evidence: Low . Available studies of valbenazine and deutetra - benazine include RCTs of short duration, as well as longer-ter m open-label follow-up phases. Findings for these medications are consistent in showing no apparent difference in side effects relative to placebo. For tetraben azine, studies have significant li mitations and a high risk of bias but show more frequent side effects than placeb o. Overall, studies are generally applicable to individuals with moderate to severe tardive dyskinesia, including individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Psychosocial Interventions STATEMENT 15: Coordinated Specialty Care Programs APA recommends (1B) that patients with schizophrenia who are experiencing a first epi- sode of psychosis be treated in a coordinated specialty care program.* This recommendation is based on evidence from four clinical trials as presented in the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017) as well as an addi tional study (Anderson et al. 2018) that showed reduced mortality at 2 years for those who had participated in an early intervention program. The strength of research evidence for this statement is rated as moderate on the basis of the moderate SOE found for multiple key outcomes. Many studies of coordinated specialty care progra ms were not included in the AHRQ review, al- though there is a long history of using such prog rams worldwide for early identification and treat- ment of attenuated psychosis syndrome, related syndromes of high psychosis risk, or first-episode psychosis (J. Addington et al. 2017; Cotton et al. 2016; Malla and McGorry 2019); however, these pro - grams were not within the scope of this guidelin e recommendation because they include individuals who do not have a psychiatric diagnosis or who have diagnoses other than schizophrenia at later fol-low-up times (Fusar-Poli et al. 2016; Iorfino et al . 2019). Only one of the studies in a meta-analysis of early intervention programs (Marshall and Rathbone 2011) was included in the AHRQ analysis; all other studies were excluded because of such factors as small sample size, enrollment of inpa- tients, lack of applicability to the U.S. population, and/or use of a one-off intervention. Pooled results from studies of individuals with a first episode of psychosis (McDonagh et al. 2017) found that up to 2 years of treatment with a coordinated specialty care program was associ - ated with higher global functioning based on Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and Global Assessment Scale scores (3 RCTs; WMD 3.88, 95% CI 0.91-6.85; moderate SOE), significantly more *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 241 people working or in school (3 RCTs; RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.47; moderate SOE), significantly higher ratings of quality of life (2 RCTs; effect size 0. 84, 95% CI 0.14-1.55; moderate SOE), and a greater rate of retention in treatment (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.16-1 .38; Cochran's Q =0.03, de grees of freedom=1; high SOE) as compared with usual care. Coordinated sp ecialty care program participants were also less likely to relapse compared with those in usual care (2 RCTs; RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52-0.79; moderate SOE). These treatment effects were not sustained and had generally dissipated by 5 years after treatment discontinuation. In addition, as compared with usual care, there were no significant ef - fects of coordinated specialty care programs on housing status (2 RCTs; low SOE), self-harm (N=506; RR 0.93, 95% CI (3 WMD -2.53, 95% CI -5.45 to Nordentoft et al . 2002; Secher et al. 2015) found no differences in rates of accidental death (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.01-7. 59) or unexplained death (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.01-7.56) at 2 years and no difference in mortality at 10 -year follow-up (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.45-1.88) between individuals who received a coordinated specialty ca re intervention as compared with usual care. In contrast, in an early intervention program for psyc hosis in Ontario, Canada (Anderson et al. 2018), rates of self-harm behavior (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.18-4.24) and suicide (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.29-1.80) did not differ during the initial 2 years after enrollment as compared with usual care, but rates of all-cause mortality were lower in the coordi nated specialty care intervention group (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.11-0.53; absolute risk reduction 2.5%; NNT=40). As compared with those who received usual care, individu- als in the coordinated specialty care program al so saw a psychiatrist more rapidly (user median days=13 compared with nonuser median days=78), were more likely to have contact with a psychi-atrist (HR 6.05, 95% CI 5.30-6.91), and were more li kely to be hospitalized (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.18-1.71) but were less likely to have emergency department visits (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60-0.83) or primary care contacts (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.41-0.52). Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Efficacy of Coordinated Specialty Care Programs Magnitude of effect: Moderate . CSC programs are associated with significant benefits in terms of retention in treatment, with smaller benefits on quality of life, functionin g, and relapse reduction. Risk of bias: Medium . Studies are RCTs with a medium risk of bias based on their descriptions of randomization, blinding pr ocedures, and study dropouts. Applicability: The included trials all involve individuals with schizophrenia as well as individ - uals with a first episode of psychosis in the cont ext of other diagnoses. In usual practice, coor- dinated specialty care programs follow the sa me model as research programs and would be expected to be comparable. Directness: Direct . Studies measure core illness symptoms, functioning, quality of life, relapse, and treatment retention. Consistency: Consistent . Findings are generally consistent among the available RCTs. Precision: Variable . Confidence intervals are generally narrow and do not cross the threshold for clinically significant benefit of the intervention for the majori ty of outcomes. For some out- comes, however, imprecision was noted because of wide confidence intervals. Dose-response relationship: Not assessed . Studies do not examine effects of varying treatment duration or visit frequency. Confounding factors: Present. Confounding factors may increase the observed effect. Subjects and treating clinicians are aware of the treatmen t arm to which subjects were assigned. This may cause confounding of effe cts due to expectancies. Publication bias: Unable to be assessed . A small number of studies met inclusion criteria for the AHRQ review, which precludes assessment of publication bias. APA Practice Guidelines 242 Overall strength of research evidence: Moderate . The strength of research evidence is moderate for most outcomes, although a high strength of ev idence is noted for rates of treatment retention, and a low strength of research evidence is no ted for housing status and core illness symptoms as measured by the PANSS. Neither of the latter outcomes showed an effect of coordinated spe- cialty care programs. Trials vary in sample size, but several had large samples and findings were generally consistent among the available RCTs. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Harms of Coordinated Specialty Care Programs Harms of coordinated specialty care programs were not systematically studied, and no grading of the evidence for harms is possible. STATEMENT 16: Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy APA recommends (1B) that patients with schizophrenia be treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp).* Evidence in support of this statement comes from multiple RCTs and meta-analyses as described in the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017). The strength of the rese arch evidence is rated as mod- erate on the basis of the evidence of CBTp benefi ts for core illness symptoms and short-term func- tioning. In terms of overall symptoms, the AHRQ report re lied primarily on a systematic review of 34 RCTs (Jauhar et al. 2014) that found CBTp to be more ef fective than usual care at improving overall symp- toms based on symptom-based rating scales such as the PANSS and BPRS (S -0.33, 95% CI -0.47 SOE). less ounced but remained significant (95% CI -0.27 to -0.03) when the analysis was restricted to trials with blinded outcome asse ssments. Because this re - view did not conduct stratified analysis by format, it is not possible to tell whether distinctions in out- come exist for individual as compared with group CBTp. Although the included studies ranged in duration from 8 weeks to 5 years, analysis of shor ter as compared with longer durations of treatment was not conducted, limiting the ability to determ ine whether more prolonged treatment is able to maintain shorter-term treatment gains. For negati ve symptoms, there was no meaningful difference noted between CBTp and usual care based on data from two systematic reviews (Jauhar et al. 2014; Velthorst et al. 2015) (low SOE). The AHRQ report (McDonagh et al. 2017) also fo und CBTp to be associated with improvements in global function in the short term ( 6 months since CBTp initiation) as measured using the GAF scale (6 trials: MD 5.35, 95% CI 1.05-9.65; I2=77%). Removing the one study that used group CBTp from the analysis strengthened the effect and elim inated statistical heterogeneity. In one study that focused on global function (van der Gaag et al. 2 011), a higher proportion of CBTp patients had nor- mal functioning after 6 months of treatment as compared with patients who received usual care (28% vs. 14%; RR 2.21, 95% CI 1.25-3.93). Another study (Zimmer et al. 2007) short-term ben- efits of an integrated cognitive-behavioral interven tion on social and/or o ccupational function (as measured by the Social and Occupational Func tioning Assessment Scale and overall functioning (GAF mean difference 5.69, 95% CI 2.05-10.97; p=0.000). Benefits of CBTp on global, social, and oc- cupational function were not ma intained for more than 6 months after treatment cessation (low SOE). CBTp also improved quality of life more than usual care in the short term but not with longer periods of follow-up (low SOE). *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 243 Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Efficacy of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Psychosis Magnitude of effect: Moderate . With outcomes for which an effect is observed (such as core ill- ness symptoms and short-term functioning impr ovements), there is a moderate magnitude of benefit. For other outcomes, either no benefit is seen or evidence is inconclusive. Risk of bias: Medium . Studies in meta-analyses and other RC T s have a moderate degree of study limitations based on their descriptions of random ization, blinding procedures, and study dropouts. Applicability: The included trials all involve individu als with schizophrenia. Some studies also include individuals with other diagnoses such as schizoaffective disorder. When delivered in clinical practice, CBTp may be conducted with a lesser degree of fidelity than when delivered in research contexts. Directness: Direct . Studies measure core illness symptoms ; negative symptoms ; and social, oc- cupational, and global function. Consistency: Variable . For outcomes with an observed effect, study findings are consistent. For outcomes with no observed effect, study findings are less consistent. Precision: Precise. Confidence intervals are narrow and do not cross the threshold for clinically significant benefit of the intervention for outcom es with an observed effect. For outcomes with no observed effect, findings are imprecise for most outcomes. Dose-response relationship: Not assessed . The impact of differences in the numbers or frequency of treatment sessions is unclear. Confounding factors: Present. Confounding factors may increase the observed effect. Subjects and treating clinicians are aware of the treatmen t arm to which subjects were assigned. This may cause confounding of effe cts due to expectancies. Publication bias: Unclear. At least one meta-analysis of CBTp suggests that publication bias may be present, but analysis for possible public ation bias based on all of the included studies was not available. Overall strength of research evidence: Moderate . For outcomes that show an effect of CBTp, there is a moderate strength of research eviden ce. For other outcomes that did not show an ef - fect, the strength of research evidence is low or insufficient. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Harms of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Psychosis Harms of the treatment were rarely reported in studies of CBTp an d were not systematically stud- ied. Information was available from only a single RCT, and the AHRQ report notes that the evi- dence is insufficient to draw any conclusions (M cDonagh et al. 2017). Thus, no grading of the evidence for harms is possible. STATEMENT 17: Psychoeducation APA recommends (1B) that patients with schizophrenia receive psychoeducation. * Evidence in support of this statement comes from a good-quality systematic review as described in the AHRQ report (McDonagh et al. 2017). The stre ngth of the research evidence is rated as mod- erate on the basis of the evidence of ps ychoeducation benefits on relapse rates. *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. APA Practice Guidelines 244 The 10 RCTs (total N=1,125) of psychoeducation included in the systematic review (Pekkala and Merinder 2002) varied in length (with duration of follow-up as long as 5 years), included diverse in- terventions, and used individual and group techniqu es. Although most of the studies included stabi- lized outpatients and were conducted in Nort h America and northern Europe, many studies contained some individuals with a diagnosis other than schizophrenia. On the basis of the data from 6 trials, psychoeducation had a greater effect than usual care on relapse rates (with or without read- mission) at 9-18 months of follow-up (RR 0.80, 95 % CI 0.70-0.92; moderate SOE). Psychoeducation was also superior to usual care in terms of global functional outcomes at 1 year of follow-up (3 RCTs; MD -5.23, 95% CI -8.76 to -1.71; low SOE). In terms of potential harms, few studies report ed adverse outcomes. Nevertheless, for psycho- education as compared with usual care, no differ ences were observed in the number of deaths, which were small in both groups, and rates of al l-cause study dropout were also comparable be- tween study groups (McDonagh et al. 2017). Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Efficacy of Psychoeducation Magnitude of effect: Small . A modest benefit is seen for psychoeducation in terms of relapse rates and global functional outcomes. Effects on other outcomes are less robust or are inconclusive. Risk of bias: Medium . Studies are RCTs, including RCTs as part of a meta-analysis, and have a medium risk of bias based on their descriptions of randomization, blinding procedures, and study dropouts. Applicability: The included trials all involve indivi duals with schizophrenia. However, many of the trials also include individuals with other diagnoses. There is considerable variability in the content and format of interventions; however, variability is also present in the delivery of psychoeducation in usual clinical practice. Directness: Direct . Studies measure relapse rates, symptoms, functioning, and quality of life. Consistency: Consistent . When outcome data are available from multiple studies, findings are consistent. Precision: Variable . The confidence interval is narrow fo r relapse at 9-18 months, but other out - comes have wide confidence intervals. Dose-response relationship: Not assessed . Confounding factors: Present. Confounding factors may increase the observed effect. Subjects and treating clinicians are aware of the treatmen t arm to which subjects were assigned. This may cause confounding of effe cts due to expectancies. Publication bias: Unclear . The most recent meta-analysis of psychoeducation in schizophrenia did not assess whether publication bias was present. Overall strength of research evidence: Moderate . Available RCTs on effects of psychoeducation have reasonable sample sizes and precise, consis tent findings on relapse. For functioning, the overall strength of research evidence is low. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Harms of Psychoeducation Harms of psychoeducation were reported in only a few studies but appeared comparable to usual care; no grading of the evidence for harms is poss ible because of the small amount of available ev- idence. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 245 STATEMENT 18: Supported Employment Services APA recommends (1B) that patients with schizophrenia receive supported employment services.* Evidence in support of this statement comes from one study comparing supported employment with usual care and an RCT and meta-analysis comparing supported employment with other vo- cational interventions as described in the AHRQ report (McDonagh et al. 2017). The strength of the research evidence is rated as moderate on the basis of the evidence of benefits for supported em- ployment on obtaining competitive work. The AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017) found that supported employment, using the individ - ual placement and support (IPS) model, results in better employment outcomes than usual care with 2 years of follow-up. Patients receiving IPS in one fair-quality trial (N =204) were significantly more likely to obtain competitive work than those receiving usual care (75% vs. 27.5%, P=0.001; Mueser et al. 2004). They were also more likely to obtain an y form of paid work than those receiving usual care (73.9% vs. 53.6%). A large RCT ( N=1,273), with both usual care and vocational training comparisons, showed similar benefits of IPS (55% vs. 34%, P<0.001 overall and 22% vs. 12%, P<0.001 in the sub - group of study subjects with schizophrenia) (Cook et al. 2005). These find ings are consistent with findings of a good-quality systematic review of 14 RCTs ( N=2,265) in which other vocational train- ing interventions were used as controls (Kinoshi ta et al. 2013). Together, these studies provide a moderate SOE for benefits of supported employment using IPS. Although a ssociated with a lower SOE, supported employment also showed benefits in terms of working more than 20 hours per week (13% vs. 34%, P=0.00), having more weeks of employment overall (24 more weeks competitive and 11 more weeks any employment, P<0.001), and longer tenure per individual job (4 weeks, P=0.048) than those in either usual care, other vocational inte rventions, or both. Patients receiving IPS also re - ported earning more money than those in us ual care ($2,078/month vs. $617.59/month, P<0.001). Several other meta-analyses of supported employ ment using somewhat different analytic meth - ods and different inclusion and exclusion criteria than the AHRQ review found similar benefits of supported employment using the IPS approach (F rederick and VanderWeel e 2019; Suijkerbuijk et al. 2017). In terms of outcomes un related to work, findings are less consistent but suggest potential advantages to supported employment in reducing symptoms and hospitalizat ion risk (Burns et al. 2007; Hoffmann et al. 2014; Luciano et al. 2014). Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Efficacy of Suppor ted Employment Services Magnitude of effect: Moderate . Moderate effects are present for the proportion of individuals at- taining competitive employment or any form of paid employment as compared with usual care or vocational training comparisons. Risk of bias: Medium . Studies are RCTs (including meta-a nalyses of RCTs) and have a medium risk of bias based on descriptions of randomization, blinding procedures, and study dropouts. Applicability: The included trials all involve individu als with schizophrenia. However, many of the trials also include individuals with other diagnoses. Supported employment interventions, particularly those using the IPS model, appear to be representative of usual clinical practice. Directness: Direct . Studies measure the duration of co mpetitive employment and the propor- tion of individuals attaining paid or competitive employment, as well as less direct outcomes such as wages earned. *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. APA Practice Guidelines 246 Consistency: Consistent . When outcome data are available fr om more than one study, findings are consistent. In addition, seve ral meta-analyses using somewhat different inclusion and exclu - sion criteria reached similar findings. Precision: Precise . Narrow confidence intervals are present for the proportion of individuals in competitive employment or work ing at least 20 hour s per week, as well as for mean weeks worked and mean wages earned. Dose-response relationship: Not assessed . Confounding factors: Present. Confounding factors may increase the observed effect. Subjects and treating clinicians are aware of the treatmen t arm to which subjects were assigned. This may cause confounding of effe cts due to expectancies. Publication bias: Suspected . There appears to be a lack of repo rting of smaller trials with nega - tive results based on network meta-analysis and associated funnel plots to identify publication bias (Suijkerbuijk et al. 2017). Overall strength of research evidence: Moderate . There is a moderate overall strength of re - search evidence for the proportion of indivi duals attaining competitive employment, any form of paid employment, mean weeks worked, or mo nthly wages earned as compared with usual care or vocational training comparisons. Trials are of varying quality, but many have a good sample size; large numbers of study subjects are included in meta-analyses. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Harms of Supported Employment Services Harms of supported employment services were not systematically studied, and no grading of the evidence for harms is possible. Statement 19: Assertive Community Treatment APA recommends (1B) that patients with schizophreni a receive assertive community treat- ment if there is a history of poor engagement with services leading to frequent relapse or social disruption (e.g., homelessness; lega l difficulties, including imprisonment).* This recommendation is based on information fr om the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017), which used a good-quality systematic review (14 RCTs; N=2,281) as a primary source (Marshall and Lockwood 2000) and also co nsidered one additional RCT ( N=118; Sytema et al. 2007). The strength of research evidence for this guideline st atement is rated as moderate on the basis of the moderate SOE found for multiple key outcomes. The AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017) focused on assertive community treatment (ACT) alone as compared with usual care and did not include a recent review in which evidence for ACT was com - bined with evidence for intensive case management . Significant variability was noted in study pop- ulations, with a range of ages, de mographic characteristics, diagnose s, and eligibility criteria (e.g., frequent or recent hospita lization, other risk factors for reduced continuity of care). In addition, the degree of fidelity to ACT principles was ofte n unclear, which may influence effectiveness. Individuals who received ACT were less likely to discontinue treatment and be lost to follow-up than individuals who received usual care (12 trials ; OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.41-0.63; moderate SOE). They were also less likely to be admitted to a hospital compared with individuals who received usual care (6 RCTs; OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41-0.85; I2=73%), and many of the reported studies also showed a decrease in the number of days in the hospital. Furthermore, individuals who received ACT were *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 247 less likely to be unemployed (3 trials; OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21-0.99; 0.35-0.79; I2=0%) compared with usual care (moderate SOE). Core illness symptoms also improved with ACT, but the degree of improvement was comparable to that in the usual care group (3 trials, N=255; MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.08; moderate SOE). As compared with usual care, there was no significant dif - ference in social function (pooled analysis of 3 st udies; MD 0.03, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.34; low SOE) and no significant differences in arrests (2 trials, total N=604; OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.60-2.29; I2=0%), impris - 95% CI 0.70-2.01; I2=27%), or police cont N=149; 0.76, 95% CI 0.32-1.79; I2=84%) with ACT (low SOE). Find ings from the additional RCT were generally consistent with the meta-analytic results. Only 2 trials reported information on qual- ity of life, with one finding a small but statistica lly significant difference and the other showing no difference. In individuals with co-occurring schizophrenia and a substance use disorder, one good-quality systematic review of 32 trials (N =3,165) examined differences between integrated ACT and usual care (Hunt et al. 2013). For most outcomes of inte rest, only one or two of the studies from the sys- tematic review contributed relevant data; however, these limited data showed no differences be- tween integrated ACT and usual care for substanc e use, treatment discontinuation, function, or mortality through follow-up durations of up to 36 months. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Efficacy of Assertive Community Treatment Magnitude of effect: Moderate . On several important outcomes, there is at least a moderate ef - fect. These outcomes include treatment discontinu ation and likelihood of hospitalization, un - employment, or homelessness. On other outcomes, however, there is no difference between ACT and treatment as usual. Risk of bias: Medium . Evidence comes from an RCT and a meta-analysis of RCTs, but individual studies have a medium risk of bias based on th eir descriptions of randomization, blinding pro- cedures, and study dropouts. Applicability: The included trials all involve individuals with schizophrenia. However, many of the trials also include individuals with other diagnoses. The delivery of ACT in the trials is likely to be representative of usual clinical practice, although program fidelity may be dimin-ished in usual practice. Directness: Direct . Studies measured core illness symptoms, functioning, quality of life, em- ployment, housing status, and interactio ns with the criminal justice system. Consistency: Variable . Findings of benefits for having housing or employment are consistent, whereas other outcomes show inconsistencies amon g individual studies within the meta-analysis. Precision: Imprecise . Confidence intervals for most outcomes are wide, and many cross the threshold for clinically significant benefit of the intervention. Dose-response relationship: Not applicable . Confounding factors: Present. Confounding factors may increase the observed effect. Subjects and treating clinicians are aware of the treatmen t arm to which subjects were assigned. This may cause confounding of effe cts due to expectancies. Publication bias: Not assessed. Overall strength of research evidence: Moderate . A significant number of RCTs of ACT are available and, compared with usual care, show that ACT is associated with a lower likelihood of being unemployed and a lowe r likelihood of not living in dependently or being homeless. Many trials are moderate in quality, although there is some variability.

STATEMENT 20: Family Interventions APA suggests (2B) that patients with schizophrenia who have ongoing contact with family receive family interventions.* This guideline statement is based on 1 fair-qua lity systematic review (27 non-Chinese studies, total N=2,297; Pharoah et al. 2010) and 6 additional studies (total N=562; Barrowclough et al. 1999; Dyck et al. 2012; Mayoral et al. 2015; Sellwood et al. 2001, 2007; Valencia et al. 2007) as described in the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017). Because most family interventions are aimed at re ducing relapse, the strength of research evidence for this state- ment is rated as moderate on the basis of the moderate SOE found for relapse in the AHRQ review with medium-term follow-up, although other outcomes had a low SOE. The studies of family intervention described in the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017) had significant variation in content and methods of the delivered intervention (e.g., psychoeducation, mo- tivational interviewing, behavioral family therapy, support groups , 24-hour support, communication training, stress management, role-play, homework, goal setting, development of social networks), measured outcomes, study design (e.g., setting, tr eatment duration, treatment frequency, follow-up duration, single-family versus multiple-family forma t, family members only vs. family members plus patient), and demographics of the study population (e.g., age, illness duration, symptom severity at baseline). Most studies had small sample sizes, and most had some risk of bias due to lack of reporting of randomization procedures or outcome assessmen t blinding. Studies conducted in China were ex- cluded because of concerns about their app licability to Canadian and U.S. populations. In the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017), fami ly interventions resulted in significantly lower relapse rates than usual care when measured at 0-6 months (3 RCTs; N=244; CI SOE) but not at 25-36 months. The strongest evidence for effects of family interventions on relapse occurred in studies that included at least 10 treatment sess ions over 7-12 months. Improvements in core -0.46, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.07; low SOE) were also found with family intervention compared with usual care. Unemployment (4 trials; N =230; 75% vs. 66% after low SOE) were not found to be different between family intervention and usual care groups (low SOE). For social func- tioning, quality of life, family burden, and nonsuicide mortality, there was insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions from the available studies. Rates of treatment discontinuation varied with time in the study, but family inte rventions either did not differ from usual care or had fewer treat- ment dropouts than usual care (McDonagh et al. 2017; low SOE). *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 249 Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Efficacy of Family Interventions Magnitude of effect: Moderate . For outcomes that show an effect of family interventions, such as effects on relapse rate and illn ess symptoms, the magnitude of the effect is generally moderate. Risk of bias: Medium . Evidence comes from RCTs, including RCTs in a fair-quality systematic review. These studies have a medium risk of bias based on their descriptions of randomization, blinding procedures, and study dropouts. Applicability: The included trials all involve individuals with schizophrenia. However, many of the trials also include individuals with other diagnoses. Studies from China are excluded from the analysis because of concerns about th eir applicability to Canadian and U.S. popula - tions. There is considerable variability in the content and methods of the family interventions that are studied; however, there is also consider able variability in interventions that are deliv- ered in clinical practice. Directness: Direct . Studies measure relapse, core illness symptoms, and outcomes related to functioning. Consistency: Consistent . For outcomes with data from more than one study, findings among the studies are consistent. Precision: Imprecise . Confidence intervals for all outcomes are wide or cross the threshold for clinically significant benefit of the intervention. Dose-response relationship: Present . The strongest evidence for effects of family interventions on relapse occurs in studies that include at least 10 treatment sessions over 7-12 months. Confounding factors: Present. Confounding factors may increase the observed effect. Subjects and treating clinicians are aware of the treatmen t arm to which subjects were assigned. This may cause confounding of effe cts due to expectancies. Publication bias: Not assessed. The most recent meta-analysis of family interventions did not as- sess whether publication bias was present. Overall strength of research evidence: Moderate . For relapse at 7-12 months, there is a moderate strength of research evidence, but for most othe r outcomes, the strength of research evidence is low. The strength of research evidence is influenced by a lack of precision, as well as by the small sample sizes for some of the outcomes. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Harms of Family Interventions Harms of family interventions were not systematically studied, and no grading of the evidence for harms is possible. STATEMENT 21: Self-Management Skills and Recovery-Focused Interventions APA suggests (2C) that patients with schizophrenia receive interventions aimed at devel- oping self-management skills and e nhancing person-oriented recovery.* This guideline statement is based on evidence provided by a fair-quality systematic review (13 stud - ies; total N =1,404; Zou et al. 2013) and 1 additional fair-quality study ( N=210; Hasson-Ohayon et al. *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. APA Practice Guidelines 250 2007) as described in the AHRQ re view (McDonagh et al. 2017), as well as a meta-analysis of per- son-oriented recovery approaches (7 RCTs, N =1,739; Thomas et al. 2018). The strength of research evidence for this statement is rated as low on the basis of the low SOE found for the majority of out- comes in the AHRQ review and a significant risk of bias (consistent with a low SOE) for most of the studies in the meta-analysis of pe rson-oriented recovery approaches. For illness self-managem ent training and for recovery-focused interventions, interpretation of the ev- idence can be challenging because of the degree of heterogeneity in the content and format of the inter- ventions. For example, illness sel f-management training programs ar e designed to improve knowledge, management of symptoms, and social and occupational functioning, with a primary goal of reducing the risk of relapse by focusing on medication mana gement, recognizing signs of relapse, and developing a relapse prevention plan and coping skills for pers istent symptoms (McDonagh et al. 2017; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2010a). Recovery-focused interventions can in - clude similar approaches but are focused primarily on supporting a recove ry-oriented vision that strives for community integration in the context of individual goals, needs, and strengths (Le Boutillier et al. 2011; Thomas et al. 2018). Activities of recovery-focused interventions incorporate opportunities for participants to share experiences and receive suppo rt as well as practicing strategies for success in illness self-management. Wi th illness self-manag ement, the interventions were typically administered in a group format, whereas recovery -focused interventions included a mix of group and individual for - mats as well as a mix of peer- and professional-led activities. Both illness self-management and recov- ery-focused interventions had significant variations in session content, duration, and number. In terms of outcomes with illness self-managem ent, the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017) noted a reduction in core illness symptom severity based on the BPRS (5 RCTs; pooled WMD -4.19, 95% CI -5.84 to -2.54; moderate SOE) and a reduce d likelihood of relapse with completion of 10 or more self-management sessions (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21-0.79; low SOE). Effect s of intervention were reduced if low-fidelity treatment was given or if fewer self-management sessions were completed. No significant effect of illness self-management was noted for negative symptoms (low SOE). With recovery-focused interventions (Thomas et al. 2018), individuals in the intervention group showed a modest improvement in person-oriented recovery, empowerment, and hope immedi-ately after the intervention (effect size 0.24, 95% CI 0.04-0.44) and at follow-up (effect size 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.35 ). Moderator analysis suggested that the greatest improvement was seen when mental health professionals and peer provider s collaborated in treatment delivery. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Efficacy of Self-Management Skills and Recovery-Focused Interventions Magnitude of effect: Small . Modest changes were noted in core illness symptom severity, like - lihood of relapse, measures of person-oriented recovery, empowerment, and hope. Risk of bias: Medium . Studies are RCTs, including RCTs as part of a meta-analysis, and have a medium risk of bias based on their descriptions of randomization, blinding procedures, and study dropouts. Applicability: The included trials all involve indivi duals with schizophrenia. However, many of the trials also include individuals with other diagnoses. There is considerable variability in the content and format of delivered interventions; however, there is also wide variation in ill- ness self-management and recovery-focused interventions in clinical practice. Directness: Direct . Studies measure functioning, symptoms, and relapse. Consistency: Variable . Consistent for symptoms and relaps e but inconsistent for functioning. Precision: Variable . Precise for symptoms as measured by the BPRS but imprecise for other out- comes because of wide confidence intervals. Dose-response relationship: Present . Effects of illness self-management were less prominent if fewer self-management sessions were completed. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 251 Confounding factors: Present. Confounding factors may increase the observed effect. Subjects and treating clinicians are aware of the treatmen t arm to which subjects were assigned. This may cause confounding of effe cts due to expectancies. Publication bias: Not assessed. Overall strength of research evidence: Low. Studies are RCTs, including a meta-analysis of RCTs, and have a medium risk of bias. The strength of research evidence is moderate for effects on symptoms; it is low or insufficient for other outcomes. Although a dose-response effect seems to be present, increasing confidence in the findings, this is offset by the lack of precision for most outcomes. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Harms of Self-Management Ski lls and Recovery-Focused Interventions Harms of self-management skills and recovery-focus ed interventions were not systematically stud- ied, and no grading of the evidence for harms is possible. STATEMENT 22: Cognitive Remediation APA suggests (2C) that patients with schizophreni a receive cognitive remediation.* This guideline statement is based on evidence provided by 2 good-quality systematic reviews (57 studies, total N=2,885; Cella et al. 2017; Wykes et al. ( N=90; Deste et al. 2015; trials et al. 2012; Mueller et al. 2015; et al. 2012). The strength of research evid ence for this statement is rated as low on the ba- sis of the low SOE found for the majority of outcomes. Studies included in the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017) used standard cognitive remedi- ation principles (Saperstein and Medalia 2012) and usual care control comparisons, but other popu - lation and study characteristics varied (e.g., population demographics, treatment setting, individual vs. group format, drill and practice vs. drill plus st rategy methodology, sessions per week, treatment duration, follow-up duration, extent of treatment fidelity, baseline symptom severity, computerized vs. noncomputerized content delivery, pres ence of active comp arator condition). Overall, as compared with usual care, use of cognitive remediation for 15-16 weeks of treatment was associated with small posi tive effects on core illness symptoms (2 trials, -0.62, 95% CI -1.01 to -0.24; low SOE), but effects were inconsistent among the studies, and symptom improvement was not sustained following treatment removal (8 RCTs; ef fect size 0.17, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.48). Cognitive re - mediation as compared with usual care was also a ssociated with improvemen ts in negative symptoms (1 systematic review of 18 RCTs; effect size -0.36, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.20; moderate SOE) as well as small positive effects on social, occupati onal, and global function (6 RCTs; effect sizes of 0.16-0.40; low SOE). Effects of intervention on cognit ive functioning were outside the sc ope of the AHRQ review, but some evidence suggests that improved cognitive function can result from treatment with cognitive remedia- tion, with indirect benefits for global function (Harvey et al. 2018). Only 1 study reported on health-related quality of life, and study limitations preclu de drawing conclusions on this outcome. Treatment with cognitive remediation did not differ from usual care in terms of rates of treatment discontinuation (McDonagh et al. 2017). Cognitive remediation also seems to be acceptable to individuals who re - ceive treatment in clinical settings as compared with research settings (Medalia et al. 2019). Although the AHRQ review did not specifically assess cognitive outcomes with cognitive remedi- ation, this has been a major focus of study and the primary target of cognitive remediation as an in- This guideline statement should be implemented in the cont ext of a person-centered treatment plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. APA Practice Guidelines 252 tervention. Results from meta-analyses (Revell et al. 2015; Wykes et al. 2011) and more recent randomized trials (D'Amato et al . 2011; Donohoe et al. 2018; Goma r et et al. et al. 2016; Mueller al. 2015; Reeder et al. 2017) have been mixe d, with significant het - erogeneity in the degree of cognitive improvemen t (if any), the domains of cognitive improvement, and the persistence and generalizability of improvements. This may not be surprising given the wide variety of cognitive remediation approaches an d formats that have been used in an effort to enhance cognitive processes such as attention, memory, executive function, social cognition, or meta-cognition (Delahunty and et al. 2016; Wykes et al. 2011). There are also no clear-cu t factors that are predictive of whether cognitive improvement will occur (Reser et al. 2019), which ma kes it difficult to determine how to target the intervention to individuals who are most likely to respond. Nevertheless, cognitive remediation does seem to result in improvements in cognition in individuals with schizophrenia, at least on a short-term basis (Harvey et al. 2018; Revell et al. 2015). Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Efficacy of Cognitive Remediation Magnitude of effect: Small . Small but significant effects are se en for core illness symptoms and neg- ative symptoms as well as for cogn itive processes in some domains. However, significant heteroge - neity is present in the degree of benefit as well as the persistence and ge neralizability of benefits. Risk of bias: Medium . RCTs, including those in systematic reviews, have a medium risk of bias based on their descriptions of randomization, blinding pr ocedures, and study dropouts. Applicability: The included trials all involve individuals with schizophrenia. Multiple different approaches to delivering cognitive remediation are used in the clinical trials. In addition, the use of cognitive remediation remains limited outside research settings, which makes it difficult to compare the study methods with current practice. Directness: Direct . Studies measure core illness symptoms, functioning, quality of life, and treat - ment discontinuation as well as cognitive effects. Consistency: Consistent . Within each outcome, study findings were consistent. Precision: Imprecise . Confidence intervals are relati vely wide for many outcomes. Dose-response relationship: Not assessed . It is not clear whether using a different frequency or duration of cognitive remediation sessions will affect outcomes. Confounding factors: Present. Confounding factors may increase the observed effect. Subjects and treating clinicians are aware of the treatmen t arm to which subjects were assigned. This may cause confounding of effe cts due to expectancies. Publication bias: Not suspected . On the basis of analyses conducted as part of meta-analyses on cognitive remediation, there is no evidence of publication bias. Overall strength of research evidence: Low. Ratings of the strength of evidence are low for global, social, and occupational function and for core illness symptoms and moderate for nega-tive symptoms. There is significant variability in the findings, perhaps related to the many dif - ferences in the study populations and treatment-related characteristics. Nevertheless, this reduces confidence in conclusions related to cognitive remediation. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Harms of Cognitive Remediation Harms of cognitive remediation were not systematically studied, and no grading of the evidence for harms is possible. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 253 STATEMENT 23: Social Skills Training APA suggests (2C) that patients with schizophrenia who have a therapeutic goal of enhanced social functioning receive social skills training.* This guideline statement is based on 3 fair-quality RCTs (total N=384; Bartels et al. 2014; Mueser et al. 2010; Valencia et al. 2007, 2013) as descri bed in the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017). The strength of research evidence for this statement is rated as low on the basis of the low SOE found for outcomes in the AHRQ review with social skills training. In the trials of social skills training that were included in the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017), sessions were held weekly for 24-52 weeks and incl uded specific, progressive intervention modules on such topics as management of symptoms and medication, improving social and family relation- ships, and increasing func tional skills such as money management . Goals of social skills training in- cluded enhanced psychosocial function and redu ctions in relapse and n eed for hospitalization. Demographic parameters, diagnoses of participants, and outcome measures varied among the trials. Social function was noted to be significantly improved with social skills training as compared with usual care (SMD on GAF at 6 months 1.60, 95% CI 1.19-2.02; SMD on GAF at 1 year 2.02, 95% CI 1.53-2.52; SMD on Multnomah Community Abilit y Scale at 2 years 0.65, 95% CI 0.36-0.95; low SOE), but it was not clear whether gains were main tained after treatment discontinuation. Core ill- ness symptoms, as measured by the PANSS, also showed more improvem ent with social skills training as compared with usual care (SMD at 6 mo nths -1.50, 95% to -0.40; low SOE). Negative symp toms also improved with social skills training as compared with usual care (SMD at 6 months -1.30, 95% CI -1.70 CI -0.74 to -0.15; low SOE), and in one study gains were maintained 1 year after treatment had ended. It was unclear whether relapse rates were af - fected by social skills training because of a small number of studies, small sample sizes, and small numbers of individuals who experienced relapse. In terms of treatment discontinuation, individu - als who received social skills training did not diff er from those in the usual care group (RR 1.10 at 1 year, 95% CI 0.92-1.31; RR 1.01 at 2 years, 95% CI 0.88-1.16; low SOE), with high rates of treatment retention in both groups. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Efficacy of Social Skills Training Magnitude of effect: Small . A modest effect of social skills tr aining was noted on social function, core illness symptoms, and negative symptoms. Risk of bias: Medium . Studies are RCTs with a medium risk of bias based on their descriptions of randomization, blinding pr ocedures, and study dropouts. Applicability: The included trials all involve individuals with schizophrenia. However, many of the trials also include individuals with othe r diagnoses. Typically, individuals also had de- creases in social functioning. Directness: Direct . Studies measure social functioning, core illness symptoms, negative symp- toms, relapse, and ability to maintain treatment. Consistency: Variable . Findings in the 3 included studies are consistent for negative symptom improvements but inconsistent for improvements in functioning and core illness symptoms. Precision: Imprecise . Confidence intervals for some outcom es cross the threshold for clinically significant benefit of the intervention in some studies. *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia.

Subjects and treating clinicians are aware of the treatmen t arm to which subjects were assigned. This may cause confounding of effe cts due to expectancies. Publication bias: Not suspected. A meta-analysis conducted subsequent to the AHRQ review showed no significant publication bias for studies of social skills traini ng (Turner et al. 2018). Overall strength of research evidence: Low. A vailable RCT s have medium risk of bias, have variable consistency, and lack precision, reducing the strength of the evidence. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Harms of Social Skills Training Harms of social skills training were not systematically studied, and no grading of the evidence for harms is possible. STATEMENT 24: Supportive Psychotherapy APA suggests (2C) that patients with schizophrenia be treated with supportive psycho- therapy. * This guideline statement is based on studie s that compared supportive psychotherapy with usual care (total N =822) in 1 good-quality systematic review (L. A. Buckley et al. 2015) as described in the AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017). The strength of research evidence for this statement is rated as low on the basis of the low SOE found for study outcomes in the AHRQ review. The studies in the systematic review (L. A. Buck ley et al. 2015) were aimed primarily at helping patients with coping abilities and maintaining levels of functioning. In other respects, there was sig- nificant variation in measured outcomes, study desi gn (e.g., setting, treatment duration, treatment frequency, follow-up duration), and demographics of the study population (e.g., age, illness dura - tion, symptom severity at baseline). In addition, most of the included studies had some risk of bias. The AHRQ review (McDonagh et al. 2017) found no difference in global or social function on the basis of 2 studies, but study results were not able to be pooled for analysis. Four RCTs reported infor- mation on study attrition, and no significant diff erence was noted between supportive psychotherapy and usual care ( N=354; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.53-1.40; low SOE). Fo r other outcomes, evidence was available from only a single study and sample sizes were sma ll, making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Efficacy of Supportive Psychotherapy Magnitude of effect: Not present . On the basis of a small number of studies, there is no difference from usual care in global functi oning or treatment discontinuation. Risk of bias: Medium . Studies are RCTs that have a medium risk of bias based on their descrip- tions of randomization, blinding procedures, and study dropouts. Applicability: The included trials all involve individuals with schizophrenia. However, some trials also include individuals with other diagno ses. There is significant variation in the dura - tion and frequency of treatment; however, variability in the delivery of supportive psychother- apy is also common in usual clinical practice. *This guideline statement should be implemented in the context of a person-centered treatm ent plan that includes evi - dence-based nonpharmacologic al and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 255 Directness: Direct . Studies measure functioning, core symptoms, negative symptoms, relapse, quality of life, and treatment discontinuation. Consistency: Consistent . For outcomes that are studied in more than one trial, findings are gen- erally consistent. Precision: Imprecise . Confidence intervals are wide and cross the threshold for clinically signifi- cant benefit of the intervention for many outcomes. Dose-response relationship: Not assessed . Confounding factors: Unclear . Supportive therapy is similar to the type of therapy that is com- monly delivered in usual care, so expectancy effects of receiving a novel intervention are likely to be minimal. Publication bias: Unable to be assessed . The number of studies on supportive therapy is too small to be able to assess for the presen ce or absence of publication bias. Overall strength of research evidence: Low. The overall strength of evidence is low for global functioning and study discontinuation. There is in sufficient evidence to draw conclusions about other outcomes. The available trials vary in thei r sample sizes. Study designs also differ, which makes comparison of findings difficult. Grading of the Overall Supporting Body of Research Evidence for Harms of Supportive Psychotherapy Harms of supportive psychotherapy were not syst ematically studied, and no grading of the evi- dence for harms is possible.

Pharmacological interventions are listed in Table D-1, and outcomes include the following: Functiona l outcomes (e.g., social, occupational) Health-related quality of life (including physical) Rates of response and/or remission Mortality (all-cause and/or specific) Reductions in self-harm, suicide, and suicide attempts Improvements in core illness symptoms , as indicated by scale score changes Overall/any adverse events (rate or proportion) Withdrawal due to adverse events Psychosocial and other nonpharmacological interv entions are listed in Tables D-2 to D-13, and outcomes include the following: Functional outcomes (e.g., social, occupational) Health-related quality of life Reductions in self-harm, suicide, and suicide attempts Rates of response and/or remission Improvements in core illness symptoms , as indicated by scale score changes Treatment discontinuation (typic ally r eported as the number of patients lost to follow-up or leaving the study early) Rates of relapse Outcomes reported as adverse ev ents related to the intervention 257 TABLE D-1.

The guideline focuses speci\u00ffcally on evidence-based pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments for schizophrenia and includes statements related to assessment and treatment planning, which are an integral part of patient-centered care. The guideline provides direction on implementing these recommendations into clinical practice, with the goal of improving the quality of care and treatment outcomes for patients with schizophrenia.
