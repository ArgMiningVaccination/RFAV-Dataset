Our public health advisors have been focusing on slowing the spread of COVID-19 with techniques like hand sanitization and mask wearing. Yet, little has been said about how we can actually boost our immune system in the event that we do come in contact with the virus. Luckily, there are a lot of natural and holistic ways to boost your immune system and keep your health a top priority. Strong immunity all starts with taking care of your body When the immune system is working well, it can quickly detect and fight against any foreign invaders. On occasion, your body will have to launch a full attack (leading to symptoms of fever, swelling, and fatigue to force you to rest) to deal with a pathogen. Yet, usually within a few days or weeks you'll be feeling better thanks to your body's quick response. In order for the immune system to have enough energy and reserve to do its job, the rest of the body must be in balance. If there is too much energy being spent on other bodily functions, which can occur with chronic inflammation, illness, or even pain, they can leave the immune system weaker than you'd like. How to naturally strengthen your immune system When the entire body is functioning well and in sync, it allows the immune system to work efficiently and uninhibited. Some of the best immunity boosters are also great habits to incorporate into your lifestyle anyways, so it's a win-win. Some ways to get started include: - Good stress management techniques - Proper [nutrition and hydration](https://mychirosolutions.com/nutrition-guidance-supplemets/)- high in nutrients and low in processed foods - Good hygiene practices such as washing produce, thoroughly cooking meats, and hand washing (just skip the antibacterial soaps!) - Regular movement and exercise - Limit alcohol consumption and smoking - Vitamin D through sun exposure or supplementation if necessary - Supplementation for immune boosting Zinc and Vitamin C - Optimal spine alignment to promote full body synchronicity How Chiropractic Care can help Spine misalignment in Virginia is a common issue in the body that often goes undetected without the trained eye of a Virginia Beach chiropractor. The subtle changes that come with poor spine alignment can lead to limited nerve energy and poor communication within the body- essential for a strong immune system when it's coordinating signals with our immunity organs like the spleen and lymph nodes.
