[1] In retrospect, an illness consistent with Lyme borreliosis had been reported in Europe as early as 1883. The disease was known in Europe as erythema chronicum migrans, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, lymphocytoma, and Bannwarth's syndrome, and an association had been proposed between a red rash (erythema migrans) and bites of insects or ticks. The causative agent of Lyme borreliosis was identified in the early 1980s, after isolation of long spiral shaped gram-negative bacteria from the guts of ticks, which were named Borrelia burgdorferi, and later also cultured from skin, blood and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with symptoms of Lyme borreliosis. [2] Currently, at least five genospecies of the Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi sensu lato group (hereafter referred to as B. burgdorferi) are known to cause Lyme borreliosis in Europe: B. is transmitted by ticks of the genus Ixodes; mainly by Ixodes (I.) ricinus ticks in Europe. In North America, Lyme borreliosis is predominantly caused by the genospecies B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, and transmitted by I. scapularis and I. pacificus [3]. After hatching from the eggs, I. ricinus has three life stages: larva, nymph and adult (see figure A), and each developmental stage needs a blood meal from a vertebrate before dropping off to moult to the next stage or to lay eggs in the case of an adult female. During a blood meal from an infected animal I. ricinus can become infected with B. burgdorferi, and during the subsequent blood meals the bacteria can be transmitted to new hosts. [4] Lyme borreliosis most commonly manifests as erythema migrans, a skin lesion that expands slowly from the site of the tick bite, indicating early localized infection (figure B). Erythema migrans may appear some days to weeks following infection, and is sometimes accompanied by systemic flu-like symptoms. Typical erythema migrans is usually sufficiently distinctive to allow a clinical diagnosis without laboratory diagnostics. Serological assays for antibodies to B. burgdorferi are insensitive in patients with erythema migrans, as the antibody response has not yet developed during the first several weeks of infection, which is why serological testing is not recommended in this stage of infection. [6, 7] In a minority of patients, the infection spreads to other tissues and organs, which can cause disseminated Lyme borreliosis such as Lyme neuroborreliosis, Lyme of the 10General introduction Figure A.

[5] Figure of erythema migrans: a slowly expanding skin lesion at the site of the tick bite, indicating early localized infection with B. burgdorferi.Pictures from the Lymeprospect study [14, 15] in Tekenradar[16]. 111General introduction various manifestations of disseminated Lyme borreliosis require recognition of clinical symptoms, along with serological testing for antibodies to B. burgdorferi. [3, 6] Oral antibiotic treatment is recommended to prevent disseminated Lyme borreliosis, although erythema migrans will often resolve without antibiotic treatment. Infection with B. burgdorferi generally responds well to antibiotic treatment, and thus the majority of patients with Lyme borreliosis have a good prognosis. [3] Occasionally, symptoms persist such as musculoskeletal pain, neurocognitive symptoms and fatigue, even after repeated antibiotic treatment.[3, 8] There is a broad range of hypotheses and no conclusive evidence to explain the persistence of symptoms after treatment for Lyme borreliosis; microbiological, immunological, cognitive and behavioural underlying mechanisms may play a role. [9-11] The cause and solution to persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis are a topic of ongoing extensive debate. Various studies have failed to support the idea that persistence of infection with B. burgdorferi causes such symptoms, and no sustained benefit has been proven from prolonged treatment with antibiotics. [9, 11-13] Since the early 1990s, Lyme borreliosis has been subject to public and medical debate. Contrasting perspectives on diagnosis, treatment, and persisting symptoms, have given rise to worldwide ''Lyme Wars'' between Lyme advocacy groups and the mainstream medical community. [17-19] Misinformation about Lyme borreliosis is widespread on the internet and messages in the media and press have caused anxiety and confusion among the public as well as physicians. The Association for Lyme Patients in the Netherlands successfully put Lyme borreliosis on the political agenda by submitting a citizens' initiative with more than 70,000 supportive signatures to the Lower House of the Dutch Parliament in May 2010. [20, 21] The patients association asked for surveillance or a patient register for Lyme borreliosis, for improved (postgraduate) training of physicians, development of good standardized diagnostic tests, establishment of a nationwide centre of expertise on Lyme borreliosis to coordinate research, more research into persisting symptoms after Lyme borreliosis, more research into other tick-borne diseases and coinfections, more improved and targeted public health education on ticks and tick bites, and development of a vaccine in Europe. Incidence and geographical spread of Lyme borreliosis The geographical spread of Lyme borreliosis in Europe closely reflects the distribution of I. ricinus, which is mainly determined by climatic factors such as temperature and humidity that allow survival, development and activity of the tick. The incidence of Lyme borreliosis in Europe shows an increasing gradient from west to east with the highest incidences in central-eastern Europe, and 12General introduction a decreasing gradient from south to north in Scandinavia and from north to south in Italy, Spain and Greece.[22] Over the past ten to twenty years, marked increases in the incidence of Lyme borreliosis have been reported in several European countries [22, 23] as well as in North America[24, 25], although some countries reported no change in the incidence[22, 23]. Surveillance of Lyme borreliosis is challenging due to the broad range of disease expressions, with sometimes non-specific clinical appearance which is further complicated by difficulties with laboratory diagnostics. As surveillance of Lyme borreliosis is not standardized on a European level, comparison of incidence rates between countries is not easy. Highly divergent incidence estimates for Lyme borreliosis have been reported between adjacent countries, and even within some countries. Surveillance systems with mandatory notification of this disease are installed in just a few European countries, not including the Netherlands. [2, 22, 23] To determine the geographical distribution of the occurrence of tick bite consultations and erythema migrans diagnoses at the general practitioners (GPs) in the Netherlands, the National Public Health Institute (RIVM) has conducted nationwide cross-sectional retrospective studies among GPs, starting in 1994. [26] This GP survey was repeated for 2001 and 2005, showing a continuing increase between 1994 and 2005 in GP consultations for tick bites, and in erythema migrans diagnoses. The incidence of tick bite consultations increased linearly from 191 per 100,000 in 1994 to 446 per 100,000 inhabitants, i.e. 73,000 GP consultations for tick bites in the Netherlands in 2005. Concurrently, the incidence of erythema migrans diagnoses increased from 39 to 104 per 100,000 inhabitants, i.e. an estimated 17,000 patients with erythema migrans were seen by all GPs in the Netherlands in 2005 [26-28]. The incidence of other manifestations of Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands remained unknown, and the increase of erythema migrans in the Netherlands, along with the severity of persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis, has raised uncertainties about the public-health impact of Lyme borreliosis. Worldwide, no quantitative estimation of the disease burden of Lyme borreliosis has been available, and reports on the societal impact of this disease are scarce. Other tick-borne diseases in the Netherlands Next to Lyme borreliosis, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a worldwide growing public health challenge; the annual number of TBE patients in Europe and Asia has increased by fourfold during the past 30 years, and the areas where people get infected with tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) have expanded. TBEV can cause brain inflammation, which can result in long term neurological symptoms, and occasionally even death. There is no specific treatment for patients with 131General introduction TBE, but the disease can be prevented by a safe and highly effective vaccine.[29] June 2016, the National Public Health Institute (RIVM) reported that TBEV was found in ticks from national park \"Sallandse heuvelrug\", for the first time in the Netherlands. [30] Ticks in the Netherlands are also infected with a wide variety of established or potentially pathogenic microorganisms such as Borrelia little is known about the incidences and clinical presentations of these tick-borne diseases, other than Lyme borreliosis and TBE, in Europe. Symptoms associated with these tick-borne pathogens are febrile illnesses with fever, headache, myalgia and malaise [36-41]. However, chronic infections with severe clinical manifestations caused by these micro-organisms and even mortality have been described in immunocompromised patients [36-38, 42]. With the increase in tick bites in the Netherlands, it is to be expected that the risk of acquiring another disease than Lyme borreliosis from a tick bite has been on the rise as well. These tick-borne diseases constitute a novel public health burden of unknown proportions. Outline of this thesis The aims of this PhD-thesis on the epidemiology of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne infections in the Netherlands were to assess: the incidence of tick bites and the whole range of disease manifestations of Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands. the public health impact of the various disease manifestations of Lyme borreliosis. the risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands. Section I. The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands. In chapter 2 and 3, incidence rates of general practitioners (GP) consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses in 2009 and 2014 in the Netherlands are estimated using identical methods as for the preceding nationwide retrospective cross-sectional GP surveys on 1994, 2001 and 2005. Based on two retrospective cross-sectional surveys of the general population, incidence rates and national estimates of total numbers of tick bites among the general population of the Netherlands in 1996 and 2007 were calculated, and these were compared to the observed incidence of GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses in 1994 and 2005. 14General introduction Chapter 4 reports the first nationwide incidence estimates of the whole range of disease expressions of Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands, including erythema migrans, disseminated Lyme borreliosis and persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis. These nationwide representative incidence rates were obtained through a two-step approach of a cross-sectional retrospective questionnaire among physicians, followed by a validation questionnaire to categorize reported cases according to likelihood of the diagnosis and to exclude cases diagnosed outside the target period. Chapter 5 focusses on the incidence of Lyme carditis, a rare manifestation of Lyme borreliosis which can occasionally be life-threatening. To validate and adjust the incidence rate of Lyme carditis diagnoses that were reported by GPs in chapter 4, medical records of patients with Lyme carditis were reviewed and categorised according to likelihood of the diagnosis of Lyme carditis. Section II. The public health impact of Lyme borreliosis. To support public health policy makers in their prioritization of prevention and control efforts for Lyme borreliosis, chapter 6 presents the first estimate of the public-health impact of Lyme borreliosis in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs: a combination of the duration and severity of disease with the number of people who get the disease). And in chapter 7 the societal cost of Lyme borreliosis is estimated in Euro, taking healthcare costs, patient costs and production loss into account. The incidence rates of Lyme borreliosis from chapter 4 are used in both chapters, as well as a patient questionnaire on the duration and severity of Lyme borreliosis, and costs due to Lyme borreliosis. Section III. The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands. Chapter 8 describes a nationwide prospective study on the transmission risk for B. burgdorferi to humans among patients presenting at the general practitioner with a tick bite or erythema migrans. The risk of infection after a tick bite was quantified, and risk factors were explored such as tick testing for B. burgdorferi and assessment of the duration of the tick's blood meal. Symptoms and serology were investigated at enrolment and after three months after tick bites, and after standard treatment for erythema migrans. In chapter 9, we developed a mathematical model to identify persons with a higher risk of developing Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite. Data of three large prospective studies on the transmission risk of tick-borne pathogens to humans in the Netherlands (among which the study described in chapter 8) were 151General introduction combined to estimate the risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite, and quantify the influence of developmental stage of the tick, detection of B. burgdorferi DNA in the tick by PCR, tick engorgement, patient-estimated duration of tick attachment, and patient age. Chapter 10 focusses on tick-borne infections other than Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands. Ticks and blood samples from the participants of the nationwide prospective study (chapter 8) were tested for DNA of Borrelia-, Anaplasma-, Rickettsia- and Babesia-species, and of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), using molecular detection techniques (polymerase chain reaction or PCR). We estimated the incidence of these tick-borne infections, and explored associations with self-reported symptoms. In chapter 11, the main findings of this thesis are discussed in an integrated way in the general discussion, followed by a summary of the main findings.16General introduction References 1.

In this paper, we report incidence estimates for GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses in 2009, and we compare the observed increase in GP consultations to reports of tick bites in two retrospective cross-sectional surveys of the general population. Methods All GPs in the Netherlands were asked to complete a postal questionnaire on the number of consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses in 2009, and the size of their practice populations. To investigate how the incidence of GP consultation rates for tick bites and erythema migrans relate to the incidence of tick bites in the general population, questionnaire data on tick bites were analyzed from two large population surveys conducted to evaluate the national immunization program in 1995/1996 and 2006/2007. Results The 2009 GP survey revealed a further increase, to 564 tick bite consultations per 100,000 inhabitants, and 134 erythema migrans diagnoses per 100,000 inhabitants of the Netherlands. The two population surveys from 1995/1996 and 2006/2007 exhibited an almost twofold increase of the incidence of tick bites in the general population from 4099 per 100,000 population in 1996, to 7198 per 100,000 population in 2007. People nationwide noticed approximately 1.1 million tick bites in 2007. Conclusions Our observation of increases in GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses between 1994 and 2009 are confirmed by the parallel increase of tick bites reported by the general population, although consultation rates slightly increased. For every sixty tick bites in the general population in 2007, we observed one GP consult for erythema migrans. The increase in tick bites poses a progressive threat to public health.232Continuing increase of tick bites and Lyme disease between 1994 and 2009 Introduction As reporting of Lyme borreliosis is not mandatory in the Netherlands, the National Public Health Institute (RIVM) conducted nationwide cross-sectional retrospective studies among general practitioners (GP) to assess the disease incidence [De Mik 1997; Den Boon 2004; Hofhuis 2006]. These three GP surveys have shown a continuing increase between 1994 and 2005 in GP consultations for tick bites, and in erythema migrans diagnoses, the most common early manifestation of Lyme borreliosis. The incidence of tick bite consultations increased linearly from 191 per 100,000 in 1994 to 446 per 100,000 inhabitants, i.e. 73,000 GP consultations for tick bites in the Netherlands in 2005. Concurrently, the incidence of erythema migrans diagnoses increased from 39 to 104 per 100,000 inhabitants, i.e. 17,000 patients with erythema migrans seen by all GPs in the Netherlands in 2005 [De Mik 1997; Den Boon 2004; Hofhuis 2006]. The identical methods and materials of our earlier GP surveys on 1994, 2001 and 2005, with large numbers of responding GPs, argue for the reliability of the observed increasing trend in GP consultations for tick bites and GP diagnoses of erythema migrans. Likewise, neighboring countries have reported increases of Lyme borreliosis during the past decades [Hub\u00e1lek 2009; Smith and Takkinen 2006]. And simultaneous to the observed increasing trend over time, there is evidence for an increase in the total number of Ixodes ricinus infected the Netherlands [Sprong 2012]. However, GP consultations for tick bites reflect an unknown fraction of tick bites in the general population, as only some people bitten by ticks will consult a physician. Whether people decide to consult a physician for a tick bite, rather than removing the tick themselves, may be influenced by media attention and public health education regarding prompt tick removal and when to visit a physician. After each GP survey, we have communicated our results to the GPs and the general population, and every time this caused a national media hype on tick bites and erythema migrans. Therefore, the question arises whether and to what extent the GP reports might be biased. In this paper, we report incidence estimates for GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses in 2009, which are in line with the earlier observed increasing trend between 1994 and 2005. We aim to confirm the increase in GP consultations for tick bites through comparison with the incidence of tick bites in the general population, as measured in two population based surveys.24Section I: The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands Methods GP survey on tick bites and erythema migrans in 2009 We assessed the incidence of GP consultations for tick bites and diagnoses of erythema migrans in 2009, using identical methods as for the preceding GP surveys on 1994, 2001 and 2005 [De Mik 1997; Den Boon 2004; Hofhuis 2006]. Preliminary results of the 2009 GP survey have been reported in Dutch in 2010 [Hofhuis 2010]. February 2010 our epidemiology group sent a pre-coded questionnaire on a postal business reply card to all 8850 GPs in our country, inquiring about the number of consultations for tick bites and diagnoses of erythema migrans in 2009 and the size of their practice population. Reminders were sent to non-responding GPs. As every person in the Netherlands is registered with only one GP , we used the practice populations of reporting GPs to calculate incidence rates and national estimates of total numbers among the population of the Netherlands. Responses to the questions were pre-coded in categories to which values were assigned based on the best fit of an assumed underlying Poisson distribution, as published by [De Mik 1997]. Incidence rates for tick bites and erythema migrans were estimated per 100,000 GP practice population in 2009, and bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for the national incidence estimates were calculated through resampling of the GPs reports 10,000 times. The unit of sampling in the bootstrap analysis concerned the report of a single general practice. Bootstrap resampling was required, as the 95% confidence intervals for incidence estimates should reflect the number of reporting GPs and each GPs number of consultations and practice population combined, instead of the size of the total practice population over all reporting GPs. Tick bites in the general population compared to GP consultations To assess the incidence of tick bites in the general population, we analyzed data from questionnaires of two highly similar nationwide cross-sectional population surveys conducted in the Netherlands in 1995/1996 and 2006/2007. The study populations of these surveys were randomly selected from 48 municipalities distributed over the country to be regionally and demographically representative of the country. The population survey proposal was approved by the Medical Ethics Testing Committee of the foundation of therapeutic evaluation of medicines in Almere, clinical trial population base seroprevalence studies were conducted primarily to evaluate the national immunization program. Both questionnaires also included one question on how many times the participant had been bitten by ticks during 252Continuing increase of tick bites and Lyme disease between 1994 and 2009 the preceding five years. These data were available for 9207 participants of the population survey from 1995/1996 (hereinafter referred to as 1996) and 9600 participants of the survey from 2006/2007 (hereafter 2007). The response to the question on tick bites was pre-coded in categories. To enable calculation of incidence rates and national estimates of the total number of tick bites, a value was assigned to these categories based on the best fit of an assumed underlying Poisson distribution: no tick bites' or more tick bites' = 14.753. The national incidence rates and the total number of tick bites in the general population were estimated using the R package \"survey\" [Lumley 2012], accounting for the age and gender distribution of the general population in the Netherlands. To compare the number of people with a tick bite or erythema migrans who consult a GP with the number of people who do not, we calculated tick bite rates and compared these between these two groups for 1996 and 2007. Data from the 48 municipalities of the 1996 population survey were linked to the same municipalities of the 1994 GP survey [De Mik 1997]. Data from the 48 municipalities of the 2007 population survey were linked to those of the 2005 GP survey [Hofhuis 2006]. The rates for both groups (GPconsulted yes or no) and both years (year 1996 or 2007) were estimated using Poisson regression with a log-link function. The number of tick bites was taken as the response variable. GP (yes or no), year (1996 or 2007), and their interaction were put in the model as explanatory variables. For the GP \"no\" group, the logarithm of the number of respondents to the population survey were taken as an offset, while for the GP \"yes\" group, the logarithm of the size of GP practice population was taken as an offset. We accounted for clustering within municipalities, by adding a random intercept to our model. Differences between the two groups are reported as rate ratios (relative rates). We call this ratio the \"consultation ratio\". Additionally, we extended our analysis to high- and low-risk municipalities, using as cut-off the median incidence (150 per 100,000) of consultations for tick bites in 1994. To assess the goodness of fit of these models, we performed Pearson's chi-squared test on the residuals. Data pre-processing and statistical analyses were performed in SAS version 9.1.3, and in R version 3.0.1. Results GP survey on tick bites and erythema migrans in 2009 The response rate to our postal questionnaire was 51% (4480/8850) among GPs, whose practice population includes 10.7 million persons, which is65% of the 16.5 million inhabitants of the Netherlands in 2009. Fig. 1 26Section I: The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands shows the incidence of GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans (EM) diagnoses per 100,000 inhabitants in 2009, as well as for the preceding GP surveys in 1994 [De Mik 1997], 2001 [Den Boon 2004], 2005 [Hofhuis 2006]. In 2009, the incidence of GP consultations for tick bites was 564 per 100,000 inhabitants of the Netherlands, and the incidence for GP diagnosed erythema migrans was 134 per 100,000 inhabitants of the Netherlands (see Fig. 1), showing a continuation of the earlier observed linearly rising trend. The large number of responses to the survey permitted a high-confidence estimate of 93,000 Figure 1.

Fig. 2 shows the geographical distribution of the incidence of GP consultations for tick bites (panel A) and erythema migrans diagnoses (panel B) per 100,000 inhabitants in 1994 [De Mik 1997], 2001 [Den Boon 2004], 2005 [Hofhuis 2006], and 2009. The greatest increase in tick bites and erythema migrans was seen in the northeast of the country, and several locations along the west coast. Tick bites in the general population compared to GP consultations Table 1 shows estimated incidence rates and national numbers of tick bites in the general population, with percentages of subjects with tick bites. In the nationwide survey of the general population in 1996, 8% of the subjects reported at least one tick bite during the preceding five years, and this percentage increased to 13% in 2007. The annual incidence of tick bites increased from 4099 per 100,000 population in 1996, to 7198 per 100,000 population in 2007. Based on the incidence estimation, people nationwide noticed approximately 1.1 million tick bites in 2007 (see Table 1). The increasing incidence in the general population is depicted in Fig. 1, alongside the similarly increasing incidence of GP consultations for tick bites between 1994 and 2009. The consultation ratio for tick bites over all municipalities of the combined surveys of 1996 and 2007 was 6.8% (95%CI 6.4%-7.4%) (model fit p = 0.99). So, for every fifteen tick bites reported in the general population, we observed one GP consult for a tick bite. We observed a statistically significant increase in the percentage of GP consultations for tick bites, relative to those reported by the general population, from 5.6% (95%CI 5.0%-6.3%) in 1996 to 7.8% (95%CI 7.1%-8.6%) in 2007 (see Table 1). This increase of consultation ratio was strongest and statistically significant among the municipalities classified as low-risk for tick bites, i.e. those below the median incidence of GP consultations for tick bites in 1994. Among municipalities classified as high-risk in 1994, no statistically significant change was observed in the consultation ratio for tick bites between 1996 and 2007. Comparing GP diagnoses of erythema migrans to tick bites in the general population, we found a consultation ratio of 1.0% (95%CI 0.9%-1.2%) in 1996, indicating that approximately for every hundred tick bites recognized in the general population, we observed one GP-diagnosed erythema migrans. In 2007, the consultation ratio for erythema migrans had increased with statistical significance to 1.8% (95%CI 1.6%-1.9%). Irrespective of the infection rate of the ticks, attachment time and awareness of tick bites and erythema migrans, approximately for every sixty tick bites reported in the general population in 2007, we observed one GP-diagnosed erythema migrans.28Section I: The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands Table 1.

Fig. 3 shows similar distributions of age-specific incidences of tick bites per year in 1996 and 2007, with a clearly elevated incidence across all age groups in 2007. Compared to the overall incidence, a relatively low risk of tick bites was observed in children below 4 years of age, and the highest incidence rates occurred in children aged 10-19 years (see Fig. 3).292Continuing increase of tick bites and Lyme disease between 1994 and 2009 Discussion The rise in the incidence of GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses between 1994 and 2005 [De Mik 1997; Den Boon 2004; Hofhuis 2006] has continued according to our 2009 GP survey, to 564 tick bite consultations per 100,000 inhabitants, and 134 erythema migrans diagnoses per 100,000 inhabitants of the Netherlands in 2009. Independent of the GP surveys, and supportive of this rising trend in GP consultations between 1994 and 2009, we observed a substantial increase of recognized tick bites in the general population of the Figure 2. The geographical distribution of the incidence of general practitioner (GP) consultations for tick bites (panel A) and erythema migrans diagnoses (panel B) per 100,000 inhabitants in 1994 [De Mik 1997], 2001 [Den Boon 2004], 2005 [Hofhuis 2006], and 2009.30Section I: The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands Netherlands from 1996 to 2007, based on data from two similar large cross- sectional population surveys. The regionally and demographically representative design of these large cross-sectional population surveys allows for estimation that 1.1 million tick bites were noticed nationwide in 2007. This nationwide estimate does not account for tick bites that go unnoticed, which have been estimated at about one third, and up to two thirds of all tick bites, as observed among patients with Lyme borreliosis [Hofhuis 2013; Strle 1996, 2002]. To what extent selection bias may have influenced our outcomes is unclear. Recall bias may have caused underestimation of the number of tick bites while telescoping bias [Huttenlocher 1990] may have led to counting tick bites from longer ago than those asked for in the preceding five years. The increase in tick bites has widespread consequences for public health, not only because of the risk of Lyme borreliosis, but also because of possible transmission of other established or potentially pathogenic tick-borne microorganisms [Wielinga 2006]. Marked increases in the incidence of Lyme borreliosis have been reported by several European countries, although some other countries did not record any increasing or decreasing trends [Hub\u00e1lek 2009; Smith 2006]. Comparability of incidence rates for tick bites and Lyme borreliosis between countries is poor, due to differences in data collection. For instance, some use Incidence of tick bites per 100,000 inhabitants of the Netherlands in 1996 and 2007, stratified per age category. Vertical bars represent 95% confidence intervals.312Continuing increase of tick bites and Lyme disease between 1994 and 2009 surveys whereas others use national voluntary reporting systems based on laboratory outcomes. Accordingly, divergent incidence rates for tick bites and Lyme borreliosis have been reported, and comparisons can only be made of year-to-year information within countries [Hub\u00e1lek 2009; Smith 2006; Lindgren 2006]. Changes in the Dutch landscape may have provided favorable conditions for ticks, bringing their habitat closer to human society [Sprong 2012; Coipan 2013]. Human recreational or behavioral changes may also contribute to our increasing exposure to ticks, although it is difficult to collect consistent data on that subject. The questionnaire response among general practitioners to the GP surveys has gradually declined from 79% in 1994 to 51% in 2009. But the population coverage, based on the GPs practice populations, showed a lesser decrease, covering 88% of the inhabitants of the Netherlands in 1994 to 65% in 2009. We did not detect any relation between response rates of the GPs and reported numbers of consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses, as response rates and point estimates did not differ between practices that responded to one, two, three or four GP surveys, nor between small or large GP practices. Therefore we conclude that the decline in response rate did not substantially bias our incidence estimates, if yet, only the 95% confidence intervals around the estimate have slightly expanded (see Fig. 1). Comparing tick bites reported by the general population to GP consultations for ti ck bites, we observed increasing consultation ratios for tick bites between 1996 and 2007, specifically in low-risk municipalities. This in dicates an increase in the habit of consulting a physician for a tick bite, and may have slightly exaggerated the increase of tick bite consultations at the GP . People living in high-risk areas may already have been more familiar with tick removal, having experienced mo re bites, whereas people in low-risk areas increased their concern and GP consultations as the tick bites increased. Comparing GP diagnoses of erythema migrans to tick bites reported by the general population, we observed consultation ratios that are comparable to the risk estimates for developing erythema migrans after tick bites as observed in prospective studies [Hofhuis 2013; Fryland 2011; Huegli 2011]. The increase in consultation ratios fo r erythema migrans could reflect an increasing risk of infection after tick bites. However, there is no evidence for rising numbers of ticks infected with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, to substantiate this possibility [Sprong 2012]. Alternatively, the increasing trend in consultation ratios may reflect the success of public health educational messages about identification of erythema migrans and the need to seek treatment, which may have slightly exaggerated the increase of GP consultations. Increased media attention to tick bites and Lyme borreliosis may have also contributed to increased awareness among physicians and the general population.32Section I: The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands Conclusion Our nationwide cross-sectional retrospective GP surveys have shown a continuing increase in GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses from 1994 and 2009, to 564 tick bite consultations per 100,000 inhabitants, and 134 erythema migrans diagnoses per 100,000 inhabitants of the Netherlands in 2009, although consultation rates slightly increased. The increase in GP consultations is confirmed by the parallel rise of tick bites reported by the general population between 1996 and 2007. The increase in tick bites, to an estimated 1.1 million in the general population in 2007, poses a progressive threat to public health. Irrespective of the infection rate of ticks, attachment time and awareness of tick bites and erythema migrans, we observed one GP consultancy for erythema migrans, for every sixty tick bites in the general population in 2007.

H. Cees C. van den Wijngaard Wilfrid van Pelt36Section I: The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands Abstract Background Nationwide surveys have shown a threefold increase in general practitioner (GP) consultations for tick bites and early Lyme borreliosis from 1994 to 2009 in the Netherlands. We now report an update on 2014, with identical methods as for the preceding GP surveys. Methods To all GPs in the Netherlands, a postal questionnaire was sent inquiring about the number of consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses (most common manifestation of early Lyme borreliosis) in 2014, and the size of their practice populations. Results Contrasting to the previously rising incidence of consultations for tick bites between 1994 and 2009, the incidence decreased in 2014 to 488 consultations for tick bites per 100,000 inhabitants, i.e., 82,000 patients nationwide. This survey revealed a first sign of stabilization of the previously rising trend in GP diagnosed erythema migrans, with 140 diagnoses per 100,000 inhabitants of the Netherlands. This equals about 23,500 annual diagnoses of erythema migrans nationwide in 2014. Conclusions In contrast to the constantly rising incidence of GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses in the Netherlands between 1994 and 2009, the current survey of 2014 showed a first sign of stabilization of erythema migrans diagnoses and a decreased incidence for tick bite consultations.373Decrease in tick bite consultations and stabilization of early Lyme borreliosis in 2014 Background Lyme borreliosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi sensu lato and is transmitted through the bite of infected ticks, mainly Ixodes ricinus ticks in Europe. Early localised infection is typically manifested as erythema migrans, a slowly expanding red or bluish-red skin lesion that is clinically diagnosed and generally treated successfully with oral antibiotics [1]. If the diameter of the lesion is less than five centimetre, the clinical diagnosis of erythema migrans requires a history of tick-bite, a delay in appearance after the tick bite of at least two days, and an expanding rash at the site of the tick-bite. If left untreated, disseminated Lyme borreliosis can develop (e.g., Lyme neuroborreliosis or Lyme arthritis) [1], causing a considerably larger disease burden[2]. Of the various clinical presentations of Lyme borreliosis, erythema migrans is the most common, accounting for about 60 to 95 % of diagnosed Lyme borreliosis in Europe [3-8]. In the Netherlands, the relative proportions for Lyme borreliosis diagnoses in 2010 were 91 % erythema migrans, 5.3 % disseminated Lyme borreliosis (mainly Lyme arthritis 2.1 %, Lyme neuroborreliosis 1.8 %, and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans 0.8 %), and 3.8 % persisting symptoms that were attributed to Lyme borreliosis [8]. Periodic nationwide cross-sectional retrospective studies among general practitioners (GPs) have shown a continuing and strong increase in GP consultations for tick bites and early Lyme borreliosis (measured as erythema migrans diagnoses) between 1994 and 2009 in the Netherlands [9-12]. A threefold increase was observed for the incidence of tick bite consultations from 191 per 100,000 in 1994 to 564 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2009, and concurrently the incidence of erythema migrans diagnoses increased from 39 to 134 per 100,000 inhabitants [9, 12]. Increases of Lyme borreliosis during the past decades have also been reported from other European countries [13] and from the North American continent[14, 15]. Possible explanations for these increases in the Netherlands are changes in the landscape that may have provided favourable conditions for ticks, bringing their habitat closer to humans, and increased total numbers of Ixodes ricinus ticks infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato in the Netherlands, possibly due to increased abundance of wildlife hosts [16]. We currently report an update on the incidence of GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses in 2014, assessed with identical methods as the preceding GP surveys for 1994, 2001, 2005 and 2009 [9, 12].38Section I: The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands Methods In December 2014, all 10,250 GPs in our country were asked to complete a brief postal questionnaire, and in January 2015 reminders were sent to non-responding GPs. With pre-coded response categories, the questionnaire inquired about the number of consultations for tick bites and diagnoses of erythema migrans in 2014, and the size of their practice population. Values were assigned to the pre-coded response categories, based on the best fit of an assumed underlying negative binomial distribution. As every person in the Netherlands is registered with only one GP , the GP practice populations were used to calculate incidence rates per 100,000 and total numbers among the 16.8 million inhabitants of the Netherlands in 2014. Bootstrap analysis (10,000 resamplings of the GP reports) was used to calculate 95 % confidence intervals (95%CI) for the incidence rates. Two point estimates with just non-overlapping 95%CI are a conservative estimate of being different at the 0.05 level of statistical significance. More extensive method descriptions can be found in publications on preceding GP surveys [9, 12]. Ethical approval was not required for this study, because the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act does not apply to this type of study, collecting physician-reported counts of patients diagnosed with Lyme borreliosis and counts of tick bite consultations. To examine a possible bias of our point estimates through declining GP response over the survey years, we compared incidence estimates for tick bite consultations and erythema migrans diagnoses, stratified for the GP practices that responded to 1-2, 3-4, or all 5 of our GP surveys. We also compared predicted incidence estimates for tick bite consultations and erythema migrans for a population coverage of 60, 75 and 90 %. We did so for each survey year independently, with a simple regression model, using for each municipality the number of reported erythema migrans diagnoses (or tick bite consultations), the patient population covered by the reporting practices as offset and the response being the fraction of the municipality population covered by the reporting practices. To explore a possible relation between the dynamics in Ixodes ricinus populations in the Netherlands and the dynamics of GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses, we included an additional analysis on changes in tick collections from the field between 2009 and 2014. In 2006, Wageningen University started a long-term tick monitoring program in the context of the Dutch phenological network \"Nature's Calendar\". Ticks were collected by groups of trained volunteers at 12 fixed forest plots of 200 square meters each distributed across the country [17]. From 2006 to the present, ticks have been collected in the first seven days of each month, year round. The T-test 393Decrease in tick bite consultations and stabilization of early Lyme borreliosis in 2014 was applied for comparison of the average annual numbers of Ixodes ricinus (larvae, nymphs and adults, averages calculated separately for each life stage) per field site per month. All ticks were recounted and identified to species and life stage by specialists at Wageningen University [17]. Figure 1.

The four identical GP surveys of 1994 to 2009 show a continuously rising trend in consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses. In 2014 the incidence of GP consultations for tick bites was 488 (95 % CI 473- 503) per 100,000 inhabitants of the Netherlands, showing a decreased incidence for the first time since the start of these identical GP surveys in 1994. In 2014 we observed a further rise of the incidence of erythema migrans diagnoses to 140 (95%CI 135- 144) per 100,000 inhabitants of the Netherlands, although the slope of the increase has decreased between 2009 and 2014. As the 95 % CI of the incidence rates in 2009 and 2014 overlap, these point estimates cannot be considered to be significantly different. All GPs nationwide saw approximately 82,000 patients with tick bites and 23,500 patients with erythema migrans in 2014. Figure 2 shows the geographical distribution of the incidence of erythema migrans diagnoses in 2014 compared to the preceding GP survey of 2009 [12]. The largest increase of erythema migrans incidence was observed in the Northeast of the Netherlands, and several locations along the West coast. 4203 GPs responded to our postal questionnaire comprising a practice population of 10.5 million persons, which covers 62 % of the 16.8 million inhabitants of the Netherlands in 2014. Table 1 shows the population coverage and incidence rates for GP-diagnosed erythema migrans in the identical surveys from 1994 to 2014. Compared to the mean incidence estimates for the whole of the Netherlands, incidence rates for erythema migrans diagnoses (see Table 1) and consultations for tick bites (not shown) did not differ substantially, nor with statistical significance, among the GP practices that responded to 1- 2, 3- 4, or all 5 GP surveys. However, among the GP practices that responded to all 5 GP surveys, the increasing trend in erythema migrans incidence is stronger between 2009 (132 per 100,000) and 2014 (151 per 100,000), with non-overlapping 95 % CI. The predicted incidence rates with population coverage set at 60 %, 75 % or 90 % also did not differ substantially, or with statistical significance, compared to the mean incidence estimates for the whole of the Netherlands. The predicted incidence rates for erythema migrans with population coverage set at 60, 75 or 90 % each showed a rising incidence with non-overlapping 95 % CI between 1994 and 2009, and a stabilizing incidence of erythema migrans in 2014, as was observed with the mean incidence estimates. With lower population coverage, our model predicted 413Decrease in tick bite consultations and stabilization of early Lyme borreliosis in 2014 slightly lower incidence rates. So the decline in population coverage over the years probably did not measurably bias our incidence estimates, if yet, only the 95 % CI around the estimate have slightly broadened (see Fig. 1).

The average annual number of nymphs per field site per month was 231 in 2014, which was 7 % higher compared to 217 in 2009 (difference not statistically significant). The average annual number of adult ticks per field site per month was 31 in 2014, which was 11 % higher compared to 28 in 2009 (difference not statistically significant). Discussion & conclusion In contrast to the constantly rising incidence of GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses between 1994 and 2009, we have currently observed a first sign of stabilization of erythema migrans diagnoses and a decreased incidence for tick bite consultations in 2014. Possibly, this decrease may have started earlier after 2009, as incidence rates for tick bite consultations and erythema migrans diagnoses similar to the incidence rates in 2014 have already been reported for 2010 [8]. The 2010 incidence rates for tick bite consultations and erythema migrans diagnoses were 495 (95 % CI 478-512) and 132 (95 % CI 127-136) per 100,000 respectively, as obtained in a nationwide cross-sectional retrospective survey among physicians, using an extended questionnaire on all Lyme borreliosis manifestations, with comparable methods to the current GP survey [8]. Based on relative proportions for Lyme borreliosis diagnoses in the Netherlands[8], the currently observed 23,500 erythema migrans diagnoses likely indicate an additional 1400 diagnoses with disseminated Lyme borreliosis, plus 1000 patients with Lyme-related persisting symptoms, resulting in a total of 25,800 cases with diagnosed Lyme borreliosis in 2014. Based on a previous study in which we compared the GP reports from 2005 to tick bites reported by the general population of the Netherlands, we observe one tick bite consultation for approximately every thirteen tick bites among the general population of the Netherlands (ratio 7.8 %) and we observe one GP-diagnosed erythema migrans for approximately every sixty tick bites among the general population of the Netherlands (1.8 %) [12]. This ratio for tick bites among the general population versus erythema migrans diagnoses is comparable to the risk estimates for developing erythema migrans after tick bites as observed in prospective studies [18- 20]. During the past decades, increases of Lyme borreliosis have been reported from European countries such as the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic 433Decrease in tick bite consultations and stabilization of early Lyme borreliosis in 2014 and Hungary[21- 23]. In Germany, the direct Eastern neighbour of the Netherland, the incidence of Lyme borreliosis increased between 2001 and 2006, and stabilized between 2009 and 2012[7, 24]. South to the Netherlands, in Belgium and France incidence rates for Lyme borreliosis remained stable between 2003 and 2012 [3, 25, 26]. The greatest increase in erythema migrans incidence was observed in the Northeast of the Netherlands and several locations along the West coast, between 2009 and 2014 (Fig. 2) as was seen between 1994 and 2009 [12]. This geographical distribution of high incidence regions for erythema migrans diagnoses is strongly correlated with tick presence as predicted through environmental risk mapping [27]. Geographically focal increases in erythema migrans incidence could be due to increases in the risk of infection with B. burgdorferi sensu lato after tick bites, or specifically B. afzelii which is mostly associated with skin manifestations such as erythema migrans and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans [28]. However, there is evidence for rising prevalence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in ticks, based on combined analysis of two large field studies [16]: one longitudinal series of tick collections between 2000 and 2009 in a coastal dune area[29], and the long-term tick monitoring program of Wageningen University geographically spread throughout the Netherlands between 2006 and 2009 [17]. For the first time since the start of our identical GP surveys in 1994, we have currently observed a decreased incidence for tick bite consultations. Our analyses of the average annual numbers of ticks per field site per month from the tick monitoring program of Wageningen University did not indicate a significant change in Ixodes ricinus abundance in the Netherlands between 2009 and 2014. While erythema migrans is a clear sign for a patient to seek medical care, most tick bites do not require a GP 's attention. Whether people decide to consult a physician for a tick bite, rather than remove the tick themselves, may be influenced by having tick bites frequently, public health education and media attention. Since the outcomes of the first GP survey on 1994 were reported, the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment of the Netherlands (RIVM), and Wageningen University, together with other stakeholders, have prompted extensive national media attention on Lyme borreliosis each year around springtime, with a national awareness week on tick bites (www .weekvandeteek.nl)to mark the onset of the tick bite season. The RIVM distributed annually updated campaign materials for public health education of the general population on the prevention of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis, and published a national guideline for professionals on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Lyme borreliosis [30]. The RIVM redesigned the campaign materials for public health 44Section I: The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands education of the general population in 2011, focussed on skin checks and removing ticks - which the public perceived most feasible[31], whereas previously the campaign materials presented all possible evidence based preventive measures. In 2012 the RIVM started approaching the public through social media, and with an educational online video [32], and school-aged children were targeted with an online serious game, teaching them about ticks and Lyme borreliosis in a playful way [33]. In 2014 a mobile phone app on ticks and Lyme borreliosis was launched. The effectivity of the educational online video, online game and the mobile phone app are being evaluated, to be published by Beaujean et al. Awaiting the study outcomes on effectivity of public health education, we tentatively propose that the decrease in GP consultations for tick bites may reflect the impact of repeated and redesigned efforts of public health education about the relevance of body checking and prompt tick removal and when to visit a physician. Further monitoring and analysis of the dynamics between humans and Ixodes ricinus (infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato), is required to identify reasons for the currently observed change in trend after 15 years of continuous increase of GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses in the Netherlands.

The objective of this study is to estimate the incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis, representative of our entire country, including erythema migrans, disseminated Lyme borreliosis and persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis. Methods A questionnaire on clinical diagnoses of Lyme borreliosis was sent to all GPs, company physicians, and medical specialists. To adjust for possible misclassification and telescoping bias, we sent additional questionnaires to categorize reported cases according to likelihood of the diagnosis and to exclude cases diagnosed outside the target period. Results Adjusted annual incidence rate for disseminated Lyme borreliosis was 7.7 GP reports per 100,000 inhabitants, and for persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis was 5.5 GP reports per 100,000 inhabitants, i.e. approximately 1,300 and 900 cases respectively. GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses were 495 and 132 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively, i.e. 82,000 and 22,000 cases in 2010. Conclusions This is the first reported nationwide physician survey on the incidence of tick bites and the whole range of manifestations of Lyme borreliosis, including persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis. This is crucial for complete assessment of the public health impact of Lyme borreliosis.494Physician reported incidence of early and late Lyme borreliosis Background Lyme borreliosis is an infectious disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species, and transmitted through tick bites. The disease most commonly manifests as erythema migrans, a slowly expanding skin lesion indicating early localized infection. If the infection spreads to other tissues and organs, it can cause disseminated Lyme borreliosis such as Lyme neuroborreliosis, Lyme atrophicans, Lyme ocular manifestations. Occasionally, symptoms persist after treatment [1]. Marked increases in the incidence of Lyme borreliosis have been reported over the past decades in several European countries [2-4] and in North America[5,6]. Assessment of the disease burden of Lyme borreliosis requires incidence estimates of all disease outcomes of Lyme borreliosis, ranging from the most common relatively mild early manifestation erythema migrans to the more severe disseminated Lyme borreliosis manifestations, and even persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis. However, few incidence estimates from European countries cover all disease expressions of Lyme borreliosis within one surveillance system or survey, representative for a whole country [1-4,7]. Underreporting and misclassification are common to all surveillance systems, and if only high-risk regions are studied, data collections are not representative for whole countries. Particularly with Lyme borreliosis, surveillance is complicated due to the non-specific nature of some disease expressions and the pitfalls of laboratory diagnostics [1-4]. The majority of European countries, including the Netherlands, have not made Lyme borreliosis mandatorily notifiable[2-4]. Most countrywide incidence estimates of Lyme borreliosis in Europe are based on passive reporting laboratory surveillance, using the available details of patients with positive laboratory tests. Unfortunately, erythema migrans is heavily underreported with laboratory surveillance for Lyme borreliosis, because erythema migrans cases are seronegative at presentation, and serologic testing is not routinely requested for erythema migrans. The other manifestations of Lyme borreliosis are overreported with laboratory surveillance, due to seropositivity linked to past exposure [1-4]. Other frequently applied approaches to collecting data on the occurrence of Lyme borreliosis and the relative frequency of its disease manifestations include monitoring of hospital in- and out-patient diagnoses, and physician surveys [8-14]. However none of the published incidence estimations represent the whole country, with exception of two published surveys in France [8,9], based on their GP sentinel surveillance network (a representative selection of all GP' s) and discharge reports of all hospitals.50Section I: The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands In the Netherlands, periodic nationwide cross-sectional retrospective studies among general practitioners (GPs) have revealed a continuing and strong increase in GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans between 1994 and 2009. The incidence of tick bite consultations increased linearly from 191 per 100,000 in 1994 to 564 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2009, and concurrently the incidence of erythema migrans diagnoses increased from 39 to 134 per 100,000 inhabitants [15-18]. Apart from these nationwide accurate incidence rates for tick bites and erythema migrans over time, the incidence of other manifestations of Lyme borreliosis remained unknown. Furthermore, reports on the occurrence of Lyme borreliosis have not yet touched on the relative occurrence of persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis [1-4]. Especially such long-term persisting conditions, with sometimes disabling symptoms, and these can have a great impact on the disease burden and cost-of-illness [1,19]. The objective of the current study is to estimate the incidence of tick bites and the whole range of disease expressions of Lyme borreliosis, including erythema migrans, disseminated Lyme borreliosis and persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis. To achieve this, we repeated our earlier nationwide GP surveys, this time including all manifestations of Lyme borreliosis, surveying all GPs, company physicians, and medical specialists who might be involved in the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Methods To rapidly assess a nationwide representative incidence rate for Lyme borreliosis, we performed a two-step approach. Firstly, a broad inquiry was required to also detect the less common disease manifestations. We sent a two-page retrospective questionnaire to all physicians possibly involved in the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme borreliosis in our country: 9178 GPs, 1321 company physicians (i.e. physicians to employee groups, vocational physicians from the private sector), and 5374 medical specialists in hospitals including neurologists, dermatologists, cardiologists, pediatricians, rheumatologists, internists and ophthalmologists. Questionnaires were sent and returned by the postal service. A reminder was sent to non-responding physicians. The questionnaire inquired about consultations for tick bites and diagnosed erythema migrans in 2010. For the less common manifestations of disseminated Lyme borreliosis and persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis, we requested clinical diagnoses for the two-year period of 2009-2010. The inquired manifestations of disseminated included borrelial acrodermatitis and ocular 514Physician reported incidence of early and late Lyme borreliosis manifestations, and diagnoses of persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis, including Lyme encephalopathy and persisting symptoms after treatment for Lyme borreliosis. As every person in the Netherlands is registered with only one GP , we used the practice populations of reporting GPs to calculate incidence rates and national estimates of total numbers among the population of the Netherlands. As company physicians and medical specialists do not have a clearly defined patient population at risk, their questionnaires were only used for proportional comparison of reported numbers of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis. Physician responses to the questions on consultations for tick bites, erythema migrans diagnoses, and size of practice population were pre-coded in categories to which values were assigned based on the best fit of an assumed underlying negative binomial distribution. Incidence rates for the three categories of Lyme borreliosis were estimated per 100,000 GP practice population in 2010, and bootstrap 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for the incidence rates were calculated by resampling of the GP reports 10,000 times. Bootstrap resampling was required, as the 95%CI for incidence rates should reflect the number of reporting GPs and each GP practice population combined, instead of the size of the practice populations over all reporting GPs. We screened questionnaires of physicians that reported the top 10% highest incidence of Lyme borreliosis, and excluded questionnaires with clearly deviating answers or unsatisfactory internal consistency (e.g. if a GP reported high numbers of uncommon disease manifestations such as Lyme carditis or ocular manifestations, without reporting common disease manifestations such as erythema migrans, Lyme neuroborreliosis or Lyme arthritis). To establish case definitions, we adapted the clinical case definitions proposed by Stanek et al. [6] with input from physicians of each medical specialism included in the survey, recommended to us by their national associations and input from the Dutch national patients' association for Lyme borreliosis. Additionally, we designed case definitions for Lyme encephalopathy and persisting symptoms after treatment for Lyme borreliosis. These were included to ensure inclusion of all diagnoses used in GP practice, although these persisting symptoms were analyzed as one category, because there are no clear criteria that distinguish between them. To achieve a high GP response rate, we inquired about clinical diagnoses of Lyme borreliosis in the first step of our two-step approach (see Table 1), not asking the GP to look into laboratory diagnostics that had been ordered and judged by medical specialists in hospitals. Instead, the laboratory diagnostics were verified in the second part of our two-step approach: validation of the GP reports, to verify and adjust the crude incidence rates of disseminated 52Section I: The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands Lyme borreliosis and persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis. For this validation we used additional questionnaires, inquiring detailed information on diagnostic criteria. GPs reporting one or two cases of Lyme borreliosis received a questionnaire (see Additional file 1) with regard to applied diagnostic criteria, clinical symptoms, anamnestic tick bites or other diagnoses of Lyme borreliosis, the year of diagnosis with Lyme borreliosis, whether the diagnosis was made by the GP or a medical specialist, treatment, recovery, differential diagnoses and how these were ruled out. GPs reporting more than two cases of Lyme borreliosis received a short questionnaire (see Additional file 2) on general criteria for diagnosis, inquiring whether a medical specialist is normally consulted, and whether laboratory outcomes, clinical symptoms, and anamnestic tick bites or the presence of other (earlier) Lyme borreliosis manifestations are taken into account. Considering the complexities in the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis, we categorized the cases of disseminated Lyme borreliosis according to the likelihood of diagnosis into 'very likely', 'likely', and 'possible' (see Table 2). We labelled GP reports as 'invalid reports', when a GP declared to have erroneously marked the Lyme borreliosis case on the questionnaire, or if the diagnosis Lyme borreliosis was abandoned after further diagnostics. For persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis we left out the 'very likely' category, as this diagnosis is always uncertain [1]. To correct for 'telescoping bias'[20], we determined the percentage of cases diagnosed with disseminated Lyme borreliosis within the target period of 2009 and 2010. The target period for diagnosis for persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis was extended to 2008-2010, to include the cases who developed Lyme borreliosis in 2008 and were diagnosed with persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis in 2009-2010. We adjusted the crude incidence rates of our incidence survey according to the proportion of \"very likely\" diagnosis for disseminated Lyme borreliosis, and \"likely\" diagnosis for persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis, and according to the proportion of GP reports within the targeted period of diagnosis (2009 and 2010 for disseminated Lyme borreliosis, 2008 to 2010 for persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme). Additionally, we performed a secondary adjustment scenario to estimate the occurrence of all Lyme borreliosis reports, including the less likely reports, because they do contribute to the disease burden and costs for our society as well as the individual patient.534Physician reported incidence of early and late Lyme borreliosis Table 1.

In this target period adjustment scenario, only invalid reports were excluded and crude incidence was adjusted according to the proportion of GP reports within the targeted period of diagnosis. Data preprocessing and statistical analyses were performed in SAS version 9.1.3, and in R version 3.0.1. In this study, physicians reported only the number of patients diagnosed with Lyme borreliosis and diagnostic methods used to make these diagnoses. Therefore, the Medical Ethics Review Committee UMC Utrecht declared that the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act does not apply to this study (protocol number 14-415/C, letter number WAG/th/14/021989).56Section I: The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands Results Among GPs, the response rate to our questionnaire was 39% (3584 out of 9178), representing a total practice population of 8.7 million pe rsons, which is 53% of the 16.6 million inhabitants of the Netherlands. Among company physicians, the response rate was 30% (391/1321) representing one million employees, which is 14% of our country's labor force. Among medical specialists, the response was 35% (1860/5347, hospital catchment population unknown). Table 3 shows the crude and adjusted incidence and national numbers, and 95% CI of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in 2010. The incidence rates of GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses respectively were 495 (95% CI 478-512) and 132 (95% CI 127-136) per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010. All GPs nationwide saw approximately 82,000 patients with tick bites and 22,000 patients with erythema migrans in 2010. The crude incidence of disseminated Lyme borreliosis was 13.6 (95% CI 12.7-14.5) per 100,000 inhabitants, and for persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis we estimated an incidence of 13.7 (95% CI 12.7-14.6) per 100,000 inhabitants. The clinical diagnoses for Lyme borreliosis among GPs were mainly (85%) for erythema migrans (see Figure 1). Of all Lyme-related diagnoses at the GP , 7.5% concerned disseminated Lyme borreliosis, and another 7.5% concerned persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis. Erythema migrans is usually diagnosed by GPs, but they still represent 33% of all Lyme borreliosis diagnoses made by company physicians and 49% of all Lyme borreliosis diagnoses made by medical specialists. For the latter, diagnoses of disseminated Lyme borreliosis and persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis together represent more than half of their Lyme borreliosis diagnoses. Lyme borreliosis diagnoses by company physicians are predominantly about persisting symptoms, but also include disseminated Lyme borreliosis (Figure 1). The response rate to our validation questionnaire among GPs was 47% (855/1832) for the short questionnaire, and 20% (276/1399) for the long questionnaire. As shown in Table 2, 89.3% of the cases of disseminated Lyme borreliosis satisfied our validation criteria for a very likely diagnosis, 4.6% were categorized as likely, and 3.7% was categorized as possible. For persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis, 76.1% of the cases satisfied our criteria for a likely diagnosis and 19.5% was categorized as possible. 2.4% and 4.4% of the reports were categorized as invalid for disseminated Lyme borreliosis and persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis, respectively. For disseminated Lyme borreliosis, 63.1% of the cases were diagnosed within the targeted period of 2009 and 2010. For persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme 574Physician reported incidence of early and late Lyme borreliosis Table 3.

We estimated the adjusted annual incidence for a very likely diagnosis of disseminated Lyme borreliosis at 7.7 (95% CI 7.2-8.2) per 100,000 inhabitants in 2009 and 2010. For persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis, we estimated the adjusted annual incidence at 5.5 (95% CI 5.1-5.8) per 100,000 inhabitants. Consequently, the national number of patients annually seen by all GPs in 2009 and 2010 was estimated at approximately 1300 patients with disseminated Lyme borreliosis and 900 patients with persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis (Table 3). After adjusting, erythema migrans represented 90.9% of the clinical diagnoses for Lyme borreliosis reported by the 58Section I: The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands GP , while 5.3% of the diagnoses concerned disseminated Lyme borreliosis, and 3.8% concerned persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis (see Figure 1). Figure 2 shows the adjusted incidence per Lyme borreliosis manifestation. Lyme arthritis and Lyme neuroborreliosis were the most frequent clinical manifestations of disseminated Lyme borreliosis, with annual incidence rates of 3.0 (95% CI 2.8-3.3) and 2.6 (95% CI 2.4-2.8) per 100,000 inhabitants. Finally, the scenario to estimate the occurrence of all Lyme borreliosis reports including less likely diagnoses, yielded an annual incidence rate of 8.4 diagnoses per 100,000 inhabitants for disseminated Lyme borreliosis, and 6.9 diagnoses per 100,000 inhabitants for persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis in 2009 and 2010 (see 95% CI in Table 3).Figure 1. Lyme borreliosis manifestations as a proportion of all Lyme-related diagnoses, of (crude)Persisting symptoms at tributed me borr eliosis Erythema migr ans594Physician reported incidence of early and late Lyme borreliosis Discussion We report the first incidence estimations of disseminated Lyme borreliosis and persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis, based on a short questionnaire with clinical case definitions, sent to all GPs in the Netherlands. Furthermore, this is the first reported physician survey on tick bites and all manifestations of Lyme borreliosis that covers an entire country. The incidence rates of GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses respectively were 495 and 132 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010. After validation of the GP reports, we estimated an adjusted annual incidence of 7.7 very likely disseminated Lyme borreliosis diagnoses per 100,000 inhabitants of the Netherlands in 2009 and 2010, and 5.5 likely diagnoses of persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis per 100,000 inhabitants in 2009 and 2010 (see Table 3). When less likely diagnoses were included to estimate the occurrence of all Lyme borreliosis reports, the annual incidence rate was 8.4 for disseminated Lyme borreliosis diagnoses per 100,000 inhabitants, and 6.9 diagnoses for persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis per 100,000 inhabitants. These estimates reflect all morbidity attributed to Lyme borreliosis by GPs. There is an ongoing debate to what extent past or present Borrelia infection actually causes this condition of persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis [21]. Nevertheless, about 900 patients consulted their GP in 2010 for such persisting symptoms which their GP attributed to Lyme borreliosis. This calls for further research to the causal mechanisms of this condition - whether or not caused by past or present Borrelia infection - to improve clinical care for this substantial patient group. Not all patients with Lyme borreliosis are correctly diagnosed and treated in practice, which may lead to underestimation of the disease occurrence. Some publications on underreporting of Lyme borreliosis state that the true incidence rate may be two to eight times higher than measured [22,23]. On the other hand, misdiagnosis and misclassification can cause overestimation, which we reduced through quantification of telescoping bias, and validation of the likelihood of diagnosis, based on the applied clinical and laboratory criteria. We achieved sufficient GP response to account for 53% of the inhabitants of the Netherlands, which is comparable to the response rates of the preceding GP surveys. The incidence rates for tick bites and erythema migrans in 2010 were similar to the estimates from the GP survey in 2009, confirming that the extended survey was consistent with the earlier GP studies. The small differences can be ascribed to the annual fluctuation typically observed in the surveillance of Lyme borreliosis [5,6].60Section I: The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands Comparability of incidence rates between countries is poor, due to differences in data collection. Accordingly, divergent incidence rates for Lyme borreliosis have been reported, and only year-to-year comparisons of the incidence rate within countries can be made [2-4]. However, countries can be compared as to the proportional occurrence of clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis. As opposed to physician based studies from other countries [8-10,12,14], persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis were included in our questionnaire and case definitions. Excluding persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis, we observed a proportion of 95% of erythema migrans diagnoses relative to all GP-reported clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis. This is in line with the proportions reported in France and Southern and Eastern Germany while in Figure 2. Adjusted incidence rates of general practitioner consultations for tick bites and Lyme borreliosis diagnoses per 100,000 inhabitants of the Netherlands in 2010. Vertical bars represent 95% confidence intervals. *For comparison, the incidence of tick bite consultations and diagnoses of erythema migrans diagnoses per 100,000 inhabitants in 2009 was 564 and 134, respectively [18].614Physician reported incidence of early and late Lyme borreliosis Southern Sweden a lower proportion of 77% was found[8,10,12,14]. In our study, as well as in France, Germany and Sweden, the two most commonly GP-reported disseminated manifestations of Lyme borreliosis were Lyme were uncommon in all countries [8-10,12,14]. Comparability between countries is also hampered by differences in health-care systems. Patients in the Netherlands are required to consult a GP to be referred to a medical specialist in a hospital. As a result, erythema migrans is usually diagnosed and treated by GPs, and not by medical specialists. This is illustrated by our relatively low proportion of diagnoses by medical specialists, as compared to GP diagnoses (53% vs 95%), although the proportion of hospital diagnoses of erythema migrans from Northeastern France (60%) [13], and in a group of hospitals surveyed in fifteen European countries (59% of Lyme-related skin manifestations) [11] was only slightly higher. The latter study of Cimmino et al. in 1994 included the Netherlands, where six medical specialists reported 42% skin manifestations, mostly erythema migrans. Considering all GP-reported Lyme borreliosis, 5.3% of the diagnoses concerned disseminated Lyme borreliosis, and 3.8% concerned persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis (see Figure 1). Due to the high disease burden and costs associated with disseminated Lyme borreliosis and persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis, they will contribute greatly to the public health impact of Lyme borreliosis in our society. Combined with data on disease burden and costs, the annual numbers per disease manifestation estimated in this study can be used to assess the annual disease burden and cost-of-illness of Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands. Conclusion The current study demonstrates that nationwide representative incidence rates for GP reported tick bites and all manifestations of Lyme borreliosis can be obtained rapidly through a two-step approach of a cross-sectional retrospective questionnaire among physicians, followed by a validation questionnaire to adjust for possible misclassification and telescoping bias. We report the first estimations for the occurrence in the Netherlands of disseminated Lyme borreliosis and of persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis, respectively 7.7 and 5.5 GP diagnoses per 100,000 inhabitants. These estimates are crucial for assessment of the public health impact of Lyme borreliosis.62Section I: The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands Acknowledgements The authors acknowledge all physicians responding to our postal questionnaire.

Hofhuis S.M. Tukkie W . van I: The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands Abstract Background Between 1994 and 2009, incidence rates of general practitioner (GP) consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans, the most common early manifestation of Lyme borreliosis, have increased substantially in the Netherlands. The current article aims to estimate and validate the incidence of GP-reported Lyme carditis in the Netherlands. Methods W e sent a questionnaire to all GPs in the Netherlands on clinical diagnoses of Lyme borreliosis in 2009 and 2010. T o validate and adjust the obtained incidence rate, medical records of cases of Lyme carditis reported by GPs in this incidence survey were reviewed and categorised according to likelihood of the diagnosis of Lyme carditis. Results Lyme carditis occurred in 0.2 % of all patients with GP-reported Lyme borreliosis. The adjusted annual incidence was six GP-reported cases of Lyme carditis per 10 million inhabitants, i.e. approximately ten cases per year in 2009 and 2010. Conclusions W e report the first incidence estimate for Lyme carditis in the Netherlands, validated by a systematic review of the medical records. Although Lyme carditis is an uncommon manifestation of Lyme borreliosis, physicians need to be aware of this diagnosis, in particular in countries where the incidence of Lyme borreliosis has increased during the past decades.715General practitioner reported incidence of Lyme carditis in the Netherlands Introduction Lyme borreliosis is an infectious disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species, and transmitted through tick bites. In Europe, the main vector of Lyme borreliosis is Ixodes ricinus, and at least five Borrelia lato can cause Lyme borreliosis: B. afzelii and B. garinii, and to a lesser degree also B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. bavariensis and B. spielmanii. Erythema migrans is the most common early manifestation of Lyme borreliosis, while disseminated infection can develop two to three months after initial infection, manifesting in the nervous system, joints, skin and sometimes the heart [1]. Symptomatic cardiac involvement associated with Lyme borreliosis usually occurs simultaneously with or shortly after other disease manifestations of Lyme borreliosis. Lyme carditis typically manifests as conduction abnormalities with varying degrees of atrioventricular conduction defects (A V block), although other cardiac manifestations such as endomyocarditis and pericarditis have also been reported [1, 2]. Although usually self-limiting, these cardiac conduction abnormalities can occasionally be life-threatening, as illustrated by a recent publication on three sudden death cardiac events associated with Lyme carditis in the United States [3]. The diagnosis of Lyme carditis is usually based on acute onset of relevant symptomatic cardiac disorders, with electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities and positive serology for Borrelia antibodies, and can be supported by a history of Lyme borreliosis or tick bite. Alternative explanations for the cardiac condition need to be excluded [1, 2]. Nationwide cross-sectional retrospective surveys among all general practitioners (GPs) in the Netherlands have shown a persistent increase in the incidence of GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans between 1994 and 2009, with up to 93,000 cases with tick bites and 22,000 cases with erythema migrans seen by all GPs in the Netherlands in 2009 [4]. Neighbouring countries have also reported an increasing incidence of Lyme borreliosis[5]. To estimate the incidence of Lyme carditis in the Netherlands in 2009 and 2010, we surveyed all GPs in the Netherlands, as part of a broader survey on physician-reported incidence of all Lyme borreliosis manifestations [6]. T o verify and adjust the crude (GP reported) incidence rate of Lyme carditis from this nationwide cross-sectional retrospective incidence survey , we reviewed the medical records of Lyme carditis cases reported by GPs.72Section I: The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands Methods T o rapidly assess a nationwide representative incidence rate for Lyme carditis, we performed a two-step approach. Firstly , a broad inquiry was required to detect a very uncommon disease manifestation such as Lyme carditis. W e sent a two-page retrospective questionnaire about Lyme borreliosis diagnoses during the two-year period of 2009-2010, also including diagnoses of Lyme carditis, to all (n = 9178) GPs in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, Lyme carditis is usually diagnosed and treated by medical specialists in the hospital, and not by GPs. However, in general, patients are required to consult a GP to be referred to a hospital, except in urgent situations, and medical specialists report back to the GP . As every person in the Netherlands is registered with only one GP , the practice populations of reporting GPs were used to calculate crude annual incidence rates and national estimates of annual total numbers among the 16.6 million population of the Netherlands in 2010. The accompanying clinical case definition with regard to Lyme carditis was: 'Acute onset of atrioventricular (I-III) conduction defects, rhythm sometimes myocarditis or pancarditis. Alternative explanations must be excluded', as proposed by Stanek et al. [1]. T o achieve a high GP-response rate, we inquired about clinical diagnoses of Lyme carditis in the first step of our two-step approach, not asking the GP to look into laboratory diagnostics that had been ordered and interpreted by medical specialists in the hospital. Instead, the laboratory diagnostics were verified in the second part of our two-step approach: systematic review of medical records of the GP-reported Lyme carditis patients, to verify this crude incidence rate of Lyme carditis, obtained from our larger incidence survey on all manifestations of Lyme borreliosis [6]. W e asked cooperation of all GPs who reported Lyme carditis diagnoses in the questionnaire. All relevant data for the systematic medical record review were collected by one medical master student (co-author CD), using a case record form (CRF). Assessed variables included: medical history, clinical symptoms (such as palpitations, dizziness, dyspnoea, oedema, orthopnoea, syncope, chest pain, fatigue), cardiac abnormalities visible on ECG, use of cardio-active medications, blood chemistry, Borrelia-specific tests such as ELISA, immunoblots, PCR and culture results, treatment and clinical course. Considering the complexities in the diagnosis of Lyme carditis, the collected medical records were categorised according to the likelihood of diagnosis, into 'very likely', 'likely', 'possible', and 'not Lyme carditis' (Table 1). In the absence of validated and standardised criteria, we designed our own criteria for this purpose, based on cardiac symptoms, ECG abnormalities consistent with Lyme carditis (any degree of atrioventricular block, or any other type of conduction 735General practitioner reported incidence of Lyme carditis in the Netherlands Very likely Acute onset of cardiAac symptomsa + ECG abnormality consistent with Lyme carditisb + positive serologyc for Borrelia Or: Acute onset of cardiac symptomsa + no ECG abnormality consistent with Lyme carditisb/no ECG performed + positive serologyc Borrelia + bite/anamnestic erythema migrans/diagnosed Lyme arthritis/ diagnosed Lyme neuroborreliosis + clinical recovery after antibiotic treatment Likely Acute onset of cardiac symptomsa + positive serologyc for Borrelia + clinical recovery after antibiotic treatment Or: ECG abnormality consistent with Lyme carditisb + positive serologyc for Borrelia Or: Acute onset of cardiac symptomsa + ECG abnormality consistent with Lyme carditisb + migrans/diagnosed Lyme arthritis/ diagnosed Lyme neuroborreliosis + clinical recovery after antibiotic treatment/ recovery ECG Possible Acute onset of cardiac symptomsa + positive serologyc for Borrelia + cardiac symptomsa + positive serologyc for Borrelia Or: Acute onset of cardiac symptomsa + Lyme carditis Negative serologyc for BorreliaTable 1.

Based on the information available in the medical records, other possible causes for the cardiac symptoms were excluded, among which syphilis, Other plausible causes for the cardiac symptoms were excluded, among which syphilis, thyroid disorders, familial arrhythmias, arrhythmogenic drugs, and ischaemia. Within each classification, criteria are ordered by their importance for the diagnosis of Lyme carditis. a Cardiac symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, dyspnoea, oedema, orthopnoea, syncope, chest pain, fatigue. b Electrocardiogram (ECG) showing cardiac disorders consistent with Lyme carditis, such as any degree of atrioventricular block, or any other type of conduction disturbance. c ELISA and/or IgG immunoblot and/or IgM immunoblot for Borrelia antibodies.74Section I: The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands thyroid disorders, familial arrhythmias, arrhythmogenic drugs, and ischaemia. W e adjusted the crude incidence rate from this incidence survey according to the proportion of GP-reported Lyme carditis that we categorised as very likely or likely diagnosis. Additionally, to correct for 'telescoping bias' [7], the incidence rate was adjusted by the proportion of GP-reported Lyme carditis cases with a clinical presentation within the targeted period of 2009 and 2010. Results The response rate to the question on Lyme carditis (Table 2) in the questionnaire on all Lyme borreliosis manifestations was 33 % (3067/9178) among GPs, whose practice population includes about 7.7 million persons. This represents 46 % of the 16.6 million inhabitants of the Netherlands. Thirty-nine cases of Lyme carditis were reported by 38 GPs. These 39 GP reports of Lyme carditis per 7.7 million practice population during two years account for 0.2 % of 15,624 GP reports on all Lyme-related diagnoses (not validated) in our incidence survey on all manifestations of Lyme borreliosis [6]. Twenty-one GPs who together reported 22 cases answered our request for cooperation in the medical record review of the reported cases. Finally , eight medical records out of 39 GP reports could be reviewed (Table 2). We discovered three invalid reports, as two reports were withdrawn after the reporting GPs declared to have marked a Lyme carditis case on the questionnaire erroneously, and one case turned out to have been reported twice by two GPs working in partnership. Table 2 shows the data collection and classification of the eight reviewed Lyme carditis cases, according to likelihood of diagnosis. Table 3 provides an overview of the collected information from the reviewed medical records. Six out of eight reviewed medical records satisfied the criteria for a very likely diagnosis of Lyme carditis, one medical record was categorised as likely, and one was categorised as not Lyme carditis. With the information gained in this medical record review we calculated an adjusted incidence rate for very likely plus likely Lyme carditis, including the three invalid reports into the denominator of reviewed GP reports, resulting in 55 % (6/11) very likely diagnoses, and 9 % (1/11) likely diagnoses. Among the reviewed medical records, three out of eight cases (38 %) had a clinical presentation within the targeted period of 2009 and 2010. The adjusted annual incidence rate for very likely plus likely Lyme carditis diagnoses was 6 (95 % CI: 4-8) per 10 million inhabitants of the Netherlands in 2009 and 2010. This yields an estimated total number of ten very likely plus likely cases diagnosed nationwide per year in 2009 and 2010, of which nine very likely diagnoses.755General practitioner reported incidence of Lyme carditis in the Netherlands Discussion W e report the first incidence estimate of Lyme carditis in the Netherlands. Considering that not all patients with Lyme borreliosis are diagnosed correctly, we may have underestimated or overestimated its true occurrence. Misdiagnosis, misclassification and telescoping bias were reduced through the systematic medical record review, showing that 64 % of the GP reports for Lyme carditis met our criteria for very likely or likely diagnosis, and 38 % had a clinical presentation within the targeted period of 2009 and 2010.

Publications on underreporting of Lyme borreliosis suggest that the true incidence rate may be two to eight times higher than measured [8]. Diagnosing Lyme carditis can be very challenging, so our category of 'very likely diagnosis' still contains uncertainty. In the early stage of Lyme borreliosis serological assays for antibodies are infrequently positive, and antibody development can be inhibited or delayed by early antibiotic treatment for erythema migrans. Therefore, convalescent serological testing, some weeks after the acute phase, is sometimes required [1, 2]. In our criteria for classification (Table 1), we considered any positive serological finding relevant to assess in the context of clinical presentation, treatment and clinical course. Although conduction abnormalities, as well as Borrelia-specific IgG antibodies, are common among the general population, a coincidence of both is more likely to represent Lyme-related conduction abnormalities. In addition, other explanations for the cardiac condition need to be excluded [1, 2]. W e consider the reported numbers of diagnoses and the medical records obtained from GPs representative of all cases diagnosed with Lyme carditis in the Netherlands, as we addressed the incidence questionnaire to all GPs nationwide, attaining a substantial response rate with a high coverage of our countries' population. In our larger incidence survey on all manifestations of Lyme borreliosis in 2010 [6], we observed a response rate and incidence estimations of GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans that were similar to the preceding incidence surveys on 1994-2009 [4]. It is possible that willingness to cooperate in the medical record review might be higher among GPs who are more confident of the diagnosis. W e are unable to quantify this potential response bias to the medical record review, which could influence our outcomes toward a higher proportion of likely diagnoses, and thus overestimation of the corrected incidence rate of Lyme carditis. In line with our observation of 0.2 % diagnoses of Lyme carditis relative to all GP-reported clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis, other European physician-based studies report Lyme carditis in 0.3-0.7 % of cases with untreated Lyme borreliosis [9-11], and European epidemiological serology studies suggest that 0.3-4 % of patients with untreated Lyme borreliosis develop carditis[12-16]. So, Lyme carditis is diagnosed rarely relative to all manifestations of Lyme borreliosis. However, several European countries, including the Netherlands, have reported marked increases in the incidence of Lyme borreliosis [4, 5]. Failure to properly diagnose Lyme carditis may have serious consequences, with the possibility of sudden death or unnecessary implantation of a permanent pacemaker [3, 17]. According to the current study , approximately ten patients were 78Section I: The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands diagnosed with Lyme carditis annually in the Netherlands in 2009 and 2010. This finding emphasises that physicians should include Lyme carditis into the differential diagnosis, in particular among younger individuals with cardiac symptoms in the presence of conduction abnormalities without other apparent risk factors, especially if combined with a history of recent exposure to ticks [1-3, 17]. Conclusion This study demonstrates that a nationwide representative incidence rate for Lyme carditis can be obtained rapidly by means of a two-step approach of a cross-sectional retrospective questionnaire among all GPs, followed by systematic review of medical records to adjust for misclassification and telescoping bias. W e report the first incidence estimate for Lyme carditis in the Netherlands of six Lyme carditis cases per 10 million inhabitants annually, in 2009 and 2010. Although Lyme carditis remains a rare manifestation of Lyme borreliosis, physicians need to be aware of this diagnosis, in particular in countries where the incidence of Lyme borreliosis has increased during the past decades, as is the case in the Netherlands.

Havelaar Anna Lugn\u00e9r Anita W .M. Suijkerbuijk Wilfrid van Pelt84Section II: The public health impact of Lyme borreliosis Abstract Background Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most commonly reported tick-borne infection in Europe and North America. In the last 15 years a 3-fold increase was observed in general practitioner consultations for LB in the Netherlands. To support prioritization of prevention and control efforts for LB, we estimated its burden expressed in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). Methods We used available incidence estimates for three LB outcomes: (i) erythema migrans (EM), (ii) disseminated LB and (iii) Lyme-related persisting symptoms. To generate DALYs, disability weights and duration per outcome were derived using a patient questionnaire including health-related quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D. Results We estimated the total LB burden for the Netherlands in 2010 at 10.55 DALYs per 100 000 population (95% CI: 8.80-12.43); LB and 9.09 DALYs for Lyme-related persisting symptoms. Per patient this was 0.005 DALYs for EM, 0.113 for disseminated LB and 1.661 DALYs for a patient with Lyme-related persisting symptoms. In a sensitivity analysis the total LB burden ranged from 7.58 to 16.93 DALYs per 100 000 population. Conclusions LB causes a substantial disease burden in the Netherlands. The vast majority of this burden is caused by patients with Lyme-related persisting symptoms. EM and disseminated Lyme have a more modest impact. Further research should focus on the mechanisms that trigger development of these persisting symptoms that patients and their physicians attribute to LB.856The burden of Lyme borreliosis expressed in disability-adjusted life years Introduction Lyme borreliosis (LB) is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato which in Europe is predominantly transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus. LB is the most commonly reported tick-borne infection in Europe and North America.[1,2] The severity of symptoms in some LB patients, and the in recent years reported increase of LB in some countries or areas in Europe and North-America has raised questions about its public-health impact. [1-4] In the last 15 years in the Netherlands a 3-fold increase was observed in general practitioner (GP) consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans (EM) - the most frequent early LB manifestation. [5,6] Early uncomplicated infection generally responds well to antibiotic treatment, and thus the majority of LB patients have a good prognosis. [7,8] However, even after repeated antibiotic therapy, some patients report persisting symptoms like musculoskeletal pain, neurocognitive symptoms and fatigue. [1,2,8,9] Especially these persisting and sometimes disabling symptoms have great impact on the quality of life of the patients concerned. Until now, worldwide no q uantitative estimation of the disease burden of LB has been available that can be used to prioritize prevention and control efforts. Such an estimate would show which LB outcomes contribute most to the LB burden, and would make it possible to compare its burden to the public-health impact of other diseases. This study aimed to estimate the burden of LB expressed in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), a summary measure of disease burden that aggregates the impact of mortality and morbidity in one figure. [10] Within the scope of this study we assessed the burden for the Netherlands in 2010; we also present the burden per case to facilitate estimates for other endemic countries based upon their national incidence figures. Methods Outcomes of LB and annual incidence per outcome Figure 1 shows the possible health outcomes of LB, after a tick bite causing a Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato infection. We distinguished three outcome categories similar as in Hofhuis et al. [11]: (i) EM - the most common clinical manifestation - an expanding skin lesion at the site of the tick bite; (ii) (early and late) disseminated LB - the more serious manifestations - which can present as a multi-system disease with skin, neurological, cardiac and musculoskeletal manifestations, especially if early infection remains untreated [1]; and (iii) persisting symptoms that patients and their physicians attribute to LB after a successfully treated infection or due to persistent infection, [1,2,9,12-14] hereafter referred to as 'persisting symptoms'.86Section II: The public health impact of Lyme borreliosis Scenarios Criteria for included patients and parameters Scenario 1: Include patients enrolled upon their own request-Same as baseline AND include patients enrolled upon their own request - i.e. mainly through the national patient association Scenario 2: Include less likely LB diagnoses in incidence estimates-Same as baseline AND Use higher LB incidence estimates that also include less likely LB diagnoses [11] Scenario 3: Exclude 5% patients with highest disease severity and duration-Same as baseline BUT exclude per LB outcome patients with the 5% highest extreme values for disability weights and disease duration Scenario 4: No co-morbidity -Same as baseline BUT exclude patients with any co-morbidity. Scenario 5: Five annual deaths due to LB-Same as baseline AND inclusion of 5 deaths attributable to LB per year, with mean age 39 years and a residual life expectancy of 47.62 years (as derived from the GBD 2010 standard life table [22]) Scenario 6: Adjust for censored disease duration in the persisting symptoms patients-Same as baseline AND raise the disease duration for persisting symptoms patients with 25%. Scenario 7: Combine scenario 2,3,4, 5 & 6-Same as baseline AND scenario 2,3,4, 5 & 6Table 1. Sensitivity analysis scenarios to calculate DALYs for LB base d upon disease duration and severity assessed in a patient questionnaire, and incidence estimates available from Hofhuis et al. [11]wFigure 1. Outcome tree with possible health outcomes of Lyme borreliosis. After a tick bite followed by infection, we distinguished three symptomatic outcome categories: (1) EM - the most common clinical manifestation - an expanding skin lesion occurring after several days or weeks at the site of the tick bite; (2) (early and late) disseminated LB - the more serious manifestations - which can present as a multi-system disease with skin, neurological, cardiac and musculoskeletal manifestations, especially if early infection remains untreated; and (3) persisting symptoms attributed to LB - after a successfully treated infection or due to persistent infection.Infection after a tick biteErythema migrans (EM) Disseminated attributed to Lyme borreliosi s (including Lyme encephalopathy and persisting symptoms after treatment for Lyme borreliosis )Recover yAsymptomatic infectio nRecover y876The burden of Lyme borreliosis expressed in disability-adjusted life years We used a recent estimate of the LB incidence for our estimation of disease burden. In Hofhuis et al.[11], the 2010 incidence per LB outcome has been estimated for the Netherlands based on a survey among GPs: per 100 000 population 131.5 (95% CI: 127.1-136.0) diagnoses of EM, 7.7 (7.2-8.2) diagnoses of disseminated LB and 5.5 (5.1-5.8) new diagnoses with persisting symptoms which the GP attributed to LB; these estimates include only (very) likely diagnoses and have been adjusted for reporting bias. [11] Patient questionnaire To gather data on duration of disease and severity per outcome, we developed a LB patient questionnaire. We distributed 5171 patient questionnaires by mail, of which 4702 were sent to physicians with the request to forward them to their LB patients. The Medical Ethics Review Committee of the University Medical Centre Utrecht declared that the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act does not apply to this study (protocol number 14-283/C, letter number WAG/om/14/015644). Patients were eligible for the study if they suffered symptoms of LB in the 12 months preceding the questionnaire. The physicians that enrolled patients were mainly GPs, medical specialists and/or occupational physicians who responded to the incidence questionnaire by Hofhuis et al. (see Appendix A, figure A1). The remaining 469 questionnaires were sent directly to patients upon their request, mainly through the national Lyme patient association. No reminders were sent. The questionnaire included questions on demographic characteristics, diagnosed clinical manifestations of LB (based upon the case definitions used in Hofhuis et al. [11], see also figure 1), and severity and duration of disease. We also asked for co-morbidity, as adjusted from the TIC-P questionnaire. [15] LB outcomes and severity of disease We firstly assigned patients to 10 manifestations of LB based upon the manifestations diagnosed, as reported in the questionnaire. We subsequently assigned patients to the three outcome categories as described in figure 1 following the criteria described in Appendix A. Following the DALY concept, we then expressed severity of disease in disability weights between 0 (representing 'full health') and 1 ('death'). In the absence of standardized disability weights for LB and because of the wide range of symptoms, we derived disability weights per LB outcome using the health states as measured by the EQ-5D in our patient questionnaire. [16,17] See Appendix B for further details.88Section II: The public health impact of Lyme borreliosis Duration of disease The questionnaire facilitated reporting of duration of disease both by date of onset (i.e. date of tick bite plus incubation period) and by pre-coded calculation of disease duration, a value was assigned to these pre-coded categories, based on the best fit of an assumed underlying negative binomial distribution. Since we used a cross-sectional survey, episodes of disease were right-censored for all patients that were currently ill when filling in the questionnaire. Estimates for the mean disease duration were obtained by survival analysis (see Appendix B). Baseline DALY estimate and sensitivity analysis We calculated the disease burden expressed in DALYs (see Appendix B). For the baseline DALY estimate we excluded the patients that were enrolled on their own request when estimating disease duration and disability weights. These patients were recruited mainly through the national patient association and therefore possibly more severely ill than the average patient. To explore the consequences of using different estimates for the incidence, severity and duration of disease, or for possible mortality due to LB, we also calculated the DALYs for seven alternative scenarios (table 1, see also Appendix B). Results LB classi cation of patients A total of 949 patients responded, of whom 660 patients were included in the analysis; they were assigned to the outcomes EM (n = 88; of which 87 (99%) enrolled through their physicians), disseminated Lyme (n = 96; 88 (92%) enrolled through physicians) or persisting symptoms (n = 476; of which 189 (40%) enrolled through physicians). See Appendix A and figure A1 for further details. Severity, duration of disease and DALY s No meaningful survival curve could be obtained for the Lyme-related persisting symptoms outcome because the parameter estimates of the survival distribution had very wide confidence intervals, as many participants in this group were still ill when they filled in the questionnaire (i.e. most individuals had a censored duration). Therefore, we used the censored estimate for the mean duration for this particular outcome - i.e. 4.6 years, similar to the 3-6 years reported in earlier studies.

Continued.916The burden of Lyme borreliosis expressed in disability-adjusted life years Table 2 shows the disability weights, duration of disease and DALYs per LB outcome in the Netherlands in 2010 for the baseline estimate. The total burden due to LB was estimated at 10.55 DALYs per 100 000 population (95% CI: 8.80-12.43) and thus for the entire 16.6 million population at 1749 DALYs (95% CI: 1458-2060). For EM, we estimated the lowest disease burden per patient - i.e. a disability weight of 0.047, disease duration weeks, and thus 0.005 DALYs per patient - reflecting its relatively mild condition. Because of the relatively high EM incidence, the total disease burden due to EM was nevertheless 0.60 DALYs per 100 000 population (and 99 DALYs for the total population). For disseminated LB the disease burden of 0.113 DALYs per patient was 23 times higher, reflecting its more severe condition, with a disability weight of 0.262 and disease duration of 22.5 weeks. Yet, because of the lower incidence compared with EM, the total disease burden due to disseminated LB was only 1.4 times higher: 0.86 DALYs per 100 000 population (143 for the total population). The outcome persisting symptoms had the highest disease burden per patient: an average disability weight of 0.364, disease duration 4.568 years, and thus 1.661 DALYs per patient. Although the incidence of persisting symptoms is lower than the incidence of disseminated LB, this high disease burden per patient leads to the highest disease burden per outcome: 9.09 DALYs per 100 000 population (1506 for the total population). This accounts for 86% of the total DALYs due to LB. Sensitivity analysis Table 2 and figure 2 show the disease burden per LB outcome for the baseline and the seven scenarios in the sensitivity analysis. The total burden due to LB ranges from 7.58 DALYs (scenario 3) to 16.93 DALYs (scenario 1) per 100 000 population. The high estimate in scenario 1, which included patients enrolled upon their own request, is mainly due to a significantly higher disease duration of these patients compared with the patients enrolled through physicians (ANOVA; P < 0.0001). In scenario 4, differences in disability weights and disease duration were not significant between patients with and without co-morbidity (ANOVA: P = 0.08 and P = 0.87). In all scenarios, the outcome persisting symptoms is the biggest contributor to the total disease burden - ranging from 76-91% of total DALYs by LB. All scenarios showed the per patient disease burden to be highest for persisting symptoms and lowest for EM.92Section II: The public health impact of Lyme borreliosis Discussion We assessed the disease burden expressed in DALYs of Lyme borreliosis, the most commonly reported tick-borne infection in Europe and North America. Using available incidence estimates from Hofhuis et al. [11] and a patient questionnaire to assess severity and duration of disease, we estimated the burden due to LB in the Netherlands. The total disease burden for 2010 was 10.55 DALYs per 100 000 population (95% CI: 8.80-12.43) the entire population 1749 DALYs (95% CI: 1458-2060). The vast majority of this burden due to LB was caused by patients with persisting symptoms attributed to LB (9.09 out of 10.55 DALYs per 100 000 pop.; i.e. 86%), whereas EM and disseminated LB have a more modest impact of 1.46 DALYs (0.60 and 0.86 DALYs per 100 000 pop.). Per individual LB case, the DALY estimate was also highest for persisting symptoms attributed to LB (1.661 DALYs per patient), moderately high for disseminated modest for EM (0.005).0 829 1657 2486 3315DALYs per L yme disease outcome total f or 16.6 million po p. 7.Combine scenar io 2,3,4, 5 & 66.Adjust f or censored disease duration in the persisting symptoms patients5.Five annual deaths due to LB4.No comorbidity3.Exclude 5% patients with highest disease severity and duration2.Include less lik ely LB diagnoses in incidence estimates1.Includes patients enrolled on their o wn requestBaseline estimate 05 10 15 20Scenar ios DALYs per L yme disease outcome per 100.000 po p.Outcome EM Disseminated L yme Persisting symptoms Death Figure 2. Sensitivity analysis: DALYs per LB outcome for baseline and seven scenarios. We performed a sensitivity analysis with seven alternative scenarios, exploring the consequences of using different estimates for the incidence, severity and duration of disease, or for possible mortality due to LB (table 1). On the y-axis, the baseline estimate and the seven alternative scenarios are indicated. The upper x-axis presents the DALYs per outcome for the entire population of the Netherlands (16.6 million), the lower x-axis DALYs per 100 000 population.936The burden of Lyme borreliosis expressed in disability-adjusted life years We thus found a substantial disease burden due to LB, which calls for continued prevention and control efforts. However, its major impact is caused by patients with persistent Lyme-related symptoms, whereas both in Europe and North-America it remains debated to what extent persisting symptoms attributed to LB are actually due to a present or preceding infection. [1,2,12,19-21] Our patient questionnaire and the incidence survey applied by Hofhuis et al.[11] cannot discriminate whether LB actually caused the reported Lyme-related persisting symptoms. Nevertheless, our results reflect the very substantial disease burden due to persisting symptoms that patients and their physicians attribute to LB. This calls for further research to the causal mechanisms of developing these symptoms - whether or not due to past or present Borrelia infection - to be able to develop better prevention and treatment strategies for patients at risk for persistence of symptoms. This is to our knowledge worldwide the first DALY estimate for LB; it adds to other studies estimating the burden of infectious diseases, and facilitates LB burden estimates for endemic countries in Europe and North-America based upon our DALY estimates per case and their national incidence figures. Compared with many non-communicable diseases, the LB burden is limited-like for most infectious diseases especially in western countries. [22-24] Nevertheless the burden of LB, as for many infectious diseases, can be decreased by public-health measures focusing on prevention of pathogen transmission and timely treatment of infection, and would likely increase without such measures. This calls for continuous priority setting in public-health. The current study shows that in the Netherlands LB has the 12th highest disease burden, compared with the comprehensive DALY estimates for 32 other infectious diseases largely based upon the 'Burden of Communicable Disease in Europe' (BCoDE) project [25,26,27]; LB is preceded by hepatitis C and Q-fever, and followed by norovirus and Salmonella spp. with a somewhat lower burden. If we restrict our estimate to the disease burden attributed to EM and disseminated Lyme (together 1.46 DALYs per 100 000 pop.), LB has still the 20th highest burden, preceded by hepatitis B and H. infl uenza, and followed by Shigella spp. and Listeria spp. In addition, DALYs per case can also be used to compare disease burden at the individual level. Per case, the burden of Lyme-related persisting symptoms is the 11th highest compared with the 32 above mentioned pathogens, preceded by tuberculosis and Listeria spp., and followed by hepatitis B and tetanus. Disseminated LB and EM have the 19th and 31st highest disease burden respectively.94Section II: The public health impact of Lyme borreliosis Finally, disability weights per disease can be used to compare the severity of diseases. Our disability weights based upon the patient questionnaire are within the range of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2010 disability weights for acute episodes and postacute consequences of infectious diseases. [28] For EM and disseminated LB the disability weights are very similar to the GBD disability weights for respectively moderate and severe episodes of acute infectious diseases. Lyme-related persisting symptoms and the GBD disability weight for post-acute consequences of infectious disease have overlapping confidence intervals (the GBD point estimate is 30% lower). Compared with non-infectious chronic diseases, our disability weight for Lyme-related persisting symptoms is somewhat higher than Crohn's disease and moderate Parkinson's disease, and somewhat lower than moderate multiple sclerosis and a moderate episode of a major depression. [28] In our sensitivity analysis, the high impact due to Lyme-related persisting symptoms was consistent in all scenarios. Patients who enrolled in the study on their own request (scenario 1) clearly had a higher disease burden than patients enrolled through their physician. Since these patients predominantly enrolled through the national patient association, it seems plausible that more severely ill patients have been more likely to join this association, and thus these patients were probably not representative for the impact of LB in the general population. This further supports our decision to exclude these patients from the baseline and other scenarios. When using the incidence estimates that include less likely LB diagnoses (scenario 2), the disease burden increased with 23%, illustrating that under-ascertainment may have led to substantial underestimation of the disease burden. Among the patients enrolled through their physician, the 5% most severely ill had a relatively high impact (28%) on the disease burden (scenario 3). Although this may be representative for LB in the general population, it also illustrates to what extent our estimates could be influenced by selection bias; i.e. if more severely ill cases have been more likely to be enrolled for the study through their physicians. The influence of co-morbidity on our total disease burden estimate was at most modest (8%), and the observed difference may be due to other co-variables (scenario 4). Sporadic mortality due to LB would moderately increase the disease burden (14% with five annual deaths, scenario 5). We were not able to adjust for censoring in the patient group with persisting symptoms, but our censored estimate for the disease duration was similar to earlier reported durations of Lyme-related persisting symptoms. [9,18] Nevertheless using the censored estimate may have substantially influenced our estimates, as raising our censored 956The burden of Lyme borreliosis expressed in disability-adjusted life years estimates with 25% proportionately increases the total disease burden with 22% (scenario 6). On the other hand, we also showed that if we combined this and all other scenarios based on physician enrolled patients, the disease burden converges towards the baseline (scenario 7): 15% above the baseline. For reasons described in [25,26], in the BCoDE project a pathogen-based incidence approach was developed to derive DALYs for infectious diseases, rather than a prevalence based approach. We similarly derived DALYs using a pathogen-based incidence approach including long-term disease outcomes. However, instead of extrapolating the impact of long-term disease outcomes from the incidence of initial infections, we used the available incidence estimates for long-term disease outcomes in 2010. [11] Although incident cases of long-term disease outcomes in 2010 originate from initial infections in 2009, this was no problem since the incidence of initial infections was the same for 2009 and 2010 (both~22000 EM cases for 16.5 million pop.); the 2010 incidence for long-term outcomes is thus expected to be proportionate to the incidence of initial infections in 2010. Age, sex and other covariates were not taken into account; studies with higher number of patients would facilitate further analysis of the influence and possible bias of such covariates. Furthermore, since unused questionnaires distributed through physicians were mostly not returned, we do not have insight into the non- response to validate to what extent our study population was representative. As an alternative validation, we compared the age and sex distributions of our study population and people acquiring tick bites. [29] The two age distributions both show peaks around 10-14 years of age and around 50 years of age, although elderly people seem to be overrepresented in our study population; as a result the mean age of our study population was 52 years of age, whereas the mean age of people acquiring tick bites was 39 years. The sex distribution of our patients enrolled through physicians was similar to people acquiring tick bites - 50% vs. 58% male respectively. Conclusion Lyme borreliosis has a substantial disease burden of 10.55 DALYs per 100 000 population (95% CI: 8.80-12.43) based on the incidence of LB in 2010 in the Netherlands (16.6 million pop.). This is the first estimate in DALYs of the public-health impact of LB, which will facilitate LB burden estimates for other countries. The disease burden is predominantly due to patients with persisting symptoms attributed to LB (9.09 DALYs per 100 000 pop.), and to a lesser extent due to patients with EM (0.60 DALYs) and disseminated LB (0.86 DALYs). 96Section II: The public health impact of Lyme borreliosis Further research should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of prevention and control measures to reduce the disease burden, and especially on the mechanisms of developing persisting symptoms that patients and their physicians attribute to LB.

Patients were excluded if they did not report a LB diagnosis, did not report symptoms due to LB in the preceding 12 months, or otherwise reported insufficient or inconsistent data for analysis. One patient was excluded because he reported an Epstein Barr virus infection in the 12 preceding months. Patients were only assigned to the outcome EM if they did not report manifestations of disseminated Lyme and/or persisting symptoms; and likewise they were only assigned to disseminated LB if they did not report persisting symptoms. Out of the 660 patients included in the analysis, we directly classified 561 patients into an LB outcome category based on their reported manifestation (see outcome tree in Figure 1). For the remaining 99 patients no specific manifestation was reported or the reported manifestation was inconsistent with the reported disease duration; these patients were classified as specified below:1) We transferred initial EM (n=17) or disseminated LB (n=47) patients towards the outcome persisting symptoms, if they reported symptoms for more than one year after diagnosis and/or persisting symptoms after treatment. 2) We transferred initial persisting symptoms (n=13) patients towards the outcome disseminated Lyme, if they reported symptoms for less than one year and reported to be currently or recently diagnosed and/or treated or reported to be recovered after treatment. 3) If patients did report diagnosed LB, but without a specific manifestation (n=22), we assigned these patients to: a) EM if duration of symptoms was <= 1 month (n=1); b) disseminated Lyme if duration of symptoms was 1-12 months (n=6); and c) persisting symptoms if duration of symptoms was >12 months (n=15).100Section II: The public health impact of Lyme borreliosis A total of 5171 patient questionnaires distribute d 4702 questionnaires distributed through GPs (n=3097), medical specialists (n=1208), occupational physicians (n=348), and other physicians (n=49) .469 questionnaires distributed at patients' own request (451 through the Dutch patient association for Lyme disease and 18 directly to patients) 593 patients responded through GPs (n=418), medical specialists (n=123) and occupational physicians (n=37), and other physicians (n=15)356 patients responded (344 through the Dutch patient association for Lyme disease and 12 directly from patients) A total of 949 enrolled patients 660 patients included in data analysis* 41% male Mean age 52 yrs, range 3-89289 patients excluded for: -no reported diagnosis of Lyme disease (n=78) -no symptoms due to Lyme disease in the preceding 12 months (n=74) -insufcient or inconsistent data (n=136 ) -a reported Epstein Barr virus infection in the 12 preceding months (n=1). 88 EM ; 87 enrolled through physicians; 1 upon his/her own request Male 44 % Mean age 50 yrs, range 3-8596 disseminated Lyme ; 88 enrolled through physicians; 8 upon their own reques t Male 51% Mean age 50 yrs, range 3-87476 persisting symptoms ; 189 enrolled through physicians; 287 upon their own request Male 51 % Mean age 48 yrs, range 6-89 ; Male 30 % Mean age 55 yrs, range 12-88;Disease outcomes * For all 660 included patients an (un)censored duration of illness had been recorded; 51 had missing values for disability weights (12 for EM, 6 for disseminated Lyme and 33 for persisting symptoms).Figure A1.Flow chart of distributed questionnaires and patients included in the study. 1016The burden of Lyme borreliosis expressed in disability-adjusted life years Appendix B: DALY s, severity and duration of LB, and a sensitivity analysis DALYs We calculated the disease burden expressed in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) [1] following these formulas: DALY = YLL + YLDYLL = d * eYLD = n l * tl* dwl Where YLL = number of Years of Life Lost YLD = number of Years Lived with Disability d = number of fatal cases e = life expectancy at age of death n l = number of cases with health outcome (l) tl = duration of health outcome (l) dwl = disability weight (i.e. severity) of health outcome (l) In this study, YLL were only included in the sensitivity analysis, as there is no evidence for mortality due to LB as a primary cause of death. [2] The total DALYs in the baseline estimate are therefore the sum of YLD for all possible health outcomes of LB. Severity of disease: disability weights derived from EQ-5D health states Our disability weights were based upon the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured by the EQ-5D in our patient questionnaire. [3, 4] With the EQ-5D classification system, subjects describe their health state in three levels of severity (no problems, some problems, severe problems) in the dimensions mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Subsequently, the reported health states were converted into health state values between 0 and 1, using a pre-existing set of values based on preference data from the general population of the Netherlands, where a value of 1 represents full health and 0 represents death. [5] Within the DALY approach, severity is expressed as a disability weight, which is also a number between 0 and 1, but now 0 represents full health and 1 represents death. Following [6], individual disability weights for a patient can be derived as 1 (i.e. the EQ-5D full health state) minus the individual EQ-5D 102Section II: The public health impact of Lyme borreliosis health state value. We similarly derived disability weights, using an age and sex adjusted EQ-5D full health state index for the population of the Netherlands.[7] We asked patients to complete two EQ-5D questionnaires, one for their current health status, and one for their entire episode of LB (up to 12 months back in time). For patients that reported current LB illness when filling in the questionnaire we used the mean of their two EQ-5D health states to derive their individual disability weight. For the patients not reporting current LB illness at the time of filling in the questionnaire we only used the EQ-5D health state for their entire episode of LB to derive their individual disability weight. We then estimated disability weights for the three Lyme outcome categories as the mean of all individual disability weights per outcome. This inclusion of reported health states up to 12 months back in time could be influenced by recall bias, [8] but since the disease severity is likely worse earlier in a disease episode, only using the health states of today would underestimate the disease burden (the mean disability weight today was 38% lower than the mean disability weight back in time). Another reason for inclusion of the EQ-5D health states back in time is that some patients (29% of patients enrolled through physicians, 2% of patients enrolled upon their own request) had already recovered when filling in the questionnaire, and thus the only available health state about their LB episode was back in time. Duration of disease: survival analysis For episodes of disease that were right-censored in our patient questionnaire, we used survival analysis to obtain the mean duration of disease per LB outcome. We used a parametric survival model to obtain a smooth survival curve and to allow for extrapolation of duration into a prolonged time horizon. Jackson et al. [9] consider a variety of parametric distributions for survival analysis: the Generalized Gamma, Generalized F , Weibull, Gamma, Exponential, Log-Normal and Gompertz distribution. We fitted each of these, and selected the Log-Normal distribution based on the Akaike Information Criterion (see e.g. [10]). Sensitivity analysisTo explore the consequences of using different estimates for the incidence, severity and duration of disease, or for possible mortality due to LB, we also calculated the DALYs for seven alternative scenarios (see also Table 1). In scenario 1, we evaluated the impact of including patients enrolled upon their own request. In scenario 2, we used alternative incidence estimates per LB outcome from Hofhuis et al. [11] this time including all reported LB cases - i.e. also less likely LB diagnoses, because these cases may also contribute to the 1036The burden of Lyme borreliosis expressed in disability-adjusted life years LB burden. In addition, more severely ill patients may have been more likely to enroll through their physician than those with only limited disease. To evaluate the possible impact of such selection bias, in scenario 3 per outcome we excluded the 5% patients with highest disease severity and duration. Our measurements of LB duration and severity could also be biased by patients with co-morbidity. [12] Scenario 4 therefore excluded patients with any reported co-morbidity. Although there is no definite evidence for substantial mortality due to LB as a primary cause of death [2], several case reports exist on LB related deaths.[13-16] Therefore, in scenario 5, we explored the possible impact of sporadic LB related deaths by assuming 5 annual deaths; for this we assumed the same mean age of death as the mean age of people acquiring a tick bite, i.e. 39 years of age, [17] and used the corresponding residual life expectancy derived from the GBD 2010 standard life table, i.e. 47.62 years. [18] For the persisting symptoms patients it was not possible to fit a survival curve to adjust for censored disease duration. Therefore, in scenario 6 we adjusted for censoring by increasing the disease duration by 25% for censored patients with persisting symptoms. Finally, we explored the impact of the different scenarios together in scenario 7, by combining scenario 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 (excluding scenario 1 from this last analysis, see Table 1). For all estimated parameters (i.e. disability weights, duration of disease, DALYs) we constructed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a bootstrap procedure with 1000 iterations while including missing values.

The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-of-illness of LB in the Netherlands. Methods We used available incidence estimates from 2010 for tick bite consultations and three symptomatic LB outcomes: erythema migrans (EM), disseminated LB and Lyme-related persisting symptoms. The cost was estimated using these incidences and the average cost per patient as derived from a patient questionnaire. We estimated the cost from a societal perspective, including healthcare cost, patient cost and production loss, using the friction cost method and a 4% annual discount rate. Results Tick bites and LB in 2010 led to a societal cost of \u20ac19.3 million (95% CI 15.6-23.4; 16.6 million population) for the Netherlands. Healthcare cost and production loss each constituted 48% of the total cost (\u20ac9.3 and \u20ac9.2 million/year), and patient cost 4% (\u20ac0.8 million/year). Of the total cost, 37% was related to disseminated LB, followed by 27% for persisting symptoms, 22% for tick bites and 14% for EM. Per outcome, for an individual case the mean cost of disseminated LB and Lyme-related persisting symptoms was both around \u20ac5700; for EM and GP consultations for tick bites this was \u20ac122 and \u20ac53. As an alternative to the friction cost method, the human capital method resulted in a total cost of \u20ac23.5 million/year. Conclusion LB leads to a substantial societal cost. Further research should therefore focus on additional preventive nterventions.1077The cost of Lyme borreliosis Introduction Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common tick-borne infection in Europe and North America. It is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato that in Europe is transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus. The disease most commonly manifests as erythema migrans (EM), a slowly expanding skin lesion. If left untreated, disseminated LB can develop, such as Lyme neuroborreliosis or Lyme arthritis. [1,2] Diagnostic criteria and clinical case definitions for LB in the Netherlands and other European countries are largely based on the criteria published by Stanek et al. [1] LB generally responds well to antibiotic treatment, and thus most LB patients have a good prognosis.[3,4] A minority of patients report persisting symptoms after antibiotic treatment.[1,2,4-6] In the United States the LB incidence is 329 000 cases per year (107/100 000 persons). In the Netherlands and some other areas in Europe the LB incidence is increasing, and the geographic distribution of I. ricinus ticks in Europe is expanding. [8,9] European-wide incidence estimates are complicated by large heterogeneity in surveillance data, but available estimates range from 65 000 to more than 200 000 LB cases per year. [8,10] In the Netherlands, the total LB incidence is almost 25 000 cases per year (145/100 000).[6] Insight in the burden of disease and the economic impact of LB is important to prioritize allocation of public resources. Recently, we reported the disease burden of LB in disability adjusted life years (DALYs): the annual disease burden for the Netherlands in 2010 was 1749 DALYs for the 16.6 million population. [11] Research on the economic impact of LB is scarce. Assessment of the cost-of-illness may be informative for economic evaluations of prevention and control interventions for LB. This study aimed to assess the cost-of-illness of LB taking healthcare cost, production loss and patient cost into account. Methods Outcomes First we mapped out potential disease outcomes after a tick bite in a tree diagram (see figure 1). Similar as in our previous work, [11] we defined five possible health outcomes to which cost can be attributed. The first two outcomes ''no infection'' and ''asymptomatic infection'' go without any symptoms. Nevertheless, tick bites without (or before) occurrence of symptoms incidentally result in GP consultation. The third and fourth outcome EM and ''disseminated LB'' are manifestations of acute symptomatic LB, [1] both requiring medical services, see 108Section II: The public health impact of Lyme borreliosis also figure 1. Both EM and disseminated LB patients might either fully recover, or develop the fifth outcome ''Lyme-related persisting symptoms'' that patients and their physicians attribute to LB.

Five possible health outcomes after a tick bite were defined: (1) ''no infection'' and (2) ''asymptomatic infection'' go without any symptoms; (3) EM and (4) ''disseminated LB'' are manifestations of acute symptomatic LB [1]; both EM and disseminated LB patients might either fully recover, or develop (5) ''Lyme-related persisting symptoms'' that patients and their physicians attribute to LB. [1,2,5,12-14] Cost-of-illness approach We estimated the total cost of LB by first using incidence data from 2010 to derive the number of new Borrelia infections and tick bites, and then model the lifetime cost associated with LB for affected individuals. We followed the Dutch guidelines for health economic evaluations, [15] which prescribe cost calculation from a societal perspective - implying that all cost due to LB was included no matter who incurs the cost - and use of the friction cost method to attribute the cost of production loss to LB. [16, 17] According to the friction cost method, production loss is only included for the so-called friction period, which is the time needed to replace a sick, physically disabled or deceased worker. A friction period of 12.1 weeks was used, following the Dutch guidelines for health economic evaluations. [15]All costs were expressed in Euro for the year 2014, where necessary corrected using Dutch consumer price indexes. Costs in future years were discounted with an annual rate of 4%.[15]1097The cost of Lyme borreliosis Cost categories We assessed (a) healthcare cost, (b) patient cost - or out-of-pocket cost - and (c) production loss. Healthcare cost for medical services included GP consultations, paramedic consultations, complementary medicine consultations, specialist consultations at the outpatient clinic, hospitalization, prescribed medications and formal home care, no matter who incurred the cost. The patient cost included informal care - such as self-paid household assistance or assistance by a relative or friend. Unfortunately data collection of other patient costs (e.g. over-the-counter medication, travel) seemed inadequate, and these were therefore excluded from the baseline estimate (see table 1 and Results section). Production loss included all cost due to work absenteeism of affected cases from paid work as a consequence of disease symptoms and/or visits to healthcare providers. Production loss due to impaired functioning during work hours was not included. Incidence data To extrapolate the mean cost per patient to national cost, the annual incidence per disease outcome was needed. We used incidence estimates for 2010 from a nationwide GP survey: 81 997 GP consultations for tick bites, 21 802 cases of EM, 1268 cases of disseminated LB and 905 new cases with Lyme-related persisting symptoms. [6] These estimates were based on likely and very likely diagnoses and were adjusted for reporting bias. The GP consultations for tick bites include tick bites that are not followed by any symptoms (outcomes and 2, figure 1), as well as tick bites that are later followed by symptomatic LB outcomes (outcomes 3, 4 and 5). We assumed that no cost occurred for tick bites for which no GP was consulted (92% of all tick bites [9]). Patient data Data on disease duration, resource utilization (i.e. healthcare and other resources) and sick leave were derived from a patient survey that we earlier used to estimate the disease burden of LB. [11] The Medical Ethics Review Committee of the University Medical Centre Utrecht declared that the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act does not apply to this study (protocol number 14-283/C, letter number WAG/om/14/015644). [18] Patients were eligible for this survey if they suffered symptoms of LB in the 12 months preceding the questionnaire, and were enrolled through their physician, or on their own request (the latter were recruited through an announcement by the national Lyme patient association). A total of 949 patients responded, of whom 660 patients were included in the analysis: 88 EM patients [of which 87 (99%) enrolled through their physicians], 110Section II: The public health impact of Lyme borreliosis Unit cost price, \u20acAverage resource unit utilization Cost (95% CI*) per -Surgery 754 0.07 (0.03-0.12) - - - 54.68 (24.99-91.14) -Hospital care (per day) 476 - - (0.52-1.35) - - 1.315 (386-2.351) 429 (247-644) (per day) 2015 - - - 0.06 (0.00-0.18) - - - 126 (0-358) -Home care (per hour) 20 - - - 0.21 14 - 20.76 (0.48-57.42) 34.29 (22.87-48.3) - - 291 (7-804) 480 (319-676) - 291 (7-804) 5666 (3502-7991) 5697 for tick bites and LB outcomes in the Netherlands in 2010, stratified for healthcare cost, patient cost and production loss, including all subcategories of cost resources and utilization. Cost is expressed in 2014 euros. * : We estimated 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a bootstrap procedure with 1000 iterations while including missing values (see Appendix 1). **: Several prescribed medications due to LB per symptomatic patient were listed in the 4 weeks preceding the questionnaire, of which 44% were antibacterial medications, 36% pain medications and 20% other medications; when in doubt whether medications were taken upon prescription or as over-the-counter drugs, we assumed they were taken upon prescription. Definite over-the- counter drugs listed by some patients in the questionnaire were excluded, since we failed to systematically collect them. All medication cost prices were derived from www .medicijnkosten.nl.***: For 10% of tick bite consultations we assumed that prophylactic treatment was prescribed, [19] with a cost price of \u20ac15 per treatment. ^: In the patient questionnaire we also asked for ''other costs'' in the 4 weeks preceding the questionnaire, in order to extrapolate these costs to complete disease episodes. Unfortunately many participants appeared to have misinterpreted this question; they seemed to have listed costs since the date of onset of disease. This complicated an accurate estimate of ''other costs'', and we excluded these costs from our estimate for the patient cost and total cost. However, to explore the possible range of these costs we calculated a lower and an upper bound for ''other costs''; the lower assuming that all ''other costs'' were listed by participants since the onset of disease, and the upper bound assuming costs listed for the four preceding weeks.^^: For the working population, we assumed one hour of work-absenteeism per tick bite GP consultation; we estimated the working population at 52%, based on the age distribution of tick bite cases and data from Statistics Netherlands. [9]1117The cost of Lyme borreliosis 96 disseminated LB patients [88 (92%) enrolled through physicians] and 476 patients with Lyme-related persisting symptoms [189 (40%) enrolled through physicians]. See our previous work for details on the questionnaire response and classification of patients in LB manifestations. [11] Lifetime cost for tick bite consultations and symptomatic LB outcomes For GP consultations for tick bites, we included the cost of one GP consult plus 1 h of work-absenteeism per consult for the working population (table 1). In addition, we included cost for prophylactic antibiotic treatment after 10% of the GP consultations for a tick bite (table 1). [19] For the symptomatic LB outcomes, we derived disease duration and resource utilization from the patient survey. [11] Cost per LB patient was calculated post hoc by multiplying used resources with corresponding unit cost prices from Dutch guidelines for health economic evaluations [15] and http://www .medicijnkosten.nl. See table 1 for resources utilization and prices. Estimation of the lifetime cost per outcome was complicated by the censored disease durations and cost histories in our patient data. To overcome this, the mean lifetime cost per patient was modelled for each symptomatic LB outcome in four steps: (a) estimate mean disease duration, (b) recreate cost histories over time, (c) estimate average cost per time interval during disease and (d) estimate the mean cost per disease episode. See Appendix 1. Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analyses were conducted assuming different estimates for the incidence, severity and disease duration, or for possible mortality due to LB (scenario 1-6). In addition, in scenario 7 the cost was estimated without discounting, and in scenario 8 and 9 the human capital method was applied, with and without possible mortality due to LB. The human capital method values all absenteeism until the retirement age as production loss, other than the friction cost method that only values production loss for the time until replacement. [17] See legend of figure 2, and table A1.112Section II: The public health impact of Lyme borreliosis Figure 2. Sensitivity analysis of the cost-of-illness due to LB for nine scenarios compared with the baseline estimate. Cost is presented per outcome in million \u20ac for the Netherlands in 2010 (16.6 million population). Cost is expressed in 2014 euros. Scenario 1 evaluated the impact of including patients enrolled at their own request, that is mainly through the national patient association. Scenario 2 used higher incidence estimates per LB outcome from Hofhuis et al.[6], by also including less likely LB diagnoses. Scenario 3 excluded the 5% patients with highest disease severity and duration, to assess the possible impact of including relatively more severely ill patients. In scenario 4, to explore whether our estimates could be biased by patients with co-morbidity that was not related to LB[35], we excluded such patients. Although there is no definite evidence for substantial mortality due to LB[36], several cases of LB-related deaths have been reported.[37-40] Scenario 5 therefore explored the possible impact of sporadic LB related deaths by assuming five annual deaths. For the patients with persisting symptoms, it was not possible to fit a survival curve to adjust for censored disease duration. Thus, in scenario 6 we increased the disease duration by 25% for censored patients with persisting symptoms. Scenario 7 presented the cost estimate without discounting, and scenario 8 presented the cost when applying the human capital method as an alternative for the friction cost method. Finally, in scenario 9 we again applied the human capital method, but now combined with the five annual deaths from scenario 5 whereby considering production loss up to age of retirement (i.e. 67 years).

For all outcomes, both healthcare cost and production loss were the most important cost (table 1). The healthcare cost was highest for disseminated LB, followed by persisting symptoms, EM and tick bite consultations. As a proportion per outcome, the healthcare cost was highest for tick bite consultations (66%), followed by EM (55%), disseminated LB (47%) and persisting symptoms (32%) (figure A1). Production loss was - both absolute and as a proportion of the outcome - highest for persisting symptoms, followed by disseminated LB, EM and tick bites (figure A1). Patient cost was only observed in patients with disseminated LB and persisting symptoms (table 1). Note that the patient cost only contained informal domestic support. Other types of patient cost - such as travel cost and other payments by patients - were excluded, although they had been included in the patient questionnaire; many patients misinterpreted the timeline and seemed to have administered the cost for their entire disease episode, whereas this should only have been 4 weeks preceding the questionnaire. Therefore, we restrained ourselves to exploring the possible range of this cost by calculating a lower and upper bound; the lower assuming that all cost was listed by participants since the onset of disease, and the upper bound assuming cost listed for the four preceding weeks (table 1). On the 16.6 million population level, the point estimates of these lower and upper bound for patient cost - other than informal domestic support - ranged from \u20ac12 thousands to \u20ac3.9 million. National cost strati ed by outcome and type of cost Table 2 shows that the total cost due to LB was estimated at \u20ac19.3 million/year (95% CI 15.6-23.4) for the 16.6 million population. Stratified by outcome, the cost was \u20ac4.3 million/year (22% of the total cost) for tick \u20ac2.7 million/year (14%) for \u20ac5.2 million/ year (27%) for persisting symptoms. Stratified by cost category, the healthcare cost and production loss were \u20ac9.3 and \u20ac9.2 million/ year, respectively (table 2), both 48% of the total cost. The patient cost was \u20ac0.8 million/year (4%).114Section II: The public health impact of Lyme borreliosis Sensitivity analysis Figure 2 and table A2 show the cost per LB outcome for the baseline and nine alternative scenarios. The human capital method[17] resulted in a 22% higher estimate (scenario 8: \u20ac23.5 million/year) than the friction cost method. In combination with possible mortality, the human capital method resulted in an even higher estimate (scenario 9: \u20ac25.6 million/year), whereas with the friction cost method mortality had hardly any influence (scenario 5). Not taking into account discounting (scenario 7) resulted in an estimate 36% above baseline. When including patients who enrolled in the survey on their own request (scenario 1), the cost was 17% higher. The total cost increased with 10%, when using higher incidence estimates (scenario 2), and decreased with 10%, when excluding the 5% most severely ill cases (scenario 3). Co-morbidity and raising the disease duration of persisting symptoms hardly influenced the cost (scenario 4 and 6). Discussion We found a substantial cost-of-illness due to LB - the most frequent tick-borne infection in Europe and North America. Using incidence estimates from Hofhuis et al. [6] and a patient questionnaire on healthcare consumption and production loss, we estimated the total societal cost due to LB in the Netherlands in 2010 at \u20ac19.3 million (95% CI 15.6-23.4; 16.6 million population). Healthcare cost and production loss both constitute almost half (48%) of the total cost-of-illness, whereas patient cost were modest (4%). Of the total cost, 37% was related to disseminated LB, followed by 27% for persisting symptoms, 22% for tick bite Cost-of-illness (95%CI*) per 16.6 million population, in million \u20ac Tick bite EM Disseminated LB Lyme-related persisting and Lym e borreliosis (LB) in the Netherlands in 2010, baseline scenario stratified for healthcare cost, patient cost, and production loss. Cost is expressed in 2014 euros. The incidence per outcome was 81 997 GP consultations for tick bites, 21 802 cases of EM, 1268 cases of disseminated LB and 905 new cases with Lyme-related persisting symptoms.[6] *: We estimated 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a bootstrap procedure with 1000 iterations while including missing values (see Apendix 1).1157The cost of Lyme borreliosis consultations and 14% for EM. Per patient, the cost of both disseminated LB and Lyme-related persisting symptoms was very high and almost similar (\u20ac5666 and \u20ac5697 per patient); not surprisingly for the mild outcomes EM and tick bite consultations the cost per patient was much lower (\u20ac122 and \u20ac53), and their impact on the population level is thus mainly due to their high incidence. The second highest societal cost was attributed to Lyme-related persisting symptoms (27% of the total cost), whereas it remains debated to what extent persisting symptoms attributed to LB are actually due to a current or preceding infection. [1,20,21] This implies that not all cost due to persisting symptoms may be mitigated through prevention and control of acute LB. Nevertheless, our results indicate the substantial cost due to persisting symptoms that are attributed to LB. Our sensitivity analysis illustrated that long-term production loss has a much higher impact when using the human capital method as an alternative for the friction cost method (scenario 8 and 9, figure 2). The higher cost when including patients who enrolled in the survey on their own request (instead of through their physician), suggests that these patients are probably not representative for the cost of LB in the general population (scenario 1), which justifies their exclusion from the baseline estimate. The somewhat higher cost when using the alternative incidence estimates (scenario 2), shows that under-ascertainment may have led to some underestimation of the cost. The most severely ill cases had only a moderate impact on the total cost (scenario 3), which suggests at most a modest effect of selection bias on our baseline estimate. To our knowledge, this is the first cost-of-illness estimate for LB that includes all possible health outcomes of LB, including tick bites and Lyme-related persisting symptoms, from a societal perspective. It adds to the few other studies that estimate the cost-of-illness of LB for countries in Europe and North America. [22-27] Most of these studies did not - or only partly - include production loss, which can be substantial as we showed in the current study. Comparing our results with these other studies is further complicated by differences in healthcare systems, the methods to attribute cost, and the disease outcomes to attribute cost to LB. An alternative for comparing the cost would be comparing the resource utilization per patient, but this is hardly reported. For the US, Maes et al. [23] estimated an annual expenditure of 500 million USD on LB, but this estimate was based on a decision analysis model that was largely built upon assumptions and expert opinion. Also for the US, Zhang et al. [24] combined data from medical records and patient questionnaires to estimate the cost of LB, which resembles our patient data driven approach. Unfortunately, they did not report units of healthcare use, complicating direct comparison 116Section II: The public health impact of Lyme borreliosis because of the differences in prices with the US. A recent study from the US by Adrion et al.[22] included Lyme-related persisting symptoms to estimate the healthcare cost due to LB. In line with our results they showed that Lyme-related persisting symptoms are associated with substantial healthcare cost. In Europe, Joss et al. [25] reported in 2003 the cost of LB for Scotland - a country with a very low LB incidence - at \u00a3331 000. A more recent cost estimate comes from Germany, where the cost of LB was estimated around \u20ac80 million, by the combined estimations of two studies based on patient data from insurance company claims. [26,27] Comparison with our study was complicated since tick bites and persisting symptoms were not included in the German estimate, neither was production loss for outpatients. For Sweden, Henningsson et al. [28] estimated the healthcare cost of neuroborreliosis at \u20ac3300 per patient, which is quite similar to our estimate of \u20ac2660 for disseminated LB (table 1). A limitation of our study was that we did not include the cost of long-term revalidation and nursery care, and the cost of LB serology, which were not included in the patient questionnaire. The cost of serology has been reported to be substantial in the US and Germany, with the majority of patients suspected of LB and not new incident LB cases. [26, 29] The German study by Muller et al.[26] estimates a total cost of LB serology testing in Germany around \u20ac40 million per year for the 82 million population, of which only around \u20ac7 million/year was due to new LB incident cases. If we extrapolate this German data to the 16.6 million population of the Netherlands this would imply a cost of around 8 million per year for all LB serology, of which only around \u20ac1.5 million would be due to new LB incident cases. This calls for further research into the cost of LB serology in the Netherlands, not in the first place to complete the healthcare cost estimate for LB cases, but also to explore the probably much higher economic impact of serology for suspected cases. Another limitation was the exclusion of patient payments such as travel cost in our study due to misinterpretations during the data collection. Inclusion of such payments could possibly have led to up to \u20ac3.9 million higher annual costs. Compared with other infectious diseases, our estimate of the cost of LB in the Netherlands is higher than the cost of 7 out of 14 foodborne pathogens, and comparable to the cost of Toxoplasma gondii and Salmonella spp. [30] Restricting our estimate to the cost attributed to tick bites, EM and disseminated Lyme (together \u20ac14.1 million) - and thus ignoring the cost of persisting symptoms - does not change the ranking of LB. [30] The total cost due to LB and other infectious diseases is only marginal compared with the total Dutch healthcare expenses of 88 billion in 2010 (highest impact by mental disorders and cardiovascular disease, 20 and 9%, respectively). [31]1177The cost of Lyme borreliosis To reduce the cost due to LB, prevention of disseminated LB and persisting symptoms should have priority, since these go with the highest cost. In the Netherlands prevention and control has been focused on early removal of tick bites. [32] Education of physicians in the early diagnosis and treatment of EM and disseminated LB is also crucial, since this can prevent severe cases of disseminated LB and persisting symptoms. In the last decade, additional research has been aunched into control measures to reduce tick abundance, into mechanisms that lead to persisting symptoms, [33] and into development of a vaccine against LB and tick bites.[34] The results of these studies will possibly lead to additional prevention and treatment strategies. The result of the current study can facilitate cost-effectiveness studies of such interventions.

The questionnaire contained questions about disease severity, [1] disease duration and questions about healthcare consumption and work absenteeism adapted from the Tic-P questionnaire.[2] More specifically the patients were asked to provide the following data: The start date of their episode-of-illness; The end date of their episode-of-illness, if the disease was no longer present; otherwise the date of patient questionnaire completion was noted; Number of LB related contacts with an health care provider in the past 12 months (GP , medical specialist, paramedic care provider, complementary healthcare provider, medical surgeons, hospital and intensive care unit); (Average) Number of weekly hours of contact with formal home care in the past 4 weeks; The types of drugs, the number of days these drugs were taken, and the daily dosage in the past 4 weeks; ''other'' costs: total costs incurred in the past 4 weeks (such as travel costs); Duration in time in which absenteeism from work had occurred, due to Lyme. Absenteeism was recorded in four degrees: 100%, >50%, 50% and <50%; in the calculations this was implemented as 100%, 75%, 50% and 25%, respectively. The questions about onset and end of disease resulted in an estimate of disease duration for each respondent, which can be regarded as right-censored, because the survey is held at a specific point of time at which the episode-of-illness may not have yet ended; the response variables concerning healthcare providers and absen- teeism are interval-censored, because these variables pertain to the last 12 months or 4 weeks only. Estimation of duration of disease and mean lifetime cost per outcome Estimation of the mean lifetime cost per outcome was complicated by the censored durations of symptoms and cost histories in our patient data. To overcome this, the mean lifetime cost per patient was estimated for each symptomatic LB outcome in four steps: (a) estimate mean duration of symptoms, (b) recreate cost histories over time, (c) estimate average cost per time interval during disease and (d) estimate the mean cost per disease episode. Below we elaborate on each of these four steps.122Section II: The public health impact of Lyme borreliosis a) Estimate duration of symptoms As described in our earlier work[1], survival analysis was applied to obtain the mean duration of symptoms for EM (5 weeks) and disseminated LB (22.5 weeks). For the outcome ''persisting symptoms'' we used the censored estimate instead (4.6 years), since very few individuals with persisting symptoms have reported that their episode of illness has ended, and thus a survival model could not be fitted. b) Recreate cost histories over time We asked patients at a specific moment in time about costs in a preceding period. Then, to obtain cost histories over time we 'recreated' the cost history process by means of Monte Carlo simulation (1000 simulations). We did so by assuming that the probability of a contact with a healthcare provider (or other cost category) in a given time interval is equal to the ratio of the interval length and the sum of all time interval in a disease episode. The moments of contact and costs can then be simulated using these probabilities. For the outcome Lyme- related persisting symptoms the disease episode was relatively long and not for every time interval cost data was available in our patient data. We therefore assumed that costs were evenly distributed over time and extrapolated the administered costs to the entire disease episode. c) Estimate mean cost per time interval during disease We followed Lin's method here:[3] after recreating cost histories in (b), we split up the cost histories in intervals, and simply estimated the sample mean of the costs in each interval. d) Estimate mean cost per outcome We can combine estimates from (a) and (c) to estimate the mean cost per outcome as follows: M M C = Cj = Smax (0, j - 1) \u00b5j j=0 j=0 where \u00b5,j is the average cost per individual incurred at interval j, and Sj the cumulative fraction of individuals that has survived interval j . Thus, the weighted average costs Cj is the fraction of individuals that have survived up until j, i.e. Sj-1 (or S0 is j= 0), multiplied with the average cost \u00b5,j. M is the total number of intervals. Incomplete intervals are left out of the analysis. See also Basu and Manning. [4]1237The cost of Lyme borreliosis To assess the uncertainty that comes with the four steps described above, we used the following bootstrap procedure. We first made a bootstrap replicate, applied steps a/b/c/d, and saved the results. Then this process was repeated for 1000 times while including missing values. Taking the mean of these 1000 iterations gave our point estimate of costs. We regarded the intervals between the 2.5 and 97.5% quantiles as confidence interval, although it also includes the model uncertainty from the cost history recreation step.124Section II: The public health impact of Lyme borreliosis Scenarios Criteria for included patients and parameters Baseline estimate -Restrict to patients that were enrolled through their physicians to estimate the disease duration and cost -discounting the cost in coming years with a rate of 4% per year -friction cost method applied to production loss[13] Scenario 1: Include patients enrolled upon their own request-Same as baseline AND -include patients enrolled upon their own request-i.e. mainly through the national patient association) Scenario 2: Include less likely LB diagnoses in incidence estimates-Same as baseline AND -Use higher LB incidence estimates that also include less likely LB diagnoses; i.e. for disseminated LB 1386 cases per year and for Lyme-related persisting symptoms 1137 cases [5] Scenario 3: Exclude 5% patients with highest disease severity and duration-Same as baseline BUT -exclude per LB outcome patients with the 5% highest extreme values for disability weights and disease duration Scenario 4: No co-morbidity -Same as baseline BUT -exclude patients with any co-morbidity Scenario 5: Five annual deaths due to LB-Same as baseline AND-inclusion of five deaths attributable to LB per year, the mean age of death was assumed to be the same as the mean age of people acquiring a tick bite, i.e., 39 years of age, [9] and the corresponding residual life expectancy was derived from Dutch mortality data, i.e. 43 years Scenario 6: Adjust for censored disease duration in the persisting symptoms patients.-Same as baseline AND -raise the disease duration for persisting symptoms patients with 25% Scenario 7: No discounting -Same as baseline BUT -no discounting of the cost in coming years Scenario 8: Human capital method (instead of the friction cost method)13-Same as baseline BUT -apply human capital method to production loss Scenario 9: Human capital method13 AND five annual deaths due to LB (5 and 8 combined)-Same as baseline BUT inclusion of five deaths attributable to LB per year, with mean age 39 years and considering productivity losses up to age of retirement (i.e. 65 years) -apply human capital method to production loss Table A1.

Aiming to quantify the infection risk at point of care by physicians, we explored risk factors such as tick testing for Borrelia and assessment of the duration of the tick's blood meal. Methods and Findings Questionnaires, blood samples and ticks from patients who consulted one of 307 general practitioners for tick bites (n = 327) or EM (n = 283) in 2007 and 2008, were collected at enrolment and three months later at follow-up. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato PCR/reverse line blot on gene. in C6 ELISA, IgM or IgG immunoblots for Borrelia-specific antibodies was observed in 3.2% of tick bite cases. Fourteen tick bite cases had evidence of early Borrelia infection, of which EM developed among seven cases. The risk of developing EM after tick bites was 2.6% (95%CI: 1.1%-5.0%), and the risk of either EM was 5.1% (95%CI: 2.9%-8.2%). Participants with Borrelia-positive ticks had a significantly higher risk of either EM or seroconversion (odds ratio 4.8, 95%CI: 1.1-20.4), and of seroconversion alone (odds ratio 11.1, 95%CI: 1.1-108.9). A third (34%) of the cases enrolled with EM did not recall preceding tick bites. Three EM cases (1%) reported persisting symptoms, three months after standard antibiotic treatment for EM. Conclusions One out of forty participants developed EM within three months after tick bites. The infection risk can be assessed by tick testing for Borrelia at point of care by physicians. However, further refining is needed considering sensitivity and specificity of tick tests, accuracy of tick attachment time and engorgement.1338A prospective study among patients presenting at the general practitioner with a tick bite or erythema migrans Introduction Lyme borreliosis is caused by different Borrelia species from the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group (hereafter referred to as Borrelia), which in Europe is transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus. The most common clinical manifestation of Lyme borreliosis is erythema migrans (EM), a characteristic rash expanding from the site of the tick bite, which may appear some days to weeks following infection, and is sometimes accompanied by systemic flu-like symptoms. Late and more serious Lyme borreliosis can present as a multi-systemic disease with skin, neurological, cardiac and musculoskeletal manifestations. [1] In the Netherlands, a repeated retrospective study among general practitioners has shown a continuing and strong increase in consultations for tick bites and for EM between 1994 and 2009 [2-4]. The increasing number oftick bites, adding up to 1.5 million people with a tick bite in 2009[4], poses a progressive threat to public health. To aid the development of prevention strategies against Lyme borreliosis, knowledge of the epidemiology and risk factors are essential. Specifically, the understanding and quantification of an individual's risk for Borrelia infection and developing symptomatic Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite would be of great value to establish the usefulness of antibiotic prophylaxis after a tick bite. The individual risk for Borrelia infection depends on several factors, one of these being the tick infection rate with Borrelia, which tends to be heterogeneous over space and time [5,6]. Another is the transmission rate of Borrelia from ticks to humans, which is affected by the tick attachment time. According to experimental data, Borrelia transmission does not occur at the beginning of the blood uptake. The transmission efficiency increases with the duration of the blood meal, as described for the North American vector Ixodes require attachment to the host for at least 24 hours before transmission of Borrelia starts, and a high level of transmission is reached after 48 hours of attachment [7,8]. In Europe however, transmission of Borrelia during the first 24 hours of Ixodes ricinus attachment has also been reported[9,10]. According to North American studies, prophylactic antibiotic treatment after a tick bite can prevent Lyme borreliosis[11], provided that the tick bite is not overlooked, which is the case for one third, up to two thirds of tick bites [12,13]. A major disadvantage of treating all detected tick bites prophylactically, would be the high number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one new case of Lyme borreliosis. Therefore we aim to explore to what extent the NNT can be reduced, using tick-screening instruments for general practitioners to predict an individual's risk of Borrelia infection after each tick bite. Such 134Section III: The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands tick-screening instruments include tick testing for infection with Borrelia, and assessment of the duration of the tick's blood meal, measured as self-estimated hours of tick attachment time or measured as degree of engorgement of the tick. The issue of transmission rate of the pathogen from ticks to humans in Europe has been addressed by studies in Switzerland [14,15], and Sweden[16]. In the Netherlands, a study was performed in 2006 on Ameland, one of the Northern Wadden islands [17]. However, these results were not considered representative of the whole of the Netherlands, due to the small sample size (n = 146) of this study, and as tick infection rates with Borrelia tend to be spatially and temporally heterogeneous. Here, we report the results of a nationwide prospective study among patients who consulted a general practitioner for a tick bite or EM. Tick bite patients were followed-up after three months to investigate the transmission risk for Borrelia to humans in the Netherlands, to gain insight in risk factors for tick bites and for Borrelia infection, exploring tick-screening instruments to predict an individual's risk of Borrelia infection after each tick bite, and to explore associations with symptoms and serology. EM patients were followed-up after three months to investigate symptoms and serology after standard antibiotic treatment, and to gain insight in risk factors for Borrelia infection. Materials and Methods Study design Out of two thousand invited general practitioners in areas with a high incidence of tick bites, as identified in an earlier study [3], 307 general practitioners from all twelve provinces of the country agreed to enroll patients into our prospective tick bite study. Between May 2007 and December 2008, patients who consulted a cooperating general practitioner for a recent EM or tick bite, preferably still having the tick, were invited to participate. Patients were not eligible for participation if they were younger than six years of age, and if the tick bite had occurred outside the Netherlands. At enrolment at the general practitioner, participants received the first set of study materials, containing a brochure about the study, an informed consent form, a baseline questionnaire, and materials for collection and mailing of baseline blood samples and removed ticks. Ticks removed from the skin were sent to our study laboratory at the RIVM by regular mail, using a small tube with 70% ethanol. Two tubes of blood, 7 ml in a serum tube and 5 ml in an EDTA tube, were collected at regular medical posts for blood withdrawal and sent to our study laboratory at the RIVM. The first questionnaire inquired about baseline data such as the location of tick bites and EM on the body, probable duration of tick attachment, in which area and during which activity the tick bite was 1358A prospective study among patients presenting at the general practitioner with a tick bite or erythema migrans possibly contracted, techniques for tick removal, use of antibiotics, symptoms, and history of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis. The questionnaire also inquired about risk behaviour, knowledge of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis, and attitudes towards preventive measures. Three months after enrolment, the participant received the second set of study materials, containing a follow-up questionnaire and materials for collection and mailing of a second blood sample. The follow-up questionnaire inquired about new tick bites, development of Lyme borreliosis, symptoms and the use of antibiotics during the period between the baseline and follow-up questionnaires. For epidemiological analysis, participants were divided into a group enrolled with an EM and a group enrolled with a tick bite. To support correct classification of EM cases, the general practitioners received an additional confirmation questionnaire for each case who reported an EM at baseline or in the follow-up questionnaire. Development of clinical Lyme borreliosis, as reported in the participant's questionnaire, was only taken into account as an outcome measure in this study, if confirmed by the general practitioner through this additional questionnaire. After having enrolled a case, the general practitioner invited a control person to fill out a questionnaire similar to the baseline case questionnaire, to enable comparison of cases and control persons with regard to risk behaviour, knowledge of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis, and attitudes towards preventive measures (not reported in this article). Eligible controls were patients who visited the same general practitioner for reasons other than a tick bite or Lyme borreliosis, preferably of the same gender and age as the corresponding case. General practitioners were additionally requested to register the number of consults for tick bites and EM on a scoring card on a weekly basis for the years 2007 and 2008. To keep the general practitioners informed and alert on the study, we sent three-monthly newsletters. The study protocol (number 07-032/K) was approved by the medical ethics committee of the University Medical Centre in Utrecht, the Netherlands. All participants gave written informed consent. Tick analyses After arrival at the laboratory, ticks were stored at -20\u00b0C in ethanol until microscopic examination was performed to determine tick species, stage and gender, using standard keys [18]. The degree of engorgement of the tick was categorized as unengorged, partially engorged, or fully engorged. Total DNA extraction from ticks, amplification by PCR, reverse line blotting (RLB) for Borrelia species identification were performed as described. [19,20] In addition, the presence of Borrelia in ticks was also determined using a real-time PCR amplification on the OspA gene.[21] Individual test results of the tick analyses were not reported to the participants or their physicians.136Section III: The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands Serological analyses Paired serum samples (the baseline and consecutive serum sample) from the same case were tested simultaneously for Borreliaspecific antibodies using a commercially available C6 peptide ELISA and in house IgM and IgG immunoblots. The C6 ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction [Immunetics, Inc. Cambridge, Mass. USA]. Results were scored as negative (ELISA index score, >0.90), borderline (0.90 to 1.09), or positive (1.10). The C6 ELISA has a reported sensitivity of 23 to 90% in EM patients [22-24], and a high specificity (99-100%).[25] Because the C6 ELISA does not distinguish between IgG and IgM antibodies, in-house IgM and IgG immunoblots were used concurrently as described [26]. Reactions to the 15-20,22, 30-39, and 41 kDa bands were evaluated for the IgM immunoblot and reactivity to the 22 kDa band with at least one other band was considered as a positive result. The IgM immunoblot was considered borderline if there was a reaction with two or more bands but not the 22 kDa. For the IgG immunoblot, reactions to the 17, 22, 31, 34, 39, 41, 58 and 92 kDa band were evaluated. The IgG immunoblot was considered positive if at least four reactive bands were present including at least one of the following specific bands: 17, 22, 39, 58 and 92 kDa. The IgG immunoblot was considered borderline when four or more bands were present but none of the 17, 22, 39, 58 or 92 kDa bands reacted or when three bands, including at least one specific band, were present. All other results were considered negative. Seroconversion of IgM or IgG in the immunoblot or in the C6 ELISA was considered as evidence of an early Borrelia infection. For seroconversion in the C6 ELISA, the ELISA index score was required to be <1.10 in the baseline serum, and 1.10 in the consecutive serum, with a minimum increase of 1.5 points. A participant was considered serologically negative if no reactivity was detected in both the baseline and consecutive serum sample, with any of the serological tests. For analysis of the risk of Borrelia infection after a tick bite, borderline results in the C6 ELISA and immunoblot were considered negative. Two consecutive positive serological outcomes without significant in- or decrease of antibody levels and seroreversion (a positive result in the baseline serum sample that became negative on follow-up) were not considered as recent Borrelia infections related to the tick consult at enrolment in our analyses. Although serological testing is not recommended after a tick bite or EM, individual serological results were reported to the general practitioner when the paired serology indicated a recent infection, if the case had given written permission for this on the informed consent form.1378A prospective study among patients presenting at the general practitioner with a tick bite or erythema migrans Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.3 (SAS Inc.). The outcome measure ''Borrelia infection within the three-month follow-up period after a tick bite'' was defined as development of physician-confirmed clinical Lyme borreliosis such as EM, or seroconversion for Borrelia-specific antibodies. The risk of Borrelia infection after a tick bite was estimated with 95% confidence intervals based on mid-P exact. Several multivariate models were developed using logistic regression. All possible predictive variables were included in the multivariate logistic regression models, after which the models were optimized using backwards elimination, until all predictive variables that were maintained in the model were statistically significant contributors (p-<0.05). Two separate logistic regression models were developed to identify distinctive symptoms at baseline and three months later at follow-up, for both the tick bite case group and the EM case group. The models compared symptoms at baseline to symptoms at follow-up within each individual case. In a further logistic regression model, adjusted for age, the reported symptoms of EM cases at baseline were compared to those of tick bite cases at baseline, in order to identify differences in symptoms at baseline. A fourth logistic regression model was developed to pinpoint symptoms that are indicative of Borrelia infection, other than the pathognomic EM. In this model, the development of new symptoms since baseline were compared between the cases that developed Borrelia infection after a tick bite, and those that did not develop EM or seroconverted after a tick bite. Logistic regression was also applied to identify possible predictors of Borrelia infection after a tick bite, adjusted for age. For this analysis, the development of EM or seroconversion were tested for associations with tick infection with Borrelia, tick engorgement, and tick attachment time reported by the participant. The same analysis was performed to look for predictors of symptoms that could be indicative of Borrelia infection, as identified in the earlier described fourth model on symptoms. Tick bite cases that received (prophylactic) antibiotic treatment for a tick bite at enrolment, were excluded from the analyses of the risk of Borrelia infection and other reported symptoms after a tick bite, as well as one case whose development of neuroborreliosis was almost certainly not attributable to the tick bite at baseline case # 15 in table 1 and 2).138Section III: The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands Case Evidence of Borrelia infection C6 ELISA index* IgM immunoblot IgG immunoblot Borrelia in tick Tick engorgement Hours of tick attachment Clinical Seroconversion** 1st 2nd 1st 2nd1st 2nd 1 yes (EM) yes (IgG) 1.12 0.83 - - +/- + n.a. n.a. 30 2 yes (EM) yes (C6) 0.21 1.90 - - - - + (untypeable orrelia Borrelia) full 16 3 yes (EM) no +/- +/- - - + (B. afzelii) 4 yes (EM) no 0.27 0.37 +/- +/- - - - full 36 5 yes (EM) no 0.47 0.43 - - - - n.a. n.a. 8 6 yes (EM) no 0.64 0.98 +/- +/- - - - unengorged 30 7 yes (EM) no 0.37 0.33 - - - - + (untypeable Borrelia) partial 15 8 no yes (C6 & IgM & IgG) 0.40 3.79 - + - + n.a.

A total of 644 participants were evenly distributed over the Netherlands (figure 1), but concentrated in areas with a high incidence of tick bites, due to the selection of invited general practitioners. The median patient enrolment was 15% per physician for tick bite patients and 33% per physician for EM patients, based on weekly scores of 90 general practitioners. A flow chart of participants is shown in figure 2, with demographic characteristics and data collection on submitted ticks and follow-up of questionnaires, serology, and physician-confirmed clinical outcomes. Among the 644 participants, 361 cases (55%) consulted their physician for a tick bite, and 283 (43%) consulted their physician at baseline with an EM that was undisputed by their physician. Tick analyses Three hundred and fourteen ticks were obtained from 293 participants. The majority (94%) of these ticks were identified as Ixodes ricinus. Eighteen ticks (6%) could not be identified, as they had been damaged too much during removal from the patient's skin. Of these participants who submitted ticks, 278 were cases who consulted their physician for a tick bite, and fifteen were cases who consulted their physician with an EM. Among the EM cases who submitted a tick, seven had saved the tick that had been removed earlier, and in six cases the tick was still attached at the site of the EM, as confirmed by the physician. Two EM cases submitted a tick that was removed by the general practitioner found on a different location on the body. The majority of tick bite cases submitted one tick (94%), and seventeen cases submitted more than two, up to five ticks. Table 3 shows developmental stage of the ticks, degree of engorgement and the Borrelia species detected in these ticks. Borrelia-positive ticks per developmental stage and engorgement are shown in supplementary table S1. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato DNA (29.3% (95%CI: 24.5%- 34.5%). Four different identified among which B. afzelii predominated In one tick B. burgdorferi ss. and B. garinii were detected simultaneously, and another tick contained B. garinii and B. afzelii. Thirty-six ticks (11.5%) contained be typed further.140Section III: The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands Follow-up of cases with a tick bite at baseline Among the 361 cases that consulted their physician for a tick bite, 34 (9%) had received antibiotics at baseline, even though the national medical guidelines did not recommend prophylactic treatment after a tick bite [27]. None of these 34 tick bite cases with antibiotics at baseline, reported development of clinical Lyme borreliosis, even though six out of eighteen corresponding ticks tested positive for Borrelia. Reported tick attachment times ranged between one hour and sixteen days. More than half of the tick bite cases (56%) reported that the tick had been removed within 24 hours (figure 3). Figure 4 shows reported tick attachment times and development of early Borrelia infection for the 327 tick bite cases that did not receive antibiotic treatment at baseline.

Self-reported symptoms among cases with evidence of Borrelia infection within three months after a tick bite. EM = erythema migrans. case #15 was excluded from risk analyses, as the development of Lyme borreliosis was almost certainly not attributable to the tick bite at baseline.1418A prospective study among patients presenting at the general practitioner with a tick bite or erythema migrans the tick bite cases reported other tick bites during the six weeks before enrolment or within the three-month follow-up. Among these cases that reported other tick bites during this period before or after enrolment, the majority (44/54) reported one to three tick bites, but some (10/54) reported more than three, and up to sixteen tick bites. Seropositive outcomes of all cases, for the C6 ELISA, the IgM and IgG immunoblot are shown in figure 5. The majority of the 284 tick bite cases with serological follow-up (85.9%) tested negative for Borrelia-specific antibodies at baseline and remained negative at follow-up in the immunoblots as well as in the C6-ELISA. Thirty-one tick bite cases (10.9%) tested positive for Borrelia-specific antibodies at baseline and at follow-up. Seroconversion for Borrelia-specific antibodies was observed in nine tick bite cases (3.2%) with any of the three tests, and in five tick bite cases (1.8%) confirmed with the immunoblot following a positive or borderline outcome in the ELISA. Within the follow-up period of three months after a tick bite, fourteen cases had evidence of an early Borrelia infection, clinically and/or serologically. Seven Figure 1. Geographical distribution of 644 cases with tick bites or erythema migrans that participated in the study, depicted as the number of cases per selected general practitioner's practice.142Section III: The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands cases developed EM, of which two cases also seroconverted. Additionally, seven other cases had serological evidence of an early Borrelia infection. For the cases with Borrelia infection after a tick bite, table 1 shows the clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis, serology and exposure to ticks, and table 2 shows their self-reported symptoms at baseline and three months later at follow-up. Table 4 shows symptoms reported by all cases at baseline and three months later at follow-up. These symptoms at baseline and three months later at follow-up were compared in a multivariate logistic regression model, matched by case. The only symptom with a statistically significant different frequency at baseline compared to follow-up among tick bite cases, was an indistinct rash at the tick bite site, which occurred among 12.3% of these cases at baseline and 7.1% at follow-up. The emergence of new symptoms since baseline after a tick bite among cases with seroconversion or EM were compared in another multivariate logistic regression model, to the tick bite cases that did not have Borrelia infection. Tick bite cases with seroconversion or EM were more likely to have newly emerged symptoms such as headache, tingling sensations in limbs, and itching (table 4). 57 cases excluded for insufcient collection of data or study materials (n=22), no recent tick bite nor erythema migrans (n=1 8), erythema migrans disputable according to the enrolling physician (n=16), aged younger than six (n=1).701 cases enrolled by 307 general practitioners May 2007 - December 2008535 controls enrolled (nine were excluded for having a tick bite or EM) 42% male Median age: 54 yrs, range 7 - 87 644 cases fullled inclusion criteria* 46% male Median age: 55 yrs, range 6 - 86 34 tick bite cases excluded from risk analysis of \"Lyme after a tick bite\" and of \"clinical symptoms after a tick bite\", due to antibiotic treatment at baseline. 327 tick bite cases without antibiotic treatment at baselineData collection:Participants with tick at baseline: physician-conrmed clinical follow-up: 255 (90%) Figure 2.

This yields an estimated risk of 2.6% (95%CI: 1.1%- 5.0%) for development of EM within three months after a tick bite. For development of either EM or seroconversion, the risk was 5.1% (95%CI: 2.9%-8.2%). Table 5 shows early Borrelia infection after a tick bite associated with tick infection with Borrelia, tick engorgement and tick attachment time reported by the participant. Among cases with a Borrelia-positive tick, the risk for development of an EM was 4.4%, the risk of seroconversion was 5.9%, and the risk for development of either EM or seroconversion was 9.0%. Cases with a Borrelia-positive tick had a substantially and significantly higher risk of developing EM or seroconversion (odds ratio 4.8, p-value 0.03), and of seroconversion alone (odds ratio 11.1, p-value 0.04). For the development of EM alone, a statistically significant association could not be shown (table 5). Tick engorgement and tick attachment time reported by the participant were not significantly associated with Borrelia infection after a tick bite. Additionally, cases with other self- reported symptoms that could be indicative of Borrelia infection, such as newly n % of ti cks (%) of species per genus Developmental stage Larva 4 1.3% Nymph 167 53.2% Adult 135 43.0% Unengorged 35.0% Partially engorged 114 36.3% Fully 64 314 ticks obtained from 293 participants. * See supplemental table S1 for Borrelia-positive ticks by developmental stage and engorgement of 314 ticks obtained from 293 participants. 144Section III: The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands emerged headache, tingling sensation in limbs, or itching (as observed in table 4), were analyzed as an outcome group together with the cases that developed EM or seroconversion. This analysis did not yield any statistically significant associations with tick infection with Borrelia, tick engorgement or tick attachment time. Follow-up of cases with erythema migrans at baseline Roughly two third (66%) of the 283 cases that consulted their physician for an EM at baseline, reported that they had noticed a tick prior to their EM. Among the EM cases that had noticed a tick bite, the reported durations of tick attachment varied between one hour and fourteen days. Half of these cases (55%) reported that the tick had been removed within 24 hours (figure 3). All cases with EM were treated with antibiotics at baseline, in accordance with the national medical guidelines for treatment of Lyme borreliosis [27]. Seropositive outcomes of the C6 ELISA, the IgM and IgG immunoblots for Borrelia-specific antibodies in simultaneously tested paired serum samples of all cases are shown in figure 5. Among 256 EM cases with serological of reported tick attachment times from 361 tick bite cases and 283 erythema migrans cases, of which respectively 36 and 37 cases did not report attachment time.1458A prospective study among patients presenting at the general practitioner with a tick bite or erythema migrans tested negative for Borrelia-specific antibodies at baseline and remained negative at follow-up in the immunoblot as well as in the C6-ELISA. Fourteen EM cases (5.5%) had serological evidence of an early Borrelia infection. Twelve of these cases seroconverted only in the IgM immunoblot, one case seroconverted in the IgG immunoblot and the C6 ELISA, and one case seroconverted only in the C6 ELISA. Seventy-three EM cases (28.5%) tested positive for Borrelia-specific antibodies at baseline and at follow-up. Seroreversion was observed in seven cases (2.7%), meaning that the baseline serum tested positive and the follow-up serum tested negative, which may be caused by antibiotic treatment for EM [28]. Self-reported symptoms during the preceding two weeks, as reported by EM cases at baseline and follow-up, are presented in table 4. Among the 273 EM cases with physician-confirmed clinical follow-up, three cases (1%) reported persisting symptoms at three months follow-up, after antibiotic treatment for EM at baseline. One case was referred to the neurologist for persisting myalgia, joint pain and headache. A second case reported tingling sensations, and continuing expansion of the EM despite treatment. The third case reported persisting flu like symptoms. Both the second and third case received additional antibiotic treatment, two weeks after initial treatment for the EM from their general practitioner. Figure 4. Ranked scatter plot of tick attachment times from 274 tick bite cases that did not receive antibiotics at baseline, excluding twenty cases (7%) that did not report tick attachment time.Fourteen cases had evidence of early Borrelia infection (erythema migrans or seroconversion) within three months after a tick bite, of which two cases did not report attachment time.146Section III: The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands The analysis of self-reported symptoms reported by EM cases at baseline and at three months follow-up (table 4) showed a statistically significantly higher frequency of headache at baseline (22.0%) than at follow-up (17.9%), and a higher frequency of an indistinct rash at the tick bite site at baseline (10.1%) than at follow-up (6.3%), and a lower frequency of impaired concentration at baseline (6.5%) than at follow-up (8.3%). For the other reported symptoms, no statistically significant differences were found between baseline and follow-up. A comparison at baseline of EM cases with tick bite cases shows that EM cases report headache more often (22.0%) than tick bite cases (10.4%). For the other reported symptoms, no statistically significant differences were found between EM cases and tick bite cases at IgM** and IgG*** immunoblot for Borrelia-specific antibodies in simultaneously tested paired serum samples, collected at enrolment and at follow-up after three months. * The C6 ELISA test was considered positive if the ELISA index scored 1.10.** The IgM immunoblot was considered positive if there was reactivity to the 22 kDa band, together with at least one of the following specific bands: 15-20, 22, 30-39, and 41 kDa.*** The IgG immunoblot was considered positive if at least four reactive bands were present including at least one of the following specific bands: 17, 22, 39, 58 and 92 kDa.1478A prospective study among patients presenting at the general practitioner with a tick bite or erythema migrans Discussion As the incidence of general practitioner consultations for tick bites and EM in the Netherlands have increased markedly during the past decade[2-4], understanding and quantification of the risk of infection after a tick bite are required. In the current study, one out of forty participants (7/274 = 2.6%) developed an EM within three months after a tick bite, which can be considered as a substantial risk. This was under the conditions that 29% of the ticks tested positive for Borrelia, and 57% of the subjects reported tick removal within 24 hours. A lower risk of 0.7% (1/146) was estimated by Jacobs et al. from a smaller study between 2004 and 2006 in the Netherlands. However, their tick infection rate was lower (20%), and the majority (84%) of their subjects reported tick removal within 24 hours [17]. According to similar studies performed during the past decade in Western Europe, risk estimates for development of EM after a tick bite vary between 0.3% (1/341) in Sweden (14/269) in Switzerland[15]. Risk estimates within this range are also observed in the United States. According to a meta-analysis of four clinical trials on antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of Lyme borreliosis, performed in the North Eastern states of Connecticut and New York, the pooled risk of Lyme borreliosis after an Ixodes scapularis tick bite was 2.2% (12/539), without prophylactic antibiotics [26]. Although prophylactic antibiotic treatment can prevent most Lyme borreliosis after detected tick bites[11], the high NNT poses a substantial disadvantage. Aiming to explore ways to reduce the NNT, we investigated tick-screening instruments such as tick testing for infection with Borrelia and assessment of the duration of the tick's blood meal. Our data suggest that tick testing for Borrelia infection may be useful in the assessment of an individual's risk, as we observed a statistically significant higher risk of developing EM or seroconversion combined and of seroconversion alone, among cases with a Borrelia-positive tick (odds ratio 4.8 and 11.1 respectively, table 5). The risk for development of EM alone was elevated, but did not reach statistical significance in our logistic regression model. Tick engorgement and self-estimated tick attachment time also yielded elevated but non-significant risks for Borrelia infection in our logistic regression model. Non-significantly elevated risk estimates for Borrelia-positive ticks, and for longer duration of tick attachment were also reported from other studies on the risk for development of Borrelia infection [14- 16]. To some extent, this lack of statistically significant predictors of Borrelia infection may be due to insufficient numbers of enrolled cases or insufficient accuracy of the measures. During the spring of 2013, we started a randomized controlled intervention study, investigating the efficacy of 148Section III: The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the NetherlandsTable 4.

The rationale for this effort, supplementary to the outcomes of North American studies[11], will be that Europe has different transmission dynamics than North America, as Lyme borreliosis in Europe is transmitted by Ixodes ricinus, and caused mainly by other species from the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group, such as B. afzelii and B. garini. Through our tick bite notification website [29], we aim to enroll approximately 2500 tick bitten participants within four years for this upcoming nationwide study on the efficacy of prophylaxis after a tick bite, randomly assigning the tick bite participants to a treated and untreated group. This amount of participants should provide sufficient power to assess the extent to which NNT can be reduced by tick screening criteria, for instance only prescribing prophylaxis if the tick is infected and if tick engorgement is above a certain threshold. Further understanding is also needed on the development of Borrelia infection after the bite of a tick that tested negative for Borrelia, or after short tick attachment duration. We observed Borrelia infection in 2% (3/149) of the cases with a Borrelia-negative tick, in 3% (2/74) of our cases with a tick bite with a low degree of tick engorgement, and in 4% (6/153) of the tick bite cases who reported an attachment duration below the 24-hours tick-to-host transmission threshold for Borrelia (table 5). One explanation for development of Borrelia infection after the bite of a Borrelia-negative tick, may be that these ticks contained Borrelia species that are not detected by our assays, because the assays were not sensitive enough or because the human blood meal present in some ticks could have inhibited the PCR. However, since the infection rates were alike among ticks with different degrees of engorgement, the blood meal probably did not inhibit the PCR. Another hypothesis could be that the tick may have injected the major portion or even all of its bacterial charge during the blood meal. In addition, we cannot exclude the possibility of incorrect diagnosis of EM by the physician in two of these three cases with a Borrelia-negative tick, who did not seroconvert but did report an EM at follow-up. Nevertheless, infection may have been transmitted through a different tick bite, which may have gone unnoticed. Other tick bites shortly before or during the follow-up period were reported by 1/3 cases who developed Borrelia infection after the bite of a Borrelia- negative tick, 1/6 cases with a <24-hours tick attachment time, and 0/2 cases with a tick bite with a low degree of engorgement. However, it is estimated that one third, up to two thirds of tick bites go unnoticed [12,13]. Accordingly, 34% of the cases who enrolled with an EM in our study did not recall a preceding tick bite. Tick attachment times shorter than 24 hours were also reported by half of our 246 cases that enrolled with an EM and recalled a tick bite shortly before the EM (figure 3).

The proportion of Borrelia species identified in Borrelia-positive ticks from our tick bite cases was similar to reports on Borrelia species identified in field ticks in the Netherlands[19]. Among the six cases who developed Borrelia infection after the bite of a Borrelia-positive tick, the Borrelia species from 2/6 ticks were identified 4/6 ticks contained B. burgdorferi sensu lato, which could not be typed further (table 1). Proportions of identified Borrelia species did not differ with statistical significance between ticks of cases who developed Borrelia infection and Borrelia-positive ticks of cases who did not develop Borrelia infection (results not shown). Neither was there sufficient statistical power to investigate associations between Borrelia species and symptoms. The rising incidence of tick bites and Borrelia infections in the Netherlands, poses a considerable threat to public health. However, there is also substantial exposure to other tick-borne microorganisms, as ticks in the Netherlands can also be infected with a wide variety of established or potentially pathogenic microorganisms, such as though none of our tick bite cases reported acute overt symptoms that would indicate a corresponding illness, we plan further analyses for tick infection with Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Rickettsia, Babesia, and Bartonella species, serological evidence of exposure, and associations with symptoms. A comparison of self-reported symptoms in our study showed that EM cases were more likely to report headache at baseline than tick bite cases (table 4). Within the group of EM cases, the frequencies of headache and of indistinct rashes were higher at baseline than at follow-up, and there was a lower frequency of impaired concentration at baseline than at follow-up. Furthermore, tick bite cases with early Borrelia infection were more likely to have newly emerged symptoms such as headache, tingling sensations in limbs, and itching (table 4). These observations are in line with other studies reporting symptoms associated with early Lyme borreliosis, which are mainly non-specific and frequent in the general population [13,33,34]. Our cases were asked to report their symptoms through the questionnaires at baseline and at follow-up. Confirmation by the physician was requested for all reported clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis, but as the other self-reported symptoms were not verified, these data should be interpreted with some caution. Remarkably, fifteen cases (5%) who enrolled with an EM also provided a tick at baseline (figure 2). Seven of these patients were enrolled and confirmed later by the physician as EM case, having a concurrent tick bite at baseline. The remaining eight EM cases presented an 152Section III: The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands earlier removed tick, which they had stored to bring it along for the physician. As we did not provide the general practitioners with a case-definition for EM, the confirmation of EM was based on the physicians' expertise and ability to discriminate an EM from other types of rashes. EM was the only physician-confirmed clinical sign of Lyme borreliosis observed in this study. Tick bite cases and their physicians did not report early neuroborreliosis or borrelial lymphocytoma that could be related to the tick bite at enrolment. As our study comprised a follow-up period of three months after the tick bite, observing rare events such as disseminated Lyme borreliosis was unlikely. For epidemiological analysis of the risk of Borrelia infection after a tick bite, we deviated from the regular medical serological diagnostic practice, in which serology is normally not recommended after a tick bite or to confirm EM [27]. 28.5% of our EM cases and 10.9% of tick bite cases tested positive for Borrelia- specific antibodies at baseline and at follow-up after three months without a clear in- or decrease of antibody levels, which provided no discrimination between recent and old Borrelia infection. Among our EM cases, only 5.5% seroconverted, and seroreversion was observed in seven 2.7%, meaning that the baseline serum tested positive and the follow-up serum tested negative. Most likely antibiotic treatment for EM may have influenced the development of an antibody response [28]. This illustrates the low sensitivity of serology in the early stages of Lyme borreliosis[35], which is why serology is not recommended after a tick bite or to confirm EM. In regular medical serological diagnostic practice, a positive or borderline ELISA assay outcome requires confirmation by IgM or IgG immunoblot. However, in our study seroconversion with any of these assays was considered evidence of an early Borrelia infection. Seroconversion in the C6 ELISA, without confirmation in the Immunoblot, was observed in one tick bite case who developed EM (case# 2 in table 1), and in three tick bite cases who did not develop EM within the follow-up period (case# 9, #12, #13 in table 1). This also occurred in one case who enrolled with an EM (C6 ELISA index score 0.44 at baseline, and 2.64 at follow-up, IgM immunoblot remained borderline and IgG immunoblot remained negative). Antibodies against C6 are of particular diagnostic relevance because they are regarded highly specific (91-100%). [36-38] In Europe, the C6 ELISA is reactive in 20-100% of EM patients depending on the duration of the rash. Among the C6 seropositive EM patients however, IgG responses are not always detected in immunoblot indicating that C6 reactivity is an early serological marker for Borrelia infection [23,39].1538A prospective study among patients presenting at the general practitioner with a tick bite or erythema migrans Patients younger than six years of age were not eligible for participation, due to ethical considerations with regard to the required blood withdrawals for our study. Although there are no nationwide data on the occurrence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis among children younger than six years of age, this group of young children do not appear to be at high risk of tick bites, according to the reported age-specific occurrence of Lyme borreliosis in the United States [40] and Europe[41,42]. Therefore, we do not expect that our estimate for the risk of infection after a tick bite will be biased substantially through the exclusion of this age group. Our study was designed to enroll 1500 participants within one year, which appeared feasible based on expected median numbers of 17.7 tick bite patients per physician and 5.8 EM patients per physician per year, as estimated from earlier questionnaires among all general practitioners in the Netherlands in 2005. [3] Based on the registered number of tick bite patients and EM patients on the weekly scoring cards, we found that half of the eligible patients were not invited.

Methods We used 3,525 single tick bite reports from three large prospective studies on the transmission risk of tick-borne pathogens to humans, with 50 reports of Lyme borreliosis during the follow-up period, among 1,973 reports with known outcome. A structural equation model was applied to estimate the risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite, and quantify the influence of: developmental stage of the tick, detection of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. DNA in the tick by PCR, tick engorgement, patient-estimated duration of tick attachment, and patient age. Results The overall risk of developing Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite was 2.6% with:- Lyme borreliosis was 14.4% (95%CI 6.8%-24.6%) after one tick bite of a substantially engorged tick that tested positive for Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. DNA, which corresponds to one new case of Lyme borreliosis per 7 (95%CI 4 - 15) of such tick bites. Conclusions An individual's risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite can be predicted with tick engorgement, patient-estimated duration of tick attachment, and detection of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. DNA in the tick.1619Predicting the risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite, using a structural equation model Introduction Lyme borreliosis is a tick-borne disease caused by bacteria of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group (hereafter referred to as Borrelia). The most common clinical manifestation of Lyme borreliosis is erythema migrans, an expanding skin lesion indicating early localized infection at the site of the tick bite. Late and more serious Lyme borreliosis can present with skin, neurological, musculoskeletal and cardiac manifestations [1]. The incidence of Lyme borreliosis has increased markedly in several regions of Europe[2]. To aid development of prevention strategies against Lyme borreliosis, understanding and quantification of the risk of developing Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite are required. The risk of infection with Borrelia after a tick bite depends on several factors, one of these being the prevalence of Borrelia in ticks. Ticks have four life stages: eggs, larva, nymph and adult. After hatching from the eggs, ticks need a blood meal from a vertebrate before dropping off to moult to the next stage or to lay eggs in the case of an adult female. During a blood meal from an infected animal, ticks can become infected with Borrelia, and during the subsequent blood meals the bacteria can be transmitted to new hosts. [3] The tick infection rate rises with its developmental stage. Among field collected host-seeking ticks, less than 1% of larvae are infected, about to 30% of the nymph, and 15% to 40% of adults [4-6]. Another factor is the transmission of Borrelia from ticks to humans, which increases with the duration of the tick's blood meal, and can be quantified as patient-estimated duration of the tick bite or as degree of engorgement of the tick. As described for the North American vector Ixodes scapularis, detectable transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto requires attachment to the host for at least 24 hours in animal experiments [7, 8]. In Europe, Lyme borreliosis is transmitted by Ixodes ricinus and caused mainly by other species of Borrelia such as B. afzelii and B. garini. Transmission of B. afzelii has been reported within the first 24 hours of Ixodes ricinus attachment in an animal experiment[9, 10]. And tick attachment durations shorter than 24 hours have been reported by patients with Lyme borreliosis in human observational studies in Europe. [11-14] The recommended standard practice after tick removal is watchful waiting; to monitor the skin for development of erythema migrans or other clinical symptoms indicative of Lyme borreliosis. As an alternative, the medical guidelines in the United States 2006 [15] and the Netherlands since 2013[16] mention prophylactic antibiotic treatment of tick bites with a single 200-mg dose of doxycycline administered within 72 hours after tick removal. Based on a study from the United States prophylactic treatment is estimated to be 91% effective (95%CI 42% - 100%), and that about fifty people bitten by a tick would 162Section III: The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands need treatment to prevent one case of Lyme borreliosis.[17] We aim to explore to what extent the number needed to treat could be reduced through identification of patients with high risk of developing Lyme borreliosis. In the current article we model the risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite, and we investigate the effect of possible predictors such as the developmental stage of the tick, tick engorgement, detection of Borrelia DNA in the tick, patient-estimated duration of tick attachment, and patient age. The estimated risks for Lyme borreliosis from our prediction model might be useful in clinical practice to identify persons with a higher risk of developing Lyme borreliosis. Methods Data description of three nationwide prospective studies To obtain sufficient numbers of subjects for estimation of the effect of the predictors of the risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite, data of three nationwide prospective studies on the transmission risk of tick-borne pathogens to humans in the Netherlands between 2007 and 2013 were combined. It was assumed that the effect of the predictors on risk of Lyme borreliosis did not change between 2007 and 2013. Appendix 1 provides a table with summary measures of the combined dataset, which contains 3,525 single tick bite reports, 50 reports of Lyme borreliosis during the follow-up period, and 1,552 reports with unknown outcome due to loss to follow-up. Appendix 4 contains the full dataset. Only participants who did not report other tick bites during the six weeks before or after enrollment, and participants who did not report prophylactic antibiotic treatment for a tick bite at enrolment were included. Study TR1213 was a web-based national survey on www .tekenradar.nl, through which civilians reported 3,191 tick bites between March 2012 and March 2013, with 42 reports of Lyme borreliosis within three months follow-up. [18, 19] Study GP0708 was a nationwide prospective study among 260 patients with tick bites who consulted one of 307 enrolling general practitioners in 2007 and 2008, with 3 reports of Lyme borreliosis within three months follow-up [12]. Study EP0911 was a prospective study performed among 244 patients with tick bites who visited one of fourteen medical emergency posts for consultation of a general practitioner outside office hours from 2009 to 2011, with 5 reports of Lyme borreliosis within two months follow-up. All study participants were asked to fill out questionnaires at enrollment and at follow-up, including questions on duration of tick attachment in the skin, the number of tick bites, and development of Lyme borreliosis. In TR1213 and GP0708, patient reported development of Lyme borreliosis was 1639Predicting the risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite, using a structural equation model confirmed through an additional questionnaire sent to their general practitioner. Our outcome measure Lyme borreliosis within three months after a tick bite was categorized as \"physician-confirmed erythema migrans\" or \"physician-confirmed disseminated Lyme borreliosis\" when patient-reported Lyme borreliosis was confirmed by the general practitioner through that additional questionnaire. In EP0911, and for participants of TR1213 and GP0708 whose general practitioner did not respond to the questionnaire, patient-reported erythema migrans combined with prescribed antibiotics was categorized as \"probable erythema migrans\". Our outcome measure Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite contained 29 physician-confirmed erythema migrans, and 21 probable erythema migrans with antibiotic treatment. Ticks removed from the skin were submitted to our study laboratory at the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment of the Netherlands through regular mail, and examined under a microscope to determine tick species, developmental stage, gender, using standard keys [20]. Trained laboratory employees categorized the degree of engorgement of the tick as low, moderate, or substantial engorgement through visual inspection. No other tick species than Ixodes ricinus were identified in GP0708. [12] The species of 187 ticks in EP0911 were not recorded during visual inspection by our trained laboratory employees for tick stage and engorgement. During cleaning of the TR1213 data, one Dermacentor marginatus tick, one Ixodes hexagonus, and two Dermacentor reticulatis ticks had been excluded from the dataset. Total DNA was extracted from the collected ticks, to test the tick lysates for DNA of Borrelia. A duplex quantitative (Q)PCR using fragments of the outer membrane protein A (OspA) gene and the flagellin B (FlaB) gene as targets [21] was applied to tick lysates from TR1213 and from EP0911 collected in 2011. A real-time QPCR on the OspA gene[22] and by reverse line blotting (RLB)[23, 24] was applied to tick lysates from GP0708 and from EP0911 collected in 2009. Tick lysates from EP0911 ticks collected in 2010 were analyzed by RLB [23, 24]. In GP0708 all participants (or their parents / guardians) gave written informed consent for analysis of a paired blood sample (blood sample data were not used for the current manuscript), and the study protocol of GP0708 was approved by the medical ethics review committee of the University Medical Centre in Utrecht, the Netherlands (number 07-032/K). EP0911 and TR1213 did not involve burdensome procedures (e.g. collection of blood samples). The Medical Ethics Review Committee UMC Utrecht declared that the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act does not apply to TR1213 (number 15-734/C). The data of these three studies were anonymized before data analysis. 164Section III: The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands Structural equation model We aimed to quantify the risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite, and to quantify the influence of characteristics of the tick (bite) and the person's age. Some of these characteristics interact with each other, so we applied structural equation modeling where all (causal) relations between variables are combined in one model, which allows for natural sequence of causation, as opposed to for instance multivariable regression analysis. Figure 1 shows the structure of our equation model, with our outcome measure Lyme borreliosis as the central variable, and the variables about the person (age) and the tick (the tick's developmental stage, engorgement, attachment duration, and whether DNA of Borrelia is detected in the tick). The arrows 'a' to 'g' between these variables in figure 1 depict (causal) relations between variables. We assumed that the risk of Lyme borreliosis increases with the patient- reported tick attachment duration (arrow a) or with tick engorgement (arrow b) [9, 10]. Additionally, we assumed that engorgement increases with rising patient- reported tick attachment duration (arrow c)[25], and that engorgement may differ per developmental stage of the tick (arrow d). We further assumed that older study participants report longer tick attachment durations than younger participants (arrow e) [26, 27]. We assumed that the risk of Lyme borreliosis is higher when DNA of Borrelia is detected in the tick (arrow f)[12, 13, 28, 29], and that the probability of a tick carrying Borrelia is associated with the developmental stage of the tick (arrow g) [4-6]. Through explorative analyses of each variable and associations between the variables, several conventional statistical models (e.g. time-to-event model, proportional odds model) were applied for specific parts of the model, and assembled into one structural equation model. For each sub-model we checked how well the associations were described and the outcome was predicted. The cumulative risk of Lyme borreliosis is described by a proportional hazards model with a Weibull baseline hazard function. The baseline hazard depends on the tick's engorgement and the patient-estimated tick attachment duration. The complementary log-log of the risk of Lyme borreliosis is a linear function of the log tick attachment duration. The tick infection with Borrelia enters the equation via a proportional hazards term. Explorative analyses of our data indicated that the tick attachment duration could be well described by a log-Normal distribution that also allows for durations that were reported as an interval. Explorative analyses of our data also indicated that the mean log attachment duration is a linear function of age. The participant's age (reported as integers) is described by a categorical distribution (Figure 1). The tick infection with Borrelia is described by a Bernoulli distribution, having one parameter, the prevalence of Borrelia in ticks in our dataset. The logit of the probability of tick 1659Predicting the risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite, using a structural equation model infection with Borrelia is a function of the tick's developmental stage, which is described by a categorical distribution (larva, nymph, adult). The probability of each engorgement class is described by a proportional odds logistic regression model, where the logit of the cumulative probabilities is a cubic function of the log attachment duration, with a tick stage specific intercept, and one cut point to describe the log odds for transition from engorgement class 'moderate' to 'substantial'. Data preparation for combined analysis and data imputation We used a Bayesian approach, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, to estimate the parameters. The advantage of this approach is that our complex structural equation model could be formulated in a straightforward manner. Besides, missing predictive variables were automatically imputed and it also naturally coped with uncertainties in the combined dataset. We assumed that the missing value mechanism for the predictive variables was \"missing completely at random\" (MCAR), meaning that the probability of a missing value (in tick stage, engorgement, tick infection, tick attachment duration, or age) was unrelated to any other variables. Missing values were sampled from the probability distributions that we assigned to these variables as described in de section \"Structural equation model\". We put non-informative priors on all parameters and generated 10,000 posterior samples for each parameter. Convergence was checked visually. All data pre- and post-processing were done in R. Computations were done in JAGS [30] (see JAGS model code in appendix 2). Participants with unknown outcome \"Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite\" due to loss to follow-up within three months after enrollment (n = 1,552) were omitted from estimation of the risk of Lyme borreliosis. However, their other available data (tick stage, engorgement, tick infection, tick attachment duration, age) were used for parameter estimation to make inference about Figure 1 Variables [blocks] and assumed (causal) relations [arrows a to g] between predictors of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite in the structural equation model. c b d Lyme borreliosis Tick engorgemen t Person's ag e Tick a/g425 achment Tick st age Tick infec/g415on with B. burgdorferi s.l. a f e g 166Section III: The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands missing data. The patient-reported duration of tick attachment in the skin was available as real valued data (hours) as well as interval censored data, depending on the study. For the TR1213 study, the duration was only provided in intervals (0-12 hours, 12-24 hours, and >24 hours). For the GP0708 study, the duration was provided as real valued data (hours) as well as in intervals (<24 hours, >24 hours). For the EP0911 study, the duration was provided only in intervals (0-12 hours, 12-24 hours, >24 hours). For combined analysis, these patient-reported attachment durations were handled as follows: if the duration was reported as a real value (in hours), then this value was taken as is. If the duration was reported as an interval, the lower- and upper bound were specified in hours and the duration itself was set to a missing value. If no attachment duration was reported, the lower bound was set to 1 hour and the upper bound was set to 240 hours. The missing duration values were subsequently imputed during the estimation procedure by sampling from the log-Normal distribution with the specified lower- and upper boundaries. Explorative analyses showed that the patient-reported hours of tick attachment centered toward whole days (24, 48, 72 or 96 hours) for the TR1213 study, which occurred much less in GP0708 and EP0911. We therefore widened the interval with 25% (lower and upper boundary) around the patient-reported hours of tick attachment in TR1213, and with 1% for the GP0708 and EP0911 studies. Results Characteristics of participants and their tick (bite) Table 1 shows the occurrence in our dataset of developmental stage of the tick, categories of tick engorgement, categories of patient-estimated duration of tick attachment, detection of Borrelia DNA in ticks, and age of the participant. Most ticks removed from our study participants were nymphs (68%), or adult ticks (29%), and a small proportion of the ticks were larvae (3%). The duration of tick attachment, as estimated by the participants, ranged from 0.2 hours to 16 days with a median of 13.5 hours, and a mean of 27 hours (95%CI: 1.3 - 135.0). Tick attachment duration shorter than 12 hours were reported by 46% of the participants, and tick attachment durations longer than four days were rarely reported (4.8%). Per every 10-year increase of a person's age, the mean duration of tick attachment slightly increased with 1.06 hours (95%CI 1.04 - 1.09). Of the ticks in this combined dataset, 14% were substantially engorged. Among these participants with a substantially engorged tick, the mean tick attachment duration was 69.2 hours (95%CI 1.9 - 323.3). Most ticks were categorized as moderate (43%) or low (43%) engorgement, and the mean tick attachment 1679Predicting the risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite, using a structural equation model durations among these participants were 25.4 hours (95%CI 1.4 - 105.2) and 15.1 hours (95%CI 1.4 - 69.8) respectively. Figure 2 shows how the degrees of tick engorgement correspond to patient-estimated duration of tick attachment per developmental stage of the tick. The overall probability of Borrelia DNA detection in ticks removed from humans was 21.6% (95%CI 19.9% - 23.5%) (table 1). The probability of DNA detection rose with the developmental stage, from 7.4% for larvae ticks. Compared to larvae, adult ticks removed from humans were five times more likely to test positive for Borrelia DNA (hazard ratio 5.0, 95%CI 1.8 - 13.2) with statistical significance, as well as nymphs compared to larvae (hazard ratio 3.4, 95%CI 1.2 - 9.1). 0102030405060708090100Larv a Low Moderat e SubstantialNymph 13 61 22 44 89 61920102030405060708090100Adult 13 61 22 44 89 61 92Ticks tage unknown Tick attachment duration (hours)Tick engorgement class probability (% ) Figure 2.

Hence, when a tick tested positive for Borrelia, the risk of Lyme borreliosis increased from 5.4% (95%CI 3.2% - 7.8%) during the first 12 hours of tick attachment, to 13.5% (95%CI 7.4% - 23.5%) after four days (lower graph in figure 3, and appendix 3). Per degree of tick engorgement, the risk of Lyme borreliosis increased with statistical significance from 1.4% (95%CI 0.7% - for low - 9.2%) for substantially engorged ticks (table 1). The difference between risk estimates per developmental stage of the tick and for age of the participant were not statistically significant (table 1). Estimating an individual's risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite An individual's risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite can be estimated with the probabilities in table 1 and appendix 3. To illustrate; when an adult tick is removed from the skin after a patient-estimated tick attachment duration of two to four days, the mean risk of developing Lyme borreliosis is estimated at 3.9% (95%CI 1.8% - 6.8%) (table 1, appendix 3). At the overall 2.6% risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite, one new case of Lyme borreliosis would develop per 38 (95%CI 20 - 71) tick bites. The highest risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite we identified with our model, was 14.4% (95%CI 6.8%-24.6%) after a tick bite of a substantially engorged tick that tested positive for Borrelia (see appendix 3), which corresponds to one new case of Lyme borreliosis per 7 (95%CI 4 - 15) tick bites. The occurrence of substantially engorged ticks that tested positive for Borrelia was 2.9% in our dataset. Without tick testing for DNA of Borrelia, the highest observed risk of Lyme borreliosis was 6.4% (95%CI 3.2% - 10.6%) after a tick bite of a substantially engorged adult tick (see appendix 3), which corresponds to one new case of Lyme borreliosis per 16 (95%CI 9 - 31) tick bites. The occurrence of substantially engorged adult ticks was 3.1% in our dataset. For multiple independent tick bites the probabilities of developing Lyme borreliosis after single tick bites can be combined: P total = 1 - (1 - Ptick1) x (1 - Ptick2) x ... x (1 - PtickN). For example, if two substantially engorged nymphs (both mean risk 5.3%; table 1, appendix 3) and one moderately engorged adult tick (mean risk 3.2%; table 1, appendix 3) are removed from a person's skin, the cumulative risk of developing Lyme borreliosis would be: 1 - (1 - 0.053) x (1 - 0.053) x (1 - 0.032) = 0.132 = 13.2%; or if four nymphs are removed from the skin after a patient-estimated tick attachment duration of 24 to 48 hours (each mean risk 2.8%; table 1, appendix 3), the cumulative risk of developing Lyme borreliosis would be: 1 - (1 - 0.028) x (1 - 0.028) x (1 - 0.028) x (1 - 0.028) = 0.1074 = 10.7%.1719Predicting the risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite, using a structural equation model Discussion We show that an individual's risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite can be estimated with the predictors tick engorgement, detection of DNA of Borrelia in the tick and patient-estimated duration of tick attachment. We observed a 2.6% overall risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite, which is in line with the range of risk estimates of 0.8% to 5.2% that were reported from prospective studies in Sweden, Finland and Switzerland. [13, 28, 29, 31] The relative proportions of Lyme borreliosis diagnoses in the Netherlands have recently been estimated at 95% erythema migrans, and 5% disseminated Lyme borreliosis. [32] Based on these proportions, the currently observed risk of 26 erythema migrans per 1000 recognized tick bites would translate into 1.5 (approximately one or two) additional diagnoses of disseminated Lyme borreliosis per 1000 recognized tick bites. Based on the above mentioned proportions, approximately three diagnoses of disseminated Lyme borreliosis would be expected in our dataset of 1973 tick bites with follow-up. We did not observe disseminated Lyme borreliosis diagnoses in the current study, which may be coincidence (due to insufficient numbers), or possibly because disseminated Lyme borreliosis is less likely to develop within our three month follow-up period. Not having observed development of disseminated Lyme borreliosis in the current study, and knowing that erythema migrans is often not observed preceding to disseminated Lyme borreliosis [33-36], we may have slightly underestimated the risk of developing Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite. Detection of Borrelia DNA in the tick was our strongest and statistically significant predictor for the risk of developing Lyme borreliosis. Elevated risk estimates for individuals with Borrelia-positive ticks have been reported from previous studies, although not with statistically significant risk difference, which in some studies may be due to insufficient numbers, and in some studies statistical significance had not been investigated for detection of Borrelia DNA in the tick [13, 28, 29, 31]. Counterintuitively, development of Lyme borreliosis was also observed after bites by ticks in which Borrelia DNA was not detected (1.4% risk of developing Lyme borreliosis, 95%CI 0.7% - 2.9%). This could be due to other unnoticed tick bites, as it is estimated that around 30%-60% of all tick bites go unnoticed [11, 12, 37], or due to the fact that the sensitivity to detect Borrelia DNA in ticks is less than 100%. Unnoticed extra tick bites in our dataset may have caused a slight overestimation of the risk of Lyme borreliosis after one tick bite. However, for the clinical relevance of our estimates for a single tick bite it does not matter how many unnoticed tick bites occurred simultaneously, since 172Section III: The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands our study participants most likely have a similar chance of unnoticed tick bites as patients reporting tick bites in daily clinical practice. Before exclusion from the dataset for the current analyses, around 5% of the participants submitted more than one tick that was removed from the skin (17/299 in GP0708, 9/246 in EP0911). We assume that the prevalence of simultaneous unnoticed extra tick bites in our dataset will be much lower than the 30% to 60% unnoticed tick bites among patients with Lyme borreliosis, because detection of one tick bite will most probably incite a thorough further inspection for ticks on the body. Therefore we hypothesize that no more than 1.5% (a third of 5%) of the tick bite participants in our dataset may have had unnoticed extra simultaneous tick bites. In absence of assays for testing of ticks for Borrelia DNA, identification of the tick's developmental stage can be informative for individual risk assessment, as the infection rate with Borrelia rises with the developmental stage of ticks. However, the risk differences between developmental stages of the tick were not statistically significant, and specifically the risk estimates for larval tick bites should be considered with caution, as only 53 of our observations were larval tick bites, none of which developed erythema migrans. Among field collected host-seeking larvae, prevalence rates of B. burgdorferi DNA are typically around 1% [3-5], as transovarial (vertical) transmission of B. burgdorferi sensu lato is ineffective in Ixodes ticks[38]. However, like several other studies[39], we detected Borrelia DNA in (7.4% of 53) larvae removed from study participants. A possible explanation for this observation may be the blood meal that ticks removed from study participants had, as the spirochetes multiply rapidly in feeding infected ticks, increasing the spirochete density and thus the chance of detecting Borrelia DNA by PCR. [40] With longer durations of the tick's blood meal, the risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite increased significantly, either measured as patient-estimated tick attachment duration, or measured as tick engorgement. Elevated risk estimates for individuals with longer durations of the ticks blood meal have been reported from previous studies, although rarely with statistically significant risk difference [13, 28, 29, 31]. Both measures of the duration of the tick's blood meal have their specific limitations. Tick engorgement provides poor discrimination, specifically for tick attachment durations below 24 hours, as observed in experimental studies. [14] The reliability and accuracy of patient-estimated tick attachment time is difficult to assess. When tick bitten persons are asked to estimate the duration of the tick's blood meal, their answer will most likely be based on the most plausible moment of tick exposure and the moment that the tick bite was identified. Wilhelmsson et al. [26] compared tick engorgement (based on scutal and coxal indices calculated into hours of tick-feeding) to patient-estimated durations of 1739Predicting the risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite, using a structural equation model tick attachment. The majority of tick-bitten persons underestimated the duration of tick attachment, with the strongest underestimation among participants with tick attachment durations longer than two days. [26] Despite these difficulties in assessment of the duration of the tick's blood meal, we observed an acceptable correlation between tick engorgement and patient-estimated tick attachment duration (figure 2) in our dataset. Future refinement of this model could be aimed at investigation of the influence of the species of Borrelia in ticks. In our dataset, the detected DNA of Borrelia in ticks were not analyzed further for identification of the species. Another possibly interesting predictor to add to the model could be the load of Borrelia in the tick, as Wang et al. [41] speculated that low numbers ( 300) cells of Borrelia found in unfed field-collected ticks may represent a transmission threshold. One may speculate that heavily infected ticks may pose a higher risk of Borrelia transmission, although, in an earlier observational study by Wilhelmsson et al [13], the Borrelial load in ticks did not differ significantly between those removed by participants who later seroconverted, and those removed by participants who did not seroconvert. Gender and skin color could possibly be interesting to add to the predictors in the model, as physiological (e.g. more hairy skin or darker skin color resulting in a longer time to detection of a tick on the skin), behavioral, or immunological aspects may influence differences in time to detection of a tick on the skin. Wilhelmsson et al reported that men took more time to detect and remove a skin-attached tick, compared to women. [26] Lastly, we aimed to model the risk of Lyme borreliosis after an Ixodes ricinus tick bite, although the species of 187 ticks from EP0911 were not recorded. A bite from another tick species than Ixodes ricinus, which rarely occurs in the Netherlands, would result in a different risk of Lyme borreliosis. The uncleaned TR1213 dataset contained 0.1% (4/2956) other tick species than Ixodes ricinus. As an alternative to the recommended standard practice of watchful waiting after tick removal, prophylactic antibiotic treatment of tick bites can potentially play an important role in the prevention of Lyme borreliosis [17]. Currently, we are analyzing the data from a randomized controlled intervention study through our tick bite notification website www .tekenradar.nl [18, 19], investigating the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotic treatment after a tick bite within the European setting. With our model, we aimed to identify patients with high risk of developing Lyme borreliosis. Assessment of the duration of the tick's blood meal and detection of Borrelia DNA in the tick were the best predictors for the risk of developing Lyme borreliosis in our model, with a maximum of 14.4% risk of developing Lyme borreliosis after a single tick bite of a substantially engorged tick that tested positive for Borrelia. Further research is needed to explore how such risk 174Section III: The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands assessment could be implemented for clinical decision making by physicians, since it would involve rapid testing of ticks for infection with Borrelia and estimation of tick attachment duration. To our knowledge, commercially available easy to use and affordable assays for testing of ticks for DNA of Borrelia at point of care currently do not provide suitable sensitivity or specificity for early detection of individuals with a higher risk of Lyme borreliosis. [19] To assess the duration of the tick's blood meal, specific knowledge and skills of the physicians in general practice would be required. To differentiate between low engorgement (1.4% risk) and substantial engorgement (5.5% risk), physicians training and education would be instrumental. Furthermore, the feasibility of teleconsulting, to send a picture of the tick to a trained entomologist for immediate consultation, could be explored.

Dataset is avaliable online at: http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.018180710 Molecular detection of tick-borne pathogens in humans with tick bites and Netherlands III: The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands Abstract Background Tick-borne diseases are the most prevalent vector-borne diseases in Europe. Knowledge on the incidence and clinical presentation of other tick-borne diseases than Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis is minimal, despite the high human exposure to these pathogens through tick bites. Using molecular detection techniques, the frequency of tick-borne infections after exposure through tick bites was estimated. Methods Ticks, blood samples and questionnaires on health status were collected from patients that visited their general practitioner with a tick bite or erythema migrans in 2007 and 2008. The presence of several tick-borne pathogens in 314 ticks and 626 blood samples of this cohort were analyzed using PCR-based methods. Using multivariate logistic regression, associations were explored between pathogens detected in blood and self-reported symptoms at enrolment and during a three-month follow-up period. Results Half of the ticks removed from s. l. positive ticks, 33% carried another pathogen from a different genus. In blood of sixteen out of 626 persons with tick bites or erythema migrans, DNA was detected from Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis 7), Anaplasma phagocytophilum Babesia divergens (n = 3), Borrelia miyamotoi (n = 1) and Borrelia burgdorferi s. l. (n = 1). None of these sixteen individuals reported any overt symptoms that would indicate a corresponding illness during the three-month follow-up period. No associations were found between the presence of pathogen DNA in blood and; self-reported symptoms, with pathogen DNA in the corresponding ticks (n = 8), reported tick attachment duration, tick engorgement, or antibiotic treatment at enrolment. Conclusions Based on molecular detection techniques, the probability of infection with a tick-borne pathogen other than Lyme spirochetes after a tick bite is roughly 2.4%, in the Netherlands. Similarly, among patients with erythema migrans, the probability of a co-infection with another tick-borne pathogen is approximately 18510Molecular detection of tick-borne pathogens in humans with tick bites and erythema migrans 2.7%. How often these infections cause disease symptoms or to what extend co-infections affect the course of Lyme borreliosis needs further investigations. Author Summary Two most common tick-borne diseases in Europe are Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis. Ticks transmit many more pathogens, diseases such as anaplasmosis, babesiosis, rickettsiosis and neoehrlichiosis. These diseases are seldom diagnosed, due to their mild and non-characteristic symptoms, but also due to lack of awareness and availability of diagnostic tests. Using molecular detection techniques (polymerase chain reaction or PCR), we estimated the frequency of tick-borne infections in humans after a tick bite and in patients with the first symptoms of Lyme borreliosis, an erythema migrans. About half of the ticks that fed on humans carried one or more tick-borne pathogens, and approximately 2.5% of people that were bitten by ticks were infected with a tick-borne pathogen other than or tick-borne encephalitis. tick-borne pathogen with an erythema migrans was also approximately 2.5%. Based on these findings, we estimated the incidence of tick-borne infections other than Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands. How often these infections cause disease or to what extend co-infections affect the course of Lyme borreliosis needs further investigations.18710Molecular detection of tick-borne pathogens in humans with tick bites and erythema migrans Introduction Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent tick-borne disease in humans, and is caused by spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex [1-3]. The most common clinical manifestation of early localized Lyme borreliosis is erythema migrans (EM), an expanding skin lesion occurring after several days or weeks at the site of the tick bite. Other sporadically reported symptoms in this early stage of disease are malaise and viral-like symptoms. Disseminated Lyme borreliosis displays more severe manifestations that can involve a patient's nervous system, joints, skin, and in rare cases the heart [1-3]. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most common tick-borne central nervous system infection caused by the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Its clinical spectrum ranges from fever to mild meningitis and severe meningoencephalitis with or without paralysis [4]. In several European countries, there have been marked increases in the incidence of Lyme borreliosis and TBE over the past ten to twenty years [5-7]. In the Netherlands, a retrospective study among general practitioners has shown a continuing increase in consultations for tick bites and EM between 1994 and 2009 [8, 9]. The increasing number of tick bites, adding up to 1.1 million tick bites in 2009[8], poses a growing risk of disseminated Lyme borreliosis and perhaps also of other tick-borne diseases. In the Netherlands, Ixodes ricinus ticks transmit several Borrelia burgdorferi s. l. genospecies, but are also infected with a variety of established or potentially pathogenic microorganisms, such as Borrelia These ticks often carry multiple pathogens; at least one-third of the I. ricinus ticks carrying B. burgdorferi s. l. are co-infected with one or more pathogens from a different genus[12], implying frequent exposure and possibly subsequent infection with several pathogens when humans are bitten by ticks. Remarkably , little is known about the incidences and clinical presentations of other tick-borne diseases than Lyme borreliosis and TBE. In general, disease caused by these other tick-borne pathogens, are associated with febrile illnesses with fever, headache, myalgia and malaise [16-21]. However, in immunocompromised patients chronic infections with severe clinical manifestations and even mortality have been described [17, 18, 21, 22]. In the Netherlands, one single case of anaplasmosis has been reported in 1999[23], and one case of B . miyamotoi disease in an immunocompromised patient in 2012[18]. It has been suggested that the severity of disease in Lyme borreliosis is affected by co-infections with other tick-borne pathogens [24- 28]. Therefore, burgdorferi s. l. with different tick-borne pathogens may possibly contribute to the high variety of clinical manifestations that are associated with Lyme borreliosis.188Section III: The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands Several reasons can be appointed for the absence in reporting of tick-borne diseases other than Lyme borreliosis and TBE, and the diagnosis of co-infections with other pathogens in Lyme borreliosis patients. Firstly , most of these infections might be self-limiting without overt or characteristic symptoms, often a clear-cut case definition of patients infected with one of these pathogens has not been established yet. Secondly , a poor performance or non-existence of supportive laboratory tests in routine medical microbiological settings. Thirdly , the lack of awareness among health professionals. Here, we aim to investigate i) whether infection with tick-borne pathogens other than B. burgdorferi s. l. can be shown in patients with early localized Lyme borreliosis and in people exposed to tick bites in the Netherlands, and to determine ii) the clinical picture of patients with DNA of tick-borne pathogens in their blood. Our approach is to test for the presence of nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) of the specific pathogens in human blood through amplification with PCR, especially since currently; there is no other specific laboratory diagnostic to detect infection with most of these tick-borne pathogens. Compared to DNA amplification with PCR, available serological tests generally have a low specificity and or sensitivity , particularly during the early phase of infection. In addition, although culturing is considered the most reliable method in proving the presence of microorganisms, it is time consuming, costly and often not possible for all pathogens. Materials and Methods Study design, ticks, human samples and questionnaires Ticks, EDTA-blood and questionnaire data were available from a nationwide prospective observational study among patients who consulted one of 307 enrolling general practitioners for a tick bite or EM between May 2007 and December 2008 in the Netherlands, as described in detail [29]. All participants gave written informed consent, all minors who participated in the study had consent given from a parent/guardian, and the study protocol (number 07-032/K) was approved by the medical ethics committee of the University Medical Centre in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Patients were not eligible for participation when they were younger than six years of age, or when the tick bite had occurred outside the Netherlands. At enrolment, participants received the first set of study materials, containing a brochure about the study , an enrolment questionnaire, and materials for collection and mailing of first blood samples and removed ticks. Ticks removed from the skin were submitted in a small tube with 70% ethanol. In total, 314 ticks were obtained from 293 participants, of which 278 patients consulted 18910Molecular detection of tick-borne pathogens in humans with tick bites and erythema migrans their physician for a tick bite, and fifteen patients consulted their physician with an EM. Four ticks (1%) were larvae, 167 (53%) nymphs, 135 (43%) adult ticks, and for eight ticks, the developmental stage could not be determined, as they had been damaged too much during removal from the patient's skin. No other tick species than I. ricinus were identified. At enrolment, two tubes of blood were collected, 7 ml in a serum tube and 5 ml in an EDTA tube. Three months after enrolment, follow-up questionnaires and a consecutive 7 ml serum sample was collected from the tick bitten patients and from the EM patients after standard antibiotic treatment [29, 30]. Seven patients who consulted their physician for a tick bite and in whom EM developed within the three month follow-up duration of the prospective study , were categorized in EM patient-group of the current study . EDTA-blood samples were available for molecular testing from 335 tick bitten patients and 291 EM patients. Tick analyses for detection of tick-borne pathogens After arrival at the laboratory , ticks were stored at -20\u00b0C in ethanol. DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions extraction for ticks. After total DNA extraction from ticks and amplification by PCR, reverse line blotting for Borrelia-, Ehrlichia-, Anaplasma-, Rickettsia- and Babesia-species. Further identification was performed as described [11, 31]. PCR products that specifically reacted to the generic (\"catch all\") probes, but that could not be further specified to the (geno) species level were designated as \"untypeable\". Furthermore, our RLB analysis could not distinguish between B. garinii and B. bavariensis [12]. The presence of B. miyamotoi in ticks was tested by a and 312 ticks. The presence of TBEV RNA could not be screened in the tick samples, since only DNA had been extracted from these samples. Individual test results of the tick analyses were not reported to the participants or their physicians, in accordance with the informed consent form. Molecular analyses for detection of tick-borne pathogens in EDTA- blood Extraction of whole nucleic acid of the EDTA-blood samples were performed using robot-extraction (MagNA Pure Compact Extraction Robot; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) from 400 \u00b5L of EDTA-plasma (Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I; Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions in a diagnostic laboratory setting. All 626 samples were analyzed with different real-time PCRs based on various genes specific for the microorganism of interest namely; B. burgdorferi s. l., B. miyamotoi, 190Section III: The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands A. phagocytophilum, Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis, spotted fever Rickettsia's carried out LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics Nederland B.V , Almere, the Netherlands). For primers and probes, see S1 Table (supplementary data). Reactions were done in a final volume of 20 \u00b5l with iQ multiplex Powermix, 3 \u00b5l of sample and 0.2 \u00b5M for all primers and different concentrations for probes. Positive plasmid controls and negative water controls were used on every plate tested. For detection of TBEV , multiplex a reverse transcription real-time PCR was performed as described before [32]. In brief, reactions were done in a final volume of 20 \u00b5l with TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Thermo Fisher scientific, USA), 5 \u00b5l of sample and 0.2 \u00b5M for all primers and 0.2 \u00b5M probes (S1 Table) were added to the master mix and internal control was added to all the samples. With 20 min reverse transcription step at 50\u00b0C, denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s and 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s. The amplification was performed on a Roche LightCycler 480 instrument. For Babesia genospecies, we performed a conventional PCR targeting the 18S rRNA gene on all the blood samples [11], followed by sequencing. T o minimize cross contamination and false- positive results, negative controls were included in each batch tested by PCR. In addition, DNA/ RNA extraction, PCR mix preparation, sample addition, and PCR analyses were performed in separated air locked dedicated labs. On all samples that were found positive in the real-time PCR, conventional PCRs were performed for confirmation on one or more targets followed by Tris-Borate-EDTA-agarose gel-electrophoresis. PCR products were sequenced, and these were compared with reference sequences from Genbank using Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean-based (UPGMA) hierarchical clustering. Individual test results of these molecular analyses on EDTA-blood were not reported to the participants or their physicians, in accordance with the informed consent form. Statistical analyses The prevalence of microorganism DNA detection in ticks and in EDTA-blood was calculated with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) based on mid-P exact. Characteristics of persons with or without DNA detected in blood by PCR were compared in Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. W e looked for associations between DNA detected in EDTA-blood by PCR and DNA detected in available ticks from the participants, tick engorgement, patient-reported tick attachment duration, antibiotic treatment at enrolment, and patient-reported symptoms at enrolment and after three months. Using multivariate logistic regression, we explored for associations between DNA detected in blood by PCR and self-reported symptoms at enrolment and follow-up. All reported clinical symptoms (at enrolment and 19110Molecular detection of tick-borne pathogens in humans with tick bites and erythema migrans follow-up) were included as predictive variables in the multivariate logistic regression models, after which the models were optimized using backwards elimination, until all predictive variables that were maintained in the model werestatistically significant contributors (p< 0.05). Statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.4 (SAS Inc.). Results Tick-borne pathogens in ticks removed from humans Table 1 shows the number of DNA sequences of the pathogens detected in 314 ticks obtained from 293 participants. Borrelia burgdorferi s. l. DNA was detected in 92 (29%) ticks, as published earlier [29]. The B. (2.3%). DNA of microorganisms of two or more genera were detected in 34 ticks (11%). Among the 92 B. burgdorferi s. l. positive ticks, 30 (33%) also carried a pathogen of a different genus. About half of the ticks (149/314, 47%) tested negative for all genera. Tick-borne pathogens in human EDTA-blood Table 2 shows the prevalence of DNA detection of tick-borne pathogens in EDTA-blood samples of 335 tick bitten patients and 291 EM patients, using various (real-time) PCRs. Only one (0.2%) of 626 blood samples tested positive for B. burgdorferi s. l. and one (0.2%) for B. miyamotoi in the real-time PCRs multiplex, both with high Ct values. In another multiplex, five blood samples (0.8%) were positive for A. phagocytophilum and seven (1.1%) for Neoehrlichia mikurensis. Three (0.5%) blood samples for Babesia genospecies yielded a sequence in conventional PCR, in which genetic analyses showed to be B. divergens. None of the samples were found positive for spotted fever Rickettsia's or TBEV . All seven of the Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis sequence yielded a partial groEL sequence and five out of seven could also be confirmed on a separate gene, namely gltA. The seven groEL are 100% identical to each other as were the five gltA sequences (Fig 1). Four out of five A . phagocytophilum positives yielded a partial groEL sequence after nested PCR. The four groEL are almost identical to each other, with just one or two mismatches. Nevertheless, all four sequences are part of zoonotic variant of the A. phagocytophilum, ecotype I [33]. Three of the tested blood samples for Babesia genospecies yielded a sequence in conventional PCR for the ribosomal 18S rRNA gene, and showed to be identical to B. divergens sequences. Extensive efforts to generate a B . miyamotoi sequence failed.

The results on B . burgdorferi s. l. have been published by Hofhuis et al. 2013 [29]. Using the observed prevalence of tick-borne pathogens in 314 ticks, national annual numbers of human exposure were estimated among 1.1 million tick bites in the Netherlands[8]. * PCR products that specifically reacted to the generic (\"catch all\") probes, but that could not be further specified to the (geno) species level were designated as Untypeable. Within B. burgdorferi s. l., RLB analysis could not distinguish between B. garinii and B. bavariensis[29]. ** These categories of co-infections with B . burgdorferi s. l. are not mutually exclusive. Characteristics of 16 participants with DNA of tick-borne pathogens detected in blood The prevalence of DNA of a tick-borne pathogen other than B . burgdorferi s. l. detected in blood from persons after a tick bite was 2.4% (Table 2), this number was similar to EM patients (2.7%). In the blood of one person DNA of both A . phagocytophilum and B. divergens were detected. Altogether, DNA of tick-borne pathogens was detected in the blood of sixteen persons.

Using the observed prevalence of infection with tick-borne pathogens, national numbers of infections per year were estimated among 1.1 million tick bites in the Netherlands[8]. Note that the prevalence of DNA confirmed Borrelia burgdorferi s. l. detection in blood is a small fraction of the number of manifest borreliosis cases. For explanation, see results section. 95% CI = 95% confidence intervals.Table 2. Prevalence of DNA detection of tick-borne pathogens in blood of persons with tick bites or erythema migrans (EM), as determined by PCRs. characteristics of these sixteen participants are summarized in Table 3, with regard to age, gender, self-reported clinical symptoms, antibiotic treatment and tick exposure at enrolment and during the three month follow-up period. Eight of the sixteen cases had submitted ticks at enrolment. Among these eight ticks, six ticks tested negative in PCR, and in two ticks DNA was detected of a different genus than the tick-borne pathogens that had been detected in the EDTA-blood of the corresponding participants (Table 3). W e did not observe associations between detection of tick-borne pathogen DNA in EDTA-blood and; patient-reported tick attachment duration, with tick engorgement, with antibiotic treatment at enrolment. Seven out of sixteen cases reported clinical symptoms at enrolment or during the three month follow-up period, such as myalgia (3 cases), skin rash (2 cases), tingling sensations in limbs (2 cases), fatigue, arthralgia, headache, pain in limbs, and gastrointestinal symptoms/vomiting. Using multivariate logistic regression, we compared the prevalence of self-reported symptoms, tick attachment duration and tick engorgement among cases with and without DNA of tick-borne pathogens detected in blood. Compared to the cases that tested negative by PCR, the cases with DNA of tick-borne pathogens detected in their blood sample were not more likely to report any of the named clinical symptoms at enrolment or at follow-up.194Section III: The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands Discussion In this study , DNA of tick-borne microorganisms was detected and identified in ticks and human blood samples (Tables 1 and 2). The limitations of this methodology are well known; hence, the interpretation of these results should be done with caution [34]. In order to unequivocally prove the presence of the corresponding infectious agents in ticks or blood, their viability should be tested by in vitro culture or infection experiments of laboratory animals. Also, the absence of DNA of a pathogen cannot be interpreted as the absence of the infectious agent. Besides the technical detection limits of PCR-based methods, the timing of sample collection after a tick bite and start of an antibiotic treatment, as well as the tissue tropism of the pathogen strongly affect the ability of pathogen detection [35, 36]. The latter is corroborated in this study: Only in one out of the 291 patients with an erythema migrans (EM) -a skin infection caused by B. burgdorferi s. l.- the DNA of this pathogen was detected in blood (Table 2). This finding confirms that the chance of detecting B. burgdorferi s. l. DNA in blood samples of confirmed Lyme borreliosis patients is very low [35]. Rickettsia helvetica and R. monacensis were both not detected in the 626 blood samples whereas, recently molecular evidence for their presence in cerebrospinal fluid of neuroborreliosis patients and in a skin sample of an EM patient was found [37, 38]. The absence of TBEV in blood samples can further be explained by its extremely low infection rates in ticks and focal geographic distribution in the Netherlands [15]. Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis, A. phagocytophilum, B. miyamotoi and Babesia species are all pathogens that can be expected in blood because of their biology and tissue tropism[16, 20, 39, 40]. The tick samples were screened by a different method (RLB) than the blood samples (realtime PCR). In 314 ticks removed from humans a wide been found in questing ticks from field studies in the Netherlands before [41-43]. The infection rate of tick-borne pathogens other than B. burgdorferi s. l. varied from 0.3% (B . divergens and R. monacensis) up to 18.8% (R. helvetica). With an estimated incidence of 1.1 million tick bites per year, human exposure to a tick-borne pathogen other than B. burgdorferi s. l. and TBEV varies from roughly 3500 for B. divergens, and 3500 for R. monacensis to 207,000 persons for R . helvetica. Among the 322,000 persons exposed to B . burgdorferi s. l. through a tick bite, roughly 105,000 are simultaneously exposed to another pathogen. In addition, 19510Molecular detection of tick-borne pathogens in humans with tick bites and erythema migrans exposure to more than one tick-borne pathogen can occur when people have more than one tick bite at once or several consecutive tick bites. Clearly , not all exposure to tick-borne pathogens results in human infection. Based on the development of an EM or seroconversion, the risk of infection with B. burgdorferi s. l. after tick bites was estimated to be 5.1% [29]. In this study , evidence for infection comes from the detection of Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis, A. phagocytophilum, B. divergens, B. miyamotoi and B. burgdorferi s. l. DNA in the Figure 1. Phylogenetic tree of the sequences obtained from human blood samples.PCR and sequencing was performed on the real-time PCR-positiveblood samples.

None of these cases reported to be immunocompromised, and all the EM patients were treated with antibiotics according to the guidelines for treatment of Lyme borreliosis [30]. Mild clinical symptoms were reported by seven out of sixteen PCR-positive cases. However, using multivariate logistic regression, we did not detect associations between DNA detected in blood and self-reported symptoms at enrolment and follow-up. Furthermore, we did not find associations between detection of DNA of tick-borne pathogens in blood and; PCR positive ticks, patient-reported tick attachment duration, tick engorgement, and antibiotic treatment at enrolment. The lack of statistically significant associations may be due to the mildness of symptoms amongst immune-competent patients, and to a lesser degree due to insufficient numbers of PCR-positive cases per pathogen genus in our analyses. In this study , Candidatus infections have been immunocompromised patients [44], and more recently in immune-competent patients with relatively mild symptoms in China, Poland, and Sweden [45-48]. Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection was found in 0.9% (95%CI 0.3%-2.0%) of the persons exposed to tick bites in the Netherlands (Table 2). Genetic analyses of the DNA sequences showed the highest similarity to the zoonotic A. phagocytophilum ecotype I [33]. Evidence for A . phagocytophilum infection is primarily based on its molecular, microscopic or serological detection most disease cases [20, 49]. There is serological evidence that A . phagocytophilum infection occurs in the absence of disease symptoms[50]. Babesia divergens infection was observed in 0.5% (95%CI 0.1%-1.3%) of the persons exposed to tick bites. In Europe, only two cases of human babesiosis have been reported in immune-competent patients, one due to B . divergens [51]. Only one patient with EM was possibly infected with B . miyamotoi 0.2% (95%CI 0.0%-0.8%). The presence of B. miyamotoi DNA could only be determined by real-time PCR, and several attempts to confirm this finding by conventional PCR was unsuccessful. This patient had received antibiotic treatment at enrolment for his EM, so a low bacterial load in blood due to the treatment could be an explanation for the high Ct value. Evidence for infection with B. miyamotoi in Europe comes from one immunocompromised case [18], and a seroprevalence study in people exposed to tick bites[ 52]. Altogether, the probability of infection with a tick-borne pathogen other than Lyme spirochetes after tick bites in the Netherlands is roughly 2.4% (95%CI 1.1%-4.5%). This number is similar to the probability of a co-infection with another tick-borne pathogen in patients with EM (2.7%, 95%CI 1.3%-5.2%). Interestingly , one patient in this study had a co-infection with A phagocytophilum 19710Molecular detection of tick-borne pathogens in humans with tick bites and erythema migrans and B. divergens. The severity of self-reported symptoms of the seven EM patients with a co-infection was indistinguishable from patients only having EM. No indications were found that infection with a tick-borne pathogen other than B. burgdorferi s. l. caused overt symptoms that would indicate a corresponding illness. The low number of persons with a tick bite or EM that were identified with an tick-borne pathogen infection other than B . burgdorferi s. l., in combination with the limited medical assessments, and the used method of pathogen detection are not sufficient to infer how often tick-borne pathogens other than B . burgdorferi s. l. (and TBEV) cause disease. Also, to what extend they affect the diagnoses and the etiology of Lyme borreliosis. Furthermore, the ability for a pathogen to cause disease depends also on extrinsic factors for example the immune status of its host. The high exposure to tick-borne pathogens other than B . burgdorferi s. l. and TBEV , and their ability to cause infection in the general population, warrants increased awareness, knowledge, improvement of diagnostic tests and a clear-cut clinical case definitions in an European setting. Only when better laboratory tests are available for these tick-borne diseases, their impact as a co-infection with Lyme borreliosis can be assessed.

The studies in this thesis provide useful information for public health decision making and developing prevention strategies against Lymeborreliosis and other tick-borne diseases. Main ndings of this thesis Section I (chapter 2 to 5) The incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands What is already known Underreporting and misclassification are common to all public health surveillance systems. Most countrywide incidence estimates of Lyme borreliosis in Europe are based on passive reporting laboratory surveillance, using the available details of patients with positive laboratory tests. [1] However, the most common expression of Lyme borreliosis, erythema migrans, is heavily underreported with laboratory surveillance. Serologic testing is not routinely requested for erythema migrans, and patients are mostly seronegative at presentation. The incidence of disseminated Lyme borreliosis may be overreported in laboratory based surveillance, due to seropositivity linked to past infection or exposure to the bacteria Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi sensu lato (hereafter referred to as B. burgdorferi). [2, 3] Other frequently applied approaches to collect data on the occurrence of Lyme borreliosis include surveillance of hospital in- and outpatient diagnoses, and physician surveys [4-10]. In the Netherlands, erythema migrans is usually diagnosed by general practitioners (GPs). Utilizing the fact that every person in the Netherlands is registered with only one GP with a known practice population, clinical erythema migrans diagnoses incidence can be monitored through GP reporting. Nationwide cross-sectional retrospective studies among GPs, conducted by the National Public Health Institute (RIVM), have revealed a consistently rising incidence of tick bite consultations and erythema migrans diagnoses in the Netherlands from 1994 to 2001, and 2005 [11-13]. What the studies in section I of this thesis add The postcard-sized voluntary questionnaires of repeated GP surveys on tick bite consultations and erythema migrans diagnoses have continued to provide high response rates and excellent regional and national estimates to identify temporal 208General discussion and spatial trends. Between 2005 and 2009, the incidence of GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses continued to increase, similar to the rising incidence observed between 1994 and 2005. Throughout the same period, from 1996 to 2007, tick bites reported by the general population increased substantially as well (Chapter 2). The GP survey of 2014 showed a first sign of stabilization of erythema migrans diagnoses and a slightly decreased incidence for tick bite consultations (Chapter 3). For every approximately sixty tick bites reported in the general population in 2007, we observed one GP-diagnosed erythema migrans. This ratio of 1.8% is comparable to the risk of developing erythema migrans after tick bites, as observed in prospective studies such as chapter 8 in this thesis. From 1996 to 2007, this ratio between GP diagnosed erythema migrans and tick bites in the population had increased, which may reflect the success of public health educational messages about identification of erythema migrans and the need to seek treatment (Chapter 2). For every thirteen tick bites among the general population of the Netherlands in 2007, we observed one tick bite consultation at the GP (ratio 7.8 %). This ratio - the habit of consulting a physician for tick bites - increased between 1996 and 2007, specifically in low-risk municipalities. People living in high-risk areas may already have been more familiar with tick removal, whereas people in low-risk areas increased their concern due to public health education regarding prompt tick removal and when to visit a physician (Chapter 2). The continuing surveys on tick bites and Lyme borreliosis have added to the public awareness and understanding of the increasing health impact of Lyme borreliosis. The emergence of Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands and the total estimated number of 1.1 million tick bites in 2007 in the general population have been referred to in several scientific papers. [14-19] The maps with the geographical distribution of GP-diagnosed erythema migrans incidence in the Netherlands have been depicted in national public health education materials since the first GP survey on 1994 [20, 21]. And the GP survey data per municipality have been used to identify areas with a high risk of tick bites in the design of scientific studies [22-25], and by policy makers of public health. Lyme borreliosis most commonly manifests as erythema migrans, as is depicted in figure C. However, to assess the complete public health impact of Lyme borreliosis, nationwide incidence rate estimates were needed for the whole range of manifestations of Lyme borreliosis, including persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis (Chapter 4). Based on the relative proportions for Lyme borreliosis diagnoses from chapter 4, the nationwide reported 23,500 erythema migrans diagnoses in 2014 likely indicate an additional 1400 diagnoses with disseminated Lyme borreliosis, plus 1000 patients with persisting symptoms 20911General discussion attributed to Lyme borreliosis (Chapter 3). Validation of the surveillance of disseminated Lyme borreliosis was exemplified by Lyme carditis; a rare and potentially underrecognized manifestation of Lyme borreliosis. Lyme carditis results from direct invasion of the heart by B. burgdorferi and can be life threatening. Through examination of the medical records of cases with Lyme carditis reported in chapter 4, we estimated that ten cases of Lyme carditis are diagnosed per year nationwide (chapter 5), close to the initial estimate from chapter 4. To estimate the number of tick bites among the general population in 2014, the proportion between the population surveys and GP surveys (as described in chapter 2) was applied to the incidence of erythema migrans in 2014 (Chapter 3). Figure C.

However, erythema migrans is often not observed nor treated preceding to disseminated Lyme borreliosis [26-29]. After treatment of Lyme borreliosis, some people experience persisting symptoms such as musculoskeletal pain, neurocognitive symptoms and fatigue. These persisting symptoms are reported by about 12% to 32% of people after treatment for disseminated Lyme borreliosis [30-35], and by on average 5% of people (range 0% to 20%) six months after antibiotic treatment for erythema migrans[36-47]. These persisting and sometimes disabling symptoms have great impact on the quality of a person's life, which has led to great societal concern and dissatisfaction among patients about the provided care, diagnostics and treatment.

It is difficult to compare the burden of different diseases based solely on morbidity or mortality rates. Therefore, composite health measures such as the DALY (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) combine the duration and severity of disease with the number of people who get the disease. [48] However, worldwide no such quantitative estimation of the disease burden of Lyme borreliosis has been available so far, and reports on the societal impact of this disease have thus been scarce. What the studies in section II of this thesis add The public health impact of Lyme borreliosis in Euros and in DALY (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) are depicted in figure D. Each year, about 1750 healthy life years (DALY) are lost among the 25,000 people who are diagnosed with Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands. The majority of this disease burden is attributed to the small group of patients with Lyme-related persisting symptoms. This substantial disease burden of Lyme borreliosis ranks at number 12 in a list of 32 infectious diseases, higher than salmonellosis and norovirus infections and lower than hepatitis C. Patients perceive Lyme-related persisting symptoms about as disabling as having Crohn's disease, moderate Parkinson's disease, moderate multiple sclerosis, and a moderate episode of a major depression (Chapter 6). Lyme borreliosis and tick bites cost our society almost 20 million Euros per year, mainly through hospital care and production loss at work due to both disseminated Lyme borreliosis and Lyme-related persisting symptoms. In a list of 14 infectious diseases the cost of Lyme borreliosis ranks at number 7, similar to the cost of toxoplasmosis and salmonellosis. However, the societal costs of infectious diseases in the Netherlands are marginal compared to the total annual healthcare expenses of 88 billion (Chapter 7). Section III (chapter 8 to 10) The risk of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases after a tick bite in the Netherlands What is already known To aid development of prevention strategies against Lyme borreliosis, understanding and quantification of the risk of developing Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite are required. The risk of infection with B. burgdorferi after a tick bite depends on several factors, one of these being the prevalence of B. burgdorferi in ticks. The tick infection rate rises with the developmental stage of 212General discussion the tick; less than 1% of larvae are infected with B. burgdorferi, about 10% to 30% of the nymph, 40% adults, Ixodes ricinus ticks are collected from nature.[23, 49, 50] Another factor is the transmission of B. burgdorferi from ticks to humans. According to animal experiments, transmission can occur after 17 hours of attachment to the skin, and the efficiency of transmission increases with the duration of the tick's blood meal. [51, 52] The duration of the tick's blood meal can be assessed as patient-estimated hours of the tick bite. Ticks swell when they suck blood to the limit of their body capacity. The duration of a tick's blood meal can therefore be quantified as a degree of engorgement [53]. After tick removal, the recommended standard practice is watchful waiting; to monitor the skin for development of erythema migrans or other clinical symptoms indicative of Lyme borreliosis. A one-day single 200-mg dose of antibiotics (doxycycline), within 72 hours after tick removal to prevent development of Lyme borreliosis could offer a treatment perspective after tick bites with high risk of developing Lyme borreliosis [54, 55]. Based on studies from the United States, this prophylactic antibiotic treatment after a tick bite is seen as highly effective. Still, a high number of patients with tick bites would require prophylactic antibiotic treatment to prevent one case of Lyme borreliosis; fifty people with tick bites. [56] With more than a million tick bites per year among the people of the Netherlands (see figure C), there is also substantial exposure to tick-borne microorganisms other than the bacteria that cause Lyme borreliosis. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) was considered solely as a travellers disease from abroad, until the summer of 2016 in the Netherlands, when TBE virus was detected in ticks from national park \"Sallandse heuvelrug\". [57] The first two hospitalized patients who had most likely acquired TBEV in the Netherlands were identified within weeks after clinicians were informed and encouraged to look for TBE patients. [58, 59] Ticks in the Netherlands also carry a wide variety of other microorganisms such as Borrelia 60-63]. Despite the high human exposure through tick bites, patients with these tick-borne pathogens are hardly ever diagnosed. This is probably due to the non-characteristic nature of the symptoms, as well as lack of awareness, case definitions, and laboratory diagnostics. Knowledge on the incidence and clinical presentation is minimal, and for some tick-borne microorganisms, the pathogenicity is yet unknown. Based on some reports of patients in Europe, most of the other tick-borne diseases appear to be relatively mild and self-limiting. [64-69] However, depending on the pathogen, a severe clinical course and eventually death may occur in immunocompromised patients, or even immunocompetent patients. [64-66, 70] The serology assays 21311General discussion for some tick-borne pathogens are of questionable sensitivity, as they are mostly designed to react with antibodies to species of tick-borne pathogens that occur outside Europe, with unknown cross-reactivity with antibodies to European tick-borne pathogens. Therefore, the laboratory diagnostics for the majority of these tick-borne pathogens are currently limited to detection by PCR of genetic material of the specific microorganism. What the studies in section III of this thesis add Many tick bites go unnoticed. A third of patients with erythema migrans do not recall a preceding tick bite (chapter 8). After a recognised tick bite, the risk of developing erythema migrans is about 2.6% (see figure C), which corresponds to one new case of Lyme borreliosis per forty tick bites (chapter 8 & 9). In addition to this risk of erythema migrans, approximately 1.5 additional diagnoses of disseminated Lyme borreliosis would be expected per 1000 tick bites, based on the relative proportions for Lyme borreliosis diagnoses from chapter 4. An individual's risk of developing Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite can be predicted based on tick engorgement, patient-estimated duration of tick attachment, and detection of B. burgdorferi DNA in the tick. The highest observed risk of Lyme borreliosis was 14.4% after a single tick bite of a substantially engorged tick that tested positive for B. burgdorferi DNA, which corresponds to one new case of Lyme borreliosis per seven tick bites (chapter 9). Depending on the laboratory methods used, B. burgdorferi DNA is detected in about twenty percent of the ticks removed from humans (chapter 8 & 9). Through tick bites, people in the Netherlands are also exposed the ticks that carry B. burgdorferi, another tick-borne pathogen was also detected. In blood of sixteen patients with tick bites and erythema migrans, detected, although none of these people reported any overt symptoms that would indicate a corresponding illness. Based on these molecular methods, the risk of such an asymptomatic tick-borne infection other than B. burgdorferi is roughly 2.4% after a tick bite. And patients with erythema migrans had a 2.7% risk of a co-infection with another tick-borne pathogen (chapter 10). 214General discussion Implications of this thesis: recommendations for surveillance, research, and policy Surveillance of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands, and research into tick-borne diseases The nationwide GP surveys are currently our only source of information on the incidence of Lyme borreliosis. The next nationwide GP survey is planned for the end of 2017 and will show whether the stabilization of erythema migrans diagnoses and a decreased incidence for tick bites has continued. The number of tick bites reported by the general population in 2016 and 2017 will become available in 2018, providing an update of the total number of tick bites in the Netherlands, as well as the age and gender specific distribution, and the consultation rate can be updated. Further research into the cost of laboratory diagnostics in the Netherlands would complete our healthcare cost estimate for Lyme borreliosis. This would reveal the probably much higher economic impact of serology performed for patients with suspected Lyme borreliosis, as in a study performed on requests for Lyme borreliosis diagnostics at a laboratory in Amsterdam, only 9% of the test requests were supported by symptoms compatible with disseminated Lyme borreliosis as recommended in the medical guideline [71]. We recommend the reassessment of the incidence of the whole range of manifestations of Lyme borreliosis diagnoses, approximately every decade, to monitor the effectiveness of public health education on identification of erythema migrans and when to seek medical care, and the effects of improved use of the guidelines for professionals on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Lyme borreliosis. To collect data on tick bites in the Netherlands and monitor people with tick bites and Lyme borreliosis, the RIVM and Wageningen University established the web portal www .tekenradar.nl in 2012 [72]. Ever since, civilians have reported and geo-located 7,000-10,000 tick bites each year. As opposed to the two years of labour intense and costly enrolment and follow-up of 327 tick bite patients through 307 physicians (as performed in chapter 8), the Tekenradar website has demonstrated to be a successful platform for citizen science: sufficient numbers of participants have been collected for prospective studies (such as in chapter 9), and up-to-date information is provided to the public on tick bites and tick-borne diseases. A prospective clinical study to investigate tick-borne diseases among tick bitten patients with fever will start next year within Tekenradar, as the chance of identifying such an infection would be highest among acute febrile patients with a recent tick bite. [72, 73] To investigate the incidence and nature of other tick-borne diseases, or to what extend co-infections affect the course of 21511General discussion Lyme borreliosis, it is imperative to develop, improve and validate laboratory diagnostic tests, and to raise awareness of other tick-borne diseases among physicians and the public. Strategies for prevention of tick bites Avoidance of exposure to tick bites is currently the most efficient way to prevent Lyme borreliosis as well as other tick-borne infections. Prevention strategies against Lyme borreliosis are aimed at public health education on behavioural measures, with a focus on performing routine body checks to enable timely removal of tick bites, but also including protective clothing, application of tick repellents, identification of erythema migrans and when to seek medical care. [3, 74] Despite considerable efforts during the past decades in education of the public in the Netherlands, since the outcomes of the first GP survey on 1994 were reported, the incidence of Lyme borreliosis has continuously increased. According to Beaujean et al., acceptance and uptake of many of these preventive behaviours are currently low, so there is need for more effective health education and health communication aimed at promoting the uptake of preventive behaviours regarding tick bites and Lyme borreliosis. [74, 75] Nevertheless, the GP survey of 2014 showed a first sign of stabilization of erythema migrans diagnoses and a decrease of tick bite consultations, and we tentatively propose that repeated and redesigned efforts of public health education may have contributed to the decrease of tick bite consultations (Chapter 2). The reasons for the emergence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis between 1994 and 2009 are difficult to assess. It has been ascribed to a growth in Ixodes ricinus tick abundance, which have likely been facilitated by landscape changes in the Netherlands, due to restoration of nature reserves and loss of farmland in favour of forests, and an increase in the wildlife population, particularly roe deer [76]. Further investigation into the complex ecology of tick-borne disease and human exposure to ticks, could aid the development of intervention strategies. Considerable research has been done on interventions that decrease tick abundance or interrupt the transmission of B. burgdorferi in the environment. However, most environmental interventions are still in the experimental phase or found to be insufficient, and empirical evidence demonstrating public health efficacy is lacking. [3] Nearly all studies have focused on entomological outcomes, such as tick abundance, rather than human illness and most have been conducted on a small scale under optimized conditions, and on a temporal basis. The importance of documenting health outcomes is highlighted by a placebo-controlled trial in North America, in which yard pesticide treatments reduced the number of ticks by 60%, although no reduction was observed in tick bites or tick-borne illness among household members. [77] 216General discussion Further obstacles to overcome before widespread implementation include cost effectiveness, regulatory issues and concerns over pesticide use and deer control. [3] With evidence of an increasing burden of tick-borne disease in many parts of the Europe, more work is needed to establish effective and sustainable prevention measures. Similar to the approach for control of mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases, a multidisciplinary One Health strategy - meaning collaboration of experts in human and animal health, ecologists, and acarologists - may prove most successful [78]. Recommendations on strategies to reduce the incidence and burden of Lyme borreliosis, of persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis, and of other tick-borne diseases No human vaccination is available to prevent Lyme borreliosis or the other tick-borne diseases, with exception of TBEV . A safe vaccine to prevent Lyme borreliosis has been marketed between 1998 and 2002 in North America. The vaccine provided 62% efficacy after one or two doses, up to 85% efficacy after three doses. But high antibody titres did not persist long after vaccination, and additional booster doses would be needed to remain protective titers. It was removed from the market due to poor sales and unsubstantiated complaints of adverse events. Subsequently, pharmaceutical companies have been reluctant to test and market human vaccines, despite the demand for a vaccine and the possible cost effectiveness of vaccination in high-risk areas [79]. Nevertheless, new proteins are being investigated as vaccine candidates for Lyme borreliosis. An alternative vaccination strategy would be to vaccinate against tick proteins. This is based on the observation that ticks are unable to feed successfully on some laboratory animals that had been infested by ticks repetitively, through which the animals developed immune responses against tick proteins. Next to prevention of Lyme borreliosis, an anti-tick vaccine could prove to be instrumental for the prevention of other tick-borne diseases, as it would be desirable to have a single human vaccine to protect against multiple tick-borne diseases. [80, 81] Prophylactic antibiotic treatment of tick bites can potentially play an important role in the prevention of Lyme borreliosis, as an alternative to watchful waiting after tick removal. The outcomes of a randomized controlled intervention study through Tekenradar will soon become available, investigating the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotic treatment after a tick bite in the Netherlands. [72, 73] Topical application of azithromycin as antibiotic prophylaxis may provide an even easier way to eradicate B. burgdorferi from the skin around the tick bite before dissemination. However, the efficacy of skin applied antibiotic ointments still needs to be proven in clinical trials. [82] As described in chapter 9 of this 21711General discussion thesis, an individual's risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite can be predicted based on detection of B. burgdorferi DNA in the tick and tick engorgement, or patient-estimated duration of tick attachment. About 39,000 (3%) of the 1.3 million observed tick bites per year are expected to be by B. burgdorferi positive and substantially engorged ticks, for which we estimate a risk of 14.4% for developing Lyme borreliosis. Under the assumption that the tick bites would have been noticed by at least two third (16,500) of the 25,000 patients with newly diagnosed Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands, and if indeed Lyme borreliosis would develop in 5600 (14.4%) of 39,000 high risk tick bites, prophylactic antibiotics (with assumed 100% effectivity) for these high risk tick bites could be an interesting strategy to prevent a third of 16,500 new Lyme borreliosis patients who observed a tick bite (that is a fifth of all 25,000 patients with newly diagnosed Lyme borreliosis). Further research is needed to explore how such assessment of high risk tick bites could be used for clinical decision making regarding prophylactic treatment by physicians. To assess the duration of the tick's blood meal, specific knowledge and skills of the physicians in general practice would be required to be able to differentiate between low engorgement (1.4% risk) and substantial engorgement (5.5% risk). To our knowledge, commercially available easy to use and affordable assays for testing of ticks for B. burgdorferi DNA at point of care currently do not provide suitable sensitivity or specificity. [83, 84] Preceding to development of disseminated Lyme borreliosis, erythema migrans is regularly not observed or not recognized, and consequently not treated as such [26-29]. Erythema migrans with central clearing, resembling a bull's eye or archery target (see figure B in the general introduction, chapter 1), has received much attention in the past. However, a third of erythema migrans rashes are homogeneous in colour and pattern. [85, 86] In the (postgraduate) training of GPs on the diagnosis and treatment of erythema migrans, the appearance of homogeneous rashes deserves special attention. Of course, the public health education on prevention of Lyme borreliosis also needs to keep providing information on the appearance of erythema migrans and when to seek medical care. For some patients it has taken years before Lyme borreliosis was diagnosed and treated. For instance, among 200 patients with suspected Lyme borreliosis referred to Lyme-specialized hospital in the Netherlands, 17 patients with Lyme borreliosis had a duration of symptoms longer than 6 months. [87] And the Association for Lyme Patients in the Netherlands reports that the time to diagnosis was longer than a year among half of the 735 respondents to their questionnaire. [88] Failure to properly diagnose Lyme carditis may have serious consequences, with the possibility of sudden death or unnecessary implantation 218General discussion of a permanent pacemaker. Moreover, an opportunity could be missed for antibiotic treatment, whereas most carditis has a viral cause with no treatment perspective. Therefore, Lyme carditis should be included in the differential diagnosis when assessing cardiac symptoms, especially in the presence of atrioventricular conduction disturbances, an absence of apparent risk factors and a history of recent exposure to ticks. There is a need for development of laboratory diagnostics that can distinguish between active and previous infections with B. burgdorferi, and for laboratory diagnostics with better sensitivity and specificity during the early stage of Lyme borreliosis. Specifically when disseminated Lyme borreliosis presents with non-characteristic manifestations, the uncertainties of imperfect laboratory diagnostics present a diagnostic challenge. [1] Many conventional diagnostic tests for Lyme borreliosis are available, all of which have some performance issues, and physicians are concerned about the appropriate use and interpretation of these tests. [2, 89] Driven by the desire for a conclusive result, patients may pay for several non-conventional non-validated diagnostic tests in different commercial laboratories, sometimes outside the Netherlands. [87, 88] As a result, contradictory outcomes both conventional and non-conventional diagnostic tests may be obtained. These challenges in the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis need to be addressed in the training of physicians: how to deal with the uncertainties of laboratory diagnostic tests, when (not) to test, and when to refer a patient for diagnosis by a medical specialist in the hospital. [1, 3] With 1400 diagnoses per year in the Netherlands, disseminated Lyme borreliosis is not a rare disease. Nevertheless, a single GP may hardly ever encounter this disease, specifically in low incidence regions. Further improvement of the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme borreliosis could be gained through easily accessible consultation of experts for physicians and medical microbiologists. Therefore a network of specialised treatment centres, named \"Nationaal Lymeziekte Expertisecentrum\" is currently being established [73]. Other aims of this network are to promote uniformity and a multidisciplinary approach for the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme borreliosis, with consultation of the patients association. It remains debated to what extent persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis are actually due to a present or preceding infection with B. burgdorferi. Misdiagnosis based on non-characteristic symptoms, combined with false positive serologic test results is common, so patients with medically unexplained symptoms, and others with more well-defined disorders, are wrongly diagnosed with Lyme-related persisting symptoms. [3, 87] In our survey on the whole range of disease expressions of Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands (chapter 4), we could not discriminate whether the reported Lyme-related persisting symptoms were 21911General discussion actually due to Lyme borreliosis. Nevertheless, according to our surveys, about a thousand new patients consulted their GP in 2014 for persisting symptoms which they and their GP attributed to Lyme borreliosis. To develop better prevention and treatment strategies for this patient group, further research is needed into the causal mechanisms of developing Lyme-related persisting symptoms. Such a prospective clinical study into the causal mechanisms of developing Lyme-related persisting symptoms is ongoing since April 2015 through Tekenradar. [72, 73, 90] Currently, the main approach for treatment and management of patients with Lyme-related persisting symptoms is exclusion of a persisting infection with B. burgdorferi and exclusion of other diseases. Among 200 patients with suspected Lyme borreliosis that were referred to a tertiary multidisciplinary Lyme centre in the Netherlands, the diagnosis Lyme borreliosis was excluded in 60% of patients [87]. A third of the patients in which Lyme borreliosis was excluded were diagnosed with another disease. Only three patients had objective evidence of a probable persisting infection with B. burgdorferi [87]. It has been suggested that the severity of disease in Lyme borreliosis is affected by co-infections with other tick-borne pathogens tick-borne pathogens may putatively contribute to the high variety of clinical manifestations that are associated with Lyme borreliosis. Again, this highlights the need for development, improvement and validation of laboratory diagnostic tests for other tick-borne diseases than Lyme borreliosis and TBEV . , O'Connell S, Ornstein K, Strle F et al: Lyme borreliosis: clinical case definitions for diagnosis and management in Europe.

Jama 1996, 275(21):1657-1660.227Summary Summary Lyme borreliosis is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacteria (hereafter referred to as B. burgdorferi), and transmitted through tick bites. The disease most commonly manifests as erythema migrans, a slowly expanding skin lesion at the site of the tick bite. Disseminated Lyme borreliosis can develop when the infection spreads to the nervous system, joints, skin or sometimes the heart. Most patients with Lyme borreliosis recover after antibiotic treatment, but some experience persisting symptoms such as musculoskeletal pain, neurocognitive symptoms and fatigue. The research presented in this thesis provides insight in the epidemiology, disease burden and risk factors for Lyme borreliosis, and the incidence of other tick-borne infections. This is useful information for public health decision making and developing prevention strategies against Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases. The incidences of tick bites and erythema migrans have increased continuously between 1994 and 2005 in the Netherlands, according to repeated nationwide cross-sectional retrospective studies among general practitioners (GPs). Chapter 2 reports on a continuation of this rising incidence of GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses between 2005 and 2009. Tick bites reported by the general population of the Netherlands also increased substantially from 1996 to 2007, up to 1.1 million tick bites noticed nationwide in 2007. In chapter 3, the GP survey of 2014 showed a first sign of stabilization of erythema migrans diagnoses and a slightly decreased incidence for tick bite consultations. In chapter 4, nationwide incidence rates were estimated for physician reported diagnoses of the whole range of manifestations of Lyme borreliosis, to assess the complete public health impact of Lyme borreliosis. The relative proportions of Lyme borreliosis diagnoses were 91% erythema migrans, and 5.3% disseminated Lyme borreliosis, and 3.8% persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis. In chapter 5, validation of the surveillance of disseminated Lyme borreliosis was exemplified by Lyme carditis. We estimated that each year in the Netherlands about ten people are diagnosed with this rare manifestation of Lyme borreliosis which can occasionally be life-threatening. In chapter 6 and 7 the public-health impact and the societal costs of Lyme borreliosis were estimated, to support public health policy makers. About 1750 healthy life years are lost among the 25.000 people who are diagnosed with Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands each year, and the majority of healthy life years are lost due to Lyme-related persisting symptoms (chapter 6). Lyme borreliosis and tick bites cost our society almost 20 million Euros per year. Mainly through hospital care and production loss at work, disseminated Lyme borreliosis and Lyme-related persisting 228Summary symptoms cause the largest share of these costs (chapter 7). Chapter 8 describes a nationwide prospective study on the transmission risk for B. burgdorferi to humans among patients presenting at the general practitioner with a tick bite or erythema migrans. The risk of developing erythema migrans is about 2.6% after a recognised tick bite. However, one third of patients with erythema migrans do not recall a preceding tick bite. Chapter 9 demonstrates how an individual's risk of Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite can be predicted based on detection of B. burgdorferi DNA in the tick and tick engorgement, or patient-estimated duration of tick attachment. The highest observed risk of Lyme borreliosis was 14.4% after one tick bite of a substantially engorged tick that tested positive for B. burgdorferi DNA. For this purpose, data were combined from chapter 8, from Tekenradar.nl, and a third prospective study on the transmission risk of tick-borne pathogens to humans in the Netherlands. In chapter 10, we used molecular methods to detect DNA of tick-borne micro-organisms in ticks and in blood of the people with tick bites or erythema migrans from the prospective study in chapter 8. Through tick bites, people in the Netherlands are exposed sixteen patients with tick bites or erythema migrans, we detected none of these people reported any overt symptoms that would indicate a corresponding illness. In Chapter 11, the main findings of this thesis are discussed in an integrated way. The most important recommendations were: Recommendations on surveillance of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands, and research into tick-borne diseases The nationwide retrospective GP surveys and the population surveys on the number of tick bites in the general population are currently our only source of information on the incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis. The GP surveys need to be repeated every three to five years. The incidence of the whole range of manifestations of Lyme borreliosis diagnoses needs reassessment every decade. Further research into the cost of laboratory diagnostics in the Netherlands, in particular the majority negative test outcomes, would complete our healthcare cost estimate related to Lyme borreliosis. The website Tekenradar.nl can be used for enrolment and follow-up of patients in national prospective studies on tick bites and tick-borne diseases. 229Summary To estimate the incidence and gain knowledge on the clinical expression of other tick-borne infections (than Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis), development and improvement of laboratory diagnostic tests for these other tick-borne infections is required. Recommendations on strategies for prevention of tick bites Effective and sustainable measures for prevention of tick bites are needed, e.g. more effective public health education aimed at promoting the uptake of preventive behaviours regarding tick bites and Lyme borreliosis. Further investigation into the ecology of tick-borne disease and human exposure to ticks could aid the development of intervention strategies. Recommendations on strategies to reduce the incidence and burden of Lyme borreliosis, of persisting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis, and of other tick-borne diseases Development of a safe and cost-effective vaccine will aid the prevention of Lyme borreliosis. Even more desirable would be an anti-tick vaccine that could block the transmission of all pathogens, thereby preventing multiple tick-borne diseases. As an alternative to watchful waiting after tick removal, prophylactic antibiotic treatment of tick bites can potentially be helpful in the prevention of Lyme borreliosis, specifically among individuals with a higher risk. Further research is needed to explore how identification of individuals with a higher risk of Lyme borreliosis (as described in chapter 9 of this thesis) could be implemented for clinical decision making by physicians. Such a risk assessment would involve estimation of tick attachment duration, and rapid testing of ticks for infection with B. burgdorferi for which validated easy to use and affordable assays are currently not commercially available . When a cardiologist assesses cardiac symptoms, Lyme carditis should be included in the differential diagnosis, specifically in the presence of atrioventricular conduction disturbances, without other apparent risk factors and a history of recent exposure to ticks. Clinicians need to be aware of how to deal with the uncertainties of laboratory diagnostic tests, when (not) to test, and when to refer a patient for diagnosis by a medical specialist in the hospital. Further improvement of the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme borreliosis could be gained through easily accessible consultation of experts for physicians and medical microbiologists. 230Summary The substantial disease burden due to Lyme-related persisting symptoms highlights the need for research into causal mechanisms of developing Lyme-related persisting symptoms, in order to develop better prevention and treatment strategies for these patients. The suggestion that co-infections with other tick-borne pathogens may affect the severity of disease in Lyme borreliosis provides yet another reason for improvement and validation of laboratory diagnostic tests for other tick-borne diseases borreliosis het De meeste pati\u00ebnten ziekte van 2005.
