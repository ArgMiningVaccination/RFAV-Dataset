Introduction U n h e a l t h yd i e ti sam a j o rr i s kf a c t o ri nt h ed e v e l o p m e n to f noncommunicable diseases (NCD), which are responsiblefor about 63% of deaths globally [ 1]. One of the main characteristics of a healthy diet is the regular consumptionof a variety of fruit and vegetable, which is associatedwith a lower risk of some cancers, coronary heart disease,hypertension, and stroke [ 2,3]. About 1.7 million deaths worldwide are attributed to a low fruit and vegetable intake[4]. In addition, about 14% of gastrointestinal cancers, 11% of ischemic heart disease, and 9% of stroke worldwide arealsoattributabletolowfruitandvegetableintake[ 5].Another importantdietaryfactorrelatedtohealthisfatintake.Ahighfat intake is associated with higher risk of coronary heartdisease,diabetes,andcancers,thecommonNCDs[ 6-8]. The World Health Organization recommends a daily in- take of at least 400g (5 servings) of fruit and nonstarchyvegetable, and fat that is less than 30% of total dietary en-ergy, of which less than 10% is from saturated fat and lessthan 1% from 10].Theglobal burdenofNCDispredictedtoincreasefurtherbecauseofthisglobaltransitioninlifestyles[ 10]. Research has shown that religion and spirituality (R/S) has a positive association with health [ 11]. About 80% of the studies looking at the relationship between R/S and healthexamined mental health [ 12], showing a positive association with wellbeing, self-esteem, and optimism [ 13-16]; lower scoresofdepressiveandsuicidalsymptoms[ 17,18];andlower stress level [ 19-21]. Numerous studies have also reported a positive association between R/S and physical health,including an association with lower all-cause mortality andlower rates of diet-related diseases such as hypertension,cardiovasculardiseases,andcancer[ 22-26]. The study of the relationship between R/S and health remains relatively novel. Initially it was not well acceptedbecauseitwasthoughtthatitisimpossible(withinapositivist2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine framework) to study R/S scientifically. However, starting in the early 1990s, with the improvement of methodology, thestudyofreligionandhealthhasbeenincreasinglyrecognizedas a legitimate domain of scientific inquiry and is becomingmoreestablished[ 27].Between2000and2010,atleast21,000 quantitative studies examining the relationship between R/S and health have been published [ 28], covering a wide range ofhealthoutcomesandbehaviors. IntheresearchofR/Sandhealth,oneofthemajorissues is defining religion and spirituality in a way that supportstheir measurement. Historically the notions of religion andspirituality have often been used interchangeably; however,recentlytherehasbeenatrendtowardsdistinguishingthetwoconcepts [ 29]. Broadly, religion includes \"beliefs, practices, and rituals related to the Transcendent or the Divine\" [ 30], while spirituality is concerned with the \"connection to thatwhich is sacred, the transcendent\" and also \"a search for thetranscendent and the discovery of the transcendent\" [ 28]. Religion tends to convey a negative impression that it isrela tedtoorganizedreligionandtheologicalrigidness,whilespirituality is viewed more positively and is associated withpersonal experience of the transcendent. However, Koenigrecommendstheuseofspiritualityinthecontextofreligion,thatis,thosewhoarespiritualare\"deeplyreligious\"[ 30]. The most commonly used R/S measure has been the single-item measuring religious attendance because of its\"ease of use\" [ 31]. In most of the studies that have used a religious attendance measure, most have also found that itis positively associated with better health outcomes [ 32]; for example, it has been associated with lower mortality rates [33,34], better adoption of health behaviors [ 35,36], more life'ssatisfaction[ 37],andalowerprevalenceofhypertension [24]. However, in many studies, R/S data were collected as part of a larger study, and this can be a drawback [ 38, 39]. It is generally accepted that R/S is a multidimensional construct[ 40],whichmeansthatasingle-itemmeasuresuch as religious attendance will be insufficient to capture alldimensions except possibly in the most general sense. Thisalso limits insights that can be gained about the relationshipbetween R/S and health. Recently, more specific scales havebeendevelopedtomeasuredifferentdimensionsofR/S[ 40]. Religionisconsideredimportanttomanypeoplearound t h ew o r l d .O n er e c e n ts u r v e ye s t i m a t e dt h a t5 1 %o ft h epopulationintheworldbelieveingod(s)[ 41].Anothersurvey conductedin143countriesfoundthatthemajorityofpeople,especially those from developing countries, reported thatreligionwasanimportantpartoftheirlives[ 14]. One of the proposed mechanisms healthis throughthe adoptionofreligiouspractices thatarealso health-promoting[ 42]. Many religions view the human body as sacred and include specific prohibitions againstu n h e a l t h yb e h a v i o r s ,w h i c ha r ec o n s i d e r e di r r e v e r e n ta n dnot only harmful physically but also spiritually. This view,however,needstobetemperedbythefactthatsomereligious adherence mayalsoresultinpoorerhealthoutcomes,suchas extremeasceticism.Notwithstandingthat,numerousstudieshave shown that R/S is negatively associated with manyharmfulbehaviorssuchassmoking[ 43,44],alcoholdrinking [45,46], substance abuse [ 47,48], and risky sexual activities[49,50]andpositivelyassociatedwithgoodhealthbehaviors such as the use of preventive health care 51,52], physicalactivity[ 36],andseatbeltuse[ 53]. fasting guidelines,for example, Muslims fasting during Ramadan and orientalorthodox Christians fasting before Holy Communion. Thesecond category relates to \"stable and distinctive dietaryhabits that differ from the general population\"; for example,MuslimsconsumehalalmeatandJewsconsumekoshermeat[54]. The main purposes of these dietary guidelines are for spiritualadvancement. R/S might encourage the consumption of fruit and vegetable and discourage fat intake (especially animal fat)because of specific doctrines of a particular religion. Forexample,theteachingofAhimsa(donoharm)inMahayanaBuddhism and Hinduism encourages their adherents to bevegetariansinordertocultivatecompassion,sinceeatingani-malsrequiresslaughtering.Nonvegetarianfoodisconsideredimpure and could hinder one's spiritual development [ 55]. TheSeventh-dayAdventistsareencouragedtobevegetarians,as part of a religious duty to maintain a healthy body [ 56]. Eveninreligionsthatdonothavespecificdietaryguidelinesor restrictions, the teaching that the body is sacred mightencourage the adoption of healthier behaviors, including ahealthierdiet. The long term dietary practices required by certain religions could be a protective factor in preventing diet-related diseases. For example, the Seventh-day AdventistChurch and the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-daySaints both encourage their believers to consume more fruitand vegetable and less fat. There is evidence from observa-tional studies that Adventists, Mormons, and adherents ofreligions with strict dietary guidelines have healthier diets,better physical health, and longer lifespans than the generalpopulation[ 57,58]. Notwithstanding the importance of food in many reli- gions, there is a surprising scarcity of research on therelationship between R/S and diet. According to the firstedition of the Handbook of Religion and Health [ 59], the most comprehensive review about R/S and health to date,therewereonlysevenstudiesonR/Sanddietbefore1990.Thesecond edition of this Handbook (2012) reviewed 21 studiesaboutR/Sanddietbetween2000and2012.Sixty-twopercentshowedapositiveassociation;thatis,ahighermeasuredR/Sisassociatedwithahealthierdiet. A few other reviews also identified generally positive associations between R/S and a healthier diet.

There was an inconsistent findingabout the influence of Ramadan fasting on physical healthamongMuslimsandanoverallpositiverelationshipbetween religiousdietarypracticesandhealthinotherreligions. However,todate,therehasbeennoreviewthatexamined therelationshipbetweenR/Sandspecificdietaryintake.Thepast reviews have only examined R/S and diet in general.Thus, the purpose our review was to address this gap andsystematicallyreviewtherelationshipbetweenR/Sandfruit,vegetable and fat intake. We hypothesized that R/S waspositively associated with fruit and vegetable intake, andnegativelyassociatedwithfatintake. 2. Methods 2.1. Search Strategy. PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycInfo were searched by using two categories of key terms: religious keyterms(religion,religiosity,religiousness,andspirituality)anddietary key terms (diet, food, food habits, health behavior,food preferences, eating, nutritional status, fruit, vegetable,fibers,andfats).TheBooleanoperator\"OR\"wasusedtocom-binekeytermswithineachcategory,and\"AND\"tocombineboth categories. In PubMed database, the \"NOT\" operatorwas also used to eliminate studies related to clinical trials,fasting, reviews, systematic reviews, case reports, mtheauthors. 2.2. Inclusion Criteria. To be eligible for inclusion, a paper hadtofulfillthefollowingcriteria.

Serum level or biomarkers ofnutrients might not be an accurate indicator of fruit, vegetable, and fat intake since the nutrients could beobtainedfromsupplements; (6) thepaperexaminedfiberintakebut didnotspecifyits dietary source as fruit and vegetable.

Thereferencesandbibliographiesofthepaperswerealso examinedtoidentifyotherrelevantarticles.Previousreviewsoftherelationshipbetweendiet(generally)andR/Swerealsoexamined [ 28,59,61,62] ,a n di no n ec a s et h er e v i e wa u t h o r was contacted for his list of papers, which were not detailedinthereviewitself. 3. Analysis The frequency and types of fruit, vegetable, and fat intakemeasures used were first examined. The measures werecategorizedintodietaryrecords,24-hourdietaryrecall,foodfrequency, brief dietary assessment methods, and dietaryhistory. A dietary record is a detailed record of all food and drinks consumed over a period of time by a respondent; in 24-hour dietary recall, a respondent is asked about the foodand drinks he/she consumed during the past 24 hours; afoodfrequencyquestionnaireisalistofcommonlyconsumedfood that could be selected by respondents; brief dietaryassessments are used to estimate the intake of a nutrient ora type of food but do not assess overall diet; dietary historyassessesdietarypatternsovertime[ 63]. Thestudiesweredividedintotwocategories: (1)denom- inational studies that compared fruit, vegetable, and/or fatintake between members of different religions, or denomi-nations within the same religion, or between a religion withthe general population and(2)degree behavior aspects of R/S e.g., attendance and social support),ideological(R/Sbeliefse.g.,importanceofreligion),personaldevotion (personal and internalized devotion, e.g., private prayer), existential (measures that are spiritual but not reli- gious,e.g.,spiritualwellbeing),multidimensional(examinedmore than one category of R/S), and generic (e.g., one-itemmeasure that asks about how religious are the respondents)[65]. The relationships (positive (+), negative ( ), mixed, or none) between R/S measures and fruit, vegetable, and fatintakewereidentified. The quality of R/S measures was assessed by examining whether their validity and reliability were reported. Thenumber of studies that used single-item measure was alsoexamined. Many R/S and health studies relied solely on theuseofsingle-itemmeasureofreligiousattendance,whichhasitslimitationsinhealthresearch[ 38].Thequalityofresearch4 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine Included Eligibility Screening IdentificationQualitative studies Did not assess direct relationship between R/S and intake of fruit/vegetable or fat No specific dietary measures of fruit/vegetable or fat intakes No R/S measures or R/S measures part of another variableRecords identified through database searchingAdditional records identified through other sources Records after duplicates removed Records screened Articles included in qualitative synthesis(n = 4297) (n = 6) (n = 3297) (n = 3297) (n = 137) (n = 39)(n = 3160)Records excluded eligibilityFull-text articles assessed for2527 excluded based on titles 618 excluded based on abstracts 14 unreachable authors1 unavailable Full-text articles excluded with reasons (n = 98) Figure1:Articlesselectionprocess. design(controlforcovariates,utilizationoflongitudinaldata, andinvestigationofmediators)wasassessed[ 64].Thestudies were also categorized based on their reported relationshipbetweenR/Sandfruit,vegetable,andfatintake. 4.

Figure1 shows the flowchart of article selection process. All of the39studieswerecross-sectional.Thereare14denominationalstudiesthatdonotcontainotherR/Smeasures,21studiesthat examined only degree of R/S, and four that included both denominationaldifferencesanddegreeofR/S.See Table 1for thetableofcharacteristicsofthe39studies. The majority (77%) of the studies were conducted in the United States. Five were conducted in other Westerncountries (two in Australia (5.1%), and one each (2.6%) inScotland, Slovakia, and Canada), two in Israel (5.1%) one inJapan (2.6%), and one in South Korea (2.6%). Four studiesincluded only female samples. Eleven studies were race-specific; seven examined African Americans, two examinednon-HispanicWhites,oneexaminedKoreans,andoneexam-ined Japanese. Thirty-two of the studies (79.4%) includedsamples that were predominantly Christians. Four studiesexaminedJewsandthreeexaminedBuddhists. 4.1. Assessment of Dietary Intake. Out of the 39 studies, 12 examined fruit, vegetable, and fat intake, 14 examined onlyfruitandvegetableintake,andtheother13onlyexaminedfat intake. Table 3shows the categories of dietary assessments of fruit, vegetable, and fat intake. Among the five categoriesof dietary assessment methods, brief dietary assessmentswere the most used, followed by food frequency. The mostusedbriefdietaryassessmentwastheFat-andFiber-RelatedBehavior Questionnaire [ 67], which was included in four studies, followed by the National Institute's 5-A-Day Survey[68],whichwasincludedinthreestudies.Threestudiesused more than one dietary assessment method, and two usedmorethanonebriefdietaryassessment. 4.2. Denominational Studies. A total of 18 studies were ana- lyzed. Eight (44%) of them compared Seventh-Day Adven-tists with the other denominations (Catholics, Methodists,and Mormons) or non-Adventists, three compared fruit,vegetable, and fat intake, three compared only fruit andvegetable intake, and two compared only fat intake. Among thesixstudiesthatcomparedfruitandvegetableintake,three (50%) showed that Adventists consumed significantly morefruit and vegetable than members of other denominationsandnon-Adventists,one(16.7%)hadpositivebutnonsignifi-cant association, one was nonsignificant in vegetable intakebut significant in higher fruit intake, and one showed thatAdventistsconsumedlessdeepfriedvegetable. FivestudiescomparedtotalfatintakebetweenAdventists and non-Adventists. Two (40%) showed that Adventistsconsumedlessfat.OneshowedthatAdventistsconsumedlessfat when comparing total fat in grams, but similar amountof fat as non-Adventists when comparing the percentageof energy from fat.

One showed no significant relationship. These five studies also examined the intake ofsaturated fat, and all found that Adventists consumed lesssaturatedfat,eventhoughtheirtotalfatintakewassimilartothose of non-Adventists. Three of the studies also comparedthe intake of unsaturated fat. Two found no significant relationship, and one found that among Adventists, the vegetarians consumed more unsaturated fat than Mormons,but Adventist omnivores consumed less saturated fat thantheMormons.Amongthestudiesthatcomparedunsaturatedf a ti n t a k e ,t w oa l s ol o o k e da tt h ep o l y u n s a t u r a t e df a ta n dsaturated fat (P:S) ratio and found that Adventists had ahigherP:Sratio. Two of the denominational studies examined Jews. One c o m p a r e dt h eJ e w sw i t ht h eg e n e r a lp o p u l a t i o ni nI t a l ya n dfound that there was no difference in fat intake betweenthe two groups. However, Jews consumed more animal fatthan the general population. Another study compared twoJewish Hassidic sects and found that Lubavitcher Hassidimconsumedmorecookedfruit. There are two denominational studies that examined fat intake in Buddhists. The study that compared JapaneseZen Buddhist monks with the general population in Japanfoundthat Zen Monks consumed less totalfat and saturatedfat, more unsaturated fat, and had a higher P:S ratio.However, another study that compared Buddhist nuns withCatholicnunsfoundnosignificantdifferenceintotalfatandunsaturated fat intake, but Catholic nuns consumed moreanimalfat. One study compared Mennonites with the general US populationandfoundthattheMennoniteshavehighertotal fat, saturated fat, and unsaturated fat intake. Another onestudy compared Catholics with non-Catholics in Scotlandand found that Catholics consumed less pure fruit juice andCatholicmalesconsumedlessfruitandvegetable. Four studies were multidenominational. One examined fruit, vegetable, and fat intake and found no significantrelationship. Three studies examined fat intake only. Onefound no significant association. One study found thatreligiousdenominationmediatesfatintake.Oneshowedthatamong females, conservative protestant and those who havenoreligiouspreferencesconsumedmorefatthanCatholics. 4.3. Degree of Religiosity Studies. At o t a lo f2 5s t u d i e sw e r e analyzed. The R/S measures were categorized into the sixcategoriesdescribedintheprevioussection. Table 4shows the categories of R/S measures and their association with fruit and vegetable intake. The most com-monly used R/S measures are multidimensional (36.8%).Amongthe19R/Smeasures,eight(42.1%)showedapositiveassociationwithfruitandvegetableintakeandanotherseven(36.8%)showednosignificantrelationship.Amongthesevenmeasures that showed no significant relationship, four ofthemshowedevidenceofapositivetrendintherelationshipbetweenfruitand/orvegetableintake. Table 5shows the categories of R/S measures and their association with total fat intake. The most commonly usedR/S measures are institutional (40.7%). Among the 27R/Smeasures, 15 (55.6%) showed no significant relationshipbetweenR/Sandtotalfatintake,whileseven(25.9%)showed a negative relationship. Among studies that show no signif-icant relationship, five showed evidence of a positive trend,andsevenshowedevidenceofanegativetrend. Inadditiontototalfatintake,threestudiesalsoexamined saturated fat intake. Two studies showed no significant association. One examined the degree of orthodoxy among JewsandfoundthatmoreOrthodoxJewsconsumedlesstotalfatandsaturatedfat,moreunsaturatedfat,andhaveahigherP:Sratio. Only20%(5outof25)ofthepapersreportedthevalidity of R/S measures, and 52% (13 out of 25) reported reliabilityof at least one of the R/S measures. Of the 12 studies thatdo not report reliability, three of them utilized a single-item measure of attendance. The majority of the studies(88%) controlled for covariates such as age, gender andyearsofeducation.Allthestudieswerecross-sectional.Onlyone study investigated the mediator between R/S measuresand healthy behaviors. However, since the mediator (self-assurance) was not associated with the intake of fruit andvegetable inthestudy, nofurthermediationtest was carriedout. Table 6showsthenumberofstudiescategorizedbasedon their reported relationship. Of the 17 studies that examinedthedegreeofR/Sandfruitandvegetableintake,R/Sreportedpositive association with fruit and vegetable intake in abouthalf(52.9%)ofthestudiesandnoassociationin35.3%ofthestudies. As for fat intake, almost half (46.7%) of the studiesreportednoassociation,andanequalnumber(20%)reportedpositiveandnegativefindings. 5. Discussion About half of the denominational studies compared Adven-tists and non-Adventists. Healthy eating is one of the majorteachings in the Adventist Church; other Christian denom-inations (except the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-day Saints) do not emphasize healthy eating as much ast h eA d v e n t i s tC h u r c h .Th u s ,i ti sn o ts u r p r i s i n gt ofi n dt h a tAdventistsgenerallyconsumedmorefruitandvegetableandless total fat and saturated fat than non-Adventists. Similarlyin studies that compared Buddhist monks and nuns withnon-Buddhists, because of the teaching of Ahimsa (do noharm), Buddhists monks and nuns are vegans, and again itisnotsurprisingtofindthattheyconsumedlesssaturatedfator animal fat. A weakness of denominational studies is the assumption of homogeneity of dietary practices among the members within a denomination. Denominational studiesonly compared denominational differences as a whole andomitted the individual variationof R/S of members within adenomination.Itisunknownwhetherthisvariationisassoci-atedwithdietaryintake.Inaddition,denominationalstudiesare \"likely be confounded with region and the effectsofsocioeconomicstatus\"[ 69],andalmostallofthedenomi- nationalstudiesinthisreviewdidnotcontrolforcovariates. Four of the denominational studies included samples from various Christian denominations. Three of the studiesfound no significant relationship between religious denomi-nation and dietary intake. The nonsignificant findings wereEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 13 39 Generic Religiousintensity 38 Spiritualintensity 38 probably due to the fact that respondents from various denominationsinterpretedquestionnaireitemsrelatedtoR/Sdifferently. Although a meta-analysis was not conducted due to heterogeneity of R/S measures and dietary measures, thepresent review on the relationship between degree of R/Sand fruit and vegetable intake points towards a positiveassociation; that is, a higher score of R/S is associated withhigherfruitandvegetableintake.AbouthalfoftheChristianstudies showed a significant positive relationship with fruitand vegetable. This is consistent with the previous reviewthat R/S is associated with a better diet [ 28]. The results ofthepresentreviewalsosuggestthattheregularconsumption of fruit and vegetable may be one of the possible linksbetween R/S and positive health outcomes. Other possiblelinks include adoption of other health behaviors such as thenosmokinganddrinking;bettersocialintegrationandsocialsupport from religious communities; higher self-esteem and personal efficacy among the more religious; better coping resources and behaviors; positive emotions from religiouspractice;andhealthybeliefs[ 42]. Six of the 17 studies reported no association between degreeofR/Sandfruitandvegetableintake.Allthreestudiesthat included only Jewish samples showed no association.Th i sm a ya r i s eb e c a u s et h ed i e t a r yr e s t r i c t i o n so fJ u d a i s monly revolve around meat and animal products and not onfruitandvegetable.Theconsumptionoffruitandvegetableisneitherrestrictednorencouraged. The findings for fat intake contradicted the previous r e v i e w .A l m o s th a l fo ft h es t u d i e sr e p o r t e dn oa s s o c i a t i o n ,andanequalnumberreportedpositiveandnegativefindings.The contradiction might be due to the fact that the previousreview examined diet as a whole and not particularly fatintake. There are other studies which showed that R/S waspositively associated with greater body weight [ 70]a n d obesity[71],bothofwhichmightberelatedtohighfatintake. The proposed explanation of higher prevalence of obesityamong religious people could be that religious communityis more accepting towards obese people, rather than R/Sitself being the cause of obesity [ 71]. Kim et al. [ 70]f o u n d that the positive relationship between R/S and greater bodyweight disappeared after controlling for health behaviors, particularly smoking. None of the degree of R/S studies in thisreviewcontrolledforhealthbehaviorsanditisunknownwhether similar attenuation effect was also found betweenR/Sandfatintake. Most of the studies in this systematic review included samples that were from the USA and Western countrieswhere Christianity is the predominant religion; only twostudies were conducted in Asia and one in Africa, eventhough religion is considered important by most people onthese two continents [ 14]. None of the studies examined Hinduism and Islam, the two major religions in the worldbesidesChristianity.OnlythreestudiesexaminedBuddhists;however,theywereBuddhistsintheUSAratherthaninAsia,eventhoughthereisahigherpercentageofBuddhistsinAsia. The most frequently used dietary assessment methods were brief dietary assessments. However, they are crudeestimates of dietary intake. For example, the Fat- and Fiber-Related Behavior Questionnaire does not report dietaryintake per se but only an overall score of fruit and vegetableand fat intake. Dietary records are considered the \"goldstandard\" of dietary assessment methods [ 68]. However, only two studies in this review utilized dietary records. Nostudiesuseddietaryhistory,probablybecausetheyarecross-sectionalandassessingdietaryhistoryistime-consuming. The present review also showed a diversity of R/S mea- sures used. Even within a category (see Table 2), there was variation. For example, the R/S measures coded as \"insti-tutional,\" defined as \"measures that focused on the socialandbehavioralaspectsofR/S\"[ 65],includedattendanceand14 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine Table3:Dietaryassessmentsoffruitandvegetableandfatintake.

However, less than a third of the R/S measures included in the present review aremultidimensional. Very little information was provided with regard to the psychometric properties of the R/S measures. In this review,only 20% of the papers reported validity and 52% reportedreliability of at least one R/S measure. However, only threestudies (out of 25) used single-item measures of religiousattendance.

Nonetheless, thepresentreviewwasthefirstthatexaminedtherelationshipofR/Swithspecificdietaryintake. Thecontradictoryfindingsamongthestudiesofdegreeof R/Spointtotheneedformorestudiesthatcontrolforhealth behaviors, for example, smoking, and use more rigorousdietary assessment method. In addition, more studies areneededthatincludeparticipantsofotherreligions,especiallythoseofEasterntraditionsandfromnon-Westerncountries.There is also a need to use more rigorous R/S measures thatarevalidated,reliable,andmultidimensional. 6. Conclusion Overall, the denominational studies showed that religiousdenomination is significantly related to fruit, vegetable, andfat intake. Specifically, the Adventists consumed more fruitandvegetableandlessfatthannon-Adventists.However,therelationship between the degree of R/S and dietary intake ismixed.Theresultsofthisreviewsuggestthatfutureresearchon R/S and diet may help explain the possible mechanismbetween religion and health.
