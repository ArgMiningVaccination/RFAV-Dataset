They now have to take into account the classification 3f early stages (Fill UICC) since chemotherapy is being integrated into treatment. The prognosis of patients is mainly influenced by distinct T- and N-categories. ]-his is well demonstrated by the example of lung cancer on the basis of figures of specialized hospital. Therapy studies for preoperative and adjuvant chemotherapy and for combined chemoradiation may only be correctly evaluated if the ~eterogeneity of stages is recognized. The different classifications currently in Jse for small cell lung cancer (VALG, IASLC and German group) will be compared with the subsets of the TNM system.

Wirth, Universit~tsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus (Dresden) 3taging of malignant diseases is undertaken in order to gain information of :herapeutic and prognostic relevance. Therapeutic relevance, however, also depends on the effective treatment modalities available. With both renal and 3rostate cancer, the primary tumour size and extent (T) represents the major 3rognostic parameter while N- and M-positive stages are not amenable to curative :reatment. Therefore, the pretherapeutic evaluation of the T-stage in NOM0-cases s of utmost importance especially in prostate cancer. n renal cell cancer there is no curative treatment modality except radical surgery. ~reoperative TNM diagnosis therefore serves primarily as the basis for the decision :or surgery. The change in the UICC classification of 1997 with the extension of the rl category to include tumours up to 7 cm in diameter has in retrospective ~nalyses not decreased the prognosis of patients with pTlpNOM0 renal cell 3ancer. A problem remains the definition of the indication for elective partial qephrectomy where the limits must be set within the T1 category. :or prostate cancer, the quality and precision of pretherapeutic T-stage evaluation s of great importance since several potentially curative treatment modalities ~xist. The T1 category for prostate cancer, however, contains diagnostic parameters Nhich are taken as a surrogate for intraprostatic turnout volume. This, however, mplies diagnostic and prognostic uncertainties between the stages Tla to Tlc. -specially the Tlc group represents are heterogeneous group so that the prognostic ~ignificance of this label is difficult to interpret. =or both diseases, the N classification acquires prognostic significance only after ntraoperative examination while the M staging is of great preoperative importance. n renal cell cancer, imaging techniques allow the examination of the primary :arget organs for early metastatic spread with limited sensitivity, in prostate .'ancer, the M-staging is significantly improved by PSA determination as the 3asis for the determination of further diagnostic strategies. For both disease ,=ntities improvements in the relevance of the TNM classification and staging ~ystem will only be achieved through improvements in both diagnostic and :herapeutic modalities+ 13 IMPROVEMENT OF SYSTEMIC TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR ADVANCED 3OLORECTAL CANCER -I.J. Schmoll, Martin-Luther-Universit#.t Halle (Halle) to 10 years ago it had been demonstrated that patients have benefit from 5FU- ~ased chemotherapy in terms of improved survival and quality of life. It was also ;hown that biochemical modulation of 5-FU with Folinic Acid (FA) or methotrexate ncreases response rate and quality of life, however, without an relevant impact on survival. The protracted infusion (24 or 48 hours weekly/ biweekly or continuous daily infusion) has been shown to increase the progression free survival, however, with increased toxicity and no or only marginal impact on survival. The orally applicable 5FU-prodrugs are presently going to substitute bolus or infusional 5FU offering the patient more comfort (Capecitabine, UFT, FA). However the most relevant improvement is achieved by the combination of 5FU with either Irinotecan or Oxaliplatin resulting in objective response rates of 50% and a prolonged survival up to 19 months, which is nearly doubling the survival achieved with 5FU/ FA alone. However, it is still unclear whether the combinations must be given first line to achieve this advantage or wether a sequential approach using the combinations after failure of 5FU/ FA is also sufficient. It is clear however, that the long survival of 22 months in median can only be achieved if all patients had at least the chance to receive all 3 agents in the course of their treatment. It is also clearly demonstrated that the combination should be applied first line as neoadjuvant treatment, followed by resection of residual metastases in liver or lung in specific cases with metastases limited to these organs and good response. This approach leads to long term survival in about 15% of these patients and offers the chance for cure for at least some patients. Further improvement is currently expected from the incorporation of EGF-receptor- and VEGF-inhibitors. All together we are in the age of a change of paradigma for the treatment of colorectal cancer where risk adapted treatment strategies also for patients with metastases must be applied in order to achieve long term survival or even cure. 14 RADIOTHERAPY AND COMBINED RADIOCHEMOTHERAPY IN RECTAL CANCER R. Sauer, Universit~t Erlangen (Erlangen) Combined modality treatment is the recommended standard adjuvant therapy for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer in the USA and in Germany. During the last decade substantial progress has been made in treatment modalities: surgical management currently includes a broad spectrum of operative procedures ranging from radical operations to innovative sphincter-preserving techniques. Specialized groups have reported excellent local control rates with total mesorectal excision (TME) alone. New and improved radiation techniques (conformal radiotherapy, intraoperative radiotherapy) and innovative schedules (protracted intravenous infusion, chronomodulated infusion) and combinations (oxaliplatin, irinotecan) of chemotherapy may have the potential to further increase the therapeutic benefit of adjuvant treatment. Moreover, the basic issue of timing of radio-(chemo-)therapy - preoperative versus postoperative - within a multimodality regimen is currently being addressed in prospective trials. Evidently, the current monolithic approaches, established by studies conducted more than a decade ago, to either apply the same schedule of postoperative radiochemotherapy to all patients with stage Will rectal cancer or to give preoperative intensive short- course radiation according to the Swedish concept for all patients with resectable rectal cancer irrespective of tumor stage and treatment goal (e.g. sphincter preservation), need to be questioned. Different irradiation settings in more recent and ongoing studies of perioperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer will be discussed. 15 COLORECTAL CANCER - FUTURE PERSPECTIVES W. Schmiegel, Med. Universit~tsklinik-Knappschafttskrankenhaus (Bochum) Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in Germany. About 30.000 people die annually from this disorder. Major advances in understanding the molecular basis of CRC have occurred and we are starting to see the clinically benefits from these discoveries, particularly in the areas of molecular epidemiology, CRC diagnostics, prevention and treatment. Screening of the general population with 'twice a life time ' colonoscopy will have a dramatic impact on CRC incidence and mortality. Therefore universal implementation of screening will be a major challenge. Risk stratification for sporadic/hereditary or specific molecular marker like K-ras, p53, APC will further improve the efficacy of our screening strategies.The better understanding of the molecular changes along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence offers the opportunity for chemoprevention studies with i.e. selective COX-2 inhib[tors. While CRC is regarded as a single disease with respect to treatment and prognosis, it is reasonable to assume that cancers from different mutational mechanism and altering different genetic targets may demonstrate distinct clinical attributes. For adjuvant chemotherapy it has been shown that a LOH18q or mutated p53 are negative predictors whereas MSI - H and a mutated TGF-B RII are associated with improved survival. The molecular setting of a given tumor has also an impact on palliative chemotherapy. High levels of TS, TP or DPD are correlated with a unfavorable outcome. A better understanding of the prognostic relevance of the molecular biology will lead to a more individualized and tailored adjuvant and palliative therapy and will help to identify new targets for therapy. These new strategies will include monoclonal antibodies and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeted at pivotal growth factors. Beside these 'biologicals' new chemotherapeutics like oxaliplatin, irinotecan or capacitabine have already extended our therapeutic options in palliative therapy. A marked increase in remission rates for the first time also translates into a significant prolongation of survival. The coordinated sequence of therapies allows median survival times of 20 months for patients with advanced CRC. The impact of these substances on the results of adjuvant therapy is currently been tested in several multicenter studies. After years of stagnation we face a multitude of promising new approaches to improve the outcome of patients with co]orectal cancer. $1 Invited Speakers 16 BREAST CANCER AND THE PRINCIPLE OF A SUCCESSFUL DISEASE- MANAGEMENT requires special efforts referring to medical care. This statement includes the duration and frequency of diagnostic and theraputic measures. As compared to acute diseases, chronic illness needs more medical intervention and nursing engagement. It is quite clear that facts like these influence the costs of care in a negative manner. Oncological diseases often develop a chronic course. Disseminated or recurrent breast cancer is a typical example. Diagnostic and therapeutic problems in breast cancer can only be solved by physicians thinking and working multidisciplinarily. The necessary collaboration of different medical specialties includes prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of malignant breast tumors. An additional demand is the undeniable cooperation between inpatient and outpatient care. The very complex chain of care in breast cancer patients needs a special coordination and organization. Only then the permanent qualified and extensive offer of an effective program is possible. The principle of ,,Disease-Management\" as disccused and proposed by health- political and financial decision-makers might become a helpful instrument to guarantee a more qualified medical care of women suffering from breast cancer. An effective Disease-Management should avoid the psychological and physical irritation by unnecessary double examinations. Disease-Management might be a very helpful support to make the interdisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic network transparent. Qualityassurance and user-friendliness should become the preferential goal for all parts of breast cancer care. But an effective Disease-Management requires the existence of an evidence- and consense-based guideline reflecting the complete network of measures in breast cancer care. The guideline is the necessary basis for the development of qualityassurance and the definition of qualityindicators. A special problem of the complex network is the quality assurance of the interdisciplinary collaboration. Principles of Disease-Management should ensure patient's rights and should offer competent information by preparing layguidelines. The responsible introduction of Disease-Management in breast cancer patients might help to basically improve medical care and to parallely reduce costintensity. 17 IMPLICATIONS OF A BREAST CANCER DISEASE MANAGEMENT IN GERMANY K. Lauterbach, E. Plamper, S. Stock, M. In Germany each year approximately 46.000 women die of breast cancer. Many of these are diagnosed in an advanced stage of the disease and care is not delivered continuus, coordinated and according to evidence based standards. To optimize breast cancer care the following areas should be addressed: close cooperation of subspecialized and certified physicians, care delivery according to evidenc based protocols, an interdisciplinary approach, a patient centered ap- proach. These requirements can be dealt with best in a breast cancer Disease Management based on EUSOMA (2000) standards. Disease Management aims to improve both cost-effectiveness and quality of care. More effect is expected by the combination with an evidence based national mammography screening programm. In the Disease Management approach care is provided by a close collaborating medical team that includes different subspecialties such as gynecologists, breast cancer surgeons (if not a gynacologist), radiologist, pa- thologist, breast cancer nurse and technicians. A breast center can provide coordinated patient centered care according to the standards of evidence based medicine. The requirements for diagnosis, ther-apy and follow-up are specified in the EUSOMA guidelines. For example should a breast cen-ter have a case load of 150 new cases each year as a minimum. Required potentials lie in a continuum care on all levels: Diagnosis: Certification of assessment centers according to EUSOMA standards (e.g. define minimum case load) including patient education, coordination by a breast disease nurse or coordinator, close cooperation with self-help groups Therapy: Delivering therapy in certified breast centers; coordination of therapy with breast nurse / coordinator; establish quality control measures such as disease management circles for continuing education; patient education in close coordination with self-help groups Follow-Up: Follow-up protocol according to evidence based guidelines, reminders for patients and physicians, patient education in close collaboration with self-help groups, breast cancer nurse or coordinator. Summary: Disease Management holds the opportunity to increase the quality of care by establishing quality assured assessment (diagnosis), therapy and follow- up. International experience suggests the establishment of quality assured breast centers for this purpose. To implement such centers in Germany EUSOMA stand- ards and guidelines can be used. 18 MULTIDISCIPLINARY TREATMENT FOR HYPOPHARYNX CARCINOMA: SUR- VIVAL, (K61n) Background: Surgery, usually in combination with postoperative radiotherapy or concurrent chemotherapy and radiation, is believed to provide highest cure rates in patients with hypopharynx carcinoma. Advanced primary tumors frequently require multidisciplinary reconstruction of the upper alimentary tract following radical surgery. Material end methods: The charts of 228 consecutive patients with previously untreated hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma seen from 1986 to 1997 were reviewed. No patient was excluded from data analysis. Outcome measures were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Surgery was offered as initial treatment if the primary tumor and regional metastases seemed completely resectable and the general health status of the patient was considered sufficient to withstand the operative trauma. Results: Out of 228 consecutive patients, 136 (59.6%) were found suitable for initial surgical treatment. Of those who had surgery, 46 had larynx-sparing procedures, 54 total laryngectomy, and 36 total laryngo-pharyngectomy. Microvascular jejunum loops for pharynx reconstruction were used in 22 patients, and gastric pull-up in 14. None of the patients who had surgery died postoperatively. Actuarial five-year overall survival was 26.6% for all 228 patients, 35.9% for the 136 patients with surgical treatment, 59.3% for the 46 patients who were treated with larynx-sparing procedures, and 12.9% for those not treated surgically. Conclusion: Out of those 136 patients found suitable for surgical treatment, only forty-six could be managed with larynx sparing procedures (20.2% of all patients and 33.8% of all patients treated with surgery). For this small portion of patients, high overall survival, disease specific survival, and local control rates could be achieved. However, survival rates and quality of life as determined by the quality of (larynx) function preservation are invariably poor in those patients who require total laryngectomy for an oncologically sound resection of their tumor. However, surgery provides immediately successful and long-lasting palliation for airway obstruction, obstructive dysphagia and aspiration since local control is frequently achieved even in locally advanced tumors 19 RADIOCHEMOTHERAPY IN ADVANCED PHARYNGEAL AND LARYNGEAL CARCINOMAS - A CHALLENGE FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY R.P. Mueiler, Klinik for the oro- and hypopharynx as well as larynx have a dismal prognosis with disappointing Iongterm Iocoregional control rates. Traditional therapy for Iocoregional advanced head and neck cancer has consisted of surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. Aggressive surgical procedures, though technically feasible, may result in significant long-term anatomic, functional, and psycologic sequelae in the surviving patients. Multimodality treatment strategies with inclusion of radio- and chemotherapy may offer organMpreservation as well as reduced rates of distant failure in Iocoregional controlled patients. Materials and Methods: During the last ten years, several attempts to optimize treatment outcome and functional results have been undertaken in cooperative working groups of head and neck surgeons and radiation oncologists. Different concepts and intensities of combined radiochemotherapy (RCT) protocols including altered fractionation schedules and primary planned or salvage surgical procedures were integrated into multimodality studies. Results: Radiochemotherapy has successfully been proven to be superior to irradiation alone in primarily unresectable patients and in high risk patients after curative surgery. Recent studies and metaanalysis showed increased Iocoregional control and/or survival rates after a concomitant combined modality approach. Interdisciplinary studies indicated long-term organ preservation in about one half of patients with primarily resectable advanced hypopharynx or larynx cancer after intensive RCT, but surgical salvage options after local failure may be limited. The benefits of neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy concepts before curative surgery is to be proven. Conclusion: Interdisciplinary cooperative multicenter studies may significantly contribute to the optimization of treatment in patients with advanced head and neck cancer, but they also indicate the need for strong definitions of inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as a consensus in the intensity and consequently acceptable toxicities of multimodality treatment. 110 RECONSTRUCTION AND PRESERVATION OF FUNCTION- A CHALLENGE FOR THE SURGEON IN INTERDISCIPLINARY TREATMENT often involves the resection of the cervical oesophagus and leads to a loss of continuity of the upper gastrointestinal tract. For the reconstruction of such defects, gastric and colonic interposition can be used, but the use of free isoperistaitic segmental jejunal grafts has proven especially beneficial following multimodal neoadjuvant treatment protocols. When latero-terminal anastomotic techniques are used, the connection with the pharyngeal remnant can be designed easily despite differing diameters of the luminal structures. The vascular anastomoses are created in microsurgical technique and are crucial for the success of the reconstruction; when a tissue monitor is created by exposing a short segment of the graft through the cervical incision, vascular complications can be diagnosed without delay and corrected before irreversible damage occurs . Other complications are anastomotic ruptures with sa]ival fistulars and osteitis of the sternum; for this reason, sternotomies should be used selectively and with caution . The functional results of this reconstruction technique are very good in a majority of patients: manometric studies in our patients demonstrated propulsive peristalsis and rapid clearance of $2 Invited Speakers testmeals even in long term observations. Subjective swallowing function and quality of life is rated good or satisfactory in most cases. Operative lethality is low, and in our own experience with 18 patients during 5 years, no patient died within the primary hespitalisation. In conclusion, the technique of reconstruction of pharyngooesophageal defects with free jejunal segments is a sophisticated method but generally offers the chance for a good functional outcome and quality of life in patients even after complex multimodal treatment protocols. Ill GASTRO INTESTINAL STROMAL TUMORS: DIAGNOSIS, DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY-INDUCED U. Robert-R6ssle-Klinik (Berlin) Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are specific mesenchymal tumors localized in the whole gastrointestinal tract, occasionally in the mesenterium or omentum. They occur typically in older individuals. Because of phenotypic similarities a histogenetic origin from the interstitial cells of Cajal has been suggested, alternatively an origin from pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells. GISTs are morphologically and immunohistologically defined KIT (CD117)-positive spindle cell or epithelieid, rarely pleomorphic mesenchymal tumors frequentely also showing an expression of CD34. Some GISTs are focally positive for smooth muscle actin, expression of desmin or S100-protein is rare but there is never a full leiomyogenic phenotype. At least 10-30% of GISTs are malignant but the biologic behaviour is not clearly related to histomorphological features of which the mitotic activity is the strongest predictor. Tumors showing five or less mitosis in 50 HPF usually behave benign, however there exist definitely some mitotically inactive tumors which are malignant, especially those large in size. GISTs localized in the small intestine have a greater tendency to be malignant than gastric tumors of the same diameter and mitotic activity. GISTs have to be separated at first from smooth muscle and neural tumors (KIT- negative). Occasionally other mesenchymal tumors fibromatosis, dedifferentiated liposarcomas or inflammatory myofibroblastic pseudotumors enter into the differential diagnosis. Furthermore it is important to consider that some other tumorentities like melanomas or angiosarcomas could be positive for KIT. Under therapy with the tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor STI-571 GISTs show regressive changes, e.g. a decrease in cellularity and cellular cohesion, sometimes severe myxoid or gelatinous change and a decrease in mitotic activity. The immunohistologically detected expression of CD117 and CD34 remains unchanged. 112 A NEW STANDARD IN THE SYSTEMIC TREATMENT OF GASTROINTESTINAL STROMAL TUMORS P. Reichardt, Universit~itsklinikum Charit6, CVK (Berlin) 10 to 15 % of all soft tissue sarcomas originate from the gastrointestinal tract or mesenterium. The vast majority of these consists of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), an entity just recently defined. The incidence is estimated to be around 10-20/1.000.000. The median age at diagnosis has been reported to be 55 to 65 years. GISTs most commonly occur in the stomach or duodenum, followed by small intestine, celerectum and esophagus. About half of the patients present with metastatic disease at first diagnosis, predominantly in the liver or periteneum. GISTs are strongly and uniformly positive for CDl17 (c-kit), a type II] receptor- tyrosine kinase. Kit in exon 11, leading to ligand independent constitutive activation and protection against apoptosis are supposed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of GIST. Until recently no active systemic treatment was available for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors. GISTs are chemoresistant with response rates of less than 5 % in all series with single agent or combination chemotherapy. Imatinib (STI571 = Glivec\u00ae) is a rationally designed, orally available phenylaminopyrimidin analogue. The mechanism of action consists of a competitive interaction with the ATP-binding pocket of specific tyrosine kinases, namely abl, bcr-abl, PDGF-receptor and c-kit. Early results from clinical trials with response rates around 60 % and progression arrest in more than 80 % of patients resulting in fast relief of symptoms, confirm the high activity of this novel treatment. The major side effects consist of edema, skin rash, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. Grade 3 or 4 myelesuppression hardly occurs. A rare but serious side effect is gastrointestinal bleeding resulting from hemorrhagic necrosis and rupture of tumor nodules, often requiring surgical intervention. Meanwhile, large international multicenter trials have included more than 1.500 patients. Open questions remain optimal dosing and especially durstion of treatment. Wheather cure of metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors will become possible remains to be seen. 113 SURGICAL THERAPY AND NEW STRATEGIES TO TREAT GASTRO-INTESTINAL STROMAL TUMORS (GIST) P. Hohenberger, University Hospital Charit~ (Berlin) Surgical treatment of GIST primary tumors clearly depends on its location. However, a considerable number of these tumors is resected within laparotomies for another indication and GISTs are detected as an ,incidentaloma'. In patients with known lesions suspicious to be a GIST, the diagnosis should be confirmed immunohistochemically prior to any treatment decision. This is important particularly in patients undergoing abdominal re-laparotomy for sarcomatosis, ,leiomyosarcoma' resected earlier, or even ,mesothelioma' with a long history of disease. Histological examination of the primary lesion with respect to the expression of c-kit (CD 117) is a must prior to re-entering the abdominal cavity. In GIST of the stomach the extent of resection depends on the size of the tumor. Smaller lesions (< 3 cm) might be resected by full-wall resection even on a laparoscopic approach depending on the part of stomach affected. Tumors of larger size need to be resected with respect to maintaining the function of the gastric remnant either as a gastroduodenostomy or gastro-jejunostemy. The indication to perform a total gastrectomy depends on the location and size of the tumor but is not required for principal reasons. Locoregional lymph nodes should be dissected together with the part of stomach resected, however, as there are no convincing data on the lymphatoic spread of GIST lesions no extended dissection seems to be mandatory.GIST of the small bowel should be treated by segmental resection with margins of clearance of 2 to 5 cm. No major resection or extended lymphadenectomy can be recommended at present due the lack of data on the incidence of lymphatic dissemination. Enlarged lymph nodes, however, should be removed as part of the resection specimen. Similar priniciples should be followed in GIST of the colorectum.Locoregienally advanced GISTs invading to adjacent organs usually have been treated by multivisceral resection, however, the local recurrence rate is very high. Typical locations are GIST of the rectum, the splenic flexure of the colon, the duodenum, or initial part of the small bowel. Most often, peritoneal dissemination of these large lesions is not detected intraoperatively and peritoneal recurrence follows very rapidly. Patients presenting with such tumors and scheduled for multivisceral resection with clear margins difficult to achieve might be discussed for being treated by systemic imatinib (STI571) up#ont. As response rate range at 85% to 90% residual tumor might be resected later with curative intent. The re-exploration of the abdomial cavity to remove residual masses of peritoneal sarcomatosis of GISTs after succesful treatment with imatinib must be discussed on a patient-by-patient basis. 114 INTENSIFYING OF TREATMENT - LIMITS OF OPERABILITY H.C Dienemann, Theraxklinik-Heidelberg (Heidelberg) Principles of surgery for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are based on rules which are helpful in identifying possible candidates for surgical treatment and in defining the standards of the operative procedure: a) Diagnosis must precede treatment b) Surgery remains the only reliable prospect for cure c) To benefit from surgery the patient must survive d) Complete resection is the only operation to have an impact on survival e) Oncological surgery is characterized by standardized steps f) Following complete resection the stage dictates the prognosis These principles are fulfilled and will be confirmed, respectively, in stage I and II and selected cases of stage Ilia. Stages Ilia (N2), IIIb and IV are handled by surgeons, medical oncologists and radiologists. If surgery is offered, these principles are sometimes disregarded. In addition it has to be considered that clinical staging is imprecise, thus preventing clinical stages Ilia and higher from radical surgery. For these patients the optimal treatment has to be found by consensus of all disciplines involved. In our institution the indication for operation is given in the following setting: a) Metachronous solitary adrenal, pulmonary (DD second cancer) or brain metastases in a patient with favourable prognostic factors (adeno carcinoma, primary tumor T1, negative lymph nodes, complete resection of former primary), when complete resection seems feasible b) Any primary tumor with local complications (abscess formation, chest wall infiltration, large tumor with mediastinal shift or compression, hemoptoe, large pleural effusion if primary tumor seems resectable based on CT-scan and patient is in stable condition c) patient with local tumor progress under chemotherapy (if the functional criteria for surgery are fulfilled), especially if histology is doubtful d) when the patient urgently demands surgery, e.g. in case of refusing chemotherapy or when no alternative can be offered Intensifying of surgical treatment for patients with lung cancer means to disregard the usual limits of indication, thus accepting a higher risk of complications in selected cases. These limits refer to functional parameters, technical, and oncological aspects. Disregarding these limits is justified by the prospect to achieve essential palliation. In a significant number of patients a complete rem- oval of the tumor mass is feasible even when the CT-scan heralds a somewhat hopeless situation. 115 CANCER AND PREGNANCY: ONCOLOGICAL ASPECTS RS. Oduncu, B. Emmerich, Medizinische Klinik - Innenstadt, (Menchen) The diagnosis of cancer during pregnancy always presents a highly critical situation for the patient and the physician. In most cases the physician is faced with the conflict between optimal maternal therapy on the one hand, and preserving the unborn's well-being on the other hand. Often, either maternal or fetal health, or both, will be compromised. Here, we provide an overview of the available data informing about the incidence and impact of the most common malignancies as they appear during pregnancy and their treatment on both: the pregnant woman and her fetus. The medical indications must consider the patient's physical state, disease process, and treatment options. $3 Invited Speakers The occurrence of malignancies during pregnancy has increased over the last decades, complicating approximately 1:1000 pregnancies. The most common malignancies associated with pregnancy include the cervix, breast, malignant melanoma, ovary, malignant lymphomas, leukemias, colon and the thyroid. Since it is impossible that prospective studies will be conducted, relevant data have been generated by case reports and matched historical cohort studies to evaluate the influence of pregnancy on cancer and of cancer on pregnancy. A major problem is the assessment of the optimal timing of delivery. The physician has to balance the risk to the health of the pregnant patient by delaying the therapy against the risk to the fetus' health by beginning the antineoplastic and potentially teratogenic chemo- and radiotherapy. Many high teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Antimetabolites, methotrexate in particular, show a strong association with teratogenicity in the first trimester. Other agents like cyclophosphamide cause also malformations, intrauterine growth retardation and low birth weight when given during the first trimester. The rate of fetal malformation from combination drugs is about 25% versus 17% for single agent use. Radiation at higher than 5 cGy is associated with fetal risks of microcephaly, growth retardation, congenital malformations and spontaneous abortion when administered in early stages of a pregnancy. Staging should include history, physical examination, routine blood tests and tumor markers, tissue and, if indicated, bone marrow biopsies, chest X-ray with abdominal shielding and abdominal ultrasound. Here, the management of specific tumors will be discussed. 116 GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER AND PREGNANCY R. Kimmig, of gynecological malignomas in pregnancy is estimated to be 1.5 / 1.000 pregnancies. Carcinoma of uterine cervix is the most common (100 / 100.000 pregnancies), followed by breast cancer (33 / 100.000 pregnancies) and ovarian cancer (10 / 100.000 pregnancies). The diagnosis of endometrial cancer, vulvar and vaginal cancer in pregnancy is extraordinary rare. Prognosis of none of these malignancies is worsened by pregnancy, if outcome in comparable tumor stage and age is analyzed. The surgical approach of breast cancer therapy during pregnancy, is not different compared to non-pregnant women. Post-operative radiotherapy usually can be delayed until delivery. If chemotherapy is indicated, Epirubicin / Cyclophosphamide therapy should be preferred, in order to avoid trophoblast damaging Methotrexate containing regimens. Apart from other risks the enhanced teratogenic risk especially during the first trimester should be discussed with the patient. In case of ovarian tumors persistent throughout the sixteen's week of gestation, surgery is indicated, especially in case of negative additional criteria's (size > 6 cm, cystic / solid aspect). In case of ovarian cancer, treatment should be the same compared to non-pregnant women. If the fetus is able to survive, cesarean section has to be performed. If net, the question has to be clarified whether viability of the fetus can be awaited or not.In case of cervical cancer, stage adapted therapy has to be performed. Tumors infiltrating up to 3 mm without lymphangiosis and haemangiosis, uterus (pregnancy) preserving therapy is justified also in early pregnancy. As in cervical cancer, in all gynecological malignancies, depending on tumor stage, gestational age and priority of the patient, individual therapy conserving the pregnancy up to viability of the fetus may be discussed. If hysterectomy is not necessary for therapy of the malignancy, no artificial termination of the pregnancy with respect to maternal / medical risk is indicated. 117 CANCER AND PREGNANCY: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS F.S. Oduncu, Medizinische Klinik - Innenstadt (MQnchen) Since the beginning of medical science two duties have dominated the self- understanding and the ethics of physicians. The first, positive duty, commands the physician to restore the patient's health. The second, negative duty, is commonly known as ,,nihil-nocere-rule\" which bans the intentional harm of the patient. An extreme collision of duties occurs whenever cancer and pregnancy assemble. There is almost always a conflict between optimal maternal therapy and fetal well-being. Consequently, either maternal or fetal health, or both, will be compromised. In this constellation the doctor's actions necessarily affect two huma n beings. These tragic cases hinder the doctor to follow the ,,nihil-nocere- rule\": Either the mother or the unborn child will be harmed - in each case reciprocally to the other's safety. The medical encounter between the patient and her physician must consider the patient's physical state, disease process, and treatment options as well as the patient's individual concerns and wishes. On behalf of the medical facts an ethical evaluation will discuss the arising maternal-fetal-conflict as a model of ,,diametrical relations\". In this model maternal and fetal prognosis are in some degree inversely porportional to each other. Patient's autonomy is the ethical and legal center of the patient-physician, and patient-nurse relationship. On the other hand, the physical and moral status of the unborn must not be neglected. The purpose of this analysis is to provide an interdisciplinary framework for assessing some of these complex issues by ethical principles, relevant and in conflict. Exploring these areas will help the decision-making process to clarify the best treatment option in consideration of the issues and the facts of the particular case. The approach presented here, applies the ethical principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, vulnerability, integrity and human dignity. This signifies that to study the tragic dilemma of concomitant cancer and pregnancy, a collaborative approach of gynecologists, obstetricians, oncelogists, psychologists, neonatologists, and ethicists is needed. 118 CONDITIONING THERAPY PRIOR TO AUTOLOGOUS AND ALLOGENEIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION H.G. Sayer, Friedrich-Schiller-Universit~t (Jena) There are two categories of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]: autologous transplants from the patients' own cells and allogeneic transplants, where cells are derived from another individual. The conditioning regimen prior to autotransplantation is primary designed to provide intensive myeloablative treatment and completely eradicate the malignant disease of the patient. Prior to allogeneic transplantation the pretreatment is used to eradicate the malignant cell clone, to ,,create space\" for the incoming stem cells and to provide immunosuppression to allow engraftment. carboplatin and thiotepa) are used as either single agents or in combination with other agents including etoposide and cytosine arabinoside, because their major dose-limiting toxicity is myelosuppression. Many centres favour protocols which include total body irradiation [TBI] (either single exposure or fractionated daily fractions) with doses ranging between 8 to 14 Gy delivered by linear accelerators or telecobalt sources. Over the years, a variety of conditioning protocols have been tested to find optimal dose and schedule. Adverse reactions and organ toxicity of lung, liver, kidney and heart highlight the dilemma to achieve a balance between fatal toxicity and maximal response. The high dose treatment is based on the hypothesis that increasing dose will increase tumour cell kill, resulting in improved response and survival rates. All conditioning regimens are inevitably associated with acute and long term adverse effects resulting in therapy related mortality. Based on new understanding of the pathogenesis of graft- versus-host disease, introduction of new immunosuppressive drugs and the efficacy of the graft-versus-malignancy effect, dose reduced conditioning regimens are recently introduced in allogeneic transplantation. Low dose TBI in combination with enhanced immunosuppression or fludarabine containing chemotherapy regimens are investigated in phase II trials. The feasibility of these less toxic, non- myeloab]ative strategies has been demonstrated. It may offer HSCT to older patients (>55 years) or to patients in poor general health, otherwise not eligible for allogeneic transplantation. The value of these pioneering approaches has to be shown in further prospective randomised trials. 119 IMMUNOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES OF ALLOGENEIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION, Kolb, R. Pihusch, W. Guenther, M. Weber, G. Ledderose, Dept. Med. III, Klinikum of the LM Univ. of Munich, Dept. Med. Ill, Klinikum of the LM University of M (Munich) AIIogeneic stem cell transplantation is the most invasive medical treatment avail- able today. There are two immune reactions involved the host versus graft (HVG) and the graft versus host reaction (GVH) which have to be controlled to the extent that the immune system of the patient is replaced by that of the donor and that it acquires sufficient immunological function to protect the host against infections. Moreover the treatment may benefit from a reaction of the graft against the neoplastic disease. Immunological interventions may be divided into the conditioning treat- ment of the patient, the prevention of GVH disease and attempts of adoptive immunotherapy. The methods used differ whether the donor is an HLA-identical sibling, an HLA-matched unrelated donor or even a HLA-mismatched family member. Total body radiation (TBI) has been a standard of conditioning for it's immunosuppressive, myeloablative and anti-leukemic activity. Today these ac- tivities may be achieved with less toxicity using chemotherapy including cyclo- phosphamide, fludarabin post-transplant as weir as immunosuppressive antibodies. This way transplantation from donors other than HLA-identical siblings has been im- proved. New approaches to control HVG and GVH reactions are being explored using \"facilitator cells\" that exert immunsuppressive effects on both host and donor T cells. The use of donor cells for control of leukemia and improvement of chimerism has opened the way for conditioning treatments of lower toxicity the so-called non- myeloablative regimens. This way allogeneic transplantation has become an option for the treatment of older patients, debilitated patients and new indications as low grade lymphomas, multiple myeloma and selected solid tumors. However the enthusiasm has been damped by the high rate of chronic GVHD in patients with insufficient immunesuppression early after transplantation. Today the results of allogeneic transplantation are more limited by chronic GVHD and insufficient immune recenstitution than acute toxicities. Ways to improve immune reconsti- tution are being explored. 120 TUMOR ANTIGENS AND CANCER VACCINATION E. J~ger, II. Medizinische Klinik, Krankenhaus Nordwest (Frankfurt) Approaches to specifically activate the immune system to control cancer growth in vivo has been a long standing goal in cancer immunology and medical oncology. The identification of antigens selectively or abundantly expressed in cancer cells has set the basis for the design of a large number of cancer vaccine trials. The aims of these trials were the evaluation of toxicity, immunological effects and clinical developments, mostly in patients with advanced disease. Antigenic peptides presented by MHC class I and II molecules, proteins, viral constructs, 'mini,,- genes, and tumor cells have been used either alone or combined with different $4 Invited Speakers cytokines or dendritic cells to improve the presentation of the vaccine and to enhance specific immune responses. Sensitive methods to evaluate the immunological efficacy of different vaccine approaches have been established. Clinical responses following vaccination were observed and correlated with measurable immune responses to vaccination in some patients. Future studies will be focused on the identification of new criteria for patient selection based on defined tumor characteristics, i.e. homogeneity of antigen and MHC class I/ll expression, intratumoral cellular infiltrates), and on new strategies to enhance the immunogenicity of cancer vaccines. 121 CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF TUMOR PAIN GUIDELINES - RESULTS OF THE GERMAN GUIDELINE CLEARINGHOUSE H. Kimhner, U. Fuhr, H. GSbel, U. Hankemeier, goals: In 1999, the German Guideline Clearinghouse started a Guideline Clearing Project ,,Tumor Pain\" in order to (a) identify evidence based guidelines on managament of tumor pain; (b) establish criteria for future guideline development and implementation (c) to familiarise stakeholders in Germany with state-of-the- art management of tumor pain; (d) identify key topics for a future national evidence- based guideline, (e) and on a whole to develop the quality of tumor pain management in Germany. Methods: Search procedures: comprehensive literature search - Medline, Healthstar, Embase, guideline databases available through the German Guideline Information Service (www.leitlinien.de) - 104 guidelines on tumor pain were identified for the period from 1990 until 1999. Formal appraisal: Of those 21 fulfilled the pre- established inclusion criteria (i.a. German and English language, national guideline, cited references published after 1990) to serve as blueprints for a German evidence based guideline on management of tumor pain. These CPGs were assessed with the help of the German Checklist for critical appraisal of CPGs, and 13 of 21 passed the checklist's minimal quality criteria as a basis for the clearing process. Appraisal of clinical appropriateness: Appraisal of the appropriateness of the recommendations was performed by a multi-disciplinary focus group of experts all of whom were familiar with evidence based medicine. Results: The results of both, the methodological appraisal as well as the appraisal of clinical appropriateness were documented on a structured abstract form. The focus group consented on a guideline clearing report containing: structured abstracts, comments on CPG methods and recommendations; methodological features which should be employed for the development of a national guideline on tumor pain for Germany (like systematic retrieval and selection of evidence or explicit links between recommendations and the supporting evidence); followed by a detailed description of 10 key topics on content issues for an evidence based guideline for Germany - like clinical assessment, pharmacological and non- pharmacological therapy, ethical aspects, as well as dissemination and implementation strategies for health care providers and health care users. The report is available for the public on internet (www.leitlinien.de). Refer.: OIlenschl&ger Get al . The 2001; 31 (Suppl 9): 59-64 122 RADIATION THERAPY (RT) IN EARLY AND LOCALLY ADVANCED STAGES OF HODGKIN'S DISEASE (HD) E. D0hmke, Klinik for Strahlentherapie und Radioonkologie (M(Jnchen) The natural history of Iocalised Hodgkin's Disease is described by contiguous extension patterns from the area of origin throughout the main lymph node regions of the body stem. About 30 years ago, Kaplan and other leading radiation oncologists, therefore developed large volume RT strategies such as total nodal irradiation (TNI), subtotal nodal irradiation (STNI), and extended field radiation therapy (EFRT) in order to cover not only the primary site(s) of disease but also anatomically and/ or functionally adjacent lymph node groups, which were not yet macroscopically involved, but endangered by the disease. This aim was achieved by the introduction of high voltage-RT using telecobalt-machines as well as linear accelerators, enabling individually shaped large field volumes (mantle, inverted Y). This resulted in a prognostic relevant advantage for early and locally advanced stages according to the Ann Arbor-classification. During recent decades, it was recognised that the prognostic value of such Iocalised stages was significantly modified adversely by prognostic factors (RF), such as macroscopic turnout load, extranodal involvement, clinical symptoms (B) and elevated ESR. As soon as more and more effective multi-drug protocols became available, such as COPP, later ABVD and others, combined modality treatment (CMT) of locally advanced stages of HD yielded nearly as good prognostic results as RT alone in early stages without prognostic RF. At the same timem staging procedures changed gradually from pathological (PS) to clinical staging (CS) omitting, for example, the former obligatory, sometimes risky staging laparotomy. The development of the principal treatment strategy in early stage HD (ESHD) without and with prognostic risk factors from STNI and EFRT alone to CMT has been shown by the German Hodgkin's Study Group (GHSG) amongst others: it has been clearly shown that CMT in early stages without risk factors did not result in better survival rates (HD4 vs. HD7), in ESHD with risk factors, such as locally advanced stages, however, the worse prognosis can be significantly improved, resulting in survival probabilities, equal to ESHD without RF (HD5, HD8). At the same time RT volumes turned out to be sufficient, if confined to a generously local, rather than extensive area (EFRT). Quality Control as well as Assurance play an important role for RT, as has been shown in the HD4 study. 123 HODGKIN'S DISEASE- TREATMENT STRATEGIES V. Diehl, Universit~ttskliniken KSIn (KSIn) The standard treatment for HD 7 in early stages was the EF RX with 30 Gy followed by a 40 Gy IF radiation. This treatment was compared to CT (2 cycles ABVD ) followed by EF RX as described above. 622 patients were randomized. CR rates are similar in the two arms (arm A: 96%, arm B: 97%). 3% progressed in arm A and one in arm B. There were 4 deaths. Median observation time was 22 months. FFTF was significantly better in arm B than in arm A ( 96% vs 84% at 24 months). Survival was not different (96% at 24 months), intermediate stagesThe standard treatment for HD 8 pts in intermediate states was 4 cycles CT (COPP/ABVD) followed by 30 Gy EF RX + 10 Gy bulk. For the experimental arm the same CT was chosen, followed by 30 Gy IF RX + 10 Gy bulk.1204 patients were randomized. MOT was 64 months. There were no significant differences between the two arms in survival after 5 years (91% vs 94%) or FFTF (86% vs 86%). The different.advanced stagesln HD 9 1201 patients aged 15-65 years with HD stage liB/IliA with risk factors or stage IIIB/IV were randomized to receive 8 cycles of the following regimens, followed by RX to any initial bulky and/or residual disease: COPP alternating with ABVD (standard arm A), baseline dose BEACOPP(B), or escalated dose BEACOPP with G-CSF in every cycle(C). The standard arm A was closed prematurely. MOT was 56 months. FFTF at 5 years was 69% in A, 76% in B and 87% in C, which was significant. Overall survival at 5 years was 83% in A, 88% in B and 91% in C. 13% of all patients died. Early progression rates were significantly lower with escalated BEACOPP. New concepts for relapsed Hodgkin's disease patients: HDR 2 100 patients with either relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma were enrolled in a multicentre setting. Treatment consisted of two cycles of DHAP followed by sequential HDCT in those patients responding. This was followed by one cycle of BEAM supported by peripheral BSCT. The latest interim analysis of this study included 69 patients. 16 were primary refractory and 53 were relapsed. The overall response was 80% in relapsed patients and 50 % in those with primary refractory disease. Patients are randomized between the described protocol and a reduced version consisting of 2 cycles of DHAP followed by BEAM. The study has enrolled 24 patients by June 2001. 124 CURRENT PROBLEMS OF THE RENAL CELL CARCINOMA J. Schubert, H. Wunderlich, FSU-Jena (Jena) Cancer is the second cause of death in Germany. Behind the carcinomas of the prostate and the bladder the renal cell carinoma (RCC) is the third most common urological malignancy in adults.In the etiology of renal cell carcinoma there are only little evidences to incriminate any specific factors. Although smoking has been suggested as a possible cause, the evidence in favor of this agent is fragile. Familial renal cell carcinoma has been identified and has served as an excellent model for the study of inherited malignancy. It has been proposed that the loss of genes with tumor suppressor function might be associated with the development of RCC. In the recent literatures the percentage of RCC on all malignomas is 3- 4%, in older literatures the percentage was 1-2%. The yearly incidence of renal cell carcinoma is 4-10 per 100.000 inhabitants. In the last years the incidence of renal cell carcinoma has increased about 15-20%.With the recent development of imaging techniques, such as ultrasenography and computerized tomography, and their widespread use the frequency of incidental diagnosis of asymptomatic RCC's is increasing. In the literature of the seventies the percentage of incidentally found RCC's is 4-30%. The annual rate of the incidentally found carcinomas has increased up to 70% on the total. The increasing trend of the incidence of RCC's seems to be real. However, with the widespread use of ultrasonography the tumor size of clinically unrecognized RCC's is decreased. Moreover, a shifting to lower tumor stages with a better prognosis is seen. Nevertheless, 8,9% of patients with clinically unrecognized RCC's died of the RCC itself. 125 SURGICAL PROCEDURES IN RENAL CELL CARCINOMA - WHAT IST NEW? A. Schlichter, Friedrich-Schiller-Universittit Jena (Jena) In this lecture we discribe the advantages and disadvantages in the different traditionally and new surgical procedures in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (BCC). Radical nephrectomy, first described by ROBSON in 1969, was the gold standard therapy for localized renal cell carcinoma for many years. But in recent years there has been a marked increase in the number of small renal cell carcinomas detected incidentally by using ultrasound (US) and computerized tomography (CT). These renal masses have usually a lower diameter and a lower stage according to the TNM- and Robson- classification than symptomatic tumors. Nephron sparing surgery (NSS) is an attractive alternative to radical nephrectomy $5 Invited Speakers in patients with bilateral renal cell carcinoma, carcinoma involving a solitary functioning kidney, in cases of unilateral RCC with a contralateral kidney that is at risk of future impairment from an intercurrant disorder as well as in patients with a chronic renal failure. NSS in patients with a small incidentally detected tumor and a normal contralateral kidney is under discussion in the literature. The main problems of partial nephrectomy is the incidence of multifocality of RCC between 4.5 % and 25 % and the risk of local recurrence in up to 7.7%. These recurrences are most probably due to incomplete resection or could be a manifestation of multifocal RCC. But in recent years some reports shows a tumor-free survival rates after partial nephrectomy comparable to those reported after radical nephrectomy. Minimally invasive technologies are currently being applied to the field of therapy of RCC in an effort to decrease morbidity , postoperative pain and hospital stay. Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy can be performed by a intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal access to the kidney. In the last years the laparoscopic technique is also used in partial nephrectomy in highly selected patients with an unifocal small exophytic peripheral renal tumor away from the collecting system. Another development in combination with laparoscopic technologies is the use of cryoablation of renal masses. Newer energy sources for tumor ablation include high intensive focused ultrasound, interstitial radiofrequency ablation, laser and microwave coagulators. But for all these technologies no long term results regarding survaillance and local recurrence rate are availlable. 126 EFFICACY OF SYSTEMIC THERAPY IN RENAL CELL CARCINOMA T. Steiner, Friedrich-Schiller-Universittit Jena (Jena) Patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma have a poor prognosis. Until recently, no therapeutic option for these patients was available. Median survival time of the patients has been increased from about 4 months in 1970 to 11 months today. This could be an effect of improved supportive care and due to unspecific immuno(chemo)therapy as well. In some patients long lasting remissions can be achieved. However, it has to be considered that systemic therapy with biological response modifiers is characterized by severe toxicity too. Active specific immunization using dendritic cells is currently being evaluated in phase I clinical trials. Presently it is considered to be a promising but only experimental option for the treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Both an overview on current therapeutic options and their assessment as well as an algorithm of diagnosis and therapy in patients with renal cell carcinoma is being presented. 127 PRESENT CLINICAL TRIALS AN DCONCEPTS OF THE EORTC Brain Tumour Group (BTG) is conducting, developing, co-ordinating and stimulating research of clinical basis for the treatment of primary and secondary brain tumours. To this end, the BTG is fundamentally based on prospective clinical studies in part in co-operation with scientific societies outside of Europe. A secondary aim is the development of translational research. Quality control is an integral part and involves medical and radiation cological aspects in co-operation within the EORTC exists with Lymphoma Group and Radiotherapy Group. Methods: Newly developed trials and proposals: 26012 / phase II : second-line temozolomide and cisplatin in recurrent oligodendroglioma. Phase III versus postop, radiotherapy in incompletely resected benign meningioma. Phase III : Primary temozolomide versus radiotherapy in low grade glioma (high risk). Ongoing trials: 26951 / phase III : adjuvant PCV versus no further treatment in anaplastic oligodendroglioma after surgery and radiotherapy. 26981 / phase Ill : Concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide versus no further treatment in gliob]astoma after surgery and radiotherapy. 26991 / phase Ill: Whole brain irradiation versus no further treatment after radiosurgery or surgery of brain metastases. 22972 / phase ill focal fractionated stereotactic boost versus no further treatment in glioblastoma. 20962 / phase II : high dose MTX in PCNSL in patients < 65 years. Closed trials for low grade glioma, anaplastic astrocytoma and recurrent oligodendroglioma. New initiatives on rare tumours comprising medulloblastoma and ependymoma in adults. Results: High rate of patient accrual in the majority of trials. Excellent feasibility of trial conduct on a multi-national level. High quality standard of patient and treatment data in recent trials. Conclusions: A large number of ongoing trials, newly developed trials and new initiatives of the EORTC BTG reflect a functioning and effective working group. Beyond this, the EORTC BTG offers a comprehensive frame work for multi- national co-operative prospective trials relating to development of protocols, monitoring and evaluating data including quality control procedures in the management of central nervous system malignancies in co-operation with the EORTC data centre. The BTG together with the data centre activities enhance European collaboration and thereby improve general health care European wide. 128 PROJECTS AND PURPOSE OF THE DEUTSCHE HIRNTUMORHILFE E.V. (GERMAN BRAIN TUMOR ASSOCIATION) B. Braun, Deutsche Hirntumorhilfe (Leipzig) The German Brain Tumor Association was founded in 1998. It is a non-profit organisation dedicated to the support of brain tumor patients and their families and to the raising of funds for research aimed at finding a treatment and cure for brain tumors. The German Brain Tumor Association represent the interests of brain tumor patients and unite medical experts, patients, physicians and authorities as well as anybody else identifying with its mission. Mission: to find a cure for brain tumors by funding and encouraging research support brain tumor patients during the disease management providing information about brain tumors to the public to improve the quality of life of brain tumor patients increasing public awareness of the disease In general, the public generally is not aware of the severity of this disease. The German Brain Tumor Association is striving to raise public awareness. Our task is to inspire a sense of commitment and urgency that will make the development of new brain tumor therapeutics a priority and a possibility. The German Brain Tumor Association will disseminate information helpful for the medical community, the public, brain tumor patients and their families on matters regarding early detection, symptoms, treatments and resources available to )atients with disorders, Projects: set-up of a central research and contact point publication of medical information clinical trials database carrying out meetings and seminars about brain tumors documentation and archiving of brain tumor information distribution of a guide about brain tumor therapy starting up research projects promotion of self-help activities 129 IMMUNE RESPONSES TO or humeral effectors of the immune system represent potential targets for antigen-specific cancer immunotherapy. Different categories of cancer antigens have been identified which induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in vitro and in vivo: 1) 'Cancer Testis,, (CT) antigens, expressed in different tumors and normal testis, 2) melanocyte differentiation antigens, 3) point mutations of normal genes, 4) 'self,,- antigens that are overexpressed in malignant tissues, and 5) viral antigens. Clinical studies with peptJdes and proteins derived from these antigens have been initiated to study the efficacy of inducing specific CTL responses in vivo. immunological and clinical parameters for the assessment of antigen-specific immune responses have been defined, i.e. DTR- , CTL-, autoimmmune-, and tumor regression responses. Specific DTH- and CTL responses and tumor regressions have been observed after intradermal administration of tumor- associated peptides alone. Peptide-specific immune reactions were enhanced after using granulocyte macrophage stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as a systemic adjuvant by increasing the frequency of dermal antigen-presenting Langerhans,, cells. Complete tumor regressions have been observed in the context of measurable peptide-specific CTL. However, in single cases with disease progression after an initial tumor response, either a loss of single antigens targeted by CTL or of the presenting MHC class I allele was detected, pointing towards immunization-induced immune escape. Cytokines to modulate antigen- and MHC class I expression in vivo are being evaluated to prevent immunoselection. Recently, a new CT antigen, NY- ESO-1, has been identified on the basis of spontaneous antibody responses to tumor-associated antigens (SEREX). NY-ESO-1 appears to be one of the most immunogenic antigens known today with spontaneous immune responses observed in 50 % of patients with NY-ESO-1 expressing cancers. Clinical studies have been initiated to evaluate the immunogenicity of different NY-ESO-1 constructs to induce both humeral and cellular immune responses in vivo. 130 BIFUNCTIONAL ANTIBODY FRAGMENTS FOR DIRECTED CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY W. F. Rohrbah, M. Biburger, C. Uherek, Chemotherapeutisches Forschungsinstitut (Frankfurt) Cellular immunity provides a powerful principle to eliminate target cells expressing foreign antigens, but often fails to defend the organism against cancer. T lymphocytes recognize target antigens by interaction of the T-cell receptor (TCR) with peptide-bearing MHC molecules. For activation of naive T cells an additional costimulatory signal is required that can be provided by the binding of B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) proteins on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC) to their counter-receptor CD28 on T cells. To direct costimulatory activity to the surface of tumor ceils and facilitate T-cell activation independent from the availability of professional APCs, we have constructed chimeric proteins that consist of CD28-binding domains of CD86 $6 Invited Speakers genetically fused to single-chain antibody fragments (scFv) specific for EGFR and ErbB2 (HER2/neu). These antigens are overexpressed by many tumors of epithelial origin. Recombinant CD86-scFv fusion proteins displayed specific binding to B7 counter receptors. The chimeric molecules localized to the respective target antigens on the surface of tumor cells and markedly enhanced the proliferation of cocultivated primary T cells. As a strategy to generate tumor specific effector cells directly, we have derived genetically modified human NK-92 natural killer (NK) cells expressing a chimeric antigen receptor that contains an ErbB2 specific scFv antibody fragment for tumor targeting, and the CD3 zeta chain as an intracellular signaling moiety. In in vitro cytotoxicity assays no difference in cytolytic activity of parental NK-92 and modified NK-92-scFv(FRP5)-zeta cells towards ErbB2 negative targets was found. In contrast, even at low effector to target ratios NK-92-scFv(FRP5)-zeta cells but not parental NK-92 cells specifically and efficiently lysed ErbB2 expressing tumor cells of various origin. Our results demonstrate that recombinant antibody fragments are highly effective for specific targeting of immunostimulatory and cytolytic effectors to tumor cells. Further development of these strategies might result in potent immmunotherapeutic reagents for cancer treatment. 131 DENDRITIC CELLS AND T CELLS AS MEDIATORS OF TUMOR- IMMUNOTHERAPY V. Schirrmacher, Division of Cellular Immunology, DKFZ (Heidelberg) Progress in tumor immunology in recent years includes the identification of human tumor associated antigens (TAA) as well as the elucidation of mechanisms of antigen processing and presentation by dendritic cells. TAA in tumor cells may derive from mutations and genetic rearrangements as well as from over-expression or aberrant expression of self proteins. A primary T cell response against TAA requires in addition to TAA costimulatory signals which can be mediated through dendritic cells. Without the participation of dendritic cells which process and present TAA of tumor cells there would be hardly a T cell mediated antitumor immune response. Similar to T cells, also dendritic cells require activation signals so that they can evaluate dangerous situations from tissue environments. Danger signals can be mediated through toll-receptors of dendritic cells thereby inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferons. Such a local pro-inflammatory micro-environment than allows cellular antitumor immune reactions. As a consequence of primary T cell immune responses against TAA memory T cells are generated. We recently provided evidence for the existence of such memory T cells in primary operated breast cancer patients. These memory T cells were enriched in the bone-marrow and could be reactivated by autologous dendritic cells presenting breast-cancer associated TAA. Such ex vivo reactivated bone marrow derived memory T cells from patients were transferred to NOD/SCID mice which had been xenotransplanted with human breast cancer. Such T cell transfer lead to infiltration of the tumors by T cells and to their regression 1). This new therapy animal model might allow in future a systematic evaluation of T cell based immunotherapies. 1) M. Feuerer, et al.

Rainov, Univ. of Liverpool, Dept. of Neurological Science (Liverpool, GB) Molecular neurooncology aims at selective killing of brain tumors while sparing normal brain from toxicity. Specific molecular features of brain tumor cells need therefore to be identified and used as targets for antitumor agents. Brain tumors are mitotic islands in the largely non-mitotic normal tissue, which allows for targeting of proliferating cells. Another extensively investigated molecular target is the tumor suppressor p53, which acts as a master switch of growth and apoptosis, p53 is often inactivated by genetic or epigenetic mechanisms and thus fails to accomplish its central regulatory role. Further molecular alterations em- ployed for targeting brain tumors include mutations in the retinoblastoma or epithelial growth factor receptor genes, and aberrant expression of cytokine receptors such as the IL4/IL13 receptor. An early strategy for molecular targeting was the use of mitosis selective recombinant virus vectors such as retrovirus. A more recent tumor specific development are virus vector mutants able to replicate in brain tumor cells devoid of functional p53 protein. Such oncolytic vectors are based on adenovirus or adeno-associated virus and have a lytic life cycle in tumor cells. On the other hand, recombinant fusion proteins were constructed consisting of a receptor binding molecule such as human IL4 or ILl3 and a toxin domain from a powerful plant or bacterial toxin. These immunotoxins are able to preferentially bind to and kill tumor cells with high density receptor expression. With all these agents, their route and mode of application to the tumor appears essential to the success of the treatment. To minimize neurotoxicity, avoid limita- tions imposed by the existence of a blood brain barrier, and allow for a widespread spatial coverage of tumor-invaded brain tissue, novel techniques such as intraparenchymal bulk flow infusion are increasingly used. With this method, catheters are stereotactically placed in and around a brain tumor and cells, immunotoxins or oncolytic viruses are infused. This application mode allows for the administration of higher doses at lower complication rates compared with bolus injections. Preliminary evidence has been provided for the efficacy of molecular therapies in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. Proof of efficacy in additional randomized and controlled prospective studies is required before these methods can be recommended for routine clinical use. 133 LOCAL THERAPY FOR GLIOMA, PERSPECTIVES AND DEVELOPMENTS M. Westphal, UKHamburg Eppendorf (Hamburg) Although gliomas are not locally limited but rather a disease involving the whole brain, failure after initial standard therapy including resection and radiotherapy is mostly local. Improvement of local control would already significantly add to improved survival and therefore many technical developments have gone into a broad range of different approaches. Intracavitary chemotherapy has proven its value in three phase Ill studies in which in recurrent as well as in newly diagnosed patients biodegradeable implants with BCNU (Gliadel) have shown a statistically significant improved survival. Another approach to intracavitary therapy is taken by instillation of radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies to tenascin, an extracellular matrix protein found in and around malignant gliomas. More recently, direct intratumoral application by continuous infusion of specific toxins is under evalu- ation where IL-4, IL-13 or TGFa coupled to a permuted form of the peudomonas exotoxin are directly infused into the tumor to be distributed within and ideally also around it, - carried forward by the force of convection. Yet other approaches are based on the injection of a biodegradeable preparation of slowly released 5-FU which is directly injected around the tumor cavity at the end of microsurgical resection to enhance the effects of irradiation in a limited phase of radioimmunotherapy for newly diagnosed tumors. New devices for direct intrac- avitary application of postoperative radiation have been tested are will soon be evaluated against conventional radiation in phase III trials. At this point, much innovations goes into the development of local control regimens after gross total resection of gliomas. These efforts should be seen in the context, that the invasive behaviour fo glioma cells may be a completely separate issue which willl be dealt with after much more intensive biological research. Local control may then be the remaining issue and much progress is being made that way. 134 OPTIMIZED RADICAL RESECTION OF INVASIVE GLIOMS - A CONTRADICTION? J.-C. Tonn, Neurochirurgische Klinik (M0nchen) There is still a debate revolving about the question whether extensive resection is beneficial in malignant gliomas. However, in case of large, space occupying lesions surgical resection has been accepted as a prerequisite for effective adjuvant therapy. Many techniques have been developed in order to optimize the extent of resection: I. intra-operative image guidance by MRI, CT or ultrasound II. Fluorescence guided resection using 5-ALA being converted to protoporphyrine IX by viable tumor cells. Nevertheless, gliomas are highly invasive tumors with far extensions into the surrounding brain tissue. Thus, the extremly high rate of tumor relapse is due to tumor re-population by these invading cells. Seemingly further therapeutic modalities like radio-or chemotherapy, radio-immunotherapy or immunotoxins have to address this cell population. Consequently, it should be justified to minimize the ,,residual tumor burden\" by an optimized radical resection in order to gain time for additional therapeutic modalities and to enhance their efficiency. Prospective trials are in need to prove this hypothesis. 135 BRAIN METASTASIS - THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERDISCIPLINARY TREATMENT STRATEGIES G. Schackert, Neurosurgery (Dresden) Metastases to the brain occur in approximately 30 - 40% of all cancer patients. They comprise more than 30% of brain tumors. Most brain metastases originate from primary lung cancer (35%) and breast cancer (21%). Brain metastases are considered to represent the final stage in the metastasizing process. The goal in treating such patients is to eliminate the life-threatening brain lesion, while maintaining or optimizing quality of life. Patients with brain metastases used to be treated either by whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) or supportive care only. The median survival time without treatment ranged between 1 and 3 months, with WBRT between 3 and 6 months. Nowadays, treatment options comprise surgery, radiosurgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and supportive care only. The selection of the appropriate therapy depends on several prognostic factors: extracerebral tumor burden, number of cerebral metastases, age, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), time interval between the occurrence of the primary tumor and the development of brain lesions. During recent years, the development of neurosurgical techniques have led to the safe removal of metastases. Neuronavigation is one of the major advances, which enables to localize and remove small, deep-seeted and multiple lesions without causing additional neurological deficits. Therefore, not only single, but also multiple lesions can be approached by surgery in one session. While in multiple brain metastases WBRT with 30 to 36 Gy belongs to the standard treament, it is still a matter of debate, whether in single brain metastasis WBRT should follow after surgery. First results of a prospective randomized trial comparing surgery vs surgery + WBRT for solitary brain metastasis (Patchell 1998) did not result in a prolonged survival time applying both treatment options. Radiosurgery $7 Invited Speakers is the alternative to surgery as a targeted treatment modality. The indication, whether surgery or radiosurgery should be applied, depends on the size of the lesions (<3cm), the location, the age, and the KPS. Median survival times are comparable between both treatments amounting to 6 to 12 months. Considering cancer disease as a systemic metastasizing process chemo- and/or immunotherapy should be applied, whenever possible. In general, the treatment of the primary tumor will determine the choice of the medication. Supportive care only is justified in patients with rapidly progressing disease, high age and low KPS. 136 CADHERINS AND CATENINS: FUNCTIONAL RELEVANCE IN SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION TUMOR PROGRESSION J. Behrens, Nikolaus-Fiebiger-Center (Erlangen) Cadherins and catenins play pivotal roles in tumor development and progression. Loss of E-cadherin is associated with increased metastasis while activation of Wnt signaling through beta-catenin/TCF complexes is a key event in the development of various tumors, in particular colorectal and liver tumors. Wnt signaling is controlled by the negative regulator conductin/axin2/axil, which induces degradation of beta-catenin by functional interaction with the tumor suppressor APe and the serine/threonine kinase GSK3beta. Conductin is upregulated in human tumors that are induced by beta-catenin/Wnt signaling and in the APC- deficient intestinal tumors of Min mice. Inhibition of Wnt signaling by a dominant- negative mutant of TCF downregulated conductin but not the related protein, axin, in DLD1 colorectal tumor cells. Conversely, activation of Wnt signaling by Wnt-1 or dishevelled increased conductin levels in MDA MB 231 and Neuro2A cells, respectively. Upregulation of conductin followed beta-catenin stabilization in time course experiments. These results demonstrate that conductin is a target of the Wnt signaling pathway, and may be used as an early marker for tumorigenesis. Upregulation of conductin may constitute a negative feedback loop that controls Wnt signaling activity. 137 TIAM1-RAC SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION: FUNCTIONAL RELEVANCE FOR THE REGULATION OF cytoskeleton changes required for adhesion, migration and invasion of cells. Tiara1 specifically activates Rac, and earlier studies have demonstrated that Tiaml-Rac signaling affects migration and invasion in a cell-type- and cell- substrate-specific manner. In the present study, we examined the role of Tiaml- Rac signaling in migration and invasion of human carcinomas. Stable overexpression of Tiaml or constitutively active V12-Rac1 in a human renal cell carcinoma cell line (clearCa-28) and a human colon carcinoma cell line (DusCol- 1B) strongly inhibited cell migration by Blocking E-eadherin-mediated adhesion by E-cadherin-specific HAV- peptides allowed cells to migrate, but was not sufficient to antagonize Tiaml- and V12-Racl-induced inhibition of Matrigel invasion, suggesting that Rac may influence invasion also through other mechanisms. Indeed, Tiaml-mediated Rac activation induced transcriptional upregulation of of TIMP-2, whereas and activity levels of their counterparts, MMP-9 and MMP-2, respectively, were not affected. Application of recombinant TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 proteins significantly inhibited invasion of mock-transfected clearCa-28 cells, supporting a role of TIMPs in Rac-mediated of invasion. Transcriptional upregulation of TIMP- 1 by Tiara1 and Rac was mediated by Rac-induced formation of reactive oxygen species and the AP-1 transcription factor. Taken together, upregulation of TIMP- 1 and TIMP-2 is a new molecular mechanism through which increased Rac signaling may inhibit invasion of epithelial tumor cells. 138 CHEMOKINES: A MOLECULAR BASIS FOR ORGAN-SPECIFIC METASTASIS IN BREAST CANCER A. MQIler, B. Homey, H. Soto, N. Ge, D. Catron, M. Buchanan, T. McClanahan, E. Murphy, W. Yuan, S. Wagner, J. Barrera, A. Mohar, E. Verastegui, A. Zlotnik, Heinrich-Heine-Universit&t DL]sseldorf, Institute, Es- sen, Institute EOS Biotechnology (DQsseldorf; Pale Alto, Kalifornien, USA; Essen; Mexiko City, MEX) Metastasis is the result of multiple sequential steps and represents a highly organized, non-random and organ-selective process. Directional migration of tumor cells and invasive capacity as well are fundamental for the initiation of metastasis. Although a number of physiological molecules have been implicated in stimulating tumor cell motility and invasion, the precise mechanisms determin- ing the directional migration of tumor cells into specific organs remain to be established. Tumor cell migration and metastasis share many similarities with leukocyte trafficking, which is critically regulated by chemokines and their receptors. These secreted proteins act in a coordinated fashion with cell surface proteins, including integrins, to direct the specific homing pattern of the various subsets of hematopoietic cells to specific anatomical sites (e.g. lymph nodes). Human breast cancer is characterized by a distinct metastatic pattern preferen- tially involving the regional lymph nodes, bone marrow, lung and liver. Here, we report that among all known chemokine receptors, CXCR4 and CCR7, specifically, are highly expressed in human breast cancer cells, malignant breast tumors and metastases. Their corresponding ligands, CXCL12/SDF-1a (CXCR4) and CCL21/ 6Ckine (CCR7) exhibit peak levels of expression in organs that represent first destinations of breast cancer metastasis. In breast cancer cells, signaling through CXCR4 invasive responses. In vivo, neutralization of CXCL12/CXCR4 interactions significantly inhibited metastasis of breast cancer cells to regional lymph nodes and lung. Taken together, our findings indicate that chemokines and their receptors play a critical role in determining the metastatic destination of breast cancer cells. Currently, intense efforts are underway to identify small-molecule antagonists for many chemokine receptors. We propose that small molecule antagonists of chemokine receptors, such as CXCR4, may be useful to interfere with tumor progression and metastasis in patients with malig- nant diseases. 139 INTENSITY MODULATED (IMRT) IN T. Wendt, H. Salz, IMRT is a type of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). it is an advanced form of external beam irradiation which implies a new philosophy in treatment planning, new hard and soft ware for treatment planning but also new concepts of quality assurance. One prerequisit are 3D treatment planning capabilities which allows for the import of data from modern imaging techniques (CT, MRI, SPECT, PET) in treatament planning process. These data sets display the extent of the target volume and may give some additional insight in tumor biology. Uniform radiation beam intensity of conventional 3D-CRT is replaced by a intensity modulation of each beam contributing to the shape of isodoses. For IMRT it is essential that the physician clearly and quantitatively define the treatment objectives. Technically three different systems are in use: 1. step and shoot method, 2. compensator method, and 3. sliding window method. In clinical practice the aim of IMRT may be twofold: 1) reduction of radiation dose at organs at risk (OAR) normal tissues exposed to high doses using classical techniques, and 2) dose escalation within a distinct part of the target volume known to harbour high tumor burden, hypoxic tumor or any other adverse condition which makes tumor control less likely and increases the rate of recurrence. The objective of organ sparing is currently studied in few ongoing clinical studies. It is of particular interest to reduce doses at OAR e.g. salivary glands, auditory stuctures, gut and central nervous system. Dose volume histograms seem to be a reliable tool to study functional outcome of dose sparing. The objective of dose escalation without increasing late toxicity at OAR critically depends on knowledge of tumor extension. New imaging techiques may help to delineate the PTV more accurately. Late toxicity of normal tissues embedded in the high dose volume must be studied in careful clinical trials. All in all, this new process of planning and treatment delivery has significant potential for improving the therapeutic ratio and reducing toxicity. 140 MOLECULAR MODULATION IN RADIATION ONCOLOGY M. Baumann, D. Zips, M. Hessel, C. Petersen, Medizinische Fakult&t C. G. Carus, TU Dresden (Dresden) Considerable progress in radiation oncology during the last decades was achieved by technologica[ advances in treatment planning resulting in higher conformity of the dose distribution, optimisation of total dose and fractionation schedules, and by combining radiotherapy with surgery and chemotherapy. In addition preclinical and clinical studies could identify a number of important radiobiologieal mechanisms determining the radiation response of tumors and normal tissues. New compounds that modulate these radiobiological mechanisms on a molecular level offer promising possibilities to increase the therapeutic ratio either by an increase of the radiation effect on tumors end/or by a specific protection of normal tissues. Examples of approaches that might be useful to increase the response of tumors include inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptors, angiogenesis, and cyclooxygenase 2. The rationales underlying these approaches include an increase of the cellular radiosensitivity, minimisation of the repopulation of clonogenic tumor cells during treatment, and an increase of the cell loss resulting in a decreased tumor burden. Examples of specific modifiers of radiation induced normal tissue reactions are keratinocyte growth factor and the Bowman-Birk- proteinase-inhibitor. These substance influence the proliferative structur of epithelia and increase radioresistance in p53 wildtype cells. Preelinical examples will be presented to discuss the possibilities and limits of combining fractionated radiotherapy with molecular modifyers of the radiation response. 141 VACCINATION AGAINST HPV-RELATED CANCER L. Gissmann, DKFZ (Heidelberg) The causal association between so called high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) and certain types of human cancer (most notably tumors of the uterine cervix) has been firmly established. Consequently developments of HPV-specific vaccines are currently being pursued. During the natural history of cervical cancer there are different possible windows for vaccination: 1) Prevention of infection As demonstrated in studies with animal papillomaviruses neutralizing antibodies directed against the L1 major structural protein of the virus particle are protective against virus infection and also against tumor development. In most cases Immunization was performed with virus-like particles (VLP) which can be produced S8 Invited Speakers by expressing the L1 protein with the aid of recombinant vectors. Clinical trials with HPV 16 VLPs in humans demonstrated safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine. Analysis of clinical endpoints such as prevention of infection, CIN and ultimately cervical cancer will require a longer follow-up time. To obtain coverage within a population vaccination should be performed before onset of sexual activity and should include both females and males. 2) Prevention of diseaseAs persistent infection appears to be a prerequisite for development of a malignant tumor the viral proteins that are expressed during this state (e.g. E6, E7, El, E2) are potential targets for an immune response to eliminate the infection. In animal experiments immunization against the protein E7 has been most intensively studied. Protection against the growth of HPV transformed cells was obtained and it was recognized that this effect is conferred by specific cytotoxic T cells. Clinical trials are underway to induce an E7-specific T cell response aiming at the elimination of infected cells in women with or without clinical disease. As the target population for this vaccination strategy will consists of mostly young sexually active women that are at risk for reinfection or are potential carrier of infectious virus, it seems to be reasonable to induce a protective immunity via neutralizing antibodies as well. 3) Treatment of malignant disease Whereas the option of curing premalignant lesions even at a more severe stage (CIN II/lll) by HPV-specific vaccination is considered with optimism, treatment of full blown cervical cancer by immunotherapy will most likely only be achievable as adjuvant strategy along with other therapies. 142 HPV PROOF IN GYNECOLOGY A. Schneider, Frauenklinik der Friedrich-Schiller-Univ. Jena (Jena) Detection of high risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) for screening for high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cervical cancer is more sensitive com- pared to cytology, but less specific. In women negative for HPV, high grade CIN or cancer is extremely rare. Detection of HPV by self sampling is as sensitive as gynecologic cytologic smears. Triage of women with abnormal cytology by HPV detection is more cost efficient compared to repeated cytology. The risk of progression of low grade CIN is assessed by repeated HPV detection with high accuracy, but low specificity. Recurrence of CIN following conization is predicted with higher accuracy by HPV testing compared to cytology.Questions about the duration of protection following a negative HPV result, about life quality in connection with HPV detection and cost effectiveness must be answered before population- based HPV screening can be recommended.Keywords: HPV, human Papillomvirus, Screening, cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial der UniversitAt laboratory detection techniques show that human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are currently the most frequent causative organisms of sexually transmissible viral diseases. Not only cosmetically unattractive skin warts but also genital squamous epithelial carcinomas of both sexes may be caused by HPV infections. In contrast to other urological carcinomas, squamous epithelial carcinomas of the penis in particular may be associated with the same oncogenic HPV genotypes as cervical carcinoma. The high prevalence in the population, the sexual transmissibility and the oncogenic potential of individual HPV genotypes make HPV an extremely controversial topic of health policy, which is currently concerned with the diagnosis, the treatment and the prophylaxis of HPV infections.In the field of urology, HPV infections play an important role, primarily in the clarification of sexually transmitted diseases in couples as well as in the diagnosis and therapy of urethral HPV diseases. Depending on the sensitivity of the various methods of detection, HPV infections of the urethra are found in up to 50% of the sexually active population, mainly in a latent form. So far, the recommendation for routine HPV laboratory screening of the urethra cannot be justified in view of the data presently available. In contrast to gynecology, laboratory methods for HPV diagnosis in urology are only justified in research.it was fluorescence endoscopy that first allowed clinical marking and specifically targeted treatment of subclinical HPV lesions of the urethra. These can be found in just under 30% of patients in whom urethral condylomata acuminata can be readily detected. Analogous to acetic acid labelling of the external genitals, fluorescence urethroscopy is a very sensi- tive technique, but its specifity is limited. As a result of the better overview in the treament of HPV lesions in the urethra, a more complete clearance of the HPV from the urethra should be facilitated by this method.Epithelial dysplasias and intraepithelial neoplasias are largely unknown in the urethra despite the demonstrated presence of high risk HPV genotypes. HPV-associated urethral carcinomas are exceedingly rare and occur only in the distal parts of the male urethra. The oncogenic potency of HPV appears to have clinical consequences far more rarely in men than in women. In men, it involves in paticular the relatively rare squamous cell carcinomas of the penis. 144 RANDOMIZED PHASE-Ill IN STAGE IV NON-SMALL=CELL LUNG CANCER (NSCLC) - AN ONGOING TRIAL OF THE AUSTRIAN SOCIETY FOR THE STUDY OF LUNG CANCER (\"AASLC\") AND THE GERMAN ASSOCIATION FOR MEDICAL ONCOLOGY (\"AIO\"). W. Eberhardt, R. Pirker, R. Buhl, P. Micke, Fischer, A. Mohn-Staudtner, W. Pfeiffer, P. Benisch, E Kummer, S. Schmeikal, combination chemotherapy (CTx) represents standard of care for patients (pts) with stage IV NSCLC with adequate PS and without major contraindications to P-treatment. During the last years, several new drugs with activity against NSCLC (eg. gemcitabine (G), vinorelbine (N), paclitaxel (T), docetaxel) have been developed and at the moment combinations of them with P are frequently used in Europe and North America based on their favourable toxicity profiles. However, with these new drugs now available, the value of P on overall survival, time to progression, different symptom control as well as life-quality parameters has been questioned. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This trial is looking at an improvement of survival (three months) between a non-P arm and two study arms, both based on E In arm A (non-P) up to four cycles G and N are sequentially followed by up to four cycles of single agent T. Arm B is testing a three drug regimen based on P (cisplatin(CIS)/N/ G; 4-6-(max)-8 cycles). Arm C includes the widely accepted combination of CIS and T (4-6(max)-8 cycles), in all three arms, a second-line treatment of mitomycin and ifosfamide is recommended. RESULTS: At the time of this writing (15/12/01) 165 pts (of 492 planned) have been entered to this trial and randomized. So far, 11 study centers in Austria (6) and Germany (5) have accrued pts and 4 more have recently been activated to participation. Ongoing toxicity monitoring of pts data has not found any serious event within each of the three arms justifying treatment modifications or arm/ study discontinuation. Treatment has shown to be feasible and active in the multicenter setting with symptom control and life quality data recorded to give detailed insight into palliative parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This large German/Austrian cooperative group trial will give important results whether it is still justified to include P into the palliative treatment of stage IV NSCLC. 145 RATIONALE AND DESIGN OF RANDOMIZED TRIALS IN RESECTABLE STAGE III NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER M. Thomas, P. Broermann, C. Dr6ge, D. Riesenbeck, M. with allover 5-year survival rates not overriding 13% in the past decades, is remaining a therapeutical challenge. Younger patients (< 70 years) with locally ad-vanced NSCLC and a good performance status (ECOG 0,1) have survival benefits in multimodality treatment approaches compared to sole Iocoregional treatment. Thus, further development of these treatment algorithms in randomized trials is necessary. With the aim to improve local control and to render unresectable disease resectable preoperative radiation in addition to chemotherapy has been introduced in the neoadjuvant treatment setting of stage Ill-disease. Some pivotal phase II - trials emphasized a favourable histomorphologic response in the resection specimens as the most important predictor for long term outcome. For patients with complete resection and a favorable histomorphologic response 3-year survival rates ran- ging from 40 to 60% have been reported. On the other hand treatment related lethality rates grew up to 10 % and might have been aggravated due to chemoradiation. At present the German Lung Cancer Cooperative Group is running a trial that compares in stage IIIA/IIIB chemotherapy followed by twice-daily chemoradiation prior to surgery versus chemotherapy alone followed by surgery and then radiotherapy. This trial might contribute to elucidate the impact of preoperative chemoradiation on resectability, the extent of tumor downstaging and its translation into a survival benefit. The West German Cancer Centre group is testing the value of another complex induction chemoradiotherapy protocol in operable, minimal IliA disease versus a more conserva-tive and standard ,,local treatment only\" approach. As pointed out, even in patients with complete resection, the extent of histomorphologic response was pivotal for long term survival. This gives rise to speculate in this treatment setting on the necessity of additional resection to eliminate residual disease in areas of former tumor bulk. Yet a high priority North American Intergroup Trial (INT 0139) randomizes stage IliA patients after concomitant chemoradiation as induction to surgery versus further chemoradiation. Moreover EORTC (EORTC 08941) is cur-rently conducting a trial that randomizes stage IliA patients after response to chemotherapy to commence further treatment with surgery or radiotherapy. The rationale, the design, and - as far as available - the interim results of these trials will be presented. 146 CHART(WEL) IN THE TREATMENT OF INOPERABLE NSCLC M. Baumann, S. Appold, T. Herrmann, Medizinische Fakult~.t C. G. Carus, TU Dresden (Dresden) Experimental studies and randomised clinical trials demonstrate that local tumor control decreases with increasing overall treatment time of fractionated radiotherapy. Most likely rapid repopulation of clonogenic tumor cells during treatment is the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon. The randomised CHART (continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy)-bronchus trial (NSCLC I-IIIb) sponsored by the MRC (UK) showed that shortening of the overall treatment time of radiotherapy from 6 weeks (60 Gy/2 Gy per fraction) to 12 consecutive days (3 x 1.5 Gy per day to a total dose of 54 Gy) resulted in a significant improvement of the 2-year survival rate by 9%. Explorative analysis revealed that the advantage of CHART was most pronounced in squamous cell carcinoma. The survival benefit was explained by improved Ioco-regional tumor control. In squamous cell carcinoma also the rate of secondary distant metastases was decreased after CHART. Early $9 Invited Speakers normal tissue reactions (esophagitis) were more pronounced after CHART, however these reactions also resolved earlier and did not result in long term sequelae. Clinical and radiological signs of pneumonitis and fibrosis were not different between both treatment arms. In a phase I/ll-trial survival rates similar to the CHART trial were achieved with the more economical and possibly also radiobiologically advantegous CHARTWEL (CHART weekend less) regimen (3 x 1.5 Gy per day to 60 Gy in 2.5 w), despite of the fact that the tumors on average were more advanced (50% stage Illb). These promising results are the basis of the currently ongoing phase III CHARTWEL-bronchus trial (ARe 97-1). 147 PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF ONCOLOGY IN THE ELDERLY L. Pientka, Marienhospital Herne (Herne) Psychosocial factors are important in the diagnosis and treatment proc-ess of elderly oncological patients. Unfortunately, the biological disease-model is not adequate for the conceptualization of this specific perspec-tive because functional aspects are neglected. Therefore, a biopsycho-social model like the ICIDH (Inter- national Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps) is more adequate and sensitive for the incor-poration of functional deficits in the treatment of elderly patients. Stan-dardized assessments of functional capability of all relevant dimensions are key elements in successful treatment and discharge planing. Individ-ual biographic aspects as specific psychological coping strategies in eld- erly patients become more relevant than in younger patients. Main target in care of the elderly is the individual quality of life (QOL). QOL-issues must consider the physical, psychological and social functioning of the individual, as well as disease and treatment-related symptoms. For an elderly person QOL depends principally on his or her self-sufficiency and social factors such as family support. Treatment decisions must therefore consider these aspects carefully. 148 MEDICAL ONCOLOGICAL THERAPY OF ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH CANCER U. Wedding, Klinik und Poliklinik fer Innere Medizin II (Jena) Over the next few decades the number of elderly patients with cancer will increase significantly. Until now, elderly patients have been widely ignored in clinical studies for cancer therapy: Differences between old and young patients with cancer may be diagnosed in three areas. The biological characteristics of the cancer may show differences between elder and younger patients. The somatic situation is marked by an age-related decline in physiological organ functions, the existence of co-morbidities, the necessity of co-medication, restrictions of the functional status and reduced remaining life expectancy. Additionally, there are typical changes in the psychosocial situation. Frequently, routine diagnostics don't assess these changes. Thus, they shourd be diagnosed in addition to the cancer-related assessment, using a geriatric-oncological assessment framework. The assessed changes are important indicators for the prognosis related to cancer and for the tolerability of a medical-oncological therapy. This document presents the first published results of the integration of a geriatric-oncological assessment into studies on the treatment of elderly patients with cancer. Decisions about the medical treatment of elderly patients within the scope of an nedical- oncological therapy shouldn't be made regarding their actual age, but should be based upon the changes diagnosed within the framework of a standardised geriatric-oncological assessment. 149 ON STRUCTURAL QUALITY IN REHABILITATION OF CANCER PATIENTS L. Schmid, H. Delbr~Jck, of rehabilitation is exclusively achieved by reaching previously defined aims of therapy. These aims can only be accomplished if the necessary structural quality is provided. a) General structural prerequisites independent of diagnosis: -An appropriate number of rooms (e.g. for group and single therapy, physiotherapy, balneophysiotherapy, functional and creative ergotherapy) -technical equipment (for clinical chemistry including stat tests, ECG, sonography, conventional x-ray) -highly qualified staff that comes up in quality and quantity with the special therapeutical needs of cancer patients b)Specific structural qualities for tumor patients, orientated on the needs and troubles of certain oncological patients: -special means of diagnosis and therapy (e.g. endoscopy, language laboratory, equipment for gynaecological examinations, lymph therapy, stoma care, spirometry, uroflow, etc.) -and most important specially qualified gynaecology, urology, neurology, haematooncology, therapists of stoma, Iogopedists) In order to provide the necessary structural qualities, it is inevitable to treat a certain minimum of patients per year in each group of diagnosis. The optimal treatment and outcome of therapy can only be reached if these prerequisites are met and the appropriate patient is sent to the adequate rehabilitation hospital. 150 QUALITY OF THE REHABILITATION PROCESS IN CANCER PATIENTS H.H. Bartsch, Klinik for Tumorbiologie (Freiburg) Medical and psychosocial rehabilitation of cancer patients is deeply integrated into the German health system.In curative treated cancer patients the main goals of rehabilitation include recovery from physical impairments,adaptation to functional disabilities and improvement of psychosocial functioning, including the ability to go back to work.The quality of the rehabilitation process is detemined by institutional and personal factors,the rehabilitation program with its adjustment to individual needs and mechanisms to control the goal attainment. The major aspects of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures will be described as well as several factors influencing the quality of this process. Although there is a systematic quality management of German rehabilitation clinics, their therapeutic programs and the individual benefit since 1995, several problems need to be solved. The percentage of outpatient rehabilitation facilities for cancer patients is still too small,the identification of rehabilitation needs often missing and the cooperation with acute hospitals unsatisfying. 151 THE ROLE OF APOPTOSIS IN CYTOSTATIC RESISTANCE P.H Krammer, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (Heidelberg) CD95, member the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily induces apoptosis upon receptor oligomerization. The receptor and its ligand are important for apoptosis of peripheral T cells, for downregulation of an immune response and most likely, at least in part, also for peripheral T cell tolerance. In Aids, apoptosis mediated by this system might contribute to the depletion of T helper lymphocytes. Likewise, in diseases in which liver cells are destroyed the CD95 system might play a major role. In a search to identify the intracellular signalling pathway of CD95 several molecules coupling to oligomerized CD95 were immunoprecipitated from apoptosis-sensitive human leukemic T cell and lymphoblastoid B cell lines. The following binding molecules were only associated with aggregated and not with monomeric CD95: phosphorylated FADD (MORT1) and caspase 8. Thus, identified as the most CD95 receptor proximal protease which starts the cascade of protease reactions important for CD95-mediated apoptosis. Association of FADD and caspase 8 truncated non-signalling CD95. FADD FLICE did also with a CD95 cytoplasmic tail carrying the Iprcg amino acid replacement. FADD and caspase 8 form a death- inducing signalling complex (DISC) with the CD95 receptor and are, thus, the first CD95 associating proteins of a signalling cascade mediating apoptosis.The function of the DISC is discussed in detail, particularly with respect to its role in sensitivity and resistance to apoptosis. The CD95 death system plays a role in destruction of liver tissue. ]n hepatitis cytotoxic T lymphocytes might use the CD95 system to kill infected hepatocytes. In M. Wilson copper overload leads to upregulation of the CD95 ligand that may finally contribute to acute liver failure. In HCC from patients treated with chemotherapeutic drugs the CD95 receptor and ligand are upregulated and may contribute to apoptosis of the tumor or, dependent on the drug sensitivity of the tumor, to the status of the tumor as an immunoprivileged site. 152 THERAPY RESISTANCE IN GERM CELL CANCER: MOLECULAR MECHANISMS AND CLINICAL TRIAL C. Bokemeyer, F. Mayer, S. Koch, J.T. Hartmann, C. Kollmannsberger, Universit#.tsklinik (GCT) of all histological subtypes with the exception of mature teratoma are highly sensitive to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Recent investigations have shown that this finding can neither be attributed to the level of functioning p53 in GCT ceils nor to the inactivation of p53 by mdm2. Chemosensitivity and refractoriness were investigated by screening formalin fixed tumor samples of 40 unselected germ cell tumor patients for biological markers potentially influencing cisplatin activity by either drug inactivation (methallothionein, glutathion-S-transferase), drug export (lung resistance protein), DNA-damage recognition (DNA mismatch repair factors hMLH1 and hMSH2), cell cycle control (P21, retinoblastoma protein) and apoptosis (BCL-2, BCL-XL, BAX). Additionally 21 samples from patients with clinically refractory disease were analyzed. The interpretation of the results leads to the hypothesis that chemosensitivity of GCT is related to a cellular composition favoring cell death after cisplatin treatment on multiple levels. The investigation of mismatch repair pathways will be of interest with respect to treatment resistance. In the clinics, several new cytotoxic drugs have been studied for the treatment of cisplatin-refractory GCT patients: paclitaxel, gemcitabin and oxaliplatin have all been found to achieve response rates up to 20% in heavily pretreated refractory patients, even in those patients relapsing after autologous PBSCT. In contrast, vinorelbine, bendamustine irinotecan did not show clinical activity Jn this subset of patients. Molecular treatment approaches based on tyrosine-kinase-inhibition do not seem promising due to the lack of appropriate molecular targets (EGFR-receptor, c-kit or Her2-Neu expression) for this approach. An ongoing phase II study of the German Testicular Cancer Study Group evaluates the combination of oxaliplatin plus gemcitabine in refractory patients in order to improve their prognosis. $10 Invited Speakers 153 PHARMACOGENOMICS - READY FOR CLINICAL APPLICATION? M. Stanulla, M. Schrappe, Medizinieche Hochschule Hannover (Hannover) Hereditary differences in drug effects and side effects are a well known clinical phenomenon. In oncology, genetic polymorphisms for crucial metabolizing enzymes might explain the heterogeneous response to chemotherapy which is even observed in genetically homogeneous subgroups. Basically, all mechanisms can be involved which are responsible for drug uptake, activation, detoxification, or elimination. For the activation of cytostatic drugs, phase I-enzymes from the cytochrom P450 complex are responsible, whereas phase II-enzymes are essential for the detoxification. In ALL therapy, the thiopurinmethyltransferase (TPMT: reducing the cytotoxic active thioguanin nucleotides) is one example of an important deactivating enzyme, and the group of glutathion-S-transferases (GSTs) is a relevant example for detoxifying enzymes. The level of enzyme activity depends on the presence of the crucial alleles (two active alleles, or one active and one inactive allele, each, or two (non-active) null alleles). Due to the large number of involved enzymes it is often difficult to link the genetic data to clinical results. The toxicity observed during treatment with 6- mercaptopurine or thioguanine could be correlated to the enzyme activity and the presence of the various corresponding alleles of TPMT. Severe treatment related toxicity could be prevented by identifying the (rare) null genotype of TPMT. For GSTs, the data are heterogenuous depending of the disease entity investigated. In childhood ALL, however, case control studies of our group could demonstrate that genetic polymorphisms for subgroups of GSTs correlate with initial response to therapy and with risk of relapse (Stanulla et al., BLOOD 2000; Anderer et al., Pharmacogenetics 2000). In the ongoing trial ALL-BFM 2000, these observations are reevaluated prospectively for GSTs. Preliminary data confirm that the presence of null alleles in GSTF1 correlate with the probability of an adequate early therapy response. Combined results from pharmacogenetic and functional expression analysis may be used in the future to adapt treatment. 154 CYTOGENETIC ABERRATIONS AND GENE EXPRESSION PROFILING IN ACUTE LEUKEMIAS Philipps Universit~.t Marburg (Marburg) Besides age, play prognostic factors. Aberrations in acute myeloid leukemias (AML) targeting transcription factor complex CBF are associated with a favourable prognosis, such as translocation t (8;21) and inversion inv 16 or t (16;16). Also, t (15;17), which itself is observed in AML M3, harbours a good prognosis. In contrast, deletions of chromosomes 5 and 7 or complex aberrations, as well as t (9;22) and t (6;9) are poor prognostic factors. In a study of CALBG it was shown that high dose cytarabine reveals it's beneficial effect especially in patients with CBF-positive AML (Bloomfield et aL, Cancer Res 1998). In acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), cytogenetic poor factors are t (9;22) and t (4;11). For all others, data are not as clear. Cytogenetics as well as molecular cytogenetics thus plays a major role in determining prognosis and sometimes therapy in acute leukemias. However, common signal transduction pathways causing leukemic expansion rarely can be detected through these parameters. Gene array technology offers the advantage of analysing several thousand genes (,,expression profiling\") of a given leukemia at a certain time point. Also, analysis can be performed before and after therapy, thus analysing molecular pathways in response to therapy. In diffuse large cell lymphomas, it has already been shown that gene expression profiling reveals significant differences with regard to biology, as well as prognosis (Alizadeh et al., Nature 2000). Recent data in acute leukemias show that not only these techniques can be used to determine the biology of leukemias, but also that significant expression differences between normal karyotypes and patients with AML with trisomy 8 can be found (Virfaneva et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci 2001). Whether these techniques can also be used to detect prognostic differences remains to be determined in clinical trials. 155 MOLECULAR MECHANISMS AND KINETICS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANGIOGENESIS angiogenesis have been elucidated in great detail. The interaction of VEGF with its tyrosine kinase receptors VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 has been identified as master switch of the angiogenic cascade. The angiopoietins and their receptor Tie-2 as well as the Ephrins and their Eph receptors act at a somewhat later stage of neovessel formation, orchestrating a number of poorly understood processes related to vessel assembly, vessel maturation, and acquisition of vessel identity. Based on an increasing understanding of the angiogenic cascade, various strategies have been employed to develop antivascular therapies aimed at inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. In fact, close to 50 different antiangiogenic substances are presently in clinical trials (some in phase III). In view of the fast pace with which antiangiogenic substances are moving towards clinical application, surprisingly little is known about the nature and the functional status of the angiogenic vascular bed in human tumors. Microvessel density (MVD) counting techniques are used widely to assess the vascular bed in human tumors. However, MVD counts assess the vascular status of a tissue or tumor, but do not reflect the angiogenic process. In order to assess quantitative parameters of tumor angiogenesis, we have performed an extensive angiokinetic analysis in human and in experimental tumors. Assessing angiogenesis on the basis of endothelial cell (EC) proliferation revealed significant differences in the intensity of angiogenesis between different tumor types (glioblastomas > renal cell carcinomas > colon carcinomas > mammary carcinomas > lung carcinomas > prostate carcinomas) as well as a marked heterogeneity within individual groups of tumors. When relating the intensity of angiogenesis to individual patient's prognosis (recurrence, 5 year survival), close to 80% of mammary carcinoma patients with EC proliferation indices of >10% had a poor prognosis confirming the role of active angiogenesis for tumor progression. Taken together, the data support the notion that angiogenesis is one of the most important tumor progression factors. However, we propose that clinical application of antiangiogenic therapies will require the establishment and implementation of diagnostic tools assessing the angiogenesis status of a tumor patient in order to identify those patients who will benefit most from antiangiogenic intervention. Supported by Dtsch. Krebshilfe and GB) Inhibition of angiogenesis represents a therapeutic approach that may be applica- ble to the treatment of all solid turnouts. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key angiogenic factor implicated in tumour blood vessel formation. We have sought to abrogate VEGF signal transduction in endothelial cells (ECs) by inhibiting VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity with a small molecule amenable to oral administration. ZD6474 is a small molecular weight inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of the endothelial cell receptor VEGFR-2 (KDR/flk). This activity translates into potent inhibition of VEGF induced endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation in vitro (IC50 = 60 nM). Chronic, once-daily, oral administration of ZD6474 (12.5 to 100 mg/kg/day) produces consistent, highly significant, broad-spectrum in vivo activity in human turnout models (lung, breast, ovarian, vulval, prostate, colon). This compound was further examined in tumour xenografts with larger pre-treatment volumes (0.5 to 1.5 cm3) and was again shown to inhibit turnout growth or, in the case of PC-3, to induce tumour regression. To further confirm that the observed anti-turnout effects were due to inhibition of VEGF-signalling and vivo, a number of pharmacody- namic endpoints known to be dependant on VEGF signalling were examined (e.g. vascular invasion of plate growth during long-bone extension, regulation of cular rats). The results obtained with ZD6474 in these assays were entirely consistent with the inhibition of VEGF signalling and thus provide support for this as the in vivo mode of action. ZD6474 is currently the focus of a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with malignant solid tumours refractory to standard therapy. The primary objective of this study is to assess the tolerability and toxicity of the agent following chronic, once daily, oral administration. In addition further studies to assess the biological and clinical activity of ZD6474 are ongoing. 157 ANTIBODY-BASED TARGETING OF ANGIOGENESIS D. Neri, ETH ZQrich (ZL~rich, CH) Angiogenesis, i.e., the proliferation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, is an underlying process in many human diseases, including cancer, blinding ocular disorders and rheumatoid arthritis. The ability to selectively target and occlude neovasculature will be potentially useful in diagnosis and treatment of angiogenesis-related diseases. A good-quality marker for both tumoural and non-tumoural neovasculature is the extra-domain B (ED-B) of fibronectin, a sequence of 91 aminoacids that can be inserted into the fibronectin molecule by a mechanism of alternative splicing. To date, the production of monoclonal antibodies directly recognising the ED-B domain has not been possible using hybfidoma technology, because of tolerance. In collaboration with Prof. Dr. Luciano Zardi (Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genova, Italy), we have overcome this problem using large synthetic antibody phage libraries, generating several high-affinity antibody fragments specific for fibronectin containing the ED-B domain, and mapping their epitope onto the three-dimensional structure of the antigen. These antibodies stain vascular structures in tumour sections and selectively target tumour neovasculature, as shown in tumour-bearing mice using infrared fluorescence and radioactive techniques. Increased binding affinity leads to improved targeting of tumoural angiogenesis, as demonstrated by biodistributions studies performed using the L19 antibody fragment with affinity for the ED-B domain in the picomolar range and L19 mutants with reduced affinity. ]n this lecture, I will present therapy results obtained in tumour-bearing mice treated with a number of L19-based fusion proteins. Fusion partners for the L19 antibody include tTF (a pro-coagulant factor) and anti-tumor cytokines. The results obtained are of therapeutic relevance, since the ED-B domain of fibronectin, a naturally-occurring marker of angiogenesis identical in mouse and man, is expressed in the majority of aggressive solid turnouts, but is undetectable in normal vessels and tissues. $11 Invited Speakers 158 ALLOGENEIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION FOR CML: IF, WHEN AND HOW? A. Gratwohl, Kantonsspital Basel, Department Internal Medicine (Basel, CH) AIIogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been considered treatment of choice for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It is the only form of therapy which allows consistently durable molecular remissions. How- ever, HSCT is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Fifteen to 50% or more of the patients succumb to complications of the transplant, 70% to less than 20% survive at plus 15 years. Age, stage of the disease, histocompatibility between donor and recipient, donor and recipient sex combination and time from diagnosis to transplant decide outcome. Results are best, if HSCT are undertaken as early in the disease as possible. This contrasts with the fact, that patients feel well at this stage and that effects of treatment are not yet fully evaluated. The risk of \"loss of early years of life\" has to be balanced against \"gain of late years in life\". The dilemma has been accentuated by the introduction of the specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (GlivecR) and intensity conditioning regimens for HSCT. GlivecR provides a new tool to achieve cytogenetic and, probably, molecular remissions; low intensity conditioning trans- plants reduce early mortality. Both procedures are tempting, adequate follow up, however, is lacking for both of them. The CML study group is currently evaluating best treatment in a prospective controlled study (CML IV). It includes availability of an HLA- identical donor (sibling or unrelated), the risk of transplant related mortal- ity by the EBMT risk score and the risk profile of the disease by the Hasford score. Patients with high Hasford scores or very young patients with low EBMT scores should proceed as early as possible to HSCT if a donor is available. Patients with low or intermediate Hasford score should be given a trial with interferon a or GlivecR first and be transplanted only if no cytogenetic remission is achieved after 6 (GlivecR) to 12 (interferon a) months of treatment or upon disease progres- sion in patients with initial response. Patients with low EBMT scores should undergo HSCT with full, patients with high EBMT scores with low intensity condi- tioning. Patients with CML should be treated with an individualised concept, based on their specific risk profile and early treatment response. 159 CYTOGENETIC AND MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS IN CML C. Schoch, leukemia (CML) is characterized by the BCR-ABL rearrangement that is mostly due to a translecstion between the long arm of chromosome 9 and the long arm of chromosome 22. The BCR-ABL gene encodes a chimeric protein with elevated tyrosine kinase activity, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. For the diagnosis of CML and for monitoring of treatment response the detection of the t(9;22)(q34;q11) or the BCR-ABL- rearrangement is mandatory. The genetic defect in CML can be detected at the level of chromosomes, the fusion gene, the chimeric RNA or altered structure of the protein. Cytogenetics is still the goldstandard for the diagnosis and follow up of CML patients, but newer techniques like FISH, qualitative and quantitative RT- PCR have been evaluated in clinical routine and can supplement or replace cytogenetics in certain settings. The major advantage of chromosome analysis compared to FISH and RT-PCR is the possibility to detect chromosome aberrations in addition to the Philadelphia-translocation that may have prognostic impact. On the other hand, chromosome banding analysis is cumbersome, time consuming, labor intensive and dependent on high numbers of viable, dividing cells. For FISH and RT-PCR less cells are needed and also cryptic BCR-ABL-rearrangements that are missed by banding studies can be detected. Furthermore, RT-PCR based techniques are about 1000 to 10O00fold more sensitive to pick up residual CML cells. This is important for follow up studies after therapy. Hypermetaphase FISH, which combines a modified preparation of metaphases with FISH and real-time PCR procedures have also added important information especially during follow up. A study comparing cytogenetics, interphase-FISH, hypermetaphase FISH, qualitative RT-PCR and real time PCR in 350 CML patients revealed a good correlation of results and showed that all techniques are applicable for the determination of clinical response. The sensitivity of methods for the detection of minimal residual disease varies broadly between methods with nested RT-PCR being the most sensitive technique. 160 EVIDENCE BASED THERAPY OF CML: INTERFERON ALPHA, STI571, OR BMT? A. Hochhaus, IIl.Med.Klinik (Mannheim) Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 that produces the Philadelphia chromosome. Typical symptom is the marked proliferation of myeloid cells that mature normally. Invariably there is a disease progession, with loss of the capacity for terminal differentiation by the hematopoietic stem cell, resulting in acute leukemia. Treatment options have become more complex in recent years, allogeneic stem cell transplantation still the only curative option. International data show that interferon- alpha (IFN) prolongs life in CML patients, as compared to hydroxyurea. Low risk patients after IFN treatment have a 10 year survival of 40%. According to the evidence based guidelines for the therapy of CML the combination of IFN and hydroxyurea with or without low dose ara-C is the standard treatment for chronic phase CML, if no allogeneic stern cell transplantation is requested. In case of IFN failure, new therapies based on the causative molecular abnormality of CML are showing great promise. The 2-phenylpyrimid[ne derivative imatinib (Glivec, formerly ST[571) is a rationally designed administered selective inhibitor of the BCR- ABL tyrosine kinase activity through competitive ATP binding pocket interactions. Phase tl data demonstrate stable hematologic responses in 95% interferon refractory chronic phase (CP), 71% accelerated phase (AP) and 31% blast crisis (BC) patients. Major cytogenetic remissions have been observed in 60% CP, 26% AP and 15% myeloid BC patients. However, long term observation and phase III data is needed to confirm that response data result in prolongation of survival. Acute side effects are common but mild in most patients; data on long term adverse effects are still missing. Various molecular and cytogenetic mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Monotherapy with imatinib may select for clones with acquired resistance, such as mutations of the ATP binding site. In vitro data suggest synergistic or additive efficacy of combinations of chemotherapeutic drugs with imatinib. Combination trials in CP and BC are ongoing. Therapy of CML patients with imatinib is feasible, effective, and well tolerated in patients after IFN failure or advanced disease. However, the available data represent response rates. Until survival data are available, the evidence based recommendations will remain valid. 161 SUICIDE GENE THERAPY OF GLIOBLASTOMAS G. Schackert, Klinik f0r Neurochirurgie (Dresden) The glioblastoma multiforme is one of the most malignant tumors in man. The median survival time ranges between 12 and 15 months with standard treatment regimen such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy Advanced gene therapy approaches focus on cytokine gene, suicide gene and tumor suppressor gene expression. Most of the gene therapies are still in the experimental stage. In 1993 Culver and Ram introduced the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK)/ Ganciclovir system in glioblastoma patients. The infection of the tumor cells was achieved by retroviral gene transfer. The viral vectors were delivered by a packaging cell line. In a first international multicenter phase I/ll trial the efficacy of the new treatment was evaluated with respect to the biosafety and the median survival time in patients with recurrent glioblastomas. The results were promising. Survival time could be slightly improved. The biosafety of the treatment was confirmed. However, in the following international multicenter phase III trial no survival advantage could be demonstrated compared to the standard treatment. One of the main obstacles of this gene therapy was the low transductien rate of tumor cells.Cytosinedeaminase (CD) gene is another suicide gene, which is used in gene therapy trials, known in the treatment of various cancers. CD converts 5-Fluorcytosine into 5-Fluoruracil. It has been shown in experimental studies of malignant glioma cells that the combined transfection of HSV-tk and CD render tumor cells more sensitive to radiotherapy, enhancing the cytotoxic effect of the suicide gene expression. The co-transfection of a suicide gene with a cytokine gene has been the subject of various investigations. The combined approach has the advantage of, beside its cytotoxic effect of the suicide gene, activating the immune response within the tumor, leading to immuno-cytotoxicity. Most of the studies are still in their expe- rimental stage; clinical trials are rare. One of the major problems in gene therapy is the transfer of genes into tumor cells. Retroviral transfer can only reach dividing cells. Viral vectors have been engineered to be replication- incompetent, in order to prevent uncontrolled spread. Recent investigations concentrate on adenoviral and herpes simplex viral gene transfer with modification of the viral vectors and improvement of the prodrug-suicide gene systems. 162 THE BMPD STUDY WITH J. C. Peschel, R. Passold, B. MLJnchen, Potsdam) The prognosis of nonimmunocompromised patients with PCNSL can significantly be improved by treatment with high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX)-based chemotherapy (CHT) as compared with WBI alone. Late neurotoxicity is the major treatment-related problem especially after both CHT and WBI. Eliminating the use of WBI might significantly diminish the risk of long-term neurotoxicity, but, on the other hand, result in an increased relapse rate. Our world-wide first randomised multicenter trial addresses the question of the role of adjuvant WBI after CHT in primary management of PCNSL. The primary CHT regimen (BMPD) incorporated dl- 14, and intrathecal MTX dl in course 1 only (repeated only in pts with positive CSF cytology). A salvage CHT with idarubicine 12 mg/m2 dl and ifosfamide 3g/m2 d2 or cytarabine 2x3g/m2 dl-2 was given to patients who failed to achieve CR after 3 BMPD courses. Patients in CR were randomly asigned to WBI with 45 Gy or one additional CHT course. Patients without CR were treated by rescue WBI. Sixty patients (55 assessable) were included. Only 26 patients were randomized: 14 in adjuvant CHT and 12 in adjuvant WBI. Preliminary results are summarized in the Table. $12 Invited Speakers Table: Therapy results Response to 36/55 patients (65.5%) thrombopenia in Infection WHO grade >3 occurred in 17/55 patients (31%). The study was closed prematurely when it became obvious that the projected number of 190 patients in 3 years could net be reached. The role of WBI in patients with PCNSL is now being evaluated in a phase IV randomized study with HD-MTX only in primary therapy (leucoverin-rescue start after 24 h) and randomized rescue treatment with WBI versus HD-cytarabine. 163 THE NOA-03 primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) has made significant progress due to the combination of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and methotrexate (MTX)-based chemotherapy. However, the combination of MTX with WBRT induces a high rate of late neurotoxicity. Thus, after encouraging results in previous unicenter trials, the German multi-center NOA-03 trial investigated the role of high-dose MTX therapy alone as first-line therapy for patients with PCNSL. Thirty-seven adult, immunocompetent patients, 37-73 years old, with histologically proven PCNSL received 8 g/m2 MTX as a 4 h infusion on a biweekly base with leucevorin rescue starting 24 h after the start of MTX infusion. MTX treatment was stopped upon progressive disease (PD), inacceptable toxicity, or if complete remission (CR) had not been achieved after 6 courses. One hundred and seventy-nine courses MTX were applied. In an intention-to-treat analysis, 11/ 37 patients (29.7%) achieved CR. Two patients had partial response, one patient had stable disease after 6 courses MTX, and 14/37 patients (37.8%) had PD upon MTX therapy. Nine patients were not evaluable for response after 6 courses of MTX: Two patients declined further treatment before completing 6 courses, one patient was excluded from the protocol due to a severe protocol violation, 5 patients were taken off the protocol due to transient moderate renal insufficiency or markedly prolonged leucoverin rescue beyond 10 days, and 1 patient died from therapy-related septicaemia on day 6 after his first MTX-ceurse. The induction of CR was not associated with expression of Ki67 or bcl-2 in tumor cells, or the detection of CD3 or CD68 in tumor infiltrates but was associated with steroid medication during the first course MTX (odds ratio 5.15). Of eleven patients achieving CR, 9 relapsed after a median of 14 months. Of 10 evaluable patients receiving WBRT as salvage therapy, 7 had CR and 1 had PR. With follow-up not yet complete in some patients, the overall median survival is 28.8 months so far. Toxicity was low with high-grade toxicity (mainly elevation of transaminases) occurring in 10.6% courses and 52.5% of courses without toxicity. In conclusion, the excellent results of previous studies with high-dose MTX were net reproduced in the NOA-03 study and the reasons for that remain largely unclear. A further randomized trial has to clarify whether WBRT can be safely delayed until relapse in patients with PCNSL. 164 HYPERTHERMIA TECHNIQUES P. Wust, R. Felix, P.M. Schlag, Charit6, Charit6 - Robert-RSssle-Klinik (Berlin) Planning and optimisation studies on three-dimensional patient models have shown that three-dimensional antenna configurations (e.g. 12 antennas) permit better steering of the power distribution and, consequently, higher and better temperature distributions. At present, only one type of 12-channel applicator is commercially available, called SIGMA-Eye applicator (BSD Corp.). We tested the technical preconditions to achieve these optimistic predictions. One partial solu- tion towards improved systems for regional hyperthermia is the so-called hybrid approach, i.e. simultaneous operation of multiantenna applicator and MR system. The SIGMA-Eye applicator was mechanically integrated in a Symphony/Quan- tum-Gradients MR-system (1.5 Tesla, Siemens Comp.). The patient is positioned in the applicator on a dedicated positioning unit from the back side of the tunnel magnet, and moved on a rail into the magnet. Particular attention is given to the guidance of cables (RF power), flexible water pipes (water bolus flow), hydraulic tubes and sensor leads (thermometry and feed point detection). Both high-fre- quency systems, HT-system at 100 MHz and MR-system at 64 MHz, must be decoupled by filters. The 100 MHz power at 60 dBm (1 kW) is coupled with 30 dBm (1 W) into the body coil, and must be further damped down to -40 to -50 dBm by a notch filter before the MR preamplifier. Other parasitary lower frequencies (~85 MHz) are filtered out in the high power path of the Dodecamp 12-channel amplifier (BSD). Experiments with a three-dimensional phantom (containing various cath- eters for direct thermometry) demonstrate that temperature distributions can be determined non-invasively obtaining an accuracy of 1 C. We used the PRF (proton resonance frequency) method applying a gradient recall sequence (TE=20 ms). Hot spots at typical locations (pelvic bone) could be detected and reduced by proper modification of phases at the 12 channels of the SIGMA-Eye applicator. Signifi- cant coupling between the channels (in particular in the longitudinal position) can change the netto phases (in the feed point of the antennas). Measurement sys- tems in the coaxial part and in the feed points directly are under development to control the steering conditions. Also the planning system is improved further, e.g. to consider to transforming networks. 165 HEAT SHOCK PROTEINS AND IMMUNOLOGICAL ASPECTS E. Noessner, GSF (Muenehen) Heat shock proteins (HSP) encompass a divers group of proteins that is highly conserved through evolution. Many of the members are specifically induced or upregulated in response to stress. They fulfill a variety of functions including the folding, assembly and intracellular distribution.of proteins, the regulation of cell cycle, cell proliferation and differentiation. HSP expression is also associated with pathological situations, especially with cancer. Through their regulatory role in cell cycle progression disturbed HSP expression may lead to uncontrolled tumor cell growth, changes in metastatic potential and reduced sensitivity to apoptosis. This cytoprotective activity is ascribed to HSPs found at the HSP-typical intracellular location. Under certain circumstances, however, HSPs can be expressed on the cell surface or released in the extracellular compartment. Outside the cell, HSPs obtain new functions. HSPs are immunodominant molecules and a significant proportion of the immune response to pathogenic microorganisms is directed towards HSP-derived peptides. Because of the phylogenetic similarity between microbial and mammalian HSPs it has been suggested that immunological recognition of cross-reactive HSP-epitopes could be the link between infection and autoimmunity. Indeed, T cell reactivity to HSP is often observed in auto- immune diseases. Other observations suggest that anti-self-HSP reactivity has a downmodulatory quality by stimulating a regulatory Th2 type T cell reactivity providing protection in a variety of autoimmune models. Indications for enhancing and protective roles of HSP-reactivity are also reported in acute and chronic graft rejection. In recent years HSPs were proposed as tools for cancer therapy. Expressed on the cell surface of tumor cells HSPs can be recognized as tumor antigens activating NK cells or g/d-T cells. HSPs can also function as antigen- presenting molecules eliciting specific immune responses through the peptides they chaperone. Released HSPs have been discovered as ,,danger signal\" to the innate immune system. By binding to antigen presenting cells they induce expression of chemokines and their receptors, cytokines, costimulatery molecules and molecules involved in the Toll signaling pathway. In their dual function as a danger signal and chaperone for peptides HSP-peptide complexes exert regulatory roles for both the adaptive and innate immune system thus making them powerful activators of anti-tumor immune responses. 166 CLINICAL RESULTS OF HYPERTHERMIA COMBINED WITH RADIATION OR CHEMOTHERAPY R. Issels, Klinikum Grosshadern (M0nchen) The purpose is to provide an overview on the current clinical application of hyperthermia combined with conventional treatment modalities (e.g. ionizing radiation, chemotherapy) in the treatment of malignant disease. The clinical application of hyperthermia with increase of tissue temperatures (range 40-44\u00b0C) has been integrated in multimodal anti-cancer strategies. This lecture describes selected phase I or II and phase III trials investigating the effect of hyperthermia combined with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both in a total of more than 2200 patients. The trials were performed in a variety of solid tumors (e.g. melanoma, head and neck cancer, breast cancer, cancer of the gastrointestinal or urogenital tract, glioblastoma, sarcoma) in paediatric or adult patients. Profound research has produced a scientific basis for the simultaneous application of hyperthermia in combination with ionizing radiation and/or systemic chemotherapy. Hyperthermia is clinically accepted, due to the substantial technical improvements made in achieving selected increase of temperatures in superficial and deep-seated tumors. At present, the combination of hyperthermia and chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy is tested within clinical protocols (phase II/lll) in order to improve local tumor control and relapse-free survival in patients with high-risk or advanced tumors of different entities. (Supported by Deutsche Krebshilfe) 167 MODULATION OF APOPTOSIS AS A NEW THERAPEUTIC CONCEPT FOR MALIGNANT DISORDERS K.O. Kliche, Friedrich-Schiller-Universit~t Jena (Jena) Apoptosis, the programmed death of cells, is a physiologic mechanism for exclusion of unnecessary cells in such events as embryogenesis and hematopoiesis. Normal homeostasis is maintained through a balance between cell proliferation and cell death. Although the control of cell proliferation is quite well understood, less is known about the control of cell death. Apeptesis represents a kind of physiologic cell death that occurs primarily through an evolutionarily conserved form of cell suicide. The decision of a ceil to undergo apoptosis is influenced by a wide variety of regulatory stimuli. Recent evidence suggests that alterations in cell survival contribute to the pathogenesJs of a number of human diseases, including cancer, viral infections, autoimmune diseases, neuro-degenerative disorders, AIDS and hematological diseases like aplastic anemia and the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Modulation of the apoptotic threshold may have the potential to change the natural progression of some of these diseases, S13 Invited Speakers and may thus be an attractive therapeutic target. In this context, at least two widely divergent situations can be envisioned; induction and termination of apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis for therapeutic endpoints became a olinical reality long ago, since many chemotherapeutic agents induce the death of tumor cells by induction of apoptosis. On the other hand, there are diseases like MDS that have recently been characterized as ,,hyperapoptotic disorders\". Considering the conti-nuously growing numbers of diseases driven by altered apoptosis -- as well as our increased understanding of the biochemistry behind the process -- therapeutic modulation of apoptosis becomes increasingly realistic. Our concepts and understanding of apoptosis are becoming more precise because of the increased basic research directed at the subject in recent years. A growing body of evidence suggests that many chemotherapeutic agents kill tumor cells by initiating apoptosis. In parallel, it is clear that malignancies which demonstrate little or no apoptosis are relatively resistant to therapeutic intervention. On a molecular level, there has been considerable progress in our understanding of the apoptotic process as the role of Bcl-2 family members and the role of a unique family of intracellular proteases called ,,caspases\" has been defined. The presentation will highlight evolving new therapeutic opportunities in detail. 168 SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION R. Wetzker, Klinikum der Friedrich-Schiller-Universit&t Jena (Jena) Tumorgenesis is accompanied by consecutive modifications of the cellular phenotype. Induced by sequential mutations tumor cells initially gain hyperproliferative features and loose their ability to apoptosis. The transformation of the cellular phenotype is accompanied by striking changes of the regulatory activities of signalling proteins inside the cancer cells. Some signalling proteins escape from their physiological function and provoke the transformed behaviour of the cancer cell. Signalling proteins and signalling paths involved in the control of cellular growth exhibit upregulated activities whereas signalling paths controlling cellular apoptosis loose their reactivity and stay suppressed. The so-called ,,Signal transduction therapy\" of tumors aims to reverse these malfunctions of cellular signalling proteins. Focussing on attempts to restore the apoptosis function of tumor cells my initial presentation will briefly summarise recent progress in this field of molecular oncology. 169 ANALYSIS AND REPRESENTATION OF SIGNAL PATHWAYS USING FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS S. W61fl, Innere Medizin, FSU Jena (Jena) Molecular variations in regulatory proteins of cellular signal pathways are well established as a cause for pathological changes. Many examples are known in which mutations of regulatory proteins result in the disfunction of signal pathways and in consequence lead to tumor formation. To understand how these proteins are connected in the complex network of signal pathways is an important prerequisite for the development and optimization of therapeutic strategies. Functional genomics can be used to identify connections between so far unconnected signal pathways. This information can than be used to construct representative models that visualize the complex networks of cellular regulation. These models can than be used to identify potential new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. 170 REGULATION OF APOPTOSIS BY THE lAP FAMILY C.D. Gerharz, Inst. of Pathology, Heinrich Heine University (DUsseldorf) Resistance to apoptosis plays a key role in tumor progression and determines the response of cancer cells to anticancer drugs and radiotherapy. Recently, a novel family of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (lAPs) was identified the antiapoptotic properties of which are mediated by a so-called BIR domain with about 70 amino acids. First discovered in the baculoviral genome, been identified so far. lAPs were found to inhibit a specific subset of caspases (primarily caspases 3,7 and 9), but may also trigger cell survival by NF-kB activation. These findings suggest a potential oncogenic role for lAPs, which is most evident for survivin. In contrast to the broad expression pattern of other lAPs in fetal and adult tissues, survivin is largely down-regulated in most differentiated tissues of post- natal life. Almost all types of human cancer, however, show marked overexpression of survivin. In contrast to other lAPs, survivin expression was found to show a marked cell cycle periodicity with the highest survivin levels, in S-G2-M-phase cells. Microtubules of the mitotic spindle, the centrosomes and the chromosomal centromeres were shown to be molecular interaction partners of survJvin, indicat- ing a role of survivin at the interface between apoptoeis and cell cycle regulation. The spectrum of survivin actions is further extended by the existence of two alternative splice variants, i.e. antiapoptotic survivin-&#8710;Ex3 and knowledge on rAPs and survivin is rapidly increasing, providing fascinating new insights into the oncogenic potential of this protein family. 171 COMBINED-MODALITY TREATMENT AND SELECTIVE BLADDER PRESERVA- TION IN INVASIVE G. Grabenbauer, C. RSdel, Universit&t Erlangen (Erlangen) Purpose: To evaluate our long-term experience with combined modality treatment and selective bladder preservation in patients with invasive bladder cancer and to identify clinical and histopathologic factors that may predict treatment response, risk of relapse and survival. Patients and Methods: Between 1982 and 2000, 415 patients with invasive bladder cancer (high risk TI: 89 pts., T2-4:326 pts.) were treated with radiotherapy (RT, 126 pts.) or radiochemotherapy (RCT, 289 pts.) after transurethral resection (TUR) of the tumor. Six weeks after RT/RCT, response was evaluated by restaging- TUR. In case of complete response (CR), patients were followed at regular intervals, in case of persistent or recurrent muscle-invasive tumor, salvage-cystectomy was recommended. Median follow-up was 60 months (range, 6-199 months). Results: CR was achieved in 72% of patients. Local control after CR without muscle-invasive relapse was maintained in 64% of patients at 10 years. Distant metastases were diagnosed in 98 patients with an actuarial rate of 35% at 10 years. Ten-year disease-specific survival was 42%, more than 80% of survivors preserved their bladder. Early tumor stage and a complete initial TUR were the most important factors predicting CR. RCT was more effective than RT alone. Following CR, only multifocality of the tumor was associated with a higher risk of local failure. T category and response to RT/RCT strongly predicted metastases- free and overall survival. Conclusion: TUR + RCT is a reasonable option for patients seeking an alternative to radical cystectomy. Ideal candidates are those with early stage and unifocal tumors, in whom a complete TUR is accomplished. 172 RADIOTHERAPY IS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT IN HIGH-RISK T1-BLADDER CANCER C. R~del, Universit~.t Erlangen (Erlangen) Purpose: Current treatment options for high-risk superficial Tl-bladder cancer (grade 3, associated Tis, multifocality, tumor diameter > 5cm or multiple recurrences) include early cystectomy or the goal of organ-preservation by adjuvant intravesical therapy after transurethral resection (TURB). We have evaluated the efficacy of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) or radiochemotherapy (RCT) on local control, bladder- preservation, recurrence rate and long-term survival after TURB of high-risk T1- bladder cancer. Patients and Methods: From 5/1982 to 5/1999, a total of 74 patients with T1- bladder cancer were treated by either RT (n=17) or concomitant RCT (n= 57) after TURB. RT was initiated 4-8 weeks after TURB; a median dose of 54 (range: 45-60) Gy was applied to the bladder with daily fractions of 1,8-2,0 Gy. Since 1985 chemotherapy has been given in the first and fifth week of RT and consisted of cislatin (25 mg/sqm/d) in 33 patients, carboplatin (65 mg/sqm/d) was administered in 14 patients with decreased creatine clearance (<50 ml/min). Since 1993 a combination of cisplatin (20 mg/sqm/d) and 5-fluorouracil (600 mg/sqm/d) was applied to 10 patients. Salvage-cystectomy was recommended for patients with refractory disease or invasive recurrences. At the time of analysis, the median follow-up for surviving patients was 57 (range: 3-174) months. Results: After RT/RCT, a complete remission at restaging-TURB was achieved in 62 patients (83,7%), 35 of whom (47% with regard to the total cohort of the 74 treated patients) have been continuously free of tumor, 11 patients (18%) experienced a superficial relapse and 16 patients (26%) showed tumor progression after initial complete response. Overall+survival was 72% at 5 years and 50% at 10 years with 77% of the surviving patients maintaining their own bladder at 5 years. Negative prognostic factors for cancer-specific survival were non-complete (R1/ 2) initial TURB (p=0,12) and recurrent disease (p=0,07); combined RCT was more effective than RT alone (p=0.1). Conclusion: Adjuvant RT/RCT offers an additional option in high-risk superficial bladder cancer with a high chance of cure and bladder preservation. The ultimate value of radiotherapy in comparision with other treatment options should be determined in randomized trials. 173 STANDARD MORPHOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY OF HUMAN BLADDER CANCER R. KnL)cheI-Clarke, R. St~hr, C. upper and lower urinary tract is a type of tumor, known to be multifocal as well as frequently recurring. Urothelial lesions mostly occur as exophytic tumors and to a lesser extent as flat neoplasms (max. carcinoma in situ , CIS) with a higher chance of progression to invasion. Multifocality and variability of type of lesion in an endoscopically accessable organ render the human bladder an ideal model to study tumor initiation and progression by comparing different tumors at one point of time and metachronously over a longer span of time. Aminolevulinic-acid-induced endoscopic fluorescence diagnosis has lead to an increase in detection of early and flat bladder lesions, which are hard to identify with white light endoscopy. The correlation of morphology to genetic alterations has been optimized by microdissection techniques and reliable whole genome amplification techniques, the latter being especially valuable for small early bladder lesions. Using this approach, consecutive comparable genetic analyses, ranging from fluorescence in situ hybridization over different types of deletion mapping $14 Invited Speakers and gene sequencing to RNA expression profiling not only help understand tumorigenesis but also give more insight into the answers obtainable with the genetic methods. Important results obtained were 1. frequent alterations of urothelial hyperplasia, and similar patterns of aberations in comparison to that of papillary tumors of the same patients; 2. prevalence of chromosome 9 alteration in papillary tumors and carcinomata in situ in contrast to a significant difference between the lesions looking at p53 mutations; 3. similarities in genetic alterations between moderate dysplasia and carcinoma in situ; 4. oligoclonality of bladder tumors in up to 30 % of patients investigated, as revealed by several methods of analysis. We propagate a uniform terminology for the different entities of bladder lesions to enable reliable prospective studies assessing the impact of e.g. urothelial hyperplasia on tumor recurrence and moderate dysplasia for early tumor progression. At the same time, genetic data indicate, that radicality of papillary tumor resection is impaired by genetic changes already present in hyperplastic urothelium, and recurrence monitoring may be insufficient, when recurrence screening is limited to the genetic alterations of the primary tumor.The work is supported by grants from the Mildred Scheel Foundation 10-1096 Ha and 70-2200-Ba 174 DETECTION OF MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD BURKITT'S LYMPHOMAS AND B-CELL ALL K. heavy chain (IgH) locus (14q32), represents 75% translocations in childhood Burkitt's lymphomas (BL) and B-cell ALL. Due to the great variability of the breakpoint region, a standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay is not sufficient for the detection of this chromosomal translocation. The recently improved long-distance (LD) PCR for the detection of t(8;14)(q24;q32) allows to identify the specific breakpoint region within the MYC gene and the IgH locus. The combination in different reactions of one primer specific for MYC exon II and four primers for the IgH locus, localized within the joining region (JH) and the constant regions (Cp, Cg and Ca), reveals the specific breakpoint region. Our investigations of Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines and several childhood BL or B-ALL, positive for t(8;14)(q24;q32), showed a product ranging in size from 1 to 10 kb. The LD-PCR, however reached a sensitivity of 10-2 only, which is not sufficient for detection of minimal residual disease. Therefore, we established a more sensitive nested PCR with a specific primer combination for each patient based on sequence analysis of the variant breakpoint regions. Thereby, two primers were specific for the MYC-gene close to the MYC/IgH breakpoint and one primer is located in the IgH locus, whereas another one overlapped the breakpoint of each specific breakpoint region. To establish the specification, we investigated the Burkitt lymphoma cell line CA-46 and several pediatric BL or B-ALL using their specific primer combination for the nested PCR in comparison with lymphoma cell lines and pediatric leukaemia which are negative for t(8;14)(q24;q32). Using this breakpoint specific nested PCR, we could detect the translocation in 1 out of 104 hematopoietic cells lacking this translocation. In conclusion, we represent a combination of LD- and nested PCR method as a specific and sensitive tool for the evaluation of minimal residual disease in patients affected by t(8;14)(q24;q32)-positive lymphomas. 175 MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE (MRD) IN schule (GieBen, Hannover) During the last years it could be shown by two large studies (Cav~ et al (1998) N.EngI.J.Med. 339,591; van Dongen et al (1998) Lancet 352,1731) that MRD is an important independent prognostic factor and can be used for therapy stratification in childhood ALL. However, for other types of malignant diseases the clinical relevance of MRD is not yet clear. Therefore, a multicenter project was created under the umbrella of the German competence network ,,Pediatric Oncology\" to analyze MRD in childhood ALL, ALL-relapse, AML and lymphoma with different techniques. The aims of this project are the comparison of results gained by different methods to find the most suitable technique for each type of malignancy. Furthermore the best time points for therapy control should be evaluated. For children with AML two different markers were used: leukemia associated immunophenotypes and leukemia specific fusion genes. In the latter group 651 children were successfully screened by RT-PCR for one of the fusion genes AML1/ETO, CBFB/MYH11, MLL/AF9, and PML/RARa and 142 of them were found to be positive for one of these rearrangements (22%). Evaluation of follow-up samples showed different results for each of these rearrangements (PML/RARa excluded because of low numbers). AML1/ETO was detectable in nearly all samples at the early time points (TPs) 1 and 2 (before HAM). During the course of treatment at the TPs 3 - 5 (before and after consolidation and after HD/VP) about 60 % of the children remained positive and also after HD/VP and during maintenance therapy about 37 % showed the rearrangement. For CBFB/MYH11 the number of follow- up samples was much smaller. But also here a decrease of positive samples was visible from TP1 and 2 (75 and 80 %) to TP5 and later, where only 1/7 was positive for the rearrangement (14%). The treatment response for MLL/AF9 positive patients was even better: The number of positive samples decreased from TP1 (50%) to TP3 (10%) and after HD/VP only 2/22 samples (8 %) remained positive. The analysis by quantitative (RQ) PCR was performed at 49 samples of 12 AML1/ETO positive patients. The results show a different response to treatment, but most of the patients reach a low copy number at TP5 and later. In 1 out of 2 relapse patients an increasing copy number was found prior to diagnosis of relapse. 176 MRD IN CHILDHOOD ALL M. (Hannover, Heidelberg) 80% of the children and adolescents patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) can be cured by intensive chemotherapy and by cranial radiotherapy (used only for approximately 20% of the patients). To reduce the rate of relapses, but also to limit treatment morbidity, it has been attempted to adapt treatment intensity by identifying the most specific prognostic factors. In addition to clinical factors (e.g. age, WBC), the immunphenotype and cytogenetic results, the in vivo treatment sensitivity has evolved as the most important predictor for relapse. To determine treatment response, blast reduction in peripheral blood or in bone marrow is usually assessed cytologically. Despite the large panel of diagnostic tools to identify high risk patients the majority of relapses is still being observed in the large group of patients with rather favorable prognosis, improved moleculargenetic techniques, the characterization of fusion genes (e.g. TEL/AML1), and the identification of clone-specific individual leukemic cell markers (in the variable regions of the T-cell receptor- or of the immunglobuline genes) provide highly sensitive tools to determine the response to treatment by detecting ,,minimal residual disease\" (MRD) in the submicroscopic range. Systematic analysis of MRD was initiated in the 1990s. The data from the different study groups sometimes showed some discrepancy, which were partly due to differences in the methodology. The main reasons for different patterns of MRD, however, were the different treatment design and the timing of evaluation. For instance, if MRD was highly positive after 5 weeks of intensive induction chemotherapy with 4 drugs, the result was more specific in predicting relapse than if the the same result was found at the same time after only a 3 drug induction therapy, if the MRD level was below 10-4 after a 4-5 week induction, all studies confirmed this to be a highly favorable prognostic factor. If MRD was highly positive (>10-3) after three months of therapy, this was highly predictive for a very high risk of relapse. The randomized trial ALL-BFM 2000 is investigating if the detection and the level of MRD after 5 and 12 weeks of therapy will allow a new risk-adapted stratification and therapy. 177 MRD IN SOLID PEDIATRIC TUMORS B. Hero, R. Schumacher-Kuckelkorn, S. Schmidt, T. Simon, F. Berthold, Universit&tskinderklinik Khln (Khln) Modern immunologic or moleculargenetic techniques are adding information to cytological investigations of bone marrow specimen. But so far, it is not clear, whether minimal bone marrow disease either at diagnosis or after induction chemotherapy is associated with a worse outcome. We addressed this question in patients with metastatic neuroblastoma (stage 4) treated according to the German cooperative neuroblastoma trials. Bone marrow specimen at diagnosis and during induction chemotherapy were investigated cytologically and with immunofluorascence using tetanus toxin binding, &-GD2- antibody (BW704) and a-NCAM-antibody (Bw507). At diagnosis, immunofluorescence was clearly positive in 82.1%, inconclusive (1 or 2 cells positive, no typical cell nests) in 1.8% and negative in 16.1% of patients (marker Bw704, n=329). Cytological examinations (n=257) revealed positive results in 75.1%, negative results in 18.3% and inconclusive results in 6.6% (n=17) of patients. In 16 of 17 patients with inconclusive cytological results, immunofluorescence confirmed bone marrow infiltration. Disconcordant results were seen in 17 out of 257 patients (Cyt.+/IF-: n=6; Cyt.-, IF+: n=11). Outcome of patients without immunological bone marrow infiltration or with infiltration < 10% was better than the outcome of patients with infiltration > 10% (p=0.0003). Mini- mal bone marrow disease (>0%, <1%) was not discriminating for outcome. In 67.3% of patients with positive immunofluorescence investigations at diagnosis, immunological remission of bone marrow was reached during the first 4 cycles of induction chemotherapy. Minimal residual disease (< 1% tumor cells) was seen in 22.5%, infiltration exceeding 1% in 2.7% of patients. Inconclusive results (1 or 2 cells positive, no typical cell nests) were seen in 7.5% of patients. Prognosis of patients without residual disease was better than the prognosis of patients with inconclusive, miminal residual or more than minimal residual bone marrow disease (p=O.014). These data indicate, that minimal residual bone marrow disease after induction chemotherapy in patients with neuroblastema stage 4 is associated with a worse outcome, whereas minimal bone marrow disease at diagnosis is not. 178 NEUROBLASTOMA SCREENING STUDY ENABLES ADEQUATE DECISION ON FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF LEGISLATIVE EARLY DETECTION PROGRAMME B, Metzinger, IKK-Bundesverband (Bergisch Gladbach) Studies about the effectiveness of screening are rare and far between in Germany. Realization of such studies usually is declined because of alleged ethical reasons. Consequently screening examinations are executed without previous effectiveness checks and quality management. Especially examinations in healthy individuals require evidence for their benefit. Necessarily the risk (including the risk of further examination) vs. benefit (better prognosis for early detected diseases) have to be weighed. The pilot project ,,Neuroblastoma screening\" is a positive example for the intention of all persons concerned realizing a study to proove the benefit of a screening test. The result of the project answers the question whether screening tests at the age of 12 months could have positive effect on mortality. This project, which will be described later at this congress, was precedented by studies in Canada and Europe. Two pilot studies had been done in Germany. In Stuttgart and Hamburg screening examinations took place at the patients' age of $15 Invited Speakers 6 months, results in Hannover and KSIn were collected from a group of 12 months old infants. Consent result after analyzing the pilot study results was that no more studies were to be executed in children younger than 10 months of age. The following main study had to include a control group with identical treatment and monitoring. Having performed the pilot studies, the German Childhood Cancer Registry in Mainz in combination with the high coverage of the established early detection programm for children in Germany was an ideal conditon for this study. Therefore the Consortium of the Statutory Health Insurance decided to financially support the pilot project in 1995 as a contribution to a further development of their catalogue. 179 RESULTS FROM THE GERMAN NEUROBLASTOMA SCREENING PROJECT F.H. Schilling, Olgahospital Stuttgart (Stuttgart) Background Neuroblastoma is the second most frequent malignancy in childhood. This study investigated the usefulness of neuroblastoma screening at one year of age. This was ethically acceptable, as at the time of the start of the trial there was as much expert opinion in favor of screening as there were warning voices. Methods Dried urine samples were examined by high performance liquid chromatography for vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid content. Screening was offered in 6 of the 16 German states from 1995 to 2000 (Baden-WLirttemberg, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Bremen, Niedersachsen, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein). investigated birth cohorts 1994-1999 consist of 2,581,188 children in the screening area and 2,117,800 in the control area. The areas were comparable with respect to treatment of neuroblastoma cases, completeness of registration, stage distribution and mortality. Parameters for evaluation were mortality and incidence of disseminated disease. Results 1,517,885 children participated, the participation rate was 61.2 percent. 149 true positive and 55 false negative neuroblastoma cases were diagnosed by June 2001. 3 of 149 screening cases and 13 of 55 false negative cases have died. Neither a decrease in stage 4 incidence (3.7 of 100,000, 90% Cl [2.8,4.5] vs. 3.7 of 100,000, 90% Cl [3.0,4.4]) in mortality (1.2 of 100,000, 90% Cl [ 0.7,1.6] vs. 1.1 of 100,000, 90% CI [0.7,1.5]) was observed in the relevant age groups. In contrast to this we were able to show that a considerable number of children may undergo unnecessary treatment on a spontaneously regressing tumor as considerable overdiagnosis was observed. The results are in agreement with a smaller North-American study evaluating screening in infants. Though neuroblastoma biology was not the focus of this study, all attainable tumor material has been or will be ascertained from all cases in the screening group (true positives and false negatives). Further biological studies on this material will contribute to better understanding of the disease. Conclusion At the moment neuroblastoma mass screening cannot be recommended as a general health measure. Schilling FH, Spix C, Berthold F, et al.

Kinderkrebsregister, Joh.Gutenberg Universitb.t (Mainz) In Germany Neuroblastoma is the most frequent extracranial solid childhood tumor. Its properties made it seem an ideal candidate for screening. The German childhood cancer registry was involved in the project as epidemiological consultant and to ensure ascertainment of cases and deaths. A complete registry, which determines the incidence, age at diagnosis, stage distribution, and mortality in all relevant groups (control area and study area, participants and non participants) independently of the study and beyond the field phase of the study is an optimal basis for the evaluation of a screening study. Ascertainment was achieved by regular stochastic record linkage of encrypted personal identifier data from all 1.5 million study participants with the registry data at the registry. Power computations were performed and showed that the study has ca. 70% power to detect a 50% mortality reduction soon after the end of the study; the power increases with increasing follow-up. We were involved in selecting mortality and disseminated stage incidence as endpoints, and selected comparison groups based on the intention-to-screen and the per-protocol approach. We developed methods for the estimation of the lead-time distribution and overdiagnosis in this project. Lead time is the amount of time by which a screen detected case is detected early. Early detection leads to an excess of cases at the screening age and cases missing at higher age. If more cases are observed at the screening age than can be explained by lead--time, the difference is attributed to overdiagnosis. About 0.8/100 000 cases experienced lead-time while 7/100 000 cases (90% CI [5.4,8.6]) were overdiagnosed. The mean lead-time was estimated to be about 16 months. The number of cases experiencing lead4ime is too small to cause a 50% reduction of mortality. 7/100 000 overdiagnosed cases is a substantial number, these are ca. 2/3rds of all screen detected cases. The ethical dimension of this result is highlighted by the fact that all deaths observed so far in the screen detected group were in localized stage at diagnosis and therapy related.

Spitz, Universit~itskinderklinik K61n (KSIn) Prerequisites for the German Neuroblastoma Screening Project, which started in 1995, seemed favorable: 1) Great differences were seen between the prognosis of localized disease (10- year-survival about 80%) and metastatic disease (10-year-survival of catecholamine metabolites (VMA and HVA) in urine is easy to carry out, is not very stressful for the children and has been proved useful in pilot studies (1991 - 1995). 3) Correlation of age and stage (stage 1: median age 13 months, stage 2:15 months, stage 3:17 months, stage 4:33 months), the absence of stage 1 and 2 disease in developing countries and the long latency from localized disease to metastatic relapses (median 13 months) were considered strong, though only indirect hints for a potential use of neuroblastoma screening. Out of 1.5 million investigated one year old children, 153 patients with neuroblastoma have been found. Localized disease, as anticipated, was seen predominantly (stage 1: 42.5%, stage 2: 28.1%, stage 3: 17%, stage 4: 12.4%). LDH elevation as risk marker was found in 38.9%, MYCN-amplification in 3.9%. In 54 screening negative children (false negative), neuroblastoma developed after a median latency of 21 months (minimum 1 month, maximum 51 months). In this group metastatatic disease was predominant (stage 1: 9.3%, stage 2: 9.3%, stage 3: 18.4%, stage 4: 63%). elevation in 79%, MYCN amplification in 35%. Only 9.4% of false negative patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis. 80% showed clearly positive catecholamine metabolites at diagnosis. The 5-year-event free survival was 89 \u00b1 3% for patients found by screening and 45 \u00b1 19 for false negative patients (p<0.0gl). Clinical characteristics of true positive and false negative screening patients regarding manifestation of disease, risk factors and survival appear comparable to those of the corresponding age groups. Epidemiologic and clinical data indicate that unfavorable stages tend to develop after infancy with high speed. 182 THE INTERNET AS A SOURCE OF ONCOLOGICAL INFORMATION FOR PA- TIENTS AND RELATIVES - CONSEQUENCES AND PERSPECTIVES H. Stamatiadis-Smidt, B. Hiller, S. Wilcke, Krebsinformationsdienst KID (Heidelberg) The interact is going to revolutionize the traditional health system. In the history of mankind, the relationship between physician and patient, between scientist and citizen, was build on the understanding of the role of the physicians and scientists as experts and the patients and citizens as recipients of expert care. Today, this relationship is undergoing an essential change. The physician in many cases may no longer be able to foresee the medical knowledge his patient will confront him with. This paper investigates the results of so far published studies and data on the use of the internet by tumor patients and their relatives, the influence it has on the communication between physician and patient, on the consequences for example on compliance, doctor's guidance and the quality of the relationship. The possible influence on the psychological and emotional situation of tumor patients, on their activities, their fears, their feeling of autonomity and a possibly increased independence will be discussed. The initiatives on the governmental and non-governmental level to meet the needs of patients by defining qualitiy criteria and to facilitate the access to services, state-of-the-art and comprehensive medical and scientific knowledge offered by the internet are described. Additional training of physicians as well als of patients and relatives will be necessary in order to make good use of the perspectives the internet offers in optimizing patients' care. The so called ,,jungle\" of information might be the starting point of a citizen in a democratic world to find his way through our health system with an expertise of his own and make best use of the international network in oncolcgy. 183 BREAST CANCER - FUTURE ASPECTS M. Kaufmann, Frauenklinik der Universit~t Frankfurt (Frankfurt) During the last 100 years various paradigm has been changed in the understanding and the treatment of primary and metastatic breast cancer. Despite increasing incidence rates of breast cancer in western parts of the world in some countries mortality decreases during the last decade. Future aspects which can yield better results in the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer will include: - less surgical and radiotherapeutical procedures like e.g. sentinel lymph node biopsies or even no axillary lymph node dissection or intraoperative radiotherapy. - Selective systemic treatment in the adjuvant or primary (preoperative) situation - Selective rapid introduction of new biologically targeted therapies in primary and metastatic breast cancer - More genetic and biomolecular approaches using BRCA detection and DNA chip technology orientated treatment decisions. - more prevention - more screening 184 FALLACIES IN THE ASSESSMENT OF TREATMENT EFFICACY U. Mansmann, Universit~tt Heidelberg (Heidelberg) This talk discusses several pitfalls in the assessment of the efficacy of surgical tumour treatment. For patients with colorectal cancer the assessment of efficacy S16 Invited Speakers is mostly based on the group-specific 5-year survival rate (5ySVR). There are many complex aspects related to this concept which have to be considered when using such figures in the clinical management. 1. There are at least three different versions of a 5ySVR used in literature: overall, cancer related, and disease free survival which may differ up to 20% and address different aspects of treatment efficacy. 2. The clear description of a patient spectrum is necessary to get a correct understanding of treatment efficacy. The importance of prognostic factors for the delineation of patients will be stressed. 3. The precision of the estimated 5ySVR depends on the follow-up structure of the population studied. Its impact on the estimation is discussed and tools presented how to communicate the structure of follow-up in a medical paper. 4. It is often observed that findings on 5ySVR of patient groups in designed studies differ from the 5ySVR of the same group observed in daily clinical work. Reasons for this phenomenon will be elucidated. Topics like the surgeon as prognostic factor and the Will-Rogers phenomenon will be touched. 5. The quantitative meaning of differences in mortality are often misunderstood. Therefore, the meaning of the relative risk, absolute risk difference, and number needed to treat will be explained. The number needed to treat is the number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional adverse outcome (death) and is also a clinically valuable information in studies where the outcome of interest is time to an event. 6. Is it possible to substitute a clinical endpoint like the 5ySVR by a so called surrogate endpeint. The concept of a surrogate endpoint will be explained, examples and counterexamples will be given. 7. A checklist will be offered on how to extract reliable information on therapeutical efficacy from the medical literature. The seven issues addressed above are important for those who will be involved in studies assessing therapeutical efficacy to guide them in presenting the data in a useful way, but also for those who look for sound information as guidance in deciding on the best therapy for their patients. 185 THE RELEVANCE OF TUMOR MARKERS IN CHECKING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THERAPY P. Stieber, Inst. of Clinical Chemistry, University of Munich (Munich) Diagnostic methods should provide a maximum in medical information combined with a minimum of strain for the patient. Under this aspect tumor markers as non- invasive, fast, reproducible and little expensive methods arouse much interest among all fields of oncology. Monitoring the course and therapeutic response of malignant solid tumors is at present the main application of tumor markers. The speed of postoperative decrease of the marker serves as a first sign of prognosis. After curative surgery, all markers are noted to display an initial short- term increase followed by a rapid decline to individual baseline levels. Tumor marker values which are decreasing slowly and not moving down to the range < the 95% percentile of healthy individuals can be a sign of non-curative surgery or insufficient staging at primary diagnosis (occult metastases). The determination of the postoperative individual baseline values is obligatory for the further fellow up.in the case of most solid tumors there is a significant release of tumor markers in metastatic disease, thus it appears feasible to use these tumor markers to control the response to therapy. Although there is up to now no prospective randomized trial comparing tumor marker directed therapy against UICC criteria directed therapy in patients with metastatic disease, there are convincing retro- spective data from the literature describing an excellent correlation between the kinetics of the markers and the UICC-criteria. This means that - outside of clinical studies - imaging techniques like X-ray, CT scans or MRT can be reduced significantly as long as the relevant markers are decreasing and the patient's clinical condition is improving or at least stable. Increasing tumor markers point to progressive disease very early, often weeks (or months) before imaging tech- niques prove the progression of the disease. Whether an immediate change of treatment will lead to prolongation of survival is still not proven especially in the situation of those tumors where the number of systemic therapies available is limited. Correct interpretation of tumor marker levels calls for an understanding of the assay method used (and the maintainance of this method for the whole monitoring), the specificity-sensitivity profile of the tumor marker, and in-vivo and in-vitro factors that influence the results. 185 NEW INTERNATIONAL REMISSION CRITERIA RECIST (REMISSION EVALUA- TION CRITERIA IN SOLID TUMORS) H. Sauer, Medizinische Klinik III (M0nchen) In 1979 the WHO released its red book on reporting results of cancer treatment (1), in which remission criteria of primary tumors or metastatic disease where based on the multiplication of the two largest diameters of the lesions. In 2000 new criteria were released and generally accepted (2), e.g. by EORTC, NCI, NCI-C. In these new guidelines only the largest diameter (LD) of a lesion has to be measured. Retrospective analyses showed that the unidimensional measure- ment can characterise the tumor shrinkage as well as the bidimensional method. The new guidelines are summarised as follows: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD Progression (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. Special criteria are give for the different method which can be used to measure the tumor diameters (e.g. CT, spiral CT, MRI, ultrasound). These new remission criteria should be used especially in all phase II studies, where tumor response is mostly the primary objective. Literature: 1.

Becker, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (Heidelberg) Recently published mortality data of 2000 suggest to draw up a balance on the evolution of cancer incidence and mortality in Germany during the second half of the twentieth century. The mortality data is based on the official cause of death statistics of West Germany (1952 - 1990), East Germany (1961 - 1990) and the unified Germany (1991 - 2000), and the incidence data on the cancer registry of the federal state of Saarland. The decrease of cancer mortality which was already indicated in the German cancer atlas based on the mortality data of the years up to 1995 continues until 2000. This trend is based on a decline of mortality from the most frequent cancer sites lung (only among men), colon and rectum, breast, prostate and stomach as well as a reduction of some less frequent cancers. It is sufficiently stable to be quantified in terms of an average annual percent change. However, with the decrease of mortality does not necessarily correspond a decline of cancer incidence which may increase despite a down-going mortality (e.g., cancers of the breast and prostate). The comparison of trends in incidence and mortality may provide indications to potential reasons for the observed evolution. A simultaneous decrease of incidence and mortality can be seen for, e.g., lung cancer in men which may be interpreted as a success of primary prevention (reduction of cigarette consumption), stomach cancer (reduction of prevalence of major risk factors) or cervical cancer (increased coverage or improvement of early-detection). Decreasing mortality while incidence increases can be observed for, e.g., cancers of the breast and prostate, whereby the increasing incidence can be partially due to increasing early detection, and the decreasing mortality may be due to improved treatment. There is only one cancer among the most frequent sites from which incidence and mortality is continuously increasing: lung cancer among women. A less deprecatory attitude of German politics towards preventive measures against tobacco consumption would help to save several thousands cancer deaths among women and dozens of thousands cancer deaths among both genders combined. 188 NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY BY INTEGRATING MO- LECULAR GENETICS A. Nieters, DKFZ (Heidelberg) Differences in inter-individual susceptibility towards diseases is one major focus of modern epidemiological research. The advancement of the Human Genome Project opens new opportunities to integrate the genetic aspects of susceptibility differences. About 90% of human genetic variation has been ascribed to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), allelic variants that occur at a frequency of > 1%. Far more than 1.5 million non-redundant SNPs have been identified in the human genome. A subset of these are expected to have a role in cancer predisposition, either directly by being of functional relevance for the respective gene product or indirectly by being in linkage disequilibrium with 'pathogenic' sequences. Various tools are available for researchers: The epidemiological approach can be in form of family studies or in form of association studies. For family-based linkage analysis SNPs are used as pointers to the approximate chromosomal location of the underlying disease gene, in association studies one tests whether allelic enrichment in diseased individuals compared to unaffected controls can be observed, which implies its contribution in disease predisposition. Epidemiological research increasingly focuses on SNPs in candidate genes along well defined functional pathways and integrates genotyping data and exposure information. For the large-scale identification of SNPs, various new technologies (i.e. DHPLC, Pyrosequencing) are available. A huge amount of SNP data is also accessible from different SNP databases (i.e. Hgvbase, dbSNP). Developments in high- throughput genotyping technologies based on mass-spectrometry or microarrays, allow large-scale association studies aiming at the identification of the role of gene-environment and gene-gene interactions in disease aetiology and prognosis. Challenges and opportunities of this fast progressing field will be addressed as well as areas identified, which need special attention from the scientific community f.e. the development of more sophisticated tools for the statistical analysis of genotyping data. S17 Invited Speakers 189 CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY (FDG-PET) FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF CUP-SYNDROME R.P. Baum, Zentralk]inik Bad Berka (Bad Berka) Patients with cancer of unknown primary (CUP) are defined as having a biopsy- proven malignancy, where the anatomic origin remains unidentified after extensi- ve history, physical examination, laboratory studies as well as thorough radiological investigations. The reported incidence of CUP varies with the setting and definition used and averages between 0.5% to 10% of all cancer 3-4% of all CUPs. Metastatic carcinoma from an unknown primary does not have a characteristic presentation and the frequency of predominant presenting sites varies depending on referral patterns (abdominal in about 1/3 of the patients, followed by pulmonary (20%), lymphadenopathies (20%), bony (16%), and neurologic abnormalities (6%). The absence of a primary tumor often poses major diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainties and usually leads to an exhaustive and often fruitless diagnostic search. Furthermore, detection of the primary tumor will influence the therapeutic management and the patients' survival and quality of life. PET utilizing 2-F-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) has been used successfully in numerous malignant tumors for i) tumor staging and in distinguishing malignant from benign processes by determining their metabolic activity ii) in differentiating malignant recurrent tumor from scar tissue and iii) in evaluating metabolic changes during chemotherapy and for monitoring of therapeutic effects. PET is a promising and highly sensitive method particularly in establishing the site of cancer of unknown primary and for reducing costs and fruitless searching. The diagnostic value of PET is shown by several scientific groups and encouraging results have been achieved, for example in staging of suspected head and neck tumors with involved cervical lymph nodes (as a tumor entity occuring also in patients with unknown primary) and preoperative staging and prognosis of these patients has been improved by using PET-FDG. The aim of this overview is to summarize the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of PET-FDG in patients with suspected cancer of unknown primary in identifying the primary site and to report on the influence of PET on patient's outcome and further therapeutic management. Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is a complex tumor entity and the management of these patients remains a clinical challenge in oncology. 190 TREATMENT STRATEGY IN CUP-SYNDROM (Halle, Hannever) After a carcinomatous disease has been defined (no primary tumor detectable by standard diagnostic measures which can be applied within 1-2 days after diagnosis) further intense elaboration aiming to detect a primary is not helpful, because: 1. the chance to detect a primary by extensive diagnostic workup is minimal 2. more importantly, even if the primary would be defined this would not change the prognosis due to the limited availability and efficacy of chemotherapy in general and in particular in CUP-syndrom. The prognosis is mainly determined by the extension of the disease: 1. good prognosis in case of localized disease, intermediate/ good prognosis in younger patients with undifferentiated histology, in particular metastases in midline structures, and treatment with Ciplatin-based chemotherapy; 2. poor prognosis in patients with disseminated disease without above mentioned features, requiring palliative chemotherapy with low toxicity on an outpatient basis; $. very poor prognosis, despite any treatment, in patients with disseminated or extensive disease, very poor performance status and/ or biological age >65. Treatment options should take into account these prognostic subgroup, histology and lecalisation of the metastases. 2- or 3 drug combinations prepared as ,,broadspectrum cytostatic combinations\" should be applied. 191 COPING WITH ANXIETY: INTERVENTIONS FOR PATIENTS G. Strittmatter, Fachklinik Hornheide (M0nster) More than 50% of all cancer patients are coping well with their cancer by their own resources and those of their surrounding without psychological support. About 30% of the patients need interventions to improve their coping with illness and treatment. Anxiety and depressive reactions are the most common burden for the patients. The main concern is the anxiety about the progression of their illness. On one hand it is a healthy reaction to the experience of threat, on the other hand to adjust to it is the main part of coping and has an essential influence on quality of life.The psychooncological approach is offered on two different levels: a basic support for all cancer patients and additional interventions for highly distressed patients and their relatives. A confidential doctor-patient relationship is the substantial part of basic support in the sense of informed consent. The patient should not be compliant only but rather take over his self-responsibility, by weighing pros and cons of the therapeutic decision making with his oncologist to achieve consent. Such a cooperation improves the level of information, the confidence in the doctor and therapy and the active cooperation with treatment as active coping strategy. Additional psychosecial support is resource oriented, offering structured interventions to relieve the patient. Precondition is the reliable well-timed identification of patients at risk (f. e. by the HAD Scale, Zigmond and Snaith 1983, and the Hornheide Screening Instrument, Strittmatter et al. 2000). The aim of interventions is to encourage active coping based on a realistic assessment of the situation to develop reasonable hope and mobilize resources. (Don't minimize, mobilize! Fawzy 1993). The sense of the interventions is: to structure the situation by coordinating treatment schedules, to promote close cooperation between patient and oncologist, to explain basic psychooncologic knowledge, to inform about the psychological function of anxiety, to counsel and train skills for better acceptance of suffering and premature death, to learn techniques to reduce physical restlessness, to enhance personal resources, to strengthen confidence in the own body and to offer an approach to inner peace and confidence. Last not least patients, relatives and therapists have to take heart of confrontation with the risk and transitoriness of their own life, that means in the existential sense to be alert and make an aware decision for life. 192 PANCREATIC CARCINOMA - STATUS OF ONCOLOGY THERAPY H. Oettle, Charit6 Campus Virchow-Klinikum (Berlin) Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the 5th leading cause of cancer death and has the worst prognosis of all GI tumors. For operable stages, surgical resection is the standard treatment, but despite recent improvements in surg. techniques, the overall survival (SU) rate following resection remains poor with a median SU of 15 months and a five-year SU rate of 10-15%. There is therefore a clear need for more effective adjuvant treatment that is currently evaluated in phase III studies. One of them is a 364 pts study done in Germany that compares a immediate 6 months adjuvant treatment with gemcitabine (GEM) in Ro resected pts against observa- tion. For pts with inoperable disease, pts often suffer during their short life span from sign. tumor-related complications that can only partially be improved by pall. surgical or endoscopic interventions. Before 1995, no standard therapy was uniformly accepted for the pall. treatment of PC. This situation has changed with the introduction of the antimetabolite GEM. In a randomized phase III study against FU, GEM showed a sign. SUI benefit compared to FU with regard to median and overall SU. Moreover, the study showed a sign. better \"clinical benefit response\" compared to FU. In another phase III study against the metalloproteinase inhibitor BAY, the study had to be terminated prematurely due to significant superiority of GEM with regard to SU. An interesting interpretation of this trial is that one must now question whether it is still ethical justifiable to do a randomized trial against best supportive care. The results with GEM demonstrated so far consistently show a mSU of approximately 6 months and a 1-year SU rate of 20% even in studies with more than 80% stage IV pts. GEM should therefore be considered as standard therapy for inoperable PC. However, the current results with this drug are far from been satisfactory and current research efforts therefore focuses on combination therapies with GEM in phase II and phase Ill studies (Oettle et al. Anticancer Drugs 2000; 11(10):771ff). In Germany, we are currently comparing \"GEM versus GEM with FU (24h) and FA\" in a phase III setting. The study will finish accrual in 3/2002 with more than 300 pts. In other studies, GEM is combined with platin derviates, other antimetabolJtes, irinotecan, taxanes and also evaluate newer concepts like farnesyltransferase inhibitors, growth factor inhibitors and vaccines. Other research activities focus on the value of second-line therapies. 193 PANCREATIC CARCINOMA - RESULTS OF SURGICAL THERAPY D. Henne-Bruns, Universit&t UIm (UIm) Ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is still a tumor type with an unfavourable prognosis. Because of the late onset of symptoms most of the tumors are diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease. Therefore, resection rates are low, ranging worldwide between 10-20%. Although resections can nowadays be performed with an acceptable morbidity and mortality rate, the value of extended radical interventions is still under discussion because the achieved overall 5-year survival rates do not exceed an average of more than 20%. The extension of the surgical procedure was among others based on the findings of Ishikawa, who described in 1988 that patients with a resectable pancreatic head carcinoma showed an improvement in the 5-year survival time from 9 to 28% after radical intra- and retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy. However, the results of several studies as well as our own data do not allow a definite conclusion regarding the prognostic impact of extended retroperitoneal dissection on the prognosis of the patients. A comparison between different studies is still difficult because several parameters like the operative techique, the histopathological analysis, the percentage of ductal adenocarcinomas, the UICC-tumor stage and the percentage of R0-resected patients vary considerably in different investigations. Another question which needs to be evaluted is the biological relevance of disseminated tumor cells as well as the prognostic relevance of such findings with regard to an extended surgical approach. An extended surgical dissection of lymphatic tissue allows an exact histopathological staging and can be performed without an increased postoperative morbidity if the removal of lymph nodes is restricted to the area of hepato-duodenal ligament, celial trunk, first part of the splenic vein and the right side of the superior mesenteric artery. It should be performed to allow an exact tumor staging.Further study protocols will have to face all the mentioned questions in order to evaluate the prognostic impact of extended surgical procedures in patients with pancreatic carcinomas. $18 Invited Speakers 194 OPTIMIZATION OF GENE DELIVERY VEHICLES BASED ON ADENO- ASSOCIATED VIRUS FOR CANCER THERAPY M. Hallek, H. BOning, Ried, is a single-stranded DNA parvovirus with some highly advantageous features for the gene therapy of cancer: It has the ability to transduce of terminally differentiated and non-dividing cells, shows little toxicity against normal tissue, but kills p53 deficient tumor cells (Raj et al, Nature 412:914, 2001). However, the broad host range of AAV currently represents a major limitation, because the specificity of the gene transfer by AAV is too low. To overcome this obstacle, our group has improved AAV vector technology during the last three years: 1. We optimized the methods of rAAV packaging and purification to achieve higher yields of clinical grade; 2. we showed for the first time the viral capsid can be modified genetically to re-target rAAV vectors to specific cancer cells (Girod et al., Nature Med. 5:1052-6, 1999). 3. We invented a new method, called single virus tracing, which allows to observe single virions during their infection of a living cell (Seisenberger et al., Science 294: 1929, 2001). Currently, we use these new technologies to specifically target AAV or AAV vectors to receptors expressed solely or preferentially on tumor cells or tumor vessels. During this process, AAV will be visualized by single virus tracing in order to obtain optimal intracellular processing of retargeting vectors. This shall enable us to create tumoricidal AAV or AAV vectors with a strongly improved safety and efficacy profile. 195 GOALS FOR REHABILITATIVE AFTER CARE FOR COLORECTAL CARCINOMA PATIENTS P. Kruck, NahetaI-Klinik (Bad Kreuznach) The goal of rehabilitation is the farmost possible elimination - at least compensation - of tumor or therapy related consequences as well as support of acceptance of remaining handicaps in order to participate independently in social life. The individual need of rehabilitation after therapy of colorectal carcinoma influences the definition of the therapy - for example: - adjustment of stoma supply according to need (selection of support, training) - elimination of stoma related complications (stoma therapy) - avoidance of stoma complications (training) - improvement of rest functions, e.g. for incontinence (training, apparative use of appliances) - adjustment of incontinence supplies according to need (selection of supportive supplies, training) - pain relief for post proctectomy syndromes (pain therapy, among others) - symptom adjusted stool regulation (dieting advice) - improvement of emotional assimilation of therapy and disease related problems (psychological support) - reinforcement of acceptance of the changed body and the lost body functions (psychological support, training, sexual advice, etc.) - compensation for fear of uncontrollable function failure (training) - reinforcement of the integration in relationship, family and social environment (information, social-medical consultation, mediation) - contact to self-help groups, e.g. ILCO, etc. (mediation) - professional reintegration (social-medical assessment, information, mediation) Institutionalized rehabilitation, e.g. in specialized local rehabilitation hospitals, is highly indicated for patients after stoma application or for incontinence, to carry out complex treatment effectively and in a coordinated manner. Another group of patients could probably be rehabilitated with similar success under out-patient conditions - for example after uncomplicated partial colon resection. The different need for rehabilitation and the obviously divergent rehabilitative goals for patients after a cole-rectal tumor are well suited as examples for an increasingly urgent discussion about implementation of oncological rehabilitation. Purpose should be the modification of the traditionally inflexible institutionalized rehabilitation towards a more flexible, out-patient treatment including local care providers. It would be recommendable to adjust the individual need for rehabilitation to optimize the rehabilitative success, while at the same time relieving financial resources. 196 GOALS FOR REHABILITATION STRATEGIES IN PATIENTS WITH MALIGNANT HEMATOLOGIC AND LYMPHATIC DISEASES H.H. treatment of patients with malignant hematologic and lymphatic diseases is characterized by intensive chemotherapy and often additional radiotherapy. Both treatment modalities, including hematopostic stem cell transplantation, induce severe and persisting toxicities followed by impairments and disabilities in physi- cal and psychosocial conditions. Typical somatic problems are loss of overall physical strength and fatigue, specific deficites such as steroid myopathy, polyneu- ropathy, mucositis with malabsorption maldigestion as well as infectious and immunologic problems. Psychesocial problems include the fear of relapse, de- pression, neuropsychological impairments and social desintegration. In Germany medical and psychesecial rehabilitation strategies are predominantly inpatient based and reimbursed by health insurance companies and retirement fends. Consequently there are two main goals to be reached by rehabilitation: improvement of the individual health related quality of life and reintegratien into the job. However there are few rehabilitation clinics focussing on the support of patients with hematologic/lymphatic diseases. Dependend on individual impairments and disabilities the rehabilitation strategy is based on a multidisciplinary approach. Information and motivation in the fields of interest such as nutrition, treatment related questions, future aspects, etc., as well as specific physical and psycho- social interventions are quality assured. Although it seems obvious that there is a tremendous demand for rehabilitation strategies in the group of patients with malignant systemic diseases, we still need prospective controlled trials to ques- tion the outcome in spite of health related quality of life and social functioning. In addition there are few informations to the cost/benefit ratio of this treatment approach. 197 RADIOSURGICAL METHODS AND PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS P. Wust, K. Gardey, R. Felix, Charit~ (Berlin) Radiosurgery is a method to deposit a high radiation dose in a well-defined target volume. The dose distribution is characterized by confermality, homogeneity, and ad-ditional restrictions upon organs of risk. Demands to plan and to perform the treatment, and the problem of positioning and possible correction are also criteria for this complex optimization problem. Presently, four methods are in use for (stereotactic) radiosurgery with different pros and cons: particle irradiation (proton or heavy ions), GammaKnife (LGU: Leksell particular robot-controlled radiotherapy. Linear accelerators (linacs) must be mechanically upgraded for radiosurgery. The gamma knife is very precise for the head region and might be superior for small targets (e.g. <1 cm). A significant improvement is the development of electronic multi-leaf collimators. Here, the linac-based technology is estimated as more flexible and promising because it is suitable for a higher number of indications and locations. Recently, the robot-controlled radiosurgery has been added with the system CyberKnife, i.e. a linac of 6 MV mounted on an industrial robot. Here, the absolute mechanical precision is +/- 0.5 mm. This technique is characterized by a large number of arbitrary non-conformal and non-isocentric beam directions for any target of on principle any shape. The degree of cenformality increases with the num-ber of elementary beams with small diameter and complicated trajectories in compari- son to a intensity-modulated radiotherapy. However, this is a very complicated optimi-zation problem. A final analysis is even with today's computer capacity challenging. Computer analyses have shown that the CyberKnife has large potentials to conform dose distributions and provide steep dose gradients, and furthermore to be superior with respect to extracranial applications, online control and correc- tions (via tracking). A permanent registration of target position is realized by two orthogonal image inten-sifiers. The short response time of some tenth of a second is unquestionably unrivaled to correct beam direction and position with respect to a moving target (because of respiration, pulsation and physiological motions). Therefore, the suitability for ex-tracranial lesions is highest. The long treatment time under certain conditions might be a disadvantage on the other hand, Comparative studies with the various described techniques are required. 198 ONCOLOGICAL INDICATIONS OF RADIOSURGERY: EXPERIENCES WITH OUTPATIENT GAMMA KNIFE RADIOSURGERY B. Wowra, Gamma Knife Praxis (M0nchen) During a period of six years a consecutive series of 2000 outpatient Gamma Knife treatments (GKRS) was performed. Concerning the major indications, 515 patients were treated for cerebral metastases, 231 patients were treated for vestibular schwannomas, and 158 patients were treated for benign skull base meningiemas (WHO I), respectively. These patients constitute the cohort of this report. The results are summarised as follows (tumour control rates are given as actuarial freedom from tumour progression at five years after GKRS): 1) Cerebral metastases: Local turnout control was achieved in 95 %. Distant new metastases were retreated by radiosurgery in 126 patients (25 %). Side effects of radiosurgery were observed in less than 10 % of patients. Prognostic factors affecting survival were the clinical performance status and the extracranial tumour status but not the number of brain metastases nor the addition of whole brain radiation therapy. 2) Vestibular schwannomas: Local tumour control was achieved in 97 %. Quan- titative MRI in 50 % of patients evidenced temporary swelling of tumour tissue. Permanent facial palsies were not observed; mild transient facial toxicity was found in 5 % and restricted to patients with previous surgery or metabolic disorders. Useful hearing was preserved in 35 %; some kind of hearing was preserved in 50 -60%. 3) Skull base meningiomas: 50 % of the patients had surgery up-front to GKRS. Local turnout control was achieved in 95 % including repeated GKRS in 4 % of patients. Recurrences of meningiomas after GKRS were observed predominantly for previously operated cases. One patient developed an acute reversible oculemotor palsy during GKRS; transient trigeminal irritations were observed in 8 % of patients. In terms of safety and efficacy, this experience evidenced an attractive therapeutic profile of outpatient Gamma Knife radiosurgery for multiple brain metastases and for benign skull base turnouts (vestibular schwannomas and meningiomas) as well. S19 Invited TISSUE ENGINEERING OF EPITHELIA W.W. Minuth, R. Strehl, K. Schumacher, Department of Anatomy, University of Regensburg (Regensburg) Imagine a world where transplant patients do not wait for a donor or a world where burn victims leave the hospital without disfiguring scars. The idea behind tissue engineering is to artificially generate living tissue from isolated cells in vitro. This artificial tissue is then grafted to a patient to engineer specific healing responses wherever the body's own regenerative mechanisms fail to do so. Successful tissue engineering depends on the ability to generate functional tissues that will perform in the desired manner after implantation. Pluripotent stem-cells as well as cells from developing or adult tissue serve as a starting material for tissue- generation. These initially few cells are expanded in monolayer culture in a culture dish to obtain the cell mass necessary for an individual application. In most cases the cells are then seeded onto a scaffold or support material to form a construct for implantation. Besides the broad field of connective tissue engineering such as cartilage and bone there is growing interest in epithelia. Today's goals are the generation of perfect skin equivalents, vessel implants, insulin-producing organoids, liver- and kidney-modules as well as the development of urinary bladder, esophagus and trachea constructs. Biomedical application of these artificial constructs will only be successful if the tissues develop the necessary degree of functional differentiation. The ultimate goal in tissue engineering is to generate tissues with characteristic features while avoiding atypical protein expression that can lead to inflammation and graft rejection. 1100 POTENTIAL TREATMENT WITH BONE MARROW STEM CELLS H.G. Sayer, Friedrich-Schiller-Universit&t (Jena) In-vitro data and animal research describe the potential of bone marrow stem cells to differentiate into various cell types including osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes, endothelia cells, neural cells and myocytes. Stem cells have the ability to differentiate into mature cells and to renew themselves without loss of potential. The plasticity and the flexibility of adult stem cells provide for new therapeutic options regarding tissue replacement and transplantation in patients with malignant diseases. For more than 20 years transplantation of haematopoietic autologous stem cells is clinically used in myeloablative treatments. Transplanta- tion of allogeneic stem cells derived from the bone marrow or cytokine mobilized peripheral blood offer cure for patients with advanced leukaemia. However, immunological reactions between host tissue and graft lymphocytes restrict this approach to HLA-compatible individuals. Beside lymphoid-haematopoietic progenitor cells, the bone marrow cell compartment contains stem cells of non-haematopoietic tissue like mesenchymal stem ceils, which are multipotential and able to differentiate into osteoblasts, chrondroblasts, adiposities and myoblasts under specific culture conditions. A small fraction seems to be endothelial, too. Recently small phase I clinical trials have started in cardiovascular diseases. Here, the hope is to promote myocardial regeneration and neovascularisation with adult stem ceils in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Autologous bone marrow cells or fractions of CD-34 positive cells are isolated and given via a percutaneous transluminal catheter placed in the infarct-related coronary artery. Nevertheless the in-vitro proven differentiation of marrow cells into myoblasts reflect a multipotential feature of the cells that may not be realized in vivo. Knowledge about the mechanism of cell engraftment in those transplanted cells and the role of the tissue specific microenvironment, which may be crucial for the differentiation process of adult stem cells, has not been obtained, yet. in addition, a number of fundamental questions about plasticity and potential use about adult marrow cells still need to be resolved. However, preliminary data justify well-designed clinical studies in adult stem cell transplantation therapy. I101 CHRONOPHARMACOLOGY - A CONTRIBUTION TO IMPROVE DRUG TREATMENT B. Lemmer, Institut fQr Pharmakologie & Toxikologie (Mannheim) It is still a common paradigm in clinical pharmacology that pharmacokinetic parameters as well as drug effects are considered not to be influenced by the time of day of drug administration. However, this paradigm can not be hold any longer since it is now well established that nearly all functions of the body, including those influencing pharmacokinetic parameters, display significant daily variations. In man the organization in time can also be seen in certain states of disease in which the onset/symptoms do not occur at random within 24 hours of a day. Asthma attacks are more frequent at nightly hours. Similarly, the occurrence of coronary infarction, angina pectoris attacks and of pathologic ECG-recordings exhibit a predominant peak in the early morning hours. Moreover, forms of primary and secondary hypertension can result in pronouncedly different 24-hour blood pressure profiles. Having in mind this organization in time of living systems including man it is easy to conceive that not only must the right amount of the right substance or drug be at the right place, but also this must occur at the right time. This is the more important when an organism or individual itself has to act or react in favorable biotic or environmental conditions which by themselves are highly periodic. Over the last years numerous clinical studies in asthma, coronary heart disease, hypertension, peptic ulcer disease, rhinitis, arthritis and ontology have demonstrated that the kinetics and/or the effects of drugs can greatly depend on the circadian dosing time leading to a circadian phase-dependency in the dose response relationship. This can result in a dissociation between a drug's pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. As a general rule antihypertensive drugs should be given in the morning in dippers, whereas in non-dippers an (additional) evening dose can be appropriate not only to reduce the elevated blood pressure but to normalize the disturbed BP pattern. Statines are recommended to be dosed in the evening to reduce hypercholesterolemia. In nocturnal asthma a single/higher evening dose of theophylline or a beta2-agonist is recommended. Also, NSAIDs should be given in the evening to better reduce arthritic symptoms in the next morning. In peptic ulcer disease H2-blockers should be dosed in the evening whereas proton-pump-inhibitors are more effective after morning administration. Chronopharmacology in oncology is covered by other speakers. 1102 ROLE OF ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY FOR RECTAL CARCINOMA H.M. Seegenschmiedt, Alfried Krupp Krankenhaus (Essen) Background: Despite improved curative surgical approaches up to 25% of rectal cancer pts will develop local recurrences. Improved multidisciplinary treatment strategies are required to achieve improved tumor control and to prevent cancer related death. Material: So far over 8.000 patients have been included in multiple randomised controlled trials which have compared the outcome of surgery alone (Sx) for rectal cancer versus surgery combined with pre- and / or postoperative radiotherapy. So far, 14 clinical trials have been conducted which have analysed surgery preceded by preoperative radiotherapy (preRT) and 8 clinical trials with surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy (postRT). Currently, another controlled clinical multi- centre study from German evaluates the two different sequencing approaches of radiotherapy (CAO-ARO Study). Results:Based on published data the following findings are available:(1) Overall survival is marginally improved by the addition of pre- and postoperative RT. Results only from one trial showed a significant survival benefit, (2)Risks of any recurrence and isolated local recurrence were significantly lower after pre- and postoperative RT. The largest effects occur for preoperative RT and a biologically effective dose of at least 30Gy; with lower doses (< 20Gy) the effect on local recurrence disappears. (3) Subgroup analysis is important: patients > 75 years may not benefit from preoperative RT due to increased perioperative morbidity and mortality (< 30 days after surgery) was compared to younger patients. (4) A greater overall survival benefit is achieved with higher risk tumor stage, which provides sufficient indication for adjuvant RT in stage C rectal cancer. Discussion:Most available data do net account for modern RT techniques and new surgical techniques such as total mesorectal excision (]-ME). In the future, further controlled clinical studies are required to develop new individual risk- adapted treatment concepts to avoid treatment related- toxicity and maximise possible benefits on local control and survival. 1103 DIAGNOSTIC IN PRIMARY CUTANEOUS LYMPHOMA U. Reinhold, Universit&ts-Hautklinik (Homburg/Saar) Primary cutaneous lymphomas encompass a wide variety of lymphomas that are characterized by the localization of the malignant lymphocytes to the skin at presentation. Cutaneous lymphomas can be classified by the tumor-node- metastasis (TNM) staging system that is based upon the type of skin lesions, extent of skin involvement, the presence of lymph node or visceral disease, and hematological involvement. Primary staging of cutaneous lymphoma includes physical examination, skin biopsies, complete blood cell count including peripheral blood smears for Sezary cells, and imaging studies to evaluate visceral involvement. Clinically suspicious lymphadenopathy can be evaluated bv needle aspiration or by biopsy. The diagnosis of early stages of cutaneous lymphoma may be difficult, especially for lesions that are at the borderline between reactive and neoplastic skin infiltrates. The determination of clonality of lymphoid infiltrates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has emerged as an important tool to overcome these diagnostic dilemmas. Available techniques are rapid, sensitive, and adapted for paraffin- embedded tissue. More than 90% of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas(CTCL) show a rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gamma chain using PCR-techniques. The demonstration of clonality, however, does not necessarily indicate malignancy. However, the presence of monoclonality in nonmalignant T-cell infiltrates has been shown to be related closely to the risk of developing CTCL. On the other hand, some CTCL might not be monoelonal de novo, but eligoclenal instead. Immunophenotyping of circulating and infiltrating T-cells including the evaluation of CD7 and CD26 antigen expression can also be helpful for the diagnosis of certain forms of CTCL. Expansion of CD4+CDT-CD26- T cells correlates with the expansion of clonal T cells in patients with Sezary syndrome and proved to be useful for the diagnosis and monitoring of erythrodermic forms of CTCL. In conclusion, PCR-analysis and immunophenotyping represent useful adjuncts in the diagnostic of cutaneous lymphomas that should however be always correlated with clinical and histologic results. 1104 DIFFERENTIAL group of lymphoid neoplasias which primary involve the skin. Although histological assessment usually enables the definitive diagnosis, differentiation of patch stage mycosis fungoides from chronic dermatitis or parapsoriasis en plaques as well as differentiation of pleo- morphic small to medium-sized cutaneous T cell lymphoma from cutaneous S 20 Invited Speakers pseudolymphoma might rise problems. In these cases, combined assessment of clinical, histological, immunological and molecular criteria is mandatory. Patch stage mycosis fungoides can be differentiated from parapsoriasis en plaques or chronic dermatitis by the following criteria: a) chronic persistence of heteromor- phous patches at the flank sides of the trunk, b) band-like infiltrates in the upper dermis which are predominated medium-sized T-lymphocytes, with pleo- morphic) nuclei, d) absence of spongiosis in the area of epidermotropism, e) detection of a clonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor genes. The diagnosis of p]eomorphic small to medium-sized cutaneous T cell lymphoma is sustained by a) the solitary or localized occurrence of red-purplish nodules at the skin, b) dense infiltrates phenotype of the pleomorphic cells with loss of pan T cell markers, d) presence of only few admixed CDS+ lymphocytes, CD20+ B cells and histiocytes, e) detection of a clonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor genes. Differential diagnosis of cutaneous lymphomas requires collaboration of clinician, pathologist and molecular biologist to ensure a precise application of the men- tioned criteria. 1105 THERAPY STANDARDS IN CUTANEOUS heterogenic group of clonally expanding lymphocytes with various clinical manifestation, histology, immunophenotype, and prognoses. The early stages of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are primarily based on the application of oral photochemotherapy. In the initial phase PUVA therapy is applied four times a week with an initial dose of 1,5 J with increasing dosages of 0,25 J to 0,5 J. This treatment regimen showed in non-controlled trials remission rates between 76 and 90 %. After a controlled multicenter trial had been carried out in German speaking countries in the 90's combination therapy interferon a + PUVA is now the therapy of choice in early stages of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, in this therapy regimen 9 Mio IU interferon a 2a are applied three times a week and combined with standard PUVA therapy. Under this combination remission rates of 70 % could be achieved in all trials. A prospective multicenter follow-up trial shows, although not all data have yet been evaluated, an advantage for the combination of interferon a 2a plus PUVA versus PUVA monotherapy in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma stages la to Ila. The influence of interferon a on the duration of remission in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is at present evaluated in a third trial. The therapy of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is also based on the application of ionizing rays (dermopan, fast electrons), combination therapies with interferon a as well as retinoids complete the treatment concept. In the USA another receptor specific retionoid (bexarotene) is available for the therapy. With this new retinoid remission rates of over 50 % in all stages are achieved. In tumor stages methotraxte, chlorambucil and recently doxorubicin are available for monechemetherapy. Remission rates of up to 80 % were reported in first pilot studies. For progressing stages of T-cell lymphoma in stage of erythroderma the therapy of choice is extracorporeal photopheresis as monotherapy or in combination with interferon, retinoids radiatio. In stage iV of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma polychemotherapy has to be regarded as ultima ratio as well a new experimental therapeutic approach with a humanized CD52 antibody CAMPATH-1H. On the whole early aggressive therapeutic schemes did not prove worthwhile in controlled studies in the past. At present a phase adapted treatment concept is recommended for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. 1106 CURRENT STATUS OF QUALITY is a quantifiable, multidimensional concept including physical, functional, emotional or psychological, social and spiritual well-being. The aspects of physical well-being include symptoms of the disease, side effects of treatment, and acute or chronic limitations in physical activity, self care, mobility, sleep, body image, and energy (fatigue). There are a number of well established and also internationally investigated instruments for QoL assessment which focus on acute effects of treatment and follow-up time in the palliative treatment of patients and use repeated measurements in order to gain insight into the changes over time according to both treatment and disease. In general, most instruments either measure generic health related QoL or cancer specific QoL. Validity, reliability, and responsiveness to change over time are anchor points and have to be investigated and proven. Some of the instruments like the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the FACT use modules to address specific symptoms or disease related problems together with the core instrument. When used as an independent or predictive variable, QoL data guide clinical decisions based on the effectiveness of treatment and assist in the early detection of morbidity. Used as a dependent measure, in the comparison of different treatments, QoL helps to determine patient preferences to choices in treatment in a systematic quantifiable manner, and has prognostic value in predicting survival among patients treated for advanced disease. In evaluating treatment outcome, the purpose is to compare the QoL across competing treatments. Repeated QoL data might be used as an endpoint or outcomes measure in clinical trials in addition to more conventional endpoints such as duration of survival or time to relapse. A major challenge in prospective multicenter trials concerning collection of longitudinal data on QoL, is the completeness of data sets since missing data in a prospective longitudinal trial limit the value of the obtained results. A high standard of data collection is essential for the trial to be successful in achieving its objectives. QoL assessment usually is regarded as a secondary outcome measure, only rarely it is used as a primary endpoint. Recent developments in quality of life research including topics like clinical significance, missing data handling, responseshift, CAT, and IRT are addressed and put into perspective for future quality of life research in cancer clinical trials. 1107 INCORPORATING QUALITY-OF-LIFE MEASURES INTO CLINICAL STUDIES T. K0chler, Referenzzentrum Lebensqualit~t (Kiel) Quality of Life (QoL) became one of the most important outcome variables in clinical studies. During the last ten years reliable measures of QoL especially in oncology have been developed. Today's challenge is to incorporate these measures into clinical studies and in quality assurance programs and to establish QoL measures as clinical routine. Therefore the German Cancer Help (Deutsche Krebs- hilfe e.V.) granted a 4-years project (1998 - 2001): Development of a ,,Reference Center on Quality of Life in Oncology\" in Germany. Overall aim of this center is to actively support studies and activities on outcome research with focus on QoL and/or other patientoriented measures. The mandate of the reference center ranges from methodological counseling on how to assess QoL in a given setting, to participate in (multicenter) trials that incorporate QoL and to realize own specific research including the development of new instruments to measure QoL in specific oncological settings. The long-term aim of this project is to establish a databank on QoL for most tumor entities and in different treatment modalities, accessible for all care providers as well as for patients. From the experience of now more than 70 extensive counsellings on all sort of methodological (study design, instruments, evaluation etc.) issues there is a set of specific problems that arise repeatedly in certain areas of clinical research: - the genuine research question in the QoL part of the study; - the choice of the appropriate instrument to assess QoL; - the detailled description of how, at which timepoints and by whom QoL is assessed; - the evaluation concept; - the appropriate statistical analysis. Just to adress the first item on the list: often enough QoL enters a clinical study as secondary criterion more because it is ,,in\" than because of a defined research question. ,,We want to know more about the course of QoL after treatment\" is a legitimate interest but not a research question. Therefore a clear hypothesis on what medical/oncological parameter has an effect on which QoL-domain (i. e.: ,,there is no correlation between the PSA-level and the emotional functioning in prostate cancer patients\") is needed to adress the following areas of the list presented above. The good news however is that to our experience these criteria are more and more met in german clinical studies that incorporate QoL-questions and therefore QoL- research is becoming increasingly reliable. 1108 NEW ASPECTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE ASSESSMENT WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON PALLIATIVE MEDICINE F. Porzsolt, AG Klinische Okonomik, Universit~.tsklinikum UIm (UIm) We want to discuss two new aspects in quality of life research which may be important for clinical decision making. These aspects are the assessment of patient's preferences and the consideration of confounders of patient's quality of life such as age and dementia. A person who describes her/his present physical well being as almost excellent has based this statement on the unconsciously calculated ratio of her/his expected and observed physical well being. With other words, the concept to quantify quality of life is based on the calculated ratio of expected and observed values. The same calculation which is applied to simple decisions like ,,how is my physical condition today\" is also applied to more complex decisions such as the expression of patient's preferences. A frequently discussed example of preference in palliative medicine is the trade off between quantity and quality of life. The process of making these decisions is based on a combination of in-formation derived from many simple decisions. Several techniques are available to measure patient preferences, e.g. time trade off, standard gamble or the simple description of the preference on a bi-directional scale. More advanced techniques such as a conjoint analysis or a discrete choice analysis are necessary to identify and understand the influence of pre-defined components which lead to the expressed preference. The second new aspect in quality of life assessment is related to possible confounders. Most of patients in palliative medicine are old or old-old patients and many of them suffer from mild to severe forms of dementia. Our recent research on quality of life in old-old patients with severe dementia identified five dimensions of quality of life in these patients, i.e. communication, negative affect, bodily contact, aggression, and mobility. These dimensions are rather different from the known dimensions of quality of life in healthy adults. The most important dimension in the old population, communication, explained 25% of total variance and all five dimesions explained more than 60%. In summary, the two aspects, patient's preference as well as communication may deserve attention in future work on quality of life in palliative medicine. $21 Invited Speakers 1109 TELOMERASE INHIBITORS: A NOVEL APPROACH FOR THE TREATMENT OF CANCER U. Hartmann, I. Ers6z, L. Kanz, C. Bokemeyer, T. BdJmmendorf, Medizinische Universit&tsklinik II (T0bingen) The ends of human chromosomes are capped by telomeres, which consist of hundreds to thousands of tandem repeats of the sequence (T2AG3)n and associated proteins. Telomeres are important for chromosomal integrity and prevent them from genetic instability. Due to the end-repliation problem, telomeres shorten at each cell division in vivo and in vitro. As a consequence, telomere length reflects the mitotic history and limits the replicative capacity of normal somatic cells. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme, that is able to synthesize terminal TTAGGG telomeric repeats and thus to extend telomeres de novo. Telomerase activity is expressed in cells of the germline as well as in the majority (>85 %) of all transformed cell lines and malignant tumors investigated, in contrast, telomerase is not expressed in most normal somatic tissues studied to date. Ectopic expression of of the catalytic subunit of the telomerase gene (hTERT) in combination with the SV40 large-T antigen and oncogenic H-ras leads to malignant transformation of normal human fibroblasts. Thus, telomerase has become an attractive target for the treatment of neoplastic tumors. A number of different strategies have been used to develop specific telomerase inhibitors as a cancer therapeutic: initial approaches were aimed a the pharmacological inhibition of the reverse transcriptase by AZT followed by antisense strategies using RNA, PNA and other synthetic oligomeres, functional inhibition of telomeres by quadruplex stabilizers and others. Just recently, a very potent and promising non-nucleosidic small molecule telomerase inhibitor has been described (Datum et al. EMBO J. in press). In vitro experiments and in vivo animal studies using tumor xenografts demonstrate potency and selectivity of this novel drug. In principle, tumor-reductive effects of this promising substance (that can be administered orally) are likely to occur only after a latency period in which telomeres should progressively shorten due to inhibition of telomerase eventually leading to replJcative senescence. Thus, duration of treatment is likely to be dependent both on initial telomere length and on cell cycle activitiy of the tumor cells. Therefore, well-designed clinical studies in chronic or stable disease states (e.g. Chronic myelogeneous leukemia in late chronic phase) are warranted in order to demonstrate efficacy and long-term tolerabilitY of this promising new drug in cancer patients. 1110 HYPOXIA-ACTIVATED CYTOTOXIC DRUGS H. Peters (S(JseI-Gothendort) Tumor hypoxia is a limiting factor in both the radiotherapy and systemic cytotoxic therapy of solid tumors. Severe chronic hypoxia (diffusion hypoxia) occurs only in solid tumor tissue, which is poorly perfused compared to normal tissue. Specific drugs such as bleomycin and others (a large group of antiproliferative drugs), which are acting via radical damage to DNA, are much less effective in hypoxic cancer cells. Although hypoxic cells in solid tumors are a significant problem of cancer treatment, they are also a relevant and demanding target in clinical oncology for optimising treatment concepts. Compounds (hypoxia-activated prodrugs) which can be ,,activated\" in remote hypoxic regions of cancer nodes (remote regions from blood vessels) therefore offer the possibility of a specific systemic treatment for solid tumors, including metastases. These agents have to fulfil several criteria to be effective. They must distribute efficiently to the remote, hypoxic regions in solid cancers and after having reached these sections undergo selective cellular metabolism to create an active cytotoxic drug capable of diffusing a limited distance to kill the surrounding tumour cell at higher oxygen concentration. Compounds of bioreductively activated agents are often classified according to the nature of the trigger unit. The trigger domain is responsible for selectivity while the effector domain of the agent controls cell killing and bystander effects (killing of surrounding oxygenated cancer cells). Classification of hypoxia-activated drugs occurs as (4) Aliphatic N-oxides (AQ4N), and (5) Transition metal complexes, a very different class of prodrugs. Some clinical studies of the above mentioned compounds will be described. Preclinical and clinical development of hypexia-activated compounds (prodrugs) has progressed during recent years, with tirapazamine demonstrating clinical proof of principle. Major advances are awaited by improved knowledge of the enzymology of bioreduction (relevant for the activation of the prodrugs), and of the physicochemical properties controlling (regulating) extravascular diffusion of the compounds (relevant for reaching especially chronically hypoxic tumor cells). Illl PHARMACOLOGICAL MODIFICATION OF RADIOSENSITIVITY (AMIFOSTIN) V. Rudat, Dept. of Radiation Oncology, Univ. Clinic Hamburg (Hamburg) The therapeutic ratio of a radiotherapy can be improved by a selective radiosensitization of tumor cells or selective radioprotection of normal tissue cells. Amifostine (WR-2721) is a cytoprotective agent that protects a broad range of normal tissues from the toxic effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy with- out attenuating tumor response. This selective protection is due to the greater conversion and uptake of the active metabolite WR-1065 in normal versus neoplastic tissues. Three prospective randomised phase Ill trials comparing treatment with or without amifostine showed the following effects in the amifosine treatment arm: i) Significant reduction of haematotogical, renal and neurological toxicities, treatment delays, treatment dicontinuation and days in hospital related to these adverse events in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. 242 patients were randomised for this study and the treatment consisted of 6 cycles with 100 mg/ m2 Cisplatin and 1000 mg/m2 Cyclophosphamide with or without 910 mg/m2 Amifostine. ii) Significant reduction of acute and late RTOG grade 2 or higher xerostomia (but no significant reduction of the mucosa reaction) in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy (50 to 70 Gy) with or without 200 mg/ m2 amifostine. For this study, 303 patients were randomised, iii) Significant reduction of the incidence of lung fibrosis, RTOG grade 2 or higher pneumonitis and esophagitis in altogether 146 randomized patients with advanced lung cancer treated with a radiotherapy (55-60 Gy) with or without 340 rag/m2 amifostine. No evidence of tumor protection has been demonstrated in these trials. Other studies have shown protective effects of amifostine in various normal tissue types with other radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimen and in other tumor types, but evidence is still limited in these indications. Adverse effects of amifostine are usually reversible and manageable. The most frequent are nausea, vomiting, transient hypotension and allergic reactions. Depending on the outcome of nu- merous ongoing clinical trials, amifostine may eventually find broader clinical application. 1112 MODIFICATION OF EPITHELIAL RADIATION EFFECTS BY KERATINOCYTE GROWTH FACTOR (RHUKGF) W. D*Srr, Tech. Universit~t Dresden (Dresden) The protective effect of recombinant human Keratinocyte Growth Factor (rHuKGF) was studied in mouse oral mucosa, using ulceration as a clinically relevant endpoint. Graded radiation doses, at least 5 dose groups per protocol with 8-10 animals each, were applied to generate full dose effect curves. KGF was kindly provided by AMGEN Inc. In single radiation dose experiments, KGF was applied before or after irradiation, or both. Daily doses of 5 mg/kg were administered subcutaneously. In fractionation studies, 5x3 Gy/5 days were followed by graded test doses on day 7. KGF was administered for 3 days before or during radiotherapy, over the weekend break, or in combinations. Moreover, single KGF-injections (5 or 15 mg/kg) were given on day -1 or on day 4. In radiochemotherapy studies, single injections of cisDDP (8 mg/kg, i.p.), 5-FU (175 mg/kg i.p.) or a combination were applied 30 min before single dose irradiation. KGF was given before, after radiochemotherapy or both. In a single dose control experiment, the ED50, i.e. the dose after which ulcer induction is expected in 50% of the mice, was 11 Gy. KGF resulted in a highly significant increase in mucosal tolerance in all protocols, with ED50-values between 16 and 24 Gy. In the fractionation study, 5x3 Gy reduced the ED50 for the test irradiation to 5.6 Gy in the control experiment without KGE With KGF, an increase in test-ED50s to ca. 8 Gy was observed in the pre-treatment arms, and to 10-11 Gy in all other protocols. This is equivalent to compensation of ca. 1.5 fractions of 3 Gy when KGF is given before radiotherapy, or to 3-4 fractions in the other schedules, respectively. Single KGF injections were similarly (5 mg/kg) or more effective (15 mg/kg). In radiochemotherapy studies, KGF treatment yielded a significant increase in isoeffective doses in all protocols tested. Pre-treatment with rHuKGF resulted in ED50-values between 19 Gy and 22 Gy. rHuKGF given after radiochemotherapy was slightly less effective, with EDS0-values of 17-19 Gy. With KGF given before and after chemotherapy and irradiation, ED50s ranged around 19 Gy. In conclusion, a substantial reduction in oral mucosal radiation effects is achieved with rHuKGE As rHuKGF has shown no or only very minor effects in tumour cell and xenograft studies, selective amelioration of radio- or radiochemotherapy induced oral mucosal toxicity during treatment of head and neck tumours can be expected. 1113 EWlNG-TUMORS FROM THE VIEW OF MEDICAL ONCOLOGY P. Reichardt, Universit~ttsklinikum CharitY, CVK (Berlin) Ewing-tumors consist of of atypical Ewing- sarcoma. Ewing-sarcomas and especially PNETs originate not only from bone but also from soft tissue. Ewing-sarcoma and PNET of the bone, occuring mainly in childhood and adolescence are treated by the medical oncologist according to the pediatric treatment protocols. The situation is different for the extrascelettal Ewing-tumors, mainly PNETs that are seen more frequently in adult patients. These tumors, ressembling soft tissue sarcomas from their clinical presentation and occuring at any site and in any age group are often treated according to treatment recommendations or protocols for adult soft tissue sarcomas showing favourable response rates compared to most other types of soft tissue sarcomas. These treatment strategies, however, are not always suitable for Ewing-tumors. Whereas the role of adjuvant chemotherapy is not clearly established in adult soft tissue sarcomas, operation without chemotherapy seems inappropriate for a Ewing-tumor. When planning local treatment of a Ewing-tumor, radiotherapy should always be considered due to its high efficacy in this tumor type. In case of metastatic disease, single-agent chemotherapy or even omittance of chemotherapy should be strictly avoided, if ever possible, aggressive combination chemotherapy including anthracyclines and ifosfamide should be applied, it has to be kept in mind that at least for metastatic disease restricted to the lungs, the treatment is conducted under curative intent. S 22 Invited Speakers The paneuropean initiative ,,EURO-Ewing 99\" represents the first treatment protocol including Ewing-tumors of bone and soft tissue in children and adults of up to 50 years. Eligible patients should strictly be included in this study. 1114 PELVIC EXENTERATION: A MUTILATING PROCEDURE OR a radical extirpative procedure designed to treat pelvic malignancy that has invaded more than one of the hollow organs of the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts. Pelvic exenteration can be performed as an anterior, posterior or total procedure according to the underlying disease (e.g. rectal cancer, cervical cancer, bladder cancer). Thus, surgeons, gynecologists and urologists are involved. Since first introduced at the Ellis Fishel Cancer Center in the 1940s, total pelvic exenteration has remained an u]traradical operation for locally advanced pelvic tumors. The procedure may involve en bloc removal of the rectum, urinary bladder, distal ureters and reproductive organs to obtain negative margins of resection. Frequent procedures: Approximately 20% of bladder tumors are muscle-invasive and require radical cystectomy with curative intention. The cure rate of localized disease is at least 70%. Orthotopic bladder reconstruction has improved the outcome of such patients with respect to preservation of micturition, renal function and a better quality of life. Approximately 10% of rectal carcinomas are locally advanced at presentation and require extensive surgery for complete tumor extirpation. The procedure results in double stomas along with an artificial anus, which reduces the quality of life of the patients. However, such studies on the quality of life in these patients are rare. Conclusions: Pelvic exenteration is associated with a high morbidity according to the extent of the underlying (malignant) disease and condition of the patient. Due to the extent of this kind of major surgery, which also requires mu]tidisciplinary cooperation, and the psychosocial problems resulting from two permanent stomas, total pelvic exenteration is an adequate therapeutic alternative in selected patients with locally advanced or recurrent pelvic disease. Anterior or posterior exenteration for malignant disease (e.g. localized to the bladder or rectum) can often cure disease and is the treatment of choice in most patients. In view of the obtained results in literature pelvic exenteration is both a radical (and sometimes mutilating) procedure and an interdisciplinary challenge. 1115 SURGERY FOR CEREBRAL METASTASES : QUALITY OF LIFE VS. PROLONGA- TION M. Westphal, UK Hamburg Eppendort (Hamburg) Cerebral metastases are an increasingly frequent complication of cancer because of improved control of systemic disease. Related to the still unsolved issue of organ tropism, some cancers like melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, broncial carcinoma and colon carcinoma are frequently found in the brain whereas others like prostate carcinoma or pancreatic tumors and gastric carcinomas are rarely found to metastasize to the brain. Diagnosis of a cerebral metastasis is frequently made during staging of a known cancer. The decision how to proceed is determined by the available options of the newly diagnosed disease or the previous history of the known disease. In principle, a limited cerebral involvement (up to three metastases) in a newly diagnosed patient with all options for systemic therapy still available should lead to aggressive management of the cranial dis- ease including surgical resection and/or radiosurgery, depending on the accessability of the lesion(s). Excessive intracranial involvement after systemic treatment in a progressive disease setting should lead to a very restrictive approach. If a brain metastasis is the initial manifestation of an otherwise unknown primary, the same holds true.With limited cerebral involvement, resection or biopsy will lead to immediate diagnosis and sometimes opening of additional therapeutic options. Therapeutic options have to be evaluated on an individual basis. Cystic lesions may be treated by burrhole and implantation of a permanent catheter for repeated aspiration and radiosurgery of the collapsed volume. Lesions with excessive edema better treated with resection than radiosurgery because the mass effect is rapidly disappearing. Some patients need resection as well as radiosurgery. Crucial questions in the management of metastatic cerebral involvement present in patients with progressive systemic disease and infratentorial mass lesions and subsequent hydrocephalus. It is general practice to not shunt these patients because they then miss the chance to have their disease limited by rapidly raising intracranial pressure. In some patients with obstructive hydrocephalus, endo- scopic ventriculostomy is a minimally invasive procedure which may be of inter- mediate benefit. In general, the extent in which technical possibilities are brought to bear in a given patient with cerebral metastases needs to be oriented towards the options for disease control and the expected quality of life. 1116 LIMBSALVAGE VERSUS ABLATION The adjuvant therapy (radiation, chemotherapy)has led us to an increased life expectancy in primary as well as in secondary tumors of the skeletal system. We see more and more patients with the second or the third malignant tumor in their lifes. That means that even in the case of metastases in the skeletal system we have some chances to give the patient a positive view for their treatment. The most common malignant tumor of the skeletal system in adults is a metastasis. 80% of our patients with bone mestastases show multiple mestastases (Harington 1995).Even in the case of multiple mestastases we can find a longer life expectancy than ten years ago.That means that we have to treat more and more patients with pathological fractures or because of expectation of a fracture. The most common primary tumors which lead to sce]etal mestastases are kidney cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer, followed by cancer of the lung and the thyroidJn the case of metastases of a thyroid- ,prostate- and mamma carcinoma especially average life- expectancy has increased most in the last ten years. That means for us, as orthopaedic surgeons, that an operative treatment of such patients is indicated more and more often. The indications of operative treatement are: solitary bone metastases danger of pathological fracture or pathological fracture. An oncological radical resection should be achived in all cases with a good prognosis.The aim in these cases is an R0 resection. All adjuvant therapeutic possibilities should be choosen for these patients. If the prognosis is bad, the first choice is radiation or / and chemotherapy. In these cases an operation will be done only as the last possibility or as an urgent treatment in the case of a fracture. The technological development of the last decade gives us the possibility of replacing nearly every part of the body with an endoprosthesis from the shelf, that means we only use custom made endoprothesis in special cases. There are some well functioning modular systems on the market: for example the MML system from ESKA. Simple amputations are rare today. In some cases we use the combination of osteosynthesis and bone cement. Intramedullary nails should not be chosen as an implant in the case of secondary bone tumors if this can be avoided. The implantation of such an implant always leads to an embolisms of the lung with tumor cells. The patients life quality with bone tumors can be increased. 1117 MEDICAL TREATMENT OF MELANOMA A. Hauschild, S. Eiling, Universit~tsklinik (Kiel) About 20 to 25% of melanoma patients will die from metastasis. Apart from surgical interventions, medical treatment still remains the therapy of choice for high-risk primary melanoma and metastatic melanoma. The majority of patients suffering from primary melanoma greater than 1.5 mm tumor thickness and/or lymph node metastasis is either treated by low-dose or high-dose interferon alpha treatment schedules. Numerous clinical studies in Europe and the US/Canada are underway to evaluate the optimal dosage and treatment duration for melanoma patients in the adjuvant setting. In contrast, chemotherapy is still widely used in patients with stage IV disease defined as advanced metastatic melanoma. However, low response rates of about 15% and an unclear impact on the overall survival are leaving many open questions. So far, biochemotherapy using polychemo regimens plus interferon alpha and interleukin-2 have demonstrated high remission rates (up to 70%) in phase ]l-trials in the US only. Among the most promising anti-tumor agents in 2002 are particularly dendritic cells loaded with specific melanoma peptides as vaccination tools. Furthermore, current international phase Ill-trials are focussing on the use of histamine- dehydrochloride combined with cytokines as of Endocrinology, Department of Internal (UIm) Hereditary tumor syndromes have provided genetic and functional insight into basic mechanisms of human tumor development. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is caused by inactivating germ line mutations of the MEN1 tumor suppressor, typically leading to parathyroid, pancreatic and pituitary neoplasias and, more rarely, a variety of other tumors. Despite a high clinical disease penetrance of >95%, the individual manifestation of MEN1 is highly variable, and no genotype-phenotype correlation has been established. Excess hormone se- cretion and local tumor growth in MEN1 may be controlled by medical and surgical therapy in most patients, while malignant transformation of pancreatic neoplasias is the leading cause of MENl-attributable mortality. In MENl-associated tumors, loss of heterozygosity of the MEN1 gene locus at chromosome 11q13 is fre- quently detectable. Similarly, bi-allelic loss of MEN1 gene expression has been found in a considerable proportion of sporadic (non-familial) endocrine tumors, e.g. gastrinomas and type 2 (MEN2), medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is the major clinical manifestation, accompanied by hyperparathyroidism, pheo- chromocytoma, or mucocutaneous and skeletal abnormalities, according to the subtype of MEN2. A limited spectrum of activating germ line mutations of the RET proto-onco protein (a receptor protein kinase) have been identified as the molecu- lar cause of disease. In RET mutation carriers, the risk to develop MTC exceeds 75%, but prophylactic thyroidectomy at a preclinical stage now offers a high probability of definite cure without significant surgical morbidity. Therefore, the early identification of individuals genetically at risk for MTC is mandatory. The availability of genetic screening for MEN1 and RET mutations has strongly influenced the clinical management of patients with neuroendocrine tumors, Up to S 23 Invited Speakers 30% of apparently sporadic endocrine neoplasias (e.g. MTCs, gastrinomas) are in fact MEN-associated, and practical guidelines when to perform gene testing have been proposed. The distinction of hereditary and sporadic tumors is critical for patient follow-up and prognosis, as well as for adequate family counselling and treatment. Revised diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are likely to improve morbidity and mortality, health care expenditure, and disease burden in patients and their families with neuroendocrine tumor disease. 1119 DETECTION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE (MRD) IN SOLID TUMORS K. Pantel, Molekulare Onkologie, Univ.-Frauenklinik, UKE (Hamburg) Using monoclonal antibodies to epithelial cytokeratins or tumor-associated cell membrane glycoproteins, individual carcinoma cells can be detected on cytologic bone marrow preparations at frequencies of 10-5 to 10-6 (for review, see Pantel et al, JNCI, 1999). In breast cancer, recent prospective clinical studies on more than 2500 patients have shown that the presence of these immunostained cells in patients without overt metastases (TNM-stage relevant et al., JCI, 2001; Gebauer et el., JCO, 2001). Studies on other epithelial tumor entities (e.g., lung, colon, gastric and prostate cancer) have shown that bone marrow is a frequent indicator site of MRD, even in those tumors where skeletal metastasis are not common. The current assays may be used to improve tumor staging with potential consequences for adjuvant therapy. Another promising clinical application is monitoring the response of micrometastatic cells to adjuvant therapies (Braun et al., JCO, 2000), which, at present, can only be assessed retrospectively after an extended period of clinical follow-up. The extremely low frequency of bone marrow tumor cells greatly hampers approaches to obtain more specific information on their biological properties. We therefore established various tools and techniques (e.g., micrometastatic cell lines, single cell (Rr)PCR, multiple labeling, and FISH) that allow us now to obtain further insights into the biology of minimal residual disease. The available data indicate that micrometastatic cells represent a selected population of cancer cells which, however, still express a considerable degree of heterogeneity with regard to chromosomal aberrrations and phenotypic properties. Prominent characteristics of bone marrow tumor cells at the time of primary tumor diagnosis are the lack of both p53 mutations and proliferation-associated marker proteins and the frequent overexpression of the erbB2 oncogene (Pantel et al, JNCI, 1993; Putz et al., Cancer Res., 1999; Offner et al, PNAS, 1999; Braun et al., Cancer Res., 2001). Identification of the molecular determinants of micrometastasis may help to design new strategies to detect and eliminate minimal residual cancer. 1120 MONITORING ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY BY QUANTIFICATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF CIRCULATING TUMOUR CELLS IN BLOOD AND BONE MARROW. K. Pachmann, Klinik f0r Innere Medizin II (Jena) Solid tumours are the second most frequent reasons for death in the developed countries. In women breast carcinoma prevails, in men lung cancer and colon cancer. The primary turnout, however, rarely is the reason for fatal outcome, but rather metastases in different organs lead to organ failure and death. These metastases are due to disseminated tumour cells, emigrating from the tumour into the peripheral blood . They are also the aim of adjuvant chemotherapy. Using immunomicrofluorimetry combined with magnetic bead enrichment allowed us to de-crease the threshold of detection down to 1 positive cell in 107 normal white blood cells and to develop a qualitative and quantitative test with an about 90% detection rate of artificially seeded cells. Suspect events are automatically detected by a Laser Scanning Cytometer due to fluorescence intensity, they can be individually relocated and the system allows for visual identification of every single positive cell. In addition slides can be restained and reanalysed for additio- nal markers like FISH-analysis for Her2/neu. Thus, this quantitative analysis enables us to quantify the number of circulating tumour cells and their decrease in response to therapies like chemotherapy and thus allows real time monitoring of adjuvant chemotherapy, a situation where there is no other way to control re-sponse to therapy, in the neoadjuvant situation the response of the circulating tumour cells can be compared to the response of the primary tumour. In addition this method allows to analyse whether subpopulations of cells, like cells with the Her2/neu amplification or cells in blood and bone marrow respond differently to the applied therapy. 1121 FLOW CYTOMETRIC DETECTION OF ANEUPLOID PLASMACELLS IN BONE MARROW M. Freund, Universit~t Rostock (Restock) Multiple myeloma cells are characterized by the expression of CD38 and CD138. Flow cytometric analysis of these two markers combined with DNA-staining is a useful tool in the detection of aneuploid multiple myeloma cells. Flow cyto-metric list-mode-data of 112 samples were analyzed by the new ,,Continuous-Gating\"- Software (Version 2.0.1), The new version is able to detect aneuploid tumorcells with an unknown DNA-index automatically. Bone marrow samples were measured in a FACSort flow cytometer, after staining with CD38-FITC and CD138-FITC and propidiumiodide. When analyzed by using the ,,Continuous Gating\"-software a gate is set in the DNA parameter, defining the normal G0/Gl-peak. Afterwards a 200x200 channel-gate (out of 1023x1023 channels) is defined automatically by the program, scanning the whole side-scatter(SSC)/CD38/CD138 dot-plot 10,000 times. The cells defined by the 10,000 different dot plot gates were analysed for percentage of cells within the DNA-gate. The DNA-gate is moved by the program to higher channel numbers and the analysis is done repeatedly with increasing DNA-indices. The 112 bone marrow samples were divided into three subgroups after analysis: < 1% (62.5% plasmacell content. In the first group 25% of the samples showed at least one aneuploid clone, in the second group 53.3%, and in the third group 58.3% respectively. The mean DNA-indices measured in samples with aneuploid clones varied from 1.22 to 1.32. 58.8% of all aneuploid plasmocytoma clones are CD56 positive in samples with a plasmacell content <1%, increasing to 68.7% of aneuploid samples >1% to <10% and 85.7% of aneuploid samples containing more than 10% plasma cells. in summary more than half of all samples with more than 1% plasma cells in the bone marrow are showing at least one aneuploid plasmocytoma clone. Samples with less than 1% plasma cells, and therefore bone marrow involvement not proven by standard diagnostics, are showing aneuploid plasma cell clones in 25% of all samples. 1122 VALIDITY OF PET - RELEVANCE OF IMAGE FUSION WITH CT/MRT U. Buell, Univ. Klinikum Aachen mmol/ rain/g) on a molecular basis (patho)physiologic signals from regional blood flow or from regional metabolism, transport, receptor or gen response. In oncologic patients mainly 18F labelled deoxyglucose (FDG) is employed as a tracer. In the last decade FDG-ONCO-PET has successfully passed five stages of verification, viz. a) comparison to CT/MR findings in detection and localization, b) metabolic staging and grading, c) therapy monitoring and d) prognostic impact by quantification of glucose uptake and e) cost-effectiveness analysis. Consensus was achieved for FDG-PET in oncology for primary clinical use and patient management (Reske S, et al. Eur J Nucl Med 2001;28;1707-23). FDG-PET yields a spatial resolution of 5 mm if FDG uptake is prominent. Therefore, and from reconstructed transmissive data of external radiation sources routinely obtained for attenuation correction, individual anatomical landmarks are provided also by imaging physiological glucose uptake.Correct topographical readouts of pathologic foci thus could be achieved in most cases. However, in patients studied after surgery or with head/neck or soft tissue foci or such adjacent to the urinary bladder, problems may arise for exact separation or localization for biopsy or for radiation planning. As a consequence, industry developed a PET/CT for combining both, adapted attenuation correction for 18F from X-rays and image fusion of PET metabolism with anatomy from high-end CT slices within one machine. Such expensive tool may gain importance if newer PET tracers, e.g.hypoxia or receptor markers will be used. On the other hand, strong experience exists already in a slice-to-slice comparison of PET to CT or MRT, routinely established in two different places/departments, which has been primarily used to successfully pass stage a) (see above). By inherent limitations, with a PET exams in less than 10 pts can be managed per day only. Thus, the CT section may not be operated efficiently. Since, however, elegant images are known to overcome economics, it is an actual task of the scientific community to evaluate such novel PET/CT machine thru stages a - d to experience additional gain for patient management and/or costs. A PET/MRT combination faces as yet physical limitations (magnetic field vs photo multipliers). It would be of interest, however, since it may reduce radiation burden vs the PET/ CT combination. 1123 MRI IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF LIVER METASTASIS G. Jung, Institut ffJr Diagnostische Radiologie (DLisseldor0 The place value of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of hepatic metastases has become increasingly important over the past 10 years. Technical improvements were prerequisite to the increase in diagnostic value of hepatic MRL These included the introduction of surface array coils and the implementation of fast sequencing, enabling data acquisition of the entire liver in breath-hold and high resolution, breath-triggered sequences. Despite these technical advances, non-enhanced imaging of the liver remains limited due to poor differentiation between tumor and normal liver tissue. In principal, three types of contrast materials can be differentiated today: Extracellular, unspecific contrast materials which spread throughout the intravasal spaces and rapidly diffuse into the interstitial space with an almost entirely renal elimination. The effect of Hepatobiliary, liver-specific contrast agents is, in part, similar to that of the extracellular type. However, there is also a variable uptake of the contrast material by hepatocytes with subsequent excretion via the biliary system. The result is a positive signal increase in normal liver tissue in T1 w images (,,positive signal amplification\"). RetJculoendothelial, liverspecific contrast agents are directly incorporated into the Kupffer-Stern cells where they are phagocytosed by macrophages and are then transmitted into the normal iron-pool. The effect is a signal decrease of liver parenchyma in T2 w images (,,negative signal amplification\"). Reticuloendothelial contrast agents (AMI-25, SHU 555 A) enable the best contrast between metastases and normal liver tissue in comparison to non-contrast enhanced imaging. One of the main uses for administration of superparamagnetic ironoxides is in pre-operative diagnostics. The advantage of the hepatobiliary S 24 Invited Speakers contrast agent Gd-EOB-DTPA, which is still in the development phase, is that it can be applied in bolus as a positive signal amplifier, thus enabling perfusion measurements in tumor-tissue. This especially helps narrow the list of possible differential diagnoses. Contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is the most sensitive, non- invasive method for detecting focal liver tumors and is equal or superior to the gold-standard CT-Arterioportography, especially when taking differentials into account. 1124 THE INDICATION OF LYMPHADENECTOMY IN ENDOMETRIAL CANCER W. Lichtenegger, J. Sehouli, Charit6 (Berlin) Primary surgical staging has become the standard of care for the treatment of women with eedometrial cancer. Tumeur stage, depth of myometrial invasion, stage of grading and lymphatic space permeation are all important predictors of lymph node involvement in endometrial cancer. In the absence of distant metastases, lymph node status remains the most accurate predictor of clinical outcome. The assessment of the lymph node status with regard to tumeur involvement using any of the actual imaging methods is quite unsatisfactory. In Germany lymphadenectomy is widely performed. Recently we conducted a cross-section survey to define the clinical-therapeutical approach concerning lymphadenectomy in early and advanced endometrial cancer in Germany. There were 564 evaluable responses received by the end of 12/ 2001 which were considered for analysis. Lymphadenectomy is utilised routinely or in selected cases in 93% of all centres (further results will be presented for the first time at the meeting). Surgical staging including lymphadenectomy is indicated to accurately determine the initial extent of disease and is associated with minimal morbidity when performed by subspecialty trained surgeons.The role of lymphadenectomy (pelvic and para-aertic) on overall survival is under discussion.There are some data which indicate recurrence-free and overall survival advantage for patients with surgically extirpated metastastic lymph nodes and suggests a therapeutic benefit. Based on the results of the lymphadenectomy the identification of high- risk patients and the type of adjuvant therapy are possible. In case of completely removed positive lymph nodes an adjuvant radiotherapy is dispensable in most cases because different studies could not showing any impact on overall survival but an increased morbidity when radiotherapy was applicated routinely. Radiotherapy should be reserved for recurrence and contraindication for surgery.In conclusion, we recommend that when-ever possible all patients with endometrial carcinoma undergo complete surgical staging with lymph node dissection. This approach maximises the amount of information available for treatment planning and offers the potential therapeutic advantage of lymph node dissection. Other issues which should be addressed in future studies for high-risk patients include the role of laparoscopic dissection and sentinel lymph node, the value of adjuvant systemic therapies, cost-benefit analysis and quality of life. 1125 WHAT DO CANCER PATIENTS WANT TO KNOW ? UNCONVENTIONAL CANCER THERAPY DURING THE LAST DECADE B. Hiller, Krebsinformationsdienst KID (Heidelberg) OBJECTIVES: Alternative or complementary methods are a source of hope for cancer patients. Many are of unproven effectiveness, and some are considered as potentially harmful. Some could help to improve the quality of life, but are promoted under conditions promising other results. Which methods are of interest in Germany? Who needs information on unconventional cancer therapy? Has the use of alternative or holistic cancer therapies changed during the last ten years? Can a change be related to evidence based medicine and quality management in cancer therapy? Who promotes unproven methods? METHODS: The German Cancer Information Service KID (Krebsinformationsdienst KID, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum) is a service providing up to date, science based information to the public via phone, e-mail and internet. Evaluation of more than 185.000 calls provides data not only on the callers' questions and their background, but also on their personal beliefs about cancer. In 1991, 1996 and 2001, the standard evaluation of calls included a detailed analysis of questions regarding unproven methods. RESULTS: Between 15 and 20 percent of the 15.000 answered calls per year included at least one question concerning alternative or unconventional methods. Mistletoe remains the most frequent topic over the years. The effect of media reports to cancer patients, their families and health professionals can also be traced in the statistics: Methods promoted by the media tend to be popular for two or three years, cause scientific and legal discussions, and disappear from the statistics, when a recommendation or a statement is published by the authorities or scientific societies. These methods, however, usually cannot be identified as unproven by patients and even physicians: They are promoted by scientists or medical professionals, claim to be based on international research and are not described as alternative, complementary or holistic. CONCLUSIONS: Between 1991 and 2001, the questions concerning unconventional methods did not match lhe patient information distributed in brochures, leaflets etc. in Germany. Most lopics were not covered by official recommendations or statements, at least not at the time they were popular among callers. Science based medicine seems to have gained a much higher reputation over the years, and unconventional methods qowadays often mimic evidence based therapy. 1126 RISK POTENTIAL OF IMMUNOMODULATORY MISTLETOE TREATMENT ASSESSED BY IN VITRO AND IN VIVO are on the market in Germany based on the special legal regulation for the so-called Besondere Therapierichtungen. Within this framework the level of controls to ensure safety and efficacy is lowered. Due to recent extract standardization on the potent immunomodulatory lectin (a surprising contradiction against the anthroposophical concept even for products based on it) it is no longer possible to draw on previous experience with mistletoe extracts of varying (often unknown) compound concentrations to claim safety (1). In vitro studies with tumor lines and histocultures of surgical specimens demonstrate the expected non-selective toxicity of the lectin for human cells already at ng/ml-quantities. However, in 5 from 12 tested lines (at 50 pg/ml) and 5 from 30 cases (at 1 ng/ml) significant stimulation of tumor proliferation was observed (2). Tested at the immunomodulatory dose in mammary carcinoma and bladder carcinogenesis animal models in vivo, enhanced tumor growth and metastasis formation were determined (3,4). Together with results from a recent EORTC/DKG study of mistletoe application in melanoma patients showing negative effects on length of survival and disease-free interval, these results underscore that rigorous preclinical testing prior to (ongoing) uncontrolled application is considered advisable (5). At present, the collected evidence does not allow to claim safety, predict the clinical response and reliably exclude harmful effects.1. Gabius, H.-J., Gabius, S.

Edler, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (Heidelberg) Objective. Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) is the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence on the effects and the efficacy of treatments in making decisions about medical care of individual patients. Complementary medicine for cancer treatment (CMCT) has claimed for a number of 'alternative' drugs and treatment modalities, in particular for mistletoe, efficacy in terms of superiority or at least equivalence with standard treatment methods. Does CMCT meetl the requirements of EBM? Methods. The studies on CMCT identified in the medical literature were examined for conduct according to the guidelines of good clinical practice. A transparent hierarchical classification scheme for clinical studies ranging from the randomized clinical trials to less informative retrospective case series was applied. This scheme was extended to include pre-clinical in vivo and in vitro results, in particular for the assessment of adverse effects which have rarely been examined in clinical studies. Results. When addressing mistletoe treatment as an example of CMCT deficits are observed in amount, transparency and quality of citable results avaitable in the medical literature. Support of the claimed effects by meta-analyses is weak and the scores are low in an evidence hierarchy. Similare results wre obtained for other CMCTs, if available data allowed any assessment. Conclusions. Evidence of efficacy, equivalence or benefit of mistletoe treatment - taken as a prominent example of complementary medicine- can not be established at this status of available results and information. In order to meet the requirements of EBM clinical evidence from systematic research must be established on the efficacy and safety of CMCT in cancer patients through GCP conform well designed, well documented, and transparently reported prospective clinical trials - favorably randomized. 1128 HIGH-DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY WITH STEM CELL SUPPORT IN ADVANCED OVARIAN CANCER N. Frickhofen, Dr.-Horst-Schmidt-Kliniken (Wiesbaden) About 1 in 70 women develops ovarian cancer. Mortality is high, since 75% of the patients present with FIGO stage III or IV disease, where at most 25% of the patients survive long-term. This has not changed significantly in recent years, even though short term progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) have dramatically improved by chemotherapy with platinum and paclitaxe] (12-13 months PFS and 36-38 months OS at 3 years). However, high response rate and increase in short term survival by intensive chemotherapy demonstrate, that ovarian cancer is one of the most chemo-sensitive malignancies. It thus makes sense to exploit the full potential of chemotherapy using high dose chemotherapy (HDTX) and hematopoietic stem cell support. Experience with HDTX primarily comes from registry data and phase II trials. There is only one completed phase III trial; two phase tll trials were stopped prematurely in 1999 and 2000 because of low patient accrual; only one phase Ill trial is currently recruiting patients. Analysis of the outcome of more than 400 patients registered in the Autologous Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry (P. Stiff, Ann. Int. Med. 133: 504; 2000) indicates, that response rates are very high after HDTX, even in refractory and early relapsing disease, but PFS and OS are to short to justify this aggressive and expensive treatment modality. Salvage HDTX may be a reasonable approach in platinum-sensitive relapse, since phase II data show median OS figures of 20-30 months. Platinum-sensitivity was also the inclusion parameter for the recently S 25 Invited Speakers completed GINECO phase III trial for upfront treatment. The French investigators found an impressive doubling of the PFS by one course of high dose compared to 3 courses of standard dose consolidation chemotherapy (H. Cure, #815, ASCO 2001). Registry data as well as phase II studies suggest, that upfront treatment of patients with low volume disease and drug-sensitivity may be the optimal strategy for HDTX. Since patients with these characteristics also benefit most from standard dose chemotherapy, only randomized phase III trials will be able to solve the issue of standard versus high dose therapy. Two phase Ill trials, organized by the German Ale and AGO and by the European Group of Blood and Marrow Transplan- tation, recently merged to improve patient accrual. With a current inclusion of about 120 patients, this ,,HIDOC European Intergroup Trial\" will hopefully determine the place of HDTX in ovarian cancer. 1129 HIGH DOSE THERAPY IN PAEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH SOLID TUMOURS: WHAT ARE THE (HDC) with stem cell rescue (SCR) in childhood has been initiated about 35 years before, but its value for treatment of solid tumours remains to be debated. Without doubt, a progress has been made in reducing the toxicity, in particular the mortality, by the use of CSF-mobilized, peripheral blood derived stem cells (PBSC) in large number as rescue after the HDC. The increasing availability of PBSC has led to an increase in protocols using SCR after repeated high dose regimens also. in neuroblastoma stage 4 a randomised study has been published, demonstrating the superiority of HDC over eonventional treatment (Matthay, KK et al. (1999). N Engl J Med 341(16): 1165-73). Several non-randomised studies including our own experience with a series of 34 patients treated with stage 4 neuroblastoma as consolidation in a single centre support these results. In our series, a probability of progression free survival of 0.55 could be achieved. Additional, in relapsed neuroblastoma a significant number of children seem to benefit from high dose treatment. In Germany a randomised trial is ongoing for neuroblaetoma stage 4 patients as consolidation, fn soft tissue sarcoma, the impact of HDC remains unclear either in initial stage 4 and in high risk relapse patients. Recent own results demonstrated in a subgroup of stage 4 patients the benefit of an oral maintenance treatment compared with HDC. The SlOP is running a sequential HDC protocol for stage 4 patients. In Ewing tumours several studies and EBMT registry data suggest the role of Busulfan in HDC in patients with disseminated disease and in relapse. Within the Euro-E.W.I.N.G group a randomised trial for high risk patients using Busulfan is ongoing. Brain tumours are the subject of recent studies demonstrating an unexpected benefit in children with recurrent tumours. This approach is under investigation in Germany. In Wilms tumors only a limited number of high risk relapse patients are qualified to be treated by HDC and may have a benefit from this treatment. Recently in osteoearcoma HDC strategies have been discussed in the treatment of relapsed or refractory patients. 1130 THE ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY OF SARCOMA G. Gosheger, W. Winkelmann, Universit~itsklinikum MQnster (MOnster) Different procedures are performed in oncologic surgery, such as amputations, resections and resections followed by reconstructive procedures. The rotationplasty has a long lasting history and was modified for tumors around the hip and for tumors of the total femur by Winkelmann 1983. Especially in childhood the rotationplasty can be used in order to avoid multiple operative procedures of growing prostheses. The clavicula-pro-humero operation according to Winkel- mann 1992 states a convincing alternative to endoprosthetic replacements which are followed by multiple revisions because of loosening of the endoprostheses due to the growth. Over the last years the use of a vascularized fibula graft is rising. In combination with an intercalary allograft and/or an osteosynthesis the fibula states a perfused bone and provides a better bony union. In adults this procedure is commonly used in the reconstruction of diaphyseal defects. The use of an irradiated osteoarticular allograff for the reconstrucion of bone defects after wide excision of malignant bone tumors led to a high rate of complications (Rodl et al. 2000). In the reconstructive surgery of musculoskeletal sarcomas the endoprosthetic replacement plays an important role. Different systems, especially modular systems (Fig.l: The Modular Universal Tumor And Revision System - Mutars\u00ae-System), are used (Gosheger 1999). These systems allow to reconstruct bony defects precisely (Fig 2). Leg length discrepancies can be avoided and furthermore these systems provide very good functional and cosmetic results (Fig 3,4). The phantom pain can be avoided in all cases and in most of the cases no external support is necessary. In the future complications can be reduced by developments in endoprosthetic materials. if\u00b0.\u00a2ir Literature: Gosheger G, Winkelmann W (2000) Mutars--a modular tumor- and revision system.

Winkelmann W (1983) Rotation osteotomy pro humero--a surgical method for malignant tumors Z Orthop Charite, CVK (Berlin) Soft tissue sarcomas are rare tumors with an incidence of 2-3/100.000 representing approximately 1% of all adult cancers with equal gender distribution. They arise from mesodermal or ectodermal tissues and therefore occur at any site of the extremities, trunc, retroperitoneum or head and neck. Currently, more than half of all patients die within 5 years of primary diagnosis, mostly due to metastatic disease involving the lungs. About 10 % of the patients present with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, whereas 40 to 60 % of patients with Iocalised, high-grade soft tissue sarcoma will develop metastases, predominantly in the lungs, despite local control of the tumor. Median survival from the time of diagnosis of metastatic disease is 8 to 12 months. Only few drugs have shown single-agent activity above 15 % with the most active being doxorubicin, epirubicin and ifosfamide resulting in response rates of 18 to 29 % in fist-line treatment. Combination chemotherapy consisting of anthracyclines and ifosfamide results in response rates of 40 to 50 % with approximately 10 % of complete remissions, however at the cost of increased toxicity. Whereas complete remissions lead to prolonged survival, sometimes even cure, overall superiority of combination chemotherapy over single-agent doxorubicin has not been established yet. in second-line treatment after anthracycline failure, ifosfamide plays a major role with response rates of up to 30 %. Even after pretreatment with standard doses of ifosfamide, high-dose ifosfamide represents an active treatment option. The only new drug with interesting activity is ET-743. Several trials have shown response rates of nearly 20 % in untreated and 10 % in pretreated patients with advanced soft tissue sarcomas. About 50 % of all patients have shown sometimes long lasting disease stabilisation. Whereas adult soft tissue sarcomas have been treated uniformly until recently, new strategies aim at developing specific treatment modalities for well defined subgroups of sarcomas. A recent example is the successful use of the specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib G6ttingen (G6ttingen) Malignant and biologically heterogeneous group of clonal disorders derived from B and T cells at different stages of their maturation. The new WHO classification (2001) distinguishes between precursor and mature (peripheral) lymphomae of the respective lineages and makes the addition of immunological and molecular data to the classical histological features in order to arrive at a specific diagnosis mandatory. Therefore, information about the biology of a lymphoma is necessary to arrive at a diagnosis and to plan differential treatment modalities for individual patients is nowadays mandatory. In recent years, information about specific chromosomal and genetic events leading to specific lymphomas has become available. Mantle cell lymphoma, for example, is characterized by a specific translocation 11;14 leading to a deregulation of the Cyclin D pathway. This knowledge is important for the diagnosis, follow up and potentially the treatment of this lymphoma entity. Therefore, the review will focus on these three areas important for the treatment decisions facing oncologists today. Follicular, mantle cell and diffuse large B- cell lymphomas will be examined in detail outlining current knowledge about their biology as'well as the consequences thereof for diagnosis, follow up and treatment of lymphoma patients. 1133 CHEMOTHERAPY OF AGGRESSIVE LYMPHOMAS M. Pfreundschuh, E Universit~it des Saarlandes (Homburg) The demonstration that the 25-year old CHOP regimen is as effective, but less toxic than the intensified 2nd and 3rd generation regimens (Fisher et al., 1993)together with the evidence that the prognosis of a patient is mostly dependent on certain pretherapeutJcally identifiable factors(Shipp et al., 1993), have led many cooperative groups to distinguish 3 subpopulations of patients with respect to therapeutic strategies: 1. young low-risk, 2. young high-risk, and 3. elderly patients(>60 years). By reducing CHOP treatment intervals from 3 to 2 weeks in the NHL-B-2 trial, the DSHNHL succeeded for the first time in 25 years to improve treatment results in elderly patients (CR rates and overall survvival after 4 years by 14%). Similar improvements - albeit at considerably higher costs - have been achieved by the French GELA by adding the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody to the classical 3-week CHOP-21. Hence, the DSHNHL-99-1 trial which will answer the question whether addition of rituximab to CHOP-14 can further improve treatment results, is of highest priority. In young low-risk (low LDH) patients, the NHL-B-1 S 26 Invited Speakers trial of the DSHNHL demonstrated the superiority of CHOEP (CHOP + etoposide) over CHOP, thus establishing CHOEP as the new standard regimen for this population. Unsettled is the optimal treatment for young high-risk patients: since high-dose chemotherapy strategies have failed to achieve any improvement and since the new strategies which have proved to be successful in the elderly and young low-risk patients, respectively, have not been tested in this population, it is mandatory to treat these patients within well-designed propsective trials. While CHOP-21 is still the formal standard for this population, it appears to be justified to treat the rare young high-risk pateint who is not eligible for such a trial with CHOEP-14, because this combination has shown excellent afficacy in elderly high risk and little toxicity in young Iowrisk patients. 1134 PALLIATIVE RADIATION THERAPY B. Kimmig, Universit~tsklinikum Kiel (Kiel) Together with analgesic drug medication radiotherapy is the most important modality for palliative cancer therapy. On the other hand about 50 % of all irradiated patients are treated for palliative indications, mostly for brain and bone metastases. Radiotherapy for lung and liver metastases is limited by the low tolerance doses (20 Gy) of these tissues. Brain and bone tissue have tolerance doses of 60 Gy and more - so there is a sufficient therapeutic range.Indications for radiotherapy of bone metastases are Iocalised pain, destruction with risk of fracture and postope- rative irradiation after surgical stabilisation. Pain relief can be attained in 70-90 %, significant reossification occurs in 65-85 % depending on tumour histology and applied dose.Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for multiple brain metastases. Surgery should be considered first for solitary metastases. For patients with prohibitive risk factors radiation therapy is an alternative, improvement in neurologic function and relief of symptoms can be archived in about 50-60 % of the patients. The median survival time is in the range of 3-8 months and can be longer than 12 months for selected patient groups. The 2-year survival rate can exceed 10 % for special tumours and patients without extracranial tumour manifestations. This group has a change of long term survival. ,,Radiosurgery\" is a special concept of radiotherapy: a stereotactic guided single high dose irritation with a steep dose gradient outside the target volume to spare out the normal tissue. For brain metastases radiosurgery shows sufficient palliative results comparable with the results of neurosurgery. An interesting development of these technique is the irradiation of lung and liver metastases using stereotactic systems for the whole body.Not so frequent but important emergency indications for palliative radiotherapy are obstruction syndroms like superior vena cava syndrom spinal cord compression of radiosensitive tumours for example lymphomas, small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. 1135 ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY AND RADIOTHERAPY FOR INCREASING PSA AFTER RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY T. Wiegel, Klinik f. Radioonkologie, Freie Universit~it Berlin and 60% of patients with pT3 prostate carcinomas have an increasing or persistent PSA within 5 years following radical prostatectomy as a sign of local and/or systemic tumor progression. From retrospective studies a rate of 35-55% of positive bipsies from the vesico-urethral anastomisis is known. The best treatment of these patients is unknown as there are strategies of adjuvant radiotherapy, ,,wait and see\" and radiotherapy for increasing PSA. Results~ A number of retrospective studies have shown an increased rate of local control and ,,freedom from treatment failure\" following adjuvant radiotherapy with 50 Gy-60 Gy. However, until yet no survival benefit has been demonstrated. Three major phase-Ill randomized studies are accruing patients. In case of persisting or increasing PSA following radical prostatectomy 3-D planned radiotherapy with a total dose of 60 Gy-70 Gy 30%-70% of these patients will reach an undetectable PSA again. Forty per cent -65% of these patients have an undetectable PSA within 2-5 years after radiotherapy. When starting radiotherapy, PSA should be as low as possible (< 2 ng/ml). With higher PSA-levels the chance of achieving an undeteetable PSA again decreases beyond 35%. Severe late side effects of the 3-D-planned radiotherapy are infrequent (< 3%). Hormonal treatment in these patients is only palliative in nature with a median time to the development of metastases of 4-7 years. This hormonal treatment can also be given after failure of radiotherapy. Conclusions: Adjuvant radiotherapy follwoing radical prostatectomy gives higher local control rates and an increase in ,,freedom from treatment failure\", but until yet no prolongation of survival has been shown. Taking into consideration, that the follow up times for patients with radiotherapy for increasing PSA after radical prostatectomy are not long enough for definite conclusions it seems to have curative potency in selected patients. The most effective cytotoxic therapies at the present time for asymptomatic progression in HRPCA seem to be combinations of (1) estramustine phosphate with taxanes and etoposide resulting in response rates of 50% to 80% with a median survival of up to 22 months; (2) docetacel and mitoxantrone resulting in positive response rates of 80%. New generation anthracyclines such as pegylated doxorubicine do not result in long-term survival. Regimes employing ketoconazole with estramustine, vinblastine or bisphosphonates seem to be worthy of further evaluation. With regard to symptomatic progression of HRPCA, mitoxantrone has an impressive palliative effect in about 40% to 45% of patients, particularly when combined with hydrocortisone. However, side effects will develop in > 30% and similar pain reliefing effects can be achieved in 80% applying the bisphosphonates clodronate and ibandronate. Currently prospective randomized clinical trials have to evaluate the clinical role of both regimes. Oral chemotherapeutic regimes with a combination of estramustine phosphate, cyclophosphamide and prednisone appear to offer a less toxic alternative with response rates of 40% to 60% and a median survival of about 1 year. For the future, we urgently need (1) prospective randomized clinical phase III studies, (2) prognosticators identifying patients being at high or at low risk who might benefit from different therapeutic approaches and (3) generally binding eligibility and response guidelines in order to be able to compare trials of different therapeutic approaches. To improve progression- free survival and overall survival it might be even useful to initiate innovative chemotherapeutic approaches following local therapy with curative intent in patients being at high risk for systemic progression; currently various prospective randomized trial are under way to evaluate the outcome of such studies. 1137 GENOMIC INSTABILITY OF DISTAL 9P IN BRCA2 MUTATION CARRIERS L. Savelyeva, A. Claas, I. Matzner, M. Kim, K. Arnold, P. line mutations of the BRCA2 gene account for the majority of families with both male and female breast cancer. Identical BRCA2 mutation has greater penetrance in high risk families compared to population-based studies, and can also be associated with different cancer phenofypes. These observations provide evidence that the cancer risk associated with a particular BRCA2 mutation is modified by additional genetic or enviromental factors. Recent studies showed a role of the BRCA2 protein in the maintenance of genomic integrity by involvement in DNA repair and recombination. To determine whether mutation of BRCA2 in humans results in genomic instability we have analyzed constitutional karyotypes of BRCA2 mutation carriers. FISH anlysis from lymphocytes of patients of breast cancer families with germ line BRCA2 mutation revealed additional constitutional chromosomal alterations on 9p23-24. The rearrangements observed include inversions, duplications and amplifications. Additionally, a high level of random somatic chromosomal abnormalities on 9p23-24 has been shown. The 9p rearrangements are complex in all families analysed showing that this chromoso- mal region has suffered a number of intrachromosomal recombinations. A comparison of the rearrangements identifies an approximately 2cM overlapping region of recombinations ranging from D9S144 to D9S269. The incidence of distal 9p rearrangements was not detectable in a randomly assembled control group of individuals wildtype for BRCA2. These results appear to suggest a non-random clustering of somatic recombinations in distal 9p as of genomic instability in a subset of BRCA2 mutation carriers. 1138 REVIEW ON ONGOING STUDIES OF THE RADIOONKOLOGICAL WORKING GROUP (ARO), GERMAN CANCER SOCIETY (DKG) F. Kamprad, Universit~it Leipzig (Leipzig) Within the Radiooneological Working Group (ARC) a study group for Clinical Cancer Research (AKK) is dealing with organization, achievement and control of study protocols for various tumour entitles. Before study activation all protocol designs are checked by the protocol review committee and modified according to the committee recommendations. There are two yearly meetings of the study group in spring and autumn. During the sessions the ongoing studies are checked, results of closed studies are discussed and new protocol designs are introduced. At present 14 different studies are registered in the study group of ARC (see table). The number of patients enrolled in the various studies is variable and ranges between 100 and 900. ]n 2001 three new protocols are activated or are under the protocol review process. 1136 CHEMOTHERAPY IN HORMONE REFRACTORY PROSTATE CANCER (HRPCA) A. Heidenreich, Philipps - Universit~.t (Marburg) Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is the most prevalent neoplastic disease in men and continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Death from prostate cancer is associated with objective and biochemical progression following hormonal manipulations often described as HRPCA. Therapy for HRPCA is primarily palliative and therapeutic efficacy has to be balanced against treatment related side effects. Therapeutic efficacy is documented by a PSA decline of more than 50%, the response of bidimensional measurable disease or by improvements in quality of life assessments. S 27 Invited Speakers Our effords are focused onto the intensification of cooperative study protocols with other working groups of the German Cancer Society. Table ........................................... Grade NHL 98-1 Essen 1139 QUALITY OF LIFE EVALUATION IN PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY AND A VERTICAL NETWORK FOR PATIENTS FOLLOW-UP G. Cascorbi, Univ.klinikum, Klinik f. P&d. H~.mato-Onkologie (D~sseldorf) By the year 2010 one in 450 young adults aged between 20 to 45 years will have survived a child-hood malignancy. At present about 70% of all children and adolescents with cancer are cured. This improvement in survival is a result of new kinds of treatment like the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, high dose chemotherapy, to some extent bone marrow transplantation and the expertise of centralised paediatric cancer studies and services. There is also an increasing recognition of the side effects of the disease and the treatment on health status, in the short and long-term. For the long term follow-up it is of major importance to build a network between Pediatric Oncology and those disciplines involved in the long term care of the cured patients. Vertical network describes the association between specialized and general medical care as well as the transfer of information of the disease, the state of art for diagnostic and treatment, the knowledge about somatic long term effects and the appaerance of second malignancies. The impact of disease and treat-merit on Quality of Life and its domains, such as social, emotional, cognitive functioning, the psychosozial development of the child during treatment as well as at the end of therapy and in the follow-up period, has also to be taken into consideration. Such research is leeds to a better understanding how children feel and how treatment, psychosozial rehabilitation and reintegration can be optimised. For evaluation of Quality of Life questionnaires are measures, which can be used in a broad setting. As paediatric cancer afflicts children in a wide range of ages, the used measures have to be sensible for the occuring developmental changes. It is generally considered impossible to obtain meaningful anwers by standard approaches in children below a certain age (8 years). Proxyratings (mainly parents) are therefore used but whenever possible the child itself should rate its Quality of Life. Supported by the ministry of education and research Society of Pediatric Hematolgy and Oncology is establishing a vertical network and is developing in associated projects screening tools and standard measures for evaluation of long term effects and Quality of Life. Supported by the BMB+F 1140 FIRST RESULTS OF THE PROSPECTIVE LATE EFFECTS SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (LESS) IN SARCOMA PATIENTS J. Beck, W. St~hr, H. J0rgens, M. Marx, S. Bielack, M. Paulussen, J. MQnster, Stuttgart, D~sseldorf) Background: 70 percent of children with cancer are cured nowadays. This growing number of survivors needs more attention to their health status. Therefore, in Germany, Austria and Switzerland the Gesellschaft f\u007fr P&diatrische Onkologie und H~.matologie initiated a late effects working group to build up a ,Late effects Surveillance System' (LESS). In 1998 this prospective multicenter study was started to investigate late effects of patients with Ewing's, osteo- and soft tissue sarcoma treated according to the protocols of the GPOH. The investigations are performed according to the previously published standardized methods of the LESS study group. In our analysis we describe cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity in the first year after cessation of antineoplastic therapy in patients treated between 1.1.'98 and 30.6.'99. Results: 75 hospitals caring for 380 patients are included in our investigation. Information on heart, renal and/or hearing function is available in 247 (65%) patients. 18/154 (12%) patients treated with anthracyclines (Doxorubicin, Epirubicin) exhibit a reduced systolic heart function (fractional shortening < 29%). 3 patients suffer from ventricular arrhythmias. Altogether 5 patients require cardiac drug therapy. In 6/72 (8%) patients treated with Cisplatin a hearing deficit < 4 kHz (> 20 dB) is found. One patient needs a hearing aid. 10/50 (20%) patients treated with Ifosfamide show a reduced tubular function, measured as fractional phosphate reabsorption. One patient suffers from a Fanconi syndrome. Summary: Already in the first year after antineoplastic therapy impairments of the heart, kidneys, and hearing are noted. In a second step, we now want to investigate the prognosis of these impairments, the number of patients who will additionally suffer from late effects within a longer posttherapeutic interval, and the contributing factors. These important questions can only be evaluated in a prospective study. We will perform repeated examinations during a time period of five years. The standardized methods of LESS will improve not only our knowledge and the ability to deal with severe late effects, but also the after-care for the individual patient in a vertical network. The knowledge of major late effects can be used also for the modification of the oncological front-line therapy. In the future the success of the oncological treatment will be defined not only by the survival rate but also by the absence of severe late sequelae. 1141 OLIGODENDROGLIAL TUMOURS A. yon Deimiing, Humboldt-Universit~.t vary in respect to clinical course, histopatho[ogical presentation and pattern of molecular alterations. Oligodendroglial tumours diagnosed as WHO grade II usually are treated by surgery followed by close observation. In contrast, anaplastic oligodendroglial tumours WHO grade Ill require further treatment such as chemotherapy, radiation or both. Several aspects and findings are currently influencing the debate on the treatment of these tumours. 1) Oligodendrogliomas have been shown to be considerable more sensitive to chemotherapy than astrocytomas. Most data have been made available from studies employing PCV therapy. 2) Allelic losses on the chromosomal arms lp and 19q have been shown to be excellent predictive markers for response to chemotherapy in oligodendrogliomas. In fact, molecular markers may even have higher power than histochemical or immunohistological analysis. 3) Oligoastrocytomas / mixed gliomas have been demonstrated to carry in both, astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumour components, either molecular lesions typical for astrocytomas, or molecular lesions typical for oligodendrogliomas. These findings cleary show that oligoastrocytomas are clonal tumors and not mixed neoplasms with features of oligodendroglioma or astrocytoma other than a confusing histology. 4) Among both, oligodendroglioma and oligoastrocytoma, tumors of temporal localization genetically differ from those residing in other regions of the CNS. These findings point to a different genesis of those tumors and may explain the significantly poorer outcome of temporal oligodendrogliomas. 5) The individual threshold for classifying a tumour astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma or oligodendroglioma shows great differences among (neuro)pathologists. ]n addition, modern surgical approaches resulting in smaller specimens have further accentuated this problem. In this setting, molecular typing of oligodendroglial tumours may be of considerable help in reducing the interobserver variation among diagnosticians, in distinguishing between tumour variants and in assisting in the choice of further treatment for patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma and oligoastrocytoma. 1142 THE QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM OF THE GERMAN CANCER SOCIETY B. Schmitt - Thomas, K. H{Sffken, T. Junginger, R. Uni-Frauenklinik UIm, Dt. Krebsges. (Frankfurt/M, Mainz) The Quality Assurance Program of the German Cancer Society (GCS) is the basis for optimal quality of research and cancer care to improve quality at all levels. Several selective measures are currently implemented. There are two main areas which will be outlined: The ,,Study House Oncology\" deals with quality assurance of clinical studies, while the ,,Information Centre for Standards in Oncology - ISTO\" focus on quality in cancer care. The ,,Study House Oncology\" was established in 1998 to enhance the quality of clinical research in Germany and to overcome structural shortcomings. The ,,Committee for Clinical Studies\" of the GCS reviews and certifies protocols of clinical studies if certain quality criterias are met. A master protocol was developed to support protocol development which is in agreement with GCP-guidelines. Certification of all steps of a clinical study is planned, including the execution and publication. For the enhancement of structural quality, minimal requirements for study centers are being developed in cooperation with the clinical working groups of the GCS. Furthermore, there are advanced training seminars for physicians and medical staff, e.g. study nurses. A registry for clinical studies in Germany (supported by the German Cancer Aid) was established (www.studien.de) and recognised by the EORTC as a partner registry. The ,,Information Centre for Standards in Oncology\", established in 1995, deals with the improvement of quality in cancer care and is advised by the ,,Committee of Quality Assurance\" of the GCS. More than 50 clinical guidelines were developed by interdisciplinary discussions, S 28 Invited Speakers which define optimal quality in cancer care (diagnosis, treatment and after care). Now, the development and implementation of evidence-based guidelines has commenced (supported by the German Cancer Aid). It is of utmost importance to define quality indicators and to determine the outcome of cancer care to evaluate the impact of guidelines and the effect of diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, registration by tumour registries and in tumour centres is mandatory. The ,,Committee for Certification\" of the GCS has developed an audit checklist for which defines quality requirements of cancer institutions. There are separate modules for each sub-speciality in oncology. Certification will be based upon a recognised quality management system, which has to be implemented as a prerequisite for certification by the GCS. 1143 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE Deutsches Cochrane Zentrum (Freiburg) Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. This original definition by D. Sackett and the vast amount of literature based on it do not explicitely refer to the field of quality assurance but restricts itself to identify, assess and apply scientific information to be used as decision aid in specific clinical situations. The techniques used to achieve the transfer of scientific literature into practice is an excellent model for teaching but has serious limitati- ons to the use by the busy clinician. Extending this approach by including population-based views leads to broader setup including health care also on a system level, called Evidence-based Healthcare (EBHC). Original litera-ture is synthesized and condensed in systematic reviews, clinical practice guidelines and health technology assessment reports, provided to clinicians and decision makers in the health care system. As clinical practice guidelines are tools to allow quality assurance, they form - if their generation was evidence-based - a natural link between EBM in the more general sense and qua- lity assurance in medical care. If quality of a service is defined as the degree to which it con-forms to pre-set targets of care, this would require a rigid inclusion of all relevant literature to define these and would thus work on the same principles as EBM. 1146 QUALITY AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - THE GERMAN GUIDELINE CLEARINGHOUSE G. OIlenschl~ger, C. Thomeczek, Background: The role of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) as a tool for quality management in health care is now widely accepted in Germany [1]. However, the amount and the quality of the available CPGa has become an issue of concern since the German scientific medical societies started their CPG programme in 1995, because the majority of the more than 900 CPGs rely more on expert opinion than on scientific evidence. They often lack a thorough and transparent development process. In order to assure and to promote the quality of clinical practice guidelines (CPG), the German Guideline Clearinghouse (GGC) has been established by the German self governing bodies in health care 1999 [2]. Methods: Clearinghouses may function either simply as directories of available guidelines, or they may provide evaluative services, assessing the methodological quality of guidelines as well as the appropriateness of their recommendations before inclusion in their databases. GGC was built up as a national center of excellence which appraises the methodological quality and the appropriateness of CPGs; networks between guideline programmes, producers, evaluators and users ; collaborates with other health care quality programmes (e.g. HTA agencies, the Cochrane Collaboration, CME programmes); guarantees easy access and transparency. GGC provides practical support for everybody interested in CPGs . Results: Within 2 years GGC was able (a) to build a consensus on national standards of guideline development, appraisal, and implementation between CPG authors and users in the German healthcare system, (b) to finish guideline appraisal reports on hypertension, tumor pain, low back pain, asthma bronchiale, diabetes meilitus. Instruments and results of GGC (available via www.leitlinien.de) are used for quality management, disease management, and CME. Refererences: 1) AGREE Collaborative Group.

The German Guidelines Clearing House (GGC) - Rationale, Aims and Results. MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHCARE G. Ollenschl~ger, H. Kirchner, M. Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are increasingly common in the German health care system. Thus, CPGs have been described as as a tool for linking evidence based medicine (EBM) to quality management, as stated by the physicians' selfgovernmental bodies in 1998: Te principles of EBM should be implemented into the German Health Care System\" by the following means:(a) to assess systematically and appraise critically the evidence in health care; (b) to develop evidence-based consensus CPGs for priority problems in health care; (c) to implement CPGs using graduate, postgraduate, and continuing medical education, as well as audits and CPG-based information management; (d) to evaluate quality in health care against the background of CPGs. Until now, in Germany guidelines are used in a systematic way only by a minority of health care providers. In order to enhance the adaption of guideline based recommendations, health care provider and sickness funds are now developing and testing guideline implementation strategies. Examples are guideline based (a) decision support systems, (b) outreach visits in quality circles, (c) disease management programmes, (d) quality measures, (e) patient information. Effectivity of and barriers against guideline implementation programmes will be discussed. Ref. O]lenschl&ger G, Kirchner H, Fiene M (2001) Leitlinien in der praktischen Internist. Hartmann, Apotheke des Klinikums der FSU (Jena) We all want that when people get cancer they will get health care of highest quality. There are several aspects of health care delivery system that have the potential to effect quality: the resources or capacity of facilities, characteristics of health care providers and systems, and the way in which services are financed, organised, and delivered and a variety of mechanisms are being used to improve health care from the inside: total quality improvement initiatives, disease management programs, and implementation of clinical practice guidelines all have the potential to improve care. To improve health care from the outside a cancer data system is needed : Basic demographic information about the patient, type and stage of cancer, and nature of the treatment given have to be reported and aggregate data have to be available publicly. These data collection allow problem areas to be pinpointed (e.g., widespread use of an inappropriate treatment for a particular type of cancer) and the observation of trends over time in such characteristics as stage at diagnosis, percentage of patients who have complete staging information, and type of treatment given. In addition, each hospital is given back its own data in summary form, which it can use to compare with these national or regional data (,,benchmarking\"). 1147 QUALITY OF STRUCTURE: CERTIFICATION OF HOSPITALS H. Schmalenberg, K. HSffken, Klinik f. Innere Meal. II, Friedrich Schiller-Univ. (Jena) The German health system demands of any German hospital the introduction of a quality management system (QMS) during the next years. The most popular QMS, applicable to hospitals and internationally accepted, is set down in the International Standard ISO 9001:2000 which is also approved as a European and German Standard. The Klinik for Innere Medizin II of the Friedrich Schiller-Univer- sity Jena, was the first hospital with an oncological and hematological specializa tion certified according to ISO 9001 in Germany. Illustrated by this example the process of the introduction of a QMS is demonstrated. After the assessment of quality objectives, a quality manual describing the structure and the relevant processes was developed and introduced. The hospital's organizing structure was improved and the processes were optimized by feed-back mechanisms to the hospital's management, e.g. anonymous questionings of patients and employ- ees. The functioning of the QMS and the introduced improvements are verified yearly by an independent officially recognized organisation, in this case EQZert, UIm, Germany. With the introduction of this system the hospital gained multiple benefits: it rose not only in the patient's estimation but also increased its organi- zational level and functioning of relevant processes. Other comparable QMS like the European Quality Award or the German KTQ-System differ as far as neces- sary efforts, costs, objectivity and reliability are concerned. The introduction of accepted diagnostic and treatment guidelines in the QMS to improve the patient's benefit, is the task of medical societies like the Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft in the future. 1148 STRUCTURAL QUALITY, CERTIFICATION OF MEDICAL PRACTICES L. B6ning, Elisenhof (MQnchen) Patient and disease-oriented written specification of all procedures in an oncological practice constitutes an essential pre-condition for quality awareness in patient care. Quality assurance by means of specification of re-assessable quality criteria which are to be reassessed at regular intervals on the basis of education and further education, performance of therapy guidelines of technical companies and observance of the requirements of the oncology agreement constitute essential factors which support it. An internal quality management system has in the meantime been prescribed for hospitals, as far as off-patient treatment is concerned, it is certain that a provision of this kind will be specified soon in order to make it possible to compare patient care and thus gather information on the quality of health care. A multitude of oncologists in private practice intends to participate in such a comparison scheme, almost 10 % of practices have already been certified or are currently being certified. Structural quality on the basis of ISO 9001:2000 is demonstrated based on the example of a large joint oncological practice and community in a medical practice. S 29 Invited Speakers 1149 PROJECT CONCERNING A PROFESSIONAL-THEORETICAL (Berlin) Quality control of medical occupation in oncology is a main prerequisite for optimal results. Still, a great percentage of therapies are treated surgically and chemotherapeutically in small size and medium size hospitals or outpatient departments which miss that specific field. The knowledge of respective therapists, the extent of participation in studies and the surgical experience determine the effectiveness of therapies in oncelogy. At this time in Germany apparently many hospitals and clinics claim to be the center of different tumor entities. Occasionally, the organizing structure of hospitals and practices is certified by DIN-norms. However, this does not convey the professional qualification of the therapists. In Switzerland and Austria there exist laws that demand continuous qualification with examination in order maintain the resident's and speciarist's status. In Germany this occurs by an optional collecting of points, but there is no quality proof of these points required. Pilot projects take place in some medical courts. Since February 2001, in cooperation with the German Cancer Organization we have led a project for certifying oncologists in their profession. 1150 BREAST CANCER FIELD STUDIES - COMPARISONS OF THE RESULTS J.M. Engel, H. Sauer, Germany (Aachen, Dresden, Jena, Mar- burg, Munich and Stuttgart) have been conducted to verify and assess health care quality, using breast cancer as an example. Methods: All data collection was carried out in comprehensive cancer centers and is population-based, with the exception of Stuttgart. Classic prognostic factors and the initial treatment of 8661 women with breast cancer, diagnosed between 1996 and 1998, were examined. Primary therapy, breast conserving therapy (BCT), and the use of subsequent local radiation and / or systemic therapy (chemotherapy or hormone therapy) were analysed. Results: BCT was performed on 39.3 - 57.7 % of patients, By pT-category, the proportion of BCT in the six regions were as follows: for pTis between 37.8 and 64.3%, for pT1 for pT2 and for pT3 between 0 and 13.1% and for pT4 between 0 and 15.2%. Multivariate analyses, adjusted for age and biological factors, showed a significant influence of treating hospital on mastectomy rate. The use of radiotherapy after BCT (about 80%) was quite homogeneous in the six regions. The application of radiotherapy after mastectomy~ however, varied between 10.4 to 32.2%. In all regions, for premenopausal patients, the use of adjuvant systemic therapy almost reflected the St. Gallen-Consensus recommendations. In contrast, postmenopausal women were not always treated according to these standards. In all regions, age had an influence on treatment administration: elderly breast cancer patients received less BCT, less radiotherapy and less adjuvant therapy than recommended in the St. Gallen-Consensus. Conclusions: Quality management in medical health care delivery is necessary and achievable. Large variations exist between hospitals, more than between regions. Feedback of the results should be available to each hospital, providing a comparative summary of patient care that can be used by participating hospitals for self-assessment and quality-control. Quality management, therefore, is principally a decentralised, regional task. 1151 QUALITY ASSESSMENT IN MEDICINE - THE CONTRIBUTION OF CLINCAL REGISTRIES cancer registries have to evaluate the outcome of cancer care. For this goal valid data about prognostic factors, treatment and the type of progression, as a proxy variable for tumour related death, must be available. The following questions are among others to be answered: What is the epidemiolegical picture of the different tumours at diagnosis? What are the long term results of treatment? Are there significant variations between the hospitals? What are the changes over time? A detailed description of each cancer site is necessary for detecting the selection bias and for comparisons with the state of the art. The cohorts of the hospitals vary with respect to age, stage, comorbidity or social situation. For instance, the stage distribution of breast cancer is worse in the Munich region than in USA, but the stage specific survival is comparable even with controlled clincal trials. For prostate and testis cancer and for malignant melanoma ten year survival is also comparable. Variations between hospitals can be shown for all aspects. Natural variations are to be expected for patient characteristics and for stages. But they can also be detected for treatment strategies, pathologic results and long term survival, which must be explained as a hospital factor. Quality of life differences can also be detected. Fair comparisons are only possible by using multivariate analyses. Time dependent analyses are necessary for several aspects. How long will it take until a innovative therapy is available for all patients? Breast conserving therapy, cisplatin for testis cancer or the withdrawal of radiotherapy for ovarian cancer required up to ten years, nearly a constant for breakthroughs in our health care system. Important improvements in survival time over the last twenty years can be shown for malignant melanoma or prostate cancer mainly caused by early detection. Breast, stomach or colon and rectum cancer evinced only small changes. If the time of progression is available, the improvements of the remaining survival time can be checked. For thousands of patients with the most common cancers, no prolongation of survival time could be detected over the last 20 years. It is important to monitor the outcome of the health care delivery at all these levels and feedback the results to support and speed up possible improvements. 1152 SYMPTOM CONTROL IN THE LAST WEEKS OF LIFE F. Nauck, C. Ostgathe, E. Klaschik, Zentrum for Palliativmedizin (Bonn) Aim of investigation: Besides pain a lot of different symptoms and psychosocial problems occur in the final phase. Our aim was to show, if symptoms from patients dying at the palliative care unit differ in the last weeks from those how are able to be discharged and die at home. Methods: In a retrospective survey 544 patients treated from 1/1995 to 7/2000 were evaluated from our computer database. We elicit the symptoms, which were spontaneously reported from patients at admission. During treatment all symptoms present were noted three times daily. Results: The average stay of the patients which are discharged is 13,5 days and of the patients dying at the palliative care unit is 10 days. The most important symptoms at admission from patients which could be discharged (respectively dying at our palliative care unit) were as symptoms like dyspnoea increased up to 31%, weakness 37%, fatigue 32% and restlessness 24%. Pain was present in 7,7% of dying patients at our palliative care unit and nausea and vomiting decreased up to 3% respectively 7%. The mean daily dose of morphine had to be increased up to 188 mg , range 20 - 3180 rag. Conclusions: The dynamic situation forces us to draw our attention to the final phase and stay at our patients side until they die. During the last days of life, it is important to redefine the goals, as previously present symptoms may increase and new symptoms may appear. Besides a funded medical care humanity is essential in accompanying the patient in his last days of life. Insufficient pain relief and other symptoms make coping with illness and acceptance of progressing asthenia impossible. The treatment of symptoms in the final phase requires openness and honesty towards the patient and his family. In the terminal phase it is important to achieve the best possible quality of life. These results highlight the importance of a careful observation and adjustment of the treatment not only with analgesics in the final phase of the patients' rives. 1153 DEATH RATTLE IN THE TERMINAL PHASE: ORDEAL FOR PATIENTS AND RELATIVES C. Bausewein, Klinikum der Universit~.t M(Jnchen - Grol3hadern (M~Jnchen) Audible respiratory tract secretions in dying are often called death rattle. It is a frequent symptom in the terminal phase causing distress to patients and carers. The prevalence of death rattle lies around 45% in most studies, with a range between 23 and 92%. Pulmonary oedema and infection have to be differentiated. Secretions are produced by salivary and bronchial glands which are regulated via sympathetic and mainly parasympathetic pathways. In dying patients who lost the ability to swallow and to cough, secretions pool in the large airways and oscillate depending on in- and expiration. Treatment options are non-pharmacological and pharmacological measures. Non- pharmacological measures are explanation to patients if conscious and relatives to reduce distress. Positioning of the patient and gentle suction are further nursing interventions which are not evaluated systematically. Depending on the pathophysiology anticholinergic drugs such as hyoscine hydrobromide, hyoscine butylbromide and glycopyrrolate can reduce respiratory tract secretions. They have to be started early because they do not influence existing secretions. The success in relieving the symptom by this measures is about 50%. Most data is either published as small studies or audits. There is no evidence for non-pharmacological or pharmacological data. 1154 COMMUNICATING WITH DYING PATIENTS AND THEIR RELATIVES M. Weber, Universit~.tskliniken Mainz (Mainz) In the care of dying patients and their relatives physicians are frequently exposed to difficult questions: ,,Isn't there anything more that can be done?\" - ,,Am I dying?\" - ,,How much time is left for me?\" - ,,All this seems so senseless - can't you help me ending my life?\" In these emotionally stressfull discussions clearly structured guidelines in breaking bad news are crucial for the physician. A very helpful protocol is the ,,SPIKES- Modell\" developed by Robert Buckman und Walter Baile. The acronym ,,SPIKES\" stands for: Setting - Is the physical context right? Beware of discussions in corridors! Always try to sit down! Patient's Perception - How much does the patient know? What does he anticipate? Invitation - Is there a clear invitation from the patient to share information? What does the patient really want to know? Which details? Knowledge - Give the medical facts in small chunks by using a language intelligible to the patient S 30 Invited Speakers Explore emotions and Empathize - Identify verbal and nonverbal signals of emotion. What does the patient feel? What is the cause or source of the emotion? Strategy and Summary - Summarize the results of the discussion and agree on a plan for the further strategy By keeping this model in mind the physician will be able to respond to the real questions, wishes and needs of patients and relatives. He will be able to give rise to justified hopes and to be honest as well in his statements. Further essential rules comprise: Capability to empathy Willingness to acknowledge emotions Less talking and more asking No premature reassurance Including other health professionals in the process of breaking bad news. 1155 EARLY DETECTION OF OCCUPATIONALLY INDUCED LUNG CANCERS J Schneider, H.-J. Woitowitz, Institut und Poliklinik f(Jr Arbeita- und Sozialmedizin (Gieasen) The number of compensated occupational cancers in Germany is still rising. Lung cancer (LC) as a result of exposure to asbestos, radiation in uranium mining, PAH and/or crystallin silica represents the most serious problem. Early diagnosis of LC seems to have the major relevance for secondary prevention in high-risk groups. Promising results on early detection of peripherial LC especially adeno-squamous LC by low dose spiral CT were reported recently mostly in smokers but also in a study with asbestos workers. In patients suffering from silicosis diagnostic procedure by HRCT is a priori of limited value. Other tools under investigation, such as automated sputum cytometry or tumor associated genetic changes or gene products are not ubiquitous available in Germany. This methods are not regarded as sufficiently sensitive or specific to be introduced into screening programs at the present. Thus we focused to improve the diagnostic efficiency of tumor markers in LC diagnosis by mathematical evaluation of a tumor marker panel employing fuzzy-logic modelling. Application of the fuzzy-logic rule based system on the tumor markers yielded a significantly increase in sensitivity even in early stages for all histological types of LC at a high specificity also in comparison to silicosis patients. The advantages and diagnostic value of HRCT, sputum cytometry and serum bio-markers including fuzzy logic technics were presented and discussed. 1156 PRIMARY MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN TESTICULAR GERM CELL TUMORS (TGCT) Heidenreich, Philipps - Universit~.t (Marburg) Optimal management of TGCT can only be achieved by close interdisciplinary collaboration of the subspecialities urology, hematology/oncolegy. Contralateral testis cancer, cryptorchidism and positive family history are established risk factors. Gonadal testicular tumors are best diagnosed by palpation and scrotal (7.5 MHZ) followed by inguinal orchiectomy always preceeda further therapeutic approaches; primary chemotherapy only is indicated in extensive metastatic disease with vital threat. Radical inguinal orchiectomy is the standard approach for unilateral TGCTs; centralateral testicular biopsy fixed in Bouin's might be taken to diagnose testicular intraepithelial neoplasia (TIN) which will be present in about 5%; patient's age < 30 years and testicular volume < 12ml harbour a >34% risk for TIN making the contralateral biopsy mandatory in those cases. TIN cells will be eradicated by local testicular radiation with 18Gy thereby maintaining Leydig cell function. TGCT in a solitary testicle or synchronous bilateral TGCT might be managed by an organ sparing approach resulting in maintainance of endogenous testosterone synthesis in 80%, paternity in 10% if strict guidelines are respected by experienced surgeons. Following primary surgical management, serum tumor markers (AFP, hCG, LDH) are obtained and retroperitoneal as well as thoracic staging is performed via computed tomegraphy to differentiate clinical stages dictating further management. For stage classification, TNM-system of the UICC 1997 will be used taking into consideration pathologic, clinical and serum parameters; patients with advanced will be classified according to the IGCCCG classification. Both systems are congruent and form the base for an individualized therapeutic management. For pathohistologic evaluation, primary tumors are classified according to the WHO classification; it is of utmost importance to recognize all tumor components in nonseminomas as well as the presence of vascular invasion since these parameters have prognostic significance with regard to occult retroperitoneal lymph structures). Ideally, rounds off the optimal primary management of TGCT. 1157 THE USE OF HIGH-DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY FOR MALIGNANT TESTICULAR are a chemotherapy-sensitive malignancy and standard cisplatin-based chemotherapy such as PEB (cisplatin, etoposide, bleomycin) will achieve long term survival in 70-80% of patients (pts) with metastatic disease. However, two subgroups of pts possess a substantially worse prognosis: 1. Pts fulfilling ,,poor prognosis\" criteria according to the international classification (IGCCCG) (mediastinal primary and/or visceral metastasis and/or AFP > 10000 IU/ ml or beta-HCG > 50000 IU/I), who have a long term survival rate of about 50%. 2. Pts with relapse after standard cisplatJn-based chemotherapy who can be cured in 20-50% of cases depending on several prognostic factors (response to first-line therapy, tumor marker elevation, location of primary tumor). For both groups of pts, the use of high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with autologous PBSCT has been investigated in several trials in recent years. Within the German Testicular Cancer Study Group, a sequential HDCT regimen consisting of one standard dose cycle of VIP (cisp]atin, etoposide, ifosfamide) and 3 HDCT cycles of VIP, all supported by PBSC and G-CSF has been tested. A matched pair analysis demonstrated a significant survival benefit of 82 vs. 71% at two years for HDCT. A subsequent phase II study adding paclitaxel to the HD-VIC regimen has confirmed the long term survivar rate of about 75% in ,,poor prognosis\" pts. Treatment associated death rate in experienced centers is < 3%. In the salvage setting most strategies have employed conventional-dose chemotherapy to mobilise PBSC and test chemotherapy sensitivity of the relapsed tumor followed by one or two cycles of HDCT with autolegous PBSCT. A randomised multi-center with carboplatin/ etoposide to conventional dose induction with 3x VIP followed by one high-dose cycle of CEC. A matched pair analysis in the relapsed situation indicates 10% improvement of long term survival by the use of HDCT. Although the results of first-line and salvage HDCT have been consistently repeated within subsequent phase II studies, results of randomised studies comparing this approach to standard chemotherapy are not yet available. The application of HDCT as first-line and salvage treatment appears to be save with acute and long term morbidity being at most slightly higher than with standard dose chemotherapy. 1158 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF THYROID CANCER H.-D. Rdher, J. Schulte, carcinomas (papillary and follicular) are the dominating histological entities and operative strategy is primarily directed to its biological and clinical behaviour. Standard operation of differentiated thyroid carcinoma still remains total thyroidectomy including the central lymph node compartment. Depending on clinical presentation with suspicious regional lymph node involvement by palpation or imaging and also with wide indication in case of T3- T4-tumors with more than 50% incidence of regional lymph node metastases a consequent systematic lateral lymphadenectomy is indicated. - Limited radicality with hemithyroidectomy only is reserved for early findings of uncapsulated T1- tumors in low risk patient below the age of 45 years. - Within a median 6 years follow up time T1/T2, N0/la, M0-tumors are surgically curable in over 90%, while Nla-b, M0-stages reach the same results only in 52%. - In the interest of improved early diagnosis and better planning of surgical strategy it is strongly recommended to make wide use of fine needle aspiration biopsy. - Whenever surgically treatable bone metastases or such of the cervico-mediastinal region are identified, the possibility of reoperative surgery should be considered prior to any other adjuvant treatment. - Own experience and results are based on the treatment of 708 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (1986 - 98) inc]uding a consequent follow-up and thyroid cancer stage pTINOM0 - where Iobectomy is considered to be appropriate - thyroidectomy should be followed by ablation of thyroid remnants with radioiodine (I-131). After surgery, 1-131 uptake of the thyroid remnant should be measured with a test activity. If the 24h-uptake is greater than 20%, re-operation is strongly recommended to reduce the mass of remnant tissue before an ablative activity of 1-131 is administered. The short ranging 6- radiation (maximum range 2 mm in soft tissue) of 1-131 (half-life 8 days) allows to administer tumor doses of more than 500 Gy in thyroid cancer tissue taking up radioiodine. There are two different indications for radioiodine treatment (nIT) after surgery: 1. Prophylactic (adjuvant) ablation of thyroid remnants after thyroidectomy, 2. curative or palliative treatment of inoperable cancer or tumor not totally removable and/or of local recurrences, lymph node or distant metastases. In addition, therapeutic activities of radioiodine sometimes allow to detect metastases which have not been diagnosed by standard imaging procedures or with lower diagnostic activities of 1-131 as for example disseminated pulmonary metastases.Usually the first course of RIT is performed 3-4 weeks after thyroidectomy, because TSH then exceeds the level Of 30 mU/I which is considered to be sufficient to induce 1-131 uptake of tumor tissue. Usually standard activities of 1-3 GBq allow complete albation in appr. 2/3 of the patients. For curative or palliative treatment of tumor residues, recurrences or metastases, higher activities between 5-10 GBq are necessary. Frequently, high dose nIT has to be repeated at least 3-4 times. In patients with lung metastases, complete remissions are achievable in 50-60% of the cases, whereas remissions in patients with bone metastases are possible in 10-20% of the patients only. Follow-up of thyroid cancer has to be organized according to tumor type and stage including palpation and ultrasenography of the neck, determinations of thyroglobulin and TSH as well as (free) T3. The follow-up intervals should be not longer than 12 S 31 Invited Speakers months. Anyhow, an 1-131 wholebody scan 1 year after complete remission by endogenous or exogenous stimulation with TSH is indicated. In high-risk patients (tumor stages pT4N1M1) 1-131 wholebody scintigraphy has to be repeated sometimes every two years. Here the use of recombinant TSH for exogenous stimulation of radioiodine uptake is advantageous. 1160 MOLECULAR MONITORING OF MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA T. Flohr, R. Beier, A. Schrauder, B. BiJrger, M. Schrappe, C. Bartram, University of Heidelberg, Medical School Hannover (Heidelberg, Hannover) The analysis of minimal residual disease (MRD) has significant prognostic value for the evaluation of early treatment response and contributes to the individualization of chemotherapy protocols. The International BFM Study Group used clone- specific immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements as MRD-PCR targets with a sensitivity of 10-4 or less on two follow-up time points to define three risk groups: a low-risk group (LR) of 43% of patients with MRD negativity at the end of induction therapy (day 33) and before consolidation treatment (week 12) and a 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) of 98%; a high-risk group (HR) of 15% of patients with MRD levels of 10-3 or more at time point 2 and 5-year RFS of 16%; an intermediate-risk group (IR) containing the 43% remaining patients with a 5-year RFS of 76%. Relying on previous experience the BFM study group introduced MRD-adapted treatment stratification in the current trial ALL-BFM 2000. Based on quantitative real-time PCR (RQ-PCR) analysis, junctional regions of Ig and TCR gene rearrangements have effectively been used for the quantification of MRD in childhood ALL. LightCycler-assisted RQ-PCR in combination with SYBR Green detection proved to be an accurate, highly flexible and sensitive method for routine monitoring of ALL patients and until 12/2001 the remission status of more than 600 children has been analyzed. 581 eligible patients were enrolled from Aug 99 to May 2001. Risk group assignment on the basis of MRD detection was possible in the case of 453. (78%) patients, with 45% stratified into the LR group, 46% into IR and 9% into the HR group. Taking into consideration additional risk group parameters (prednisone response, translocations 9;22 and 4;11) patients were HR (17%), respectively. On-time MRD-based stratification in large prospective trials is feasible using rapid cycle real+time PCR protocols in combination with very reliable logistics and high laboratory standards. 1161 CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF MRD DIAGNOSTICS (Hannover, Heidelberg) The International BFM-Study-Group has demonstrated that standardized detection of MRD by identifying clone-specific T-cell receptor- (TCR) or immunglobuline (Ig) gene rearrangements can be used to define three risk groups (van Dongen et al., LANCET 352: 1731-38; 1998). Standard risk (SR): no evidence of MRD using two highly sensitive markers (sensitivity \u00a310 4) on day 33 (timepoint 1) and in week 12 before consolidation (timepoint 2); medium risk (MR): MRD positive at MRD of 310- 3 at timepoint 2. Complex logistics between the study center (Hannover) and the MRD laboratory (Heidelberg) had to be developed to guarantee on-time MRD results for the new trial ALL-BFM 2000: When initial diagnosis or remission during follow-up was confirmed in the study center, DNA from bone marrow samples was sent to the MRD laboratory. At least two independent Ig/TCR gene rearrangements had to be identified as PCR targets individually from the diagnostic material. The two follow-up samples when received in Heidelberg (week 13) were analyzed quantitatively by real-time PCR (LightCycler). MRD results were reported to the participating hospitals via the study center 4-6 weeks later, after cross- checking with additional patient data relevant for stratification. 581 eligible patients were enrolled in from August 1, 1999, to May 31, 2001. MRD- based stratification was possible in 453 patients (78%), of which 19 had only one highly sensitive marker. 71 patients could not be stratified on the basis of MRD, because follow-up material had not been sent or was insufficient, or because the MRD markers were not sensitive enough. For the remaining patients no initial material was available, no marker could be identified, or the patient failed prior to the 2nd timepoint. Based only on MRD results, 45% of the patients were eligible for SR, 46% for MR, and 9% for HR. When the additional risk group definitions (prednisone response, induction failure, translocation t9;22, or t4;11) were included according to protocol, all 581 eligible patients could be stratified: SR comprised 34%, MR 49%, and HR 17% of the patients. On-time MRD-based stratification is feasible in a multicenter trial for childhood ALL if very reliable logistics and lab methodology are available. Trial ALL-BFM 2000 is investigating whether this effort can be converted into a therapeutic benefit. 1162 MRD IN CHILDHOOD AML Labor, Medizinische Hochschule (GieBen, Hannover) During the last years it could be shown by two large studies (Cav6 et al (1998) N.EngI.J.Med. 339,591; van Dongen et al (1998) Lancet 352,1731) that MRD is an important independent prognostic factor and can be used for therapy stratification in childhood ALL. However, for other types of malignant diseases the clinical relevance of MRD is not yet clear. Therefore, a multicenter project was created under the umbrella of the German competence network ,,Pediatric Oncology\" to analyze MRD in childhood ALL, ALL-relapse, AML and lymphoma with different techniques. The aims of this project are the comparison of results gained by different methods to find the most suitable technique for each type of malignancy. Furthermore the best time points for therapy control should be evaluated. For children with AML two different markers were used: leukemia associated immunophenotypes and leukemia specific fusion genes. In the latter group 651 children were successfully screened by RT-PCR for one of the fusion genes AML1/ETO, CBFB/MYH11, MLL/AF9, and PML/RARa and 142 of them were found to be positive for one of these rearrangements (22%). Evaluation of follow-up samples showed different results for each of these rearrangements (PML/RARa excluded because of low numbers). AML1/ETO was detectable in nearly all samples at the early time points (TPs) 1 and 2 (before HAM). During the course of treatment at the TPs 3 - 5 (before and after consolidation and after HD/VP) about 60 % of the children remained positive and also after HD/VP and during maintenance therapy about 37 % showed the rearrangement. For CBFB/MYH11 the number of follow- up samples was much smaller. But also here a decrease of positive samples was visible from TP1 and 2 (75 and 80 %) to TP5 and later, where only 1/7 was positive for the rearrangement (14%). The treatment response for MLL/AF9 positive patients was even better: The number of positive samples decreased from TP1 (50%) to TP3 (10%) and after HD/VP only 2/22 samples (8 %) remained positive. The analysis by quantitative (RQ) PCR was performed at 49 samples of 12 AML1/ ETO positive patients. The results show a different response to treatment, but most of the patients reach a low copy number at TP5 and later. In 1 out of 2 relapse patients an increasing copy number was found prior to diagnosis of relapse. follow-up is an essential feature of the treatment of chronic and life- threatening diseases in young age. The intensive medical therapy of oncological diseases causes physical, psychological and social stress factors which fre- quently extend beyond the cessation of therapy. Since 1998 our department is working on the concept and realization of an outpatient psychosocial follow-up program. Based on the care-service-science-model the concept aims for the following parameters: 1. patient care is closely related to patients needs (care) 2. guideline-based instructions of care satisfy the need of quality control in healthcare (service), 3. creation of empirical data for the evaluation of care (science). In a pilotphase the primary contents of this concept were discussed with outpa- tient physicians and home-care nurses. Thus the necessary organization and structure was established. Different standards of care were defined for different patient groups according to the kind and degree of stress factors. These stand- ards were intended to warrant an appropriate level of care. In order to establish the appropriate individual need of care a screening instrument was developed and is now in clinical use. The diagnostical instrument considers the physical, psycho- logical and social sequelae and allows an indication-based kind of therapeutic intervention.Here the concept and experience of the \"Bonn model\" will be dis- cussed. Important steps of the implementation and preliminary results of this psychosocial follow-up will be presented. Finally a recent cooperative project about this subject with the department of Pediatric Oncology Erlangen was designed in order to establish guidelines for psychosocial follow-up. 1164 REGIONAL CASE-MANAGEMENT: THE AUGSBURG Kanth, H. Erhardt, Universit~ts-Kinderklinik Bonn, betainstitut (Bonn, Augsburg) With the objective of an improved connection of inpatient and outpatient treatment according to SGB V an interdisciplinary oriented aftercare concept has been developed and implemented for children and young persons suffering from cancer or other chronical and serious diseases as well as for their families. The Augsbur- ger model of aftercare ,,BUNTER KREIS\" is a pilot study representing a holistic, family-oriented case-management. It has been drawn from practice as a social- integrative approach in cooperation with staff of the hospital for children (member of the Krankenhauszweckverband in Augsburg), self-help groups and scientists. Case-management is understood as ,,help for self-help\" that is oriented at the individual case by means of goal-directed support and the interaction of appropriate cooperating partners for the outpatient continuing treatment at home. Thus, a network is established including potential part-hers, such as physicians, outpatient care services, hospitals, health insurance companies, self-help groups, advisory boards and other institutions. Since 1999 the beta institute gGmbH carries out a cost-benefit analysis of the ,,BUNTER KREIS\"-aftercare of premature and high- risk born infants. The analysis is performed in cooperation with the university of Augsburg. The results of this study confirm the assumption that qualified aftercare is efficient and effecitive. These results can serve as evaluation criteria for the assessment of further aftercare support systems. At present the well tried case- management concept of the institution ,,BUNTER KREIS\" for the aftercare of chronically ill children is transferred to the field of adult treatment. It is projected by the beta institute to outpatient networks of physicians treating patients with mammacarcinoma. We intend to present the Augsburger model of aftercare as it is realized in practice and discuss the results of the cost-benefit analysis. We will also provide an outlook on the possibilities of further implementations of aftercare institutions according to the ,,Augsburger Model of Aftercare\". S 32 Invited Speakers 1165 EVIDENCE OF PSYCHOONCOLOGICAL FOLLOW-UP: RESULTS OF A PROSPECTIVE, MULTICENTER STUDY OF CNS-TOXICITY AND HEALTH- RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN ALL-PATIENTS T. Langer, E. Ittner, J. Beck, Klinik f~r Kinder und Jgdl. (Erlangen) Background in 1997, we started a multicenter, longitudinal study investigating chidlren with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) - receiving only chemotherapy without irra- diation for CNS-prophylaxis according to the ALL-BFM and CoALL protocols - with regard to CNS-toxicitiy. The aim of this study is to investigate if CNS-prophylaxis with chemotherapy can lead to impairments in intelligence, attention and behavior. Methods Psychomotoric, neuropsychological and clinical status are assessed at 5 times: within the first 8 days after diagnosis (El), after reinduction therapy (E2), after maintenance therapy (E3), 2 years (E4) and 5 years after therapy (E5). We have obtained data of 109 patients at E1 and data of 86 of at E2. Mean age at diagnosis is 6.7 \"b 3.6, 54 female, 55 male. Following psychological tests are used: K-ABC, K-TIM (for evaluation of intellectual performance), reaction time (visual-motor (Qual- ity of life), Child Behavior Checklist (behavioral problems). Results Intellectual performance significantly decreased in the age group <6 years (y.) IQ(E1)=108 vs. IQ(E2)=102 (n=36; p<.05), was equal in the 9;11 y. IQ(E1)=109 vs. IQ(E2)=109 (n=34; p>.05), IQ(E2)=123 (n=11; p<.05). In visual-motor integration the 6-11 years old patients exhibited a significant decline between E1 and E2 (p<.05). There was an significant increase in externalizing behavioral problems (n=56; p<.001) for the 6-11 years old patients, but not in internalizing (p>.05). From the patients point of view quality of life improved significantly (n=42; p<.05) as well as from the parents point of view (n=58; p<.05). There were no significant changes between E1 and E2 in concentration (n=45; p>.05). Summary & Conclusion These preliminary results suggest that younger patients (<6 y.) have a higher risk of a decrease in their intellectual performance. Older patients tend to have rather an increase in intellectual performance probably supported by maintenance of school teaching throughout therapy. Less restrictions after completing reinduction therapy might lead to the improvement of quality of life at E2 compared to El. Further follow-up investigations (E3, E4, E5) will be needed to give information about the neuropsychological and psychooncological outcome of children with ALL, 1166 QUALITY DEVELOPMENT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE IN PSYCHOONCOLOGY AFTERCARE: M. Kusch, Abt. f. Psychoonkologie am KKH (Herford) In the german health care system different approaches of psychosocial and psychooncological care exist. The approches that stick closely to the course and medical treatment of cancer are of special interest for the development of disease and case management strategies, but most of these approaches are disconnected and spread over the different health care sectors. Some national health care strategies, for example the ,,Konzertierte Aktion gegen Brustkrebs in NRW\", try to coordinate and integrate the delivery of psychosocial and psychooncological care according to the demands and burdens of the patients at different points within the early identification, treatment and aftercare of cancer. Local strategies within oncology departments, that integrate the inpatient and outpatient as well as the acute treatment phase and the aftercare are not well understood and hardly known in germany. The strategies are based on the idea of comprehensive and continuous patient care, and try to realize a data- and guidelinebased psychological care according to the course of medical aftercare. They are finetuned to the medical schedule of aftercare and the demands of the patients because of the close cooperation of patients, physicians, nurses and psychologists during their development. The care-service-science-concept is one result of this local bottom- up strategy of quality development. The care-service-science-concept provides support to the clinician in his efforts to improve the care of his patients, to correspond with the demands of quality assurance and to evaluate the utility of psychoonco-logical care at the same time. The development and implementation of the psychosocial and psychoon- celogical aftercare in the departments of Herford, Bonn/Erlangen and Augsburg is based on the care-service-science-concept. The lecture will demonstrate the actual developments and basic concepts of psychosocial and psychooncological aftercare within the Apotheke des Klinikums der FSU (Jena) Financial pressure in the German healthcare system have led to the decision to introduce a diagnosis related group system (DRG). Starting on 01.01.2003 the hospital reimbursement system will be transferred from a payment depending mainly on length of hospital stay to payment per case that groups patients with homogeneous average costs based on diagnoses and procedures performed in the hospital. The time table given by the legislation is tight and many questions in the field of Oncology are still not answered and have to be addressed: Is Oncology sufficient represented? Are the Costs within a DRG homogeneous? Can new technologies and new drugs be implemented fast enough in usual care? Do DRG's influence the quality of cancer care? Quality management and indicators must be established because the benefit of a treatment can not be shown in the planned DRG system. Therefore, essential for efficient patient management will be the implementation of treatment guidelines and quality standards, as well as the co-operation over occupational groups, departments, and even over sectors (inpatient/outpatient), 1168 ORGANISATIONAL PREREQUISITES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION Siess, Klinikum rechts der Isar (M0nchen) In the past two decades significant improvements in cancer care could be achieved by the ongoing development of multimodal treatment courses. Cancer care today is multidisciplinary. The increasing use of multimodal therapies confronts clinics with the need to create new organisational structures. The high degree of specialisation necessitates that the separate disciplines seek ways of working closer together. This is particulary the case when staging results have to be evaluated and a multimodal therapy course chosen or when quality management issues and the coordination of different steps of a treatment are being to be considered. Furthermore, the implementation of the new DRG-based reimbursement system will lead to a significant decrease in the average length of stay. Therefore modern hospitals are forced to meet greater demands of organisation and management. By establishing disease-oriented organisational structures and by institutionalising interdisciplinary cooperation, e.g. in daily tumor board meetings, interdisciplinary outpatient clinics and in fixed disease management teams, the organisational prerequisites for implementing multimodal therapies are created. 1169 LOCOREGIONAL THERAPIES OF LIVER METASTASES C. Stroszczynski, Charite Campus Buch (Berlin) Techniques, indications and clinical results of several thermoablative methods (i.e. radiofrequency ablation, laserinduced thermotherapy and cryotherapy) will be presented including new technical developments to increase the safety and the size of ablation zones. Moreover, the advantages and limitations of the different imaging modalities for the guidance of thermal ablation will be shown. In addition, a review of the data concerning other concepts of Iocoregional treament of liver metastases will be demonstrated. 1170 CHEMORADIATION WITH GEMCITABINE IN PRIMARY INOPERABLE PAN- CREATIC CANCER - IMPROVED LOCAL REGIONAL CONTROL R. Wilkowski, V. Heinemann, H.G. Rau, registered for palliative treatment in pancreatic cancer. The feasibility as a radiosensitizing drug for inoperable pancreatic cancer is under discussion. Within 34 months 51 patients (pts) were treated with 5 weeks radiochemotherapy using concurrent G (300mg/m2 for 5 days/5 weeks) or in a further step G (300 mg/m 2) and Cisplatin (30 mg/m ~) weekly day 1 ; 5pts; or week 1,2,4,5 day 1; 25pts) . Results were evaluated retrospectively. Radiation therapy consisted of 1,8 gray/ day with a total of 45 gray/ 5 weeks. 19 pts received one prior chemoradiation with concurrent G/ 5FU. Afterwards 18 pts received 4 additional cycles of G/Cis. In a next step 30 patients received chemoradiation at first with G/Cis concurrently and up to 4 cycles iv G/Cis afterwards. CT staging: responses: CR 6pt; PR 31pts; NC 14pts ; No progression occured until the end of the chemoradiation. Operation procedures: 21 pts resections (12 pts nO; 7 pts R1; 2 pts not specified); 5 pts refusal due to good PR; 7 pts only laparotomy (peritoneal carcinomatosis). Toxicities during chemoradiation: leucopenia grade 3 (24 pts) and grade 4 (5 pts) ; thrombocytopenia grade 3 (18 pts) and grade 4 (6 pt). Until December 2001 14 patients were alive. Median survival time: 13.3 months ( 3,6 - 36,3 months); postoperatively mortality pts. Conclusions: G is feasible in chemoradiation with 5FU or Cis. The therapy led to high numbers of possible resections. The combination of G/Cis is more convenient because the consumtary handling of continous infusion techniques is not needed. A prospective randomized multicenter study is under the way to evaluate the efficacy of chemoradiation with G and Cis for primary inoperable patients with pancreatic cancer. 1171 QUALITY MANAGEMENT IN PATIENT INFORMATION - TRANSPARENCY AND QUALITY OF HEALTH INFORMATION FOR LAY PERSONS S. S~nger, J. Nickel, A. Huth, G. Ollenschl~.ger, ,~rztliche Zentralstelle Qualit~tssicherung (K61n) Objective: Health information for lay persons in print or electronic form are necessary in the decision-making process of individuals. Many of the available health information show significant deficits regarding quality and accessibility. The Agency for Quality in Medicine (AQUMED) has developed a program to improve the quality of health information for lay persons. This program involves and supports the development, distribution and implementation of health information. The purpose of these activities S 33 Invited Speakers is to establish a German Patient Information Clearinghouse. Method: Quality improvement of health information for lay persons is based on (1) the determination of quality requirements for patient information published in German, (2) the development of a standardised instrument for assessing the quality of patient information by non medically trained persons, (3) the establishment of an internet based patient information system for evaluated and rated material, and (4) the establishment and organisation of relevant partnerships with information providers, distributers and users of health and medical information. The principal building block to rate medical information for non-prefessionals is the DISCERN criteria for good patient information. The results of the quality rating of patient information are made available to the public to promote transparency of the assessment and rating processes used. Results: The internet based patient information service of AQUMED (www.patienten- information.de) currently comprises of a selection of approximately 800 information items covering fifty disease topics. Partnerships with appropriate information providers and users have already been established and tested in several projects. Conclusion: To further advance quality improvement of medical information for lay persons, it is essential (1) to develop and to intensify the cooperation with stakeholders and partners at different levels, (2) to develop the quality assessment tool for medical lay information and (3) to make the process of quality improvement for consumers more transparent and more comprehensible. 1172 DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL NETBASED INFORMATION SYSTEM F. Kallinowski, A. Mehrabi, R. Abu Azab, H. Schwarzer, A. Bayer, C. Herfarth, University of Heidelberg (Heidelberg) The constant growth and the complexity of surgical knowledge as well as the necessity to continuously update the information provided in a time-efficient and inexpensive manner puts certain demands on educational media in advanced medical education. These demands can only be met by a databank- and net- based multimedia information system. This project introduces such an internet digital multimedia library with medical content. The ,,Computer Based Training\"-Iaboratory of the Department of Surgery University of Heidelberg publishes the CD-ROM series ,,medLIVE\". Up to now 99 CD-ROMs with 125,000 multimedia information units of a common structure and a total amount of 65 GB of data have been produced. On the basis of already completed CD-ROM projects and using the object-oriented databank object-store (ODI, USA) an internet-based multimedia library was developed. The system allows to determine the individual requirements of the user by providing search and index functions. The special effectiveness of the system is due to the logical combination of documents and presentations that adjust themselves to the actual information required as well as the knowledge and experience of the user. Using multimedia components (sound, picture, diagrams, animations and video clips) the user is provided with the demanded knowledge and the information required via the internet independent of time or location. To allow continous updating of the contents, a virtual faculty of 850 professors was founded in cooperation with several German Medical Universities. A netbased authoring system serves to allow adding to and updating of multimedia documents without prior computer programming skills. Simultaneously the system is evaluated concerning its user-friendliness from the psychological and didactic viewpoint. This evaluation is used to improve the developement process. With the virtual faculty a committee has been founded to coordinate the development of further multimedia educational projects and to control their quality. Furthermore this organization can award the user a certificate for the completed course. 1173 SYMPOSIAWARE -MULTIMEDIAL CONTINUING EDUCATION K.A. Gawad, Univ.klinikum Eppendorf, Chirurgische Klinik (Hamburg) Continuing medical education could probably be eased by if top-class symposia and congresses were provided on CD-ROM or in the internet for anytime access. In the past years we have fostered the distribution of symposia on multimedia CD- ROM's. This so-called Symposiaware was realized and evaluated. The basis for the digital processing of a symposium is are the presented slides as well as the recorded soundsequences of all presentations. Slides are converted to digital information by scanning during the symposium or provided electronically, the sound is recorded digitally and the whole symposium is video filmed. Pictures and sounds are combined to digital videosequences and a presentation with graphic user interface is implemented. This allows access to the respective symposium at home or at work at any time. We have analyzed physicians at 47 universities for their demands concerning technique, content, presentation and didactics of a multimedia educational module. In a second step we evaluated 2 multimedia applications with surgical and gastreenterological contents. Content, value for clinical application and continuing education as well as quality of the CD- ROM were evaluated. 320 physicians were included in the first part of the survey. All participants wished the integration of text, pictures, animation and video. 95 % encouraged a provision in the intemet. 37 colleagues were interviewed concerning the applications. The appraisal of the symposiaware was generally positive. Questions concerning relevance and suitability of a a multimedia slide show for the procurement of knowledge were rated 2 (score 1-6, 1 being best) in median. 81% would by such CD's in general, 89 % would pay up to 50 ,, for such a product. Quality, language, content and user friendliness were all rated 2. Symposiaware is highly accepted in the medical fraternity. A standardized structure od contents as well as a platform independent, web based presentation is aimed for. A picture and video orientated visualization should be standard for better illustration. Symposiumsware is generally valued positive. It should cost no more than 50 and is a valuable source of information for physicians. 1174 STUDENTS\" RESPONSE TO CBT-MODULES IN SURGICAL EDUCATION A. Mehrabi, J. Zumbach, K. Gawad, C. Herfarth, F. Kallinowski, University of Heidelberg (Heidelberg) Medical computer programs were tested to determine areas for improvement and to find out whether the theoretical advantages mentioned above were actually perceived by the students. This study was conducted to determine the value of computer modules as an addition to educational tools in surgical education. 47 men and 30 women, all medical students, were asked to write free essays describing their experience with the medium. They were also required to suggest improvements in whatever area they considered important. The multimedia presentation was rated very high. 99% mentioned it to be effective. 92% stated they would use CBT modules as a studying tools and 83% found them to be a valuable addition to standard lectures, because of their video clips, animations and pictures. The students also stressed that the information presented needed to be structured in different levels of difficulty to assure that the students could fully profit from the knowledge presented. The major points of criticism concerned themselves with the quality of the presentation. The multimedia components needed to be of high quality to avoid distraction of the student from an educational tool that was otherwise described as a relaxing and interesting new way of studying. The students signaled that they needed to be able to select a level of difficulty in order net to be overwhelmed by the number of facts presented. In conclusion the response to CBT-modules in surgical education was very posi- tive. The multimedia effect was something that was considered valuable by the majority of the students. They also signaled their intention to further experiment with the medium, which will be an important step in making it a standard part of medical education. 1175 FAMILIAL BREAST CANCER: SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMME R.K. Schmutzler, Universit~ts-Frauenklinik (Bonn) Purpose: As part of the multidisciplinary program ,,Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer\" of the Deutsche Krebshilfe (DKH) the center in Bonn actually cares for 698 women from 565 families with multiple breast and ovarian cancers. The effectiveness of intensive surveillance in these women is still unknown. We here present first results from a structured surveillance program offered to these women. Patients and Methods: Women meeting the inclusion criteria for familial breast and ovarian cancer according to the criteria of the german familial breast cancer study group were offered to participate in a structured surveillance program including physical examination, sonography every 6 months, mammography and MRI-mammography once a year. Detection rate and screening parameters were analysed after risk stratification. Only women taking part in the program for more than 1 year were took into consideration. These included 45 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, 259 high-risk and 177 moderate risk women Results: Women with a high familial breast cancer risk show a high compliance for the surveillance program. In contrast, only a small number of women decided for prophylactic surgery. Within a median follow-up of 2 years, 43 breast carcinomas were detected. Of these 23 were found in the first screening round and 10 in subsequent examinations. In 10 cases recurrent tumors were detected. The detection rate was 92.59 for BRCA1/2 carriers, 40.31 for high risk and 16.04 for moderate risk per 1000, respectively. MRI-mammography showed the highest sensitivity and specificity of the screening methods. Breast sonography is superior of mammography in young women with dense breast tissue and is especially valuable as an interval investigation method between MRI scans. 85% of tumors were detected in early stages (pTf or DCIS and pNo). Conclusions: With the inclusion criteria of the DKH for ,,Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer\" a subgroup of women at increased breast cancer risk is identified. The number of detected breast carcinomas in these high risk women much higher than in an age matched population. A structured surveillance program including MRI and sonography allows the detection of early tumor stages. (Supported by the Deutsche Krebshilfe e.V.) 1176 SENTINEL CONCEPT FOR BREAST Bauerschlag, W. Jonat, Universit&tsfrauenklinik Kiel (Kiel) For more than 30 years the standard axillary lymph node dissection (SAD) has been the standard procedure for breast cancer patients. This method has proven that the lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor for recurrence and overall survival. The SLN technique is based on the idea that the lymph nodes lie in line and the first lymph node can predict the lymph node status. Several detection methods have been described, the most frequently used methods are the radioactive tracer or/and the blue-dye. In several studies this technique has proven to be practicable and to have an excellent positive predictive value. However, it could also be demonstrated that insufficient training can cause a low detection rate and a high false positive rate up to 17%. R. err (1999) revealed in a meta-analysis - including 3000 patients - a significant S 34 Invited Speakers survival advantage of 5.4% in patients with palpable masses who had undergone a prophylactic SAD. Therefore, false negative SLN means an unpredictable risk of recurrence and survival in breast cancer patients. Using the SLN technique lymph nodes can also be detected in areas other than the axilla, the prognostic value is still unknown. Data for the reliability of the SLN biopsy exist only from case control studies.The results of the 2 prospective and randomised multicentre studies (NSABP B-032 and GABGg/KiSS) are eagerly awaited. 1177 SENTINEL LYMPH NODE DETECTION IN WOMEN WITH CERVICAL CANCER, A PROSPECTIVE MULTICENTER STUDY C. Altgassen, 77 Lantzsch, J. Dunst, T. Validity of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) concept in patients with cervical cancer. Patients and Methods: Between December 1998 and November 2001 144 patients (mean age 42.7+/-12.3ys) with cervical cancer FIGO stage I (n=108), FIGO stage II (n=33), FIGO (n=l), detection during trachelectomy (n=17), exenteration (n=4), lml Albu-Res\u00ae labelled with 50MBq Technetium99m was applied into the cervix subepithelially at 3oo, 600, 900, and 12oo (n=51) Additionally alternatively (n=33) , 4ml of blue dye (Patentblue\u00ae) were administered at the beginning of the surgical procedure. Localization of the SLNs was documented by video (n=87) or drawing (n=57). 31 primary tumors were examined for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA of which 29 were positive for HPV (93.5%). The respective SLNs (n=30) of 22 patients were examined for HPV RNA by nested RT-PCR. Results: Overall detection rate for SLNs was 91.7%, sensitivity 76.9%, and negative predictive value 94.6%. With radioactive labelled albumin alone detection rate was 84.3%, sensitivity, and negative predictive value was 100%. In combination with Patentblue\u00ae detection rate increased to 96.7%, whereas sensitivity was 83.3%, and negative predictive value was 93%. Out of 31 patients labelled with blue dye three patients were diagnosed with a false negative SLN. Out of 58 patients labelled with blue dye and radioactive labelled albumin three patients were diagnosed with a false negative SLN. Detection rate of SLNs did not differ between tumors smaller or greater than 4ore in diameter. SLNs (n=30) of 22 patients were analysed for the presence of HPV RNA. 8 patients with histologically positive SLNs contained HPV RNA. 4 patients had 2 (n=3), and 3 (n=l) SLNs. Each of these 4 patients had one SLN histologically negative that contained HPV RNA. 7 patients had histologically negative SLNs without any evidence of HPN RNA. In addition, 7 patients with histologically negative SLNs contained HPV RNA transcripts indicating the presence of active tumor cells. Conclusions: SLNs could be detected successfully in the majority of patients with cervical cancer. Six false negative SLN was found. Detection of HPV RNA in histologically negative SLNs is feasible and may be useful as a prognostic marker. 1178 SENTINEL NODE process of metastasis of solid cutaneous malignant tumors is very complex and not completely understood.Distinct regional lymph nodes (LN),namely the first targets of the lymphatic drainage from the tumor, are usually the intitial sites of metastasis.Gould and Cabanas were the first to call them \"sentinel lymph nodes\" (SLN). If these are free of metastases,then the risk is low to find other regional LN involved.inversely, tumor positive SLN imply the indication for radical completion lymphadenectomy of the entire region. This understanding led to the concept of the so- called sentinel lymph node biopsy as a diagnostic strategy for a more precise melanoma staging, presented by Morton et al. in 1992.The meanwhile improved techniques of the LN detection, the surgical LN removal as well as the histological/immunohistochemical procedures for LN diagnosis have been confirmed and internationally standardized by an expert panel as the Augsburg Consensus in 2000.We now established a micromorphometric routinely applicable method for classifying the dimension of the SLN metastasis (so-called S-staging)in analogy to the measurement of the tumor thickness according to Breslow.This allows to fill the gap between the T and N component of the pTNM classification and to get better founded criteria for or against the decision to perform the completion LN dissection.In a high percentage the SLNE is obviously curative histologically $1 and $2 melanomas.By multivariate analyses the S-classification has been proven to be an independent leading predictor of later distinct metastasis and survival.Parallel retrospective Kaplan-Meier studies significantly (p=0,03) support a survival benefit resulting from SLN guided surgery for patients with intermediate thickness melanoma (1,51-4mm).The 5-year mortality of these patients decreased down to 13% versus 29% following the former \"watch and wait\" strategy.Furthermore,the diagnostic but not the therapeutic validity of the SLNE is the same as for malignant melanoma for Merkel cell and squamous cell carcinomas and primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma of the leg.So the SLNE and the S-classification are now indispensable for an exact tumor staging (pTN(S)M classification), the estimation of prognosis, for certain melanoma patients as therapeutic intervention, and as stratification criterion for therapy trials. 1179 MULTIMODAL TREATMENT OF LIVER METASTASES M. Lorenz, E. Staib-Sebler, Universit~itsklinik Frankfurt am Main (Frankfurt) Up to 50% of all patients with colorectal cancer present themselves with synchronous metastases or develop metachronous liver metastases. Only a minority is resectable and even in these patients recurrence occurs in up to 80%. Therefore modalities to increase resectability and to reduce relapse rate are needed to improve prognosis. To date, postoperative chemotherapy after resection remains still controversial. Concerning systemic application only retrospective studies are available. Of all postoperative local treatments only hepatic artery infusion was tested prospectively. Whereas hepatic arterial infusion ( HAl ) of FUdR plus systemic Mayo reduced the incidence of hepatic recurrence, the overall survival was not improved. The missing impact on overall prognosis was demonstrated already by our own study using adjuvant HAl with 5-Fluorouracil (5- Fu)/Folinic acid (FA) Recently significant improvement of the results of chemotherapy were demonstrated. Effective regimen with 5-FU/FA in combination with oxaliplatin were potent enough to reduce size of liver metastases by at least 50 % in half of all patients and made a resection possible in 20-50% of all cases. After resection of these initially unresectable patients a 5 year survival rate up to 50 % was reported. Therefore this preoperative modality is evaluated by a prospective EORTC - Study in resectable patients. Rates of resectability may further increase by different local ablative treatments such as radiofrequency and HAl. Despite all progress of surgery and additive treatments, prospective trials are essential before the introduction of these multimodal approaches into clinical practice. 1180 LIVER METASTASES: INTERVENTIONAL ASPECTS T.J. Vogl, UnJversitb.t Frankfurt (Frankfurt) Purpose: to present actual data for the clinical use of interventional techniques in the treatment of liver metastases Material and methods: Interventional techniques are defined metastases reveals a high local tumor control rate of 98 % in 965 treated patients with 2,000 lesions. The complication rate is low with a 3-year and 5-year survival rate of x years and x years, respectively. Ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation is characterized by a high local recurrence rate of x %. The use of transarterial chemoembolisation (]-ACE) is restricted to symptomatic or palliative indications. A new approach is its neoadjuvant use of reducing the size of large liver metastases for further ablative treatment. Conclusion: MR-guided Llqq- allows a precise tumor ablation in outpatients for lesions = 5 cm and = 5 in number. Currently radiofrequency ablation presents inferior results. TACE allows a palliative treatment and a neoadjuvant STATUS AND CANCEROGENESIS T. Grune, Humboldt-Universit&t zu Berlin (Berlin) It is commonly acknowledged that various turnouts are formed by several oxidising 'agents', like ionising radiation, various toxicants or pollutants. Most of these 'agents' have in common, that they induce a phenomenon called oxidative stress. Oxidative stress strongly induces the modification of various biomolecules, including DNA. In the human body permanently occur oxidation induced mutations. These mutations are readily repaired by the DNA-repair mechanisms. Nevertheless several of these changes are accumulating within cells, so that within time cells are formed which can be the beginning of a tumorogenous cell clone. These cells are often recognised and eliminated by various immunological mechanisms. On the other hand a functional overwhelming of the immunological response of the organism is able to lead to a growth of the formed cell clone which after transformation can result in a clinical relevant tumour. Therefore, several prevention strategies are directed towards the decrease of the primary formed oxidative DNA lesions. It is therefore, important to understand the functionality of the antioxidant defence system. The role of the various components of the primary antioxidative role, like the enzymatic and non-enzymatic defence systems, are focussed on the prevention of various oxidative damage to biomolecules. It is in this context important to know the mechanism of action and the role of the antioxidative molecules, including the antioxidative vitamins, minerals and other low molecular weight components of our food. On the other hand one has to understand, that these components can only act effective in a context with the endogenous antioxidant enzymes and repair mechanisms. The uptake, transportation, distribution and storage of antioxidative components is regulated and depends upon endogenous systems, therefore, a further investigation of these parts of the antioxidative defence is important to understand the role of antioxidants in our body. Since, our possibilities to influence the endogenous antioxidative defence mechanisms are still very limited, the current strategies of the prevention of the cancerogenesis are directed towards the exclusion of 'tumour-inducing agents' and the preventive usage of low molecular antioxidants by healthy nutrition or sometimes by pharmacological supplementation. S 35 Invited Speakers 1182 PRIMARY CANCER PREVENTION: EPIDEMIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE, EXAM- PLE COLON CARCINOMA S. Bischoff, Medical School of Hannover (Hannover) The role of nutritional factors and life style for cancer development and prevention is discussed controversially, since clinical experience suggests a crucial role that could be confirmed only partially by several recently published epidemiological studies. The issue will be addressed by means of the colorectal cancer (CRC) which is thought to be some kind of ,disease of the modern civilization'. The risk of falling ill of CRC within life span is estimated to be 6 %. Most cases occur after an age of 50 years. In 1996 more than 30.000 patients died of CRC in Germany. Thus CRC is the second most common cause of death due to cancer. These scaring facts strongly suggest that apart from genetic factors other risk factors must exist which rapidly increase in industrial countries. Such environmental factors including nutritional behaviors have been analyzed in some recent large- scale epidemiological studies. They indicate that the risks of refined sugars, as well as low fiber, fatty and protein-rich diets have been possibly overestimated in the past. Factors such as hyperalimentation in general combined with low physi- cal activity, but also high alcohol, high meat, and low vegetable intake seem to be of more importance regarding the risk of CRC. The individual nutritional compo- nents that may provide a protective effect regarding CRC development are poorly defined. Folic acid, methionine, phenols, flavoids and other antioxidants as well as calcium have been discussed as possible candidates. Studies on the polymor- phism of metabolic enzyme genes suggest that the risk of single nutritional factors depends on the genetic background of the individual. This may explain why the risk of a particular food component may be subjected to a considerable interindividual variability. Similar observations have been made for cancer dis- eases other than CRC. 1183 MALIGNANCIES H. Riess, S.H. Humboldt Universit~tt Berlin (Berlin) Since the introduction of cyclosporin A in 1983 organ transplantation became clinical routine for treatment of end-stage organ failures. Evidence has accumulated that organ transplantation, and the life long immunosuppression associated with it, are complicated by the development of an unusual assortment of malignancies. Cancer incidence ranges from 6% to 18% of solid-organ transplant recipients and 4% of renal transplant recipients, and is 200 - 1000fold increased compared with normal population. The predominant tumors are lymphomas (40%), skin and lip carcinomas (30%), or perineal carcinomas (2%). Tumors appear relatively early after transplantation, with Kaposi's sarcoma presenting at an average of 20 months, lymphomas at an average of 33 months, miscellaneous other tumors at an average of 67 months, and carcinomas of the vulva and perineum at an average of 107 months. Immunosuppressive drugs impair the ability of the immune system to cope with cancers caused by carcinogens such as sunlight or oncogenic viruses. These include Epstein-Barr-virus-related B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, human papilloma virus causing carcinoma of the cervix, vulva, perineum, and other skin areas, hepatitis B virus-related and hepatitis C virus-related is of B-cell origin and in up to 90% associated with the Epstein-Barr virus. The histolgy ranges from more reactive lymphoproliferatiens, lymphomas. PT-LPD frequently involves extranodal sites e.g. stomach, gut, lung, liver, kidney, cns and the a]lograff. Neoplastic regression after reduction or cessation of immunesuppressive therapy occurs in some patients with PT-LPD , or Kaposi's sarcoma. for chronic-phase CML patients is between 40% and 80%, but is inferior with advancing disease. The results of allogeneic HSCT in early disease stages of acute or chronic leukemias are currently compared to conventional treatment in several large prospective trials. These trials will contribute to define those patients, who will most probably benefit from allogeneic HSCT in early disease stages, thus avoiding potentially harmful and cost-intensive treatment. Recent developments in allogeneic HSCT include reduced intensity conditioning regimens, transplants of selected stem cells, and posttransplant adoptive cellular immunotherapy, which hold promise to expand and further improve this treatment modality. 1185 ADENOVIRUSES AS TOOLS IN CANCER THERAPY d. Roth, R Koch, J. Gatfield, C. Lenz-St~bppler, (Marburg) Adenoviruses have been explored for their potential use in the treatment of malignant disease. Currently, several phase Ill study protocols are followed, involving the intratumoral injection of head and neck cancers, in combination with chemotherapy. For cancer therapy, it would be highly desirable to design viruses with cytotoxicity that depends on the p53 status of the infected cell. The adenoviral oncoproteins E1B-55 kDa and E4orf6 inactivate and destabilize the tumor suppressor protein p53. However, it is controversial whether adenoviruses with a deletion in the E1B- 55 kDa coding region might selectively replicate in cells with mutant or absent p53. To address the role of p53 in virus replication, amino acid substitutions were introduced into the N-terminal portion of p53, leaving p53 transcriptionally active but resistant to inhibition and degradation by adenoviral oncopreteins. Surprisingly, even strong overexpression of this p53-variant allowed the virus to replicate and spread as efficiently as in the absence of p53 proteins, both in tumor cells and in primary endothelial cells, and in the presence of p14ARE Thus, active p53 does not inhibit the growth of adenovirus. As an alternative strategy to make oncolysis dependent on mutant p53, we have developed an adaptor protein that reactivates mutant p53 by binding simultaneously to the DNA of p53-responsive promoters, and to mutant p53. When the adaptor was expressed in tumor cells that contain mutant p53, expression of p53- responsive genes was strongly activated, and growth was inhibited. This strategy turns mutant p53 into an inhibitor of tumor cell growth and may enable gene therapy to eliminate cancer cells with unprecedented specificity. Further, similar adaptors may be used to render the expression of adenovirus-genes, and thus virus replication itself, dependent on mutant p53. 1184 TRANSPLANTATION IN ONCOLOGY: THE ROLE OF ALLOGENEIC HEMATOPOETIC TRANSPLANTATION D.W. Universit~ttsklinikum hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from histocompatible related or unrelated donors is now an accepted treatment option for various malignancies of the lympho-hematopoetic system. Similar to solid organ transplantation, the curative potential of this treatment modality relies on the displacement of the diseased organ system by normal donor tissue, which may additionaly exert antitumor activity by graft-derived donor immune cells. More than 1500 allogeneic HSCT per year have been performed during recent years in Germany. Major indications are acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Other, less frequent indications include myelodysplastic syndromes, lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. Allogeneic HSCT for solid organ tumors is regarded experimental and accounts for less than 1% of all transplant indications. In the past, the major stem cell source for allogeneic HSCT has been bone marrow, but now growth-factor mobilized blood stem cells are being used increasingly. The major disease-related determinant for the outcome and curative potential of allogeneic HSCT in patients with leukemias is the disease stage at the time of transplant, whereas the influence of cytogenetic and molecular disease characteristics on transplant endpoints needs to be further defined. In 1st remission of AML and ALL, long-term disease-free survival estimates (DFS) range between 30% and 75%, mainly reflecting heterogeneities in disease biology and patient selection. In 2nd and 3rd remission of acute leukemJas, DFS is between 10% and 30%, and further declines in more advanced stages. Similarly, the long-term DFS 1186 THERAPEUTIC WINDOWS IN THE GENETIC ENGINEERING OF HEMATOPOIETIC CELLS C. Baum, C. Baum, Dept. of Hematology and Oncology, Medical School, Heinrich- Pette-lnstitut (Hannover, Hamburg) Gene transfer into repopulating hematopoietic cells and lymphocytes offers new perspectives in the treatment of malignant disorders. Improvements in retroviral vector technology have resulted in clinically relevant gene transfer frequencies. Also, promising selectabie marker genes have been developed to enrich engi- neered cells prior to transplantation, or to control their survival and proliferation in vivo. However, elevating the efficiency may also increase the risk of genetic interventions, emphasizing the need to define therapeutic windows in somatic gene transfer. In the ex vivo manipulation of transplantable cells, side effects could originate either from the ectopic expression of the transgene or from genetic damage induced by the gene transfer procedure. Retroviral vectors integrate without inducing genetic instability, but at random positions in the host genome. With respect to contributing to a malignant phenotype, the risk of mutagenesis of cellular sequences has been estimated to be in the order of 10-7 per insertion. As further genetic lesions are required for tumor development, a single insertion of an otherwise innocuous retroviral transgene is not expected to produce severe side effects. Nevertheless, we observed for the first time leukemia induction in an animal model of retroviral gene marking of hematopoietic stem cells. Genetic and functional controls suggested that the leukemia arose by a combination of insertional S 36 Invited Speakers activation of a proto-oncogene and signal interference induced by the expression of a truncated cell-surface receptor, previously suggested to represent an inert marker. Others have observed leukemia induction in mice when expressing the multidrug resistance 1 gene, a marker proposed for chemoprotection of bone marrow cells (Bunting et al., Blood 1998; 92:2269). However, so far we have been unable to reproduce this observation in our animal model. Possibly, this discrep- ancy is due to differences in transgene copy numbers in single cells, or related to other aspects of retroviral vector design. These and further observations suggest that the incidence of toxic or mutagenic side effects of gene therapeutic interven- tions in stem cells and lymphocytes depends on multiple factors, including the persistence, expansion and plasticity of engineered cell clones, the transgene copy number, the expression level of the transgene, and its interaction with cellular signaling networks. 1187 THE CONCEPT OF THERAPEUTIC VACCINATION IN CANCER THERAPY Th. W~lfel, Universit~.t Mainz (Mainz) The concept of therapeutic as opposed to preventive vaccination is based on the hypothesis that ignorance of the immune system towards antigens expressed in certain tissues can be abolished by vaccination with the respective antigens. The antigens have to be presented by properly activated professional antigen-presenting cells (APC), which then leads to effective systemic T cell responses. Animal models confirmed this hypothesis in principal. Malignant cells do by no means show the features of professional APC. In addition, most of the tumor-associated antigens (TAA) identified on human malignant ceils are subjected to physiological immune tolerance. The discovery of human TAA prompted a series of phasel/ll vaccination studies in metastatic malignant disease during the past years. A variety of vaccination strategies involving diffe- rent TAA categories were applied. While vaccations were generally well tolerated, regression of metastases was only seen in a minority of patients. Clearly, a more detailed understanding of the interactions between cellular immunity and TAA is inevitable for further progress. Especially, we have to learn more about the mechanisms of tolerance, ignorance and energy induction and maintenance, the quantitative and qualitative assessment of cellular immune responses, the rules for the induction and maintenance of efficient T cell responses in vivo, and the hierarchy between distinct TAA categories. Future trials should increase our knowledge in these areas and identify appropriate clinical, phenotypical and immunological parameters for success or failure of therapeutic vaccination. The design of these trials should allow to find out, in which patient subgroups, against which antigen categories and with which vaccination strategy efficient and durable anti-tumor responses can be induced. Prospective, randomized phase III trials based on these findings would have best chances to establish therapeutic vaccination as a permanent modality of cancer therapy. 1188 IMMUNOCYTOKINES - A NEW CLASS OF THERAPEUTIC AGENTS AGAINST SOLID TUMORS A. Harstrick, K. Sturmh~fel, S. Gillies, Merck KGaA, EMD Pharmaceuticals and Lexigen Pharmaceuticals (Darmstadt; Lexington, USA) Immunocytokines are genetically fused, recombinant proteins, consisting of a humanized antibody and one or more immunological active effectcr-molecules (e.g. IL-2; IL-12; TNF).Currently two development: huKS-IL2 (EMD273066) and hu14.18-1L2 (EMD273063). Both carry two molecules of human IL-2, attached either to an antibody against EpCAM or against GD2, respectively. The mechanism of action is based on the induction of a strong immunological response, which is enhanced by the targeted delivery of IL-2 specific to tumor tissue. Preclinical data have shown that binding of immunocytokines results in the destruction of tumor cells by ADCC, CDC and NK- cell activity, followed by processing and presentation of tumor-associated anti- gens. These antigens lead to the activation of specific T-cells and further destruc- tion of the tumor. Both immunocytokines are capable of curing mice with meta- static experimental tumors. Furthermore, it could be shown in various models, that immunocytokines lead to the development of specific immunological memory, protecting treated animals against re-challenge with the same tumor. In clinical phase I studies, both drugs were infused over four hours on three consecutive days every four weeks. For huKS-IL2, the MTD was 6,4mg/m2/day with fever, drop in performance status and fluid retention being the most promi- nent side effects. In the hu14.18-1L2 study, the MTD has not yet been determined with the current dose of 7.5mg/m2/d. In this study, the most important side effects are chills, fever and asymptomatic hypophosphataemia. Biologic activity with systemic activation of lymphocytes and NK cells was demonstrated in both studies. In summary, immunocytokines constitute a new class of potential anti-neoplastic agents with an innovative mechanism of action and very significant activity in various experimental tumor models. Upon completion of the phase I studies, these agents will be further evaluated in IL-2 sensitive (renal cancer, melanoma) and IL-2 insensitive (NSCLC) tumors. 1189 EARLY BREAST CANCER DETECTION PROGRAM GERMANY - GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT U.-S. Albert, R. Fischer, R. ,,Konzertierte Aktion Brustkrebs-Fr0herkennung in Deutschland\". Breast cancer is one of the leading death of women in Germany. Diagnosis of breast cancer at an early stage has a better prognosis and better chances to be cured. The quality of care of early detection of breast cancer today should not be concentrated on mammography alone. The efficacy depends on the concomitant quality assuring arrangements of the interdiciplinary diagnostic chain including risk evaluation, clinical examination, technical diagnostic procedures including interventional techniques and histo-pathologic analysis in combination with excellent surgical and oncological treatment and follow-up. To establish an effective, quality assured, interdiciplinary early detection program for breast cancer in Germany a multidiciplinary clinical practice guideline has been developed.Methode: Stepwise process of guideline development according to the German Manual for Clinical Practice Guidelines (GERM-CPG). Results: The 10 consensus-statements for an early breast cancer detection program of 17 scientific and medical societies and organisations, patients selfhelp groups and advocacies have been elevated to the highest level of GERM-CPG. 1. Systematic evidence review of the 10 statements 2. Algorithm of the diagnostic chain for eary diagnosis of breast cancer 3. quality assurance with defined core clinical data for reporting the relevant clinical care 4. links between the recommendations and the supporting evidence, potential harms and risks 5. guideline for information; key areas on which information for patients has to be provided in respect to quality of life and informed consent/shared decision making 6. measurable outcome indictors and clear targets 7. procedures for dissimination, implementation and scheduled review 8. final consensus conference as part of the systematical process of guideline development Conclusion: The final result of the consensus conference of the quality assured, interdiciplinary early breast cancer detection program with its technological diagnostic procedures has to be dissiminated and implemented as an integrated part of a comprehensive disease management concept. Outcome analysis focuses on clinical relevance which include objective measurements (i.g. mortality rate) and subjective quality of life assessment reported by the patient.The stepwise process of guideline development can be recommended for further CPG topics. 1190 SECONDARY PREVENTION IN BREAST CANCER: PROBLEMS IN IMPLE- MENTATION W. Lorenz, Philipps-Universit~it Marburg (Marburg/Lahn) Secondary prevention in breast cancer comprises not prevention after therapy for this very common and highly rated human disease, but the complex system of detecting early cancer by a variety of immediate clinical, technical, surgical and pathohistological methods. The system also includes advice for the individual patient with strategies of quality of life and should guarantee shared decision making of the doctors related to the individual wishes of patients - all parameters which go beyond puristic epidemiological studies of the value of mammography in detecting early cancer. The program of secondary prevention was framed and designed as a clinical practice guideline. It was developed not only as evidence- based, but also as consensus- and outcome-based by a group of care providers and patients who were certainly experts of their own. Epidemiological studies alone will not solve the problem of early detection of breast cancer. This mechanistic view is outdated in a globalised world where cultural differences in health disease perception play an important role in guideline development for a particular health system. 1191 BEHAVIOURAL DIRECTIVE: 5 A DAY C. Pratt-Yule, German Cancer Society (Frankfurt) Everybody knows fruit and vegetables are good for your health. Nearly everybody believes they eat a healthy diet with more than sufficient fruit and vegetables. In actual fact over 60% of the population in Germany eat no fruit each day. 30% eat no vegetables. Nu-trition-related illnesses are a heavy drain on Germany's health budget. Epidemiological surveys show a lower incidence of such illnesses in Mediterranean and other countries in which higher quantities of fruit and vegeta- bles are consumed. The 5 A Day (5 am Tag) campaign aims to increase consumption of fruit and vegetables [n Germany and thereby to reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease, cancer, diabetes, etc. In achieving the target of 5 servings per person per day, canned, frozen, dried, processed and juice-products - together with fresh - all play a critically important role. The greater the variety and the quantity the better. This short, simple and positive message has proved its effectiveness in getting an ever increasing number of people to count how few servings of fruit and vegetables they eat each day and to increase their con-sumption accordingly. The German Cancer Society is sponsored by the Sanco directorate to promote pan EU development of appropriate elements of the communication programme S 37 Invited Speakers and networking organisation. In Germany the campaign's official patrons are the Federal Ministers of Health and of Consumer Protection, Nutrition, and Agriculture who sponsor projects such as the development and distribution of 5 A Day educational kits for schools. Membership of the 5 A Day Association is open to all health sector organisations and commercial operations who pay their annual subscription and promote con- sumption of fruit and vegetables in accordance with the principles laid down by the advisory committee of leading scientists. The Association's members include such prestigious institutions as the German Society for Nutrition and the German Cancer Society, which is responsible for its administration. The Association facilitates effective networking between members to communicate 5 A Day in the electronic, digital and print media. The awareness hereby created, together with promotion activities at point of sale changes purchasing behaviour and consumption patterns in the supermarket, canteen and restaurant. 1192 NEW STRATEGIES IN THE BATTLE AGAINST COLON CANCER C. Maar, Felix Burda Stiftung (M~Jnchen) Every year in Germany 52,000 persons contract colon cancer and 30,000 die from the disease. In other words, every year the population of an entire small city falls victim to a disease that can be prevented at a rate of almost 100 percent if it is diagnosed at an early stage. The reason it is not diagnosed more often in its early stages is that colon cancer is a \"taboo\" disease - it isn't discussed, and therefore very few people go for preventive check-ups. If we want to reduce the horren- dously high numbers of deaths, we have to inform the general public that colon cancer is a disease that can be healed if it is diagnosed at an early stage. In order to make the general public more aware of colon cancer we need innovative PR concepts and strategies. An excellent example of the success of novel PR concepts can be found in the United States. In the U. S., early diagnosis of colon cancer is advertised in various media and formats, and as a result the death rate in the U.S., which was almost 60 percent several years ago (similar to the death rate in Germany), has fallen to 35 percent in the meantime. Based on this model campaign from the U.S., the Felix Burda Foundation has given itself the task of reducing the death rate in Germany by 50 percent over the next five years. In order to reach this goal we are initiating effective public service campaigns in the media, which we are conducting together with representatives from the media and the fields of business and politics, and with medical and private institutions. The foundation has started a campaign throughout Germany to make the general public aware of the early diagnosis of colon cancer with the assistance of the media, company networks and testimonials from prominent people from business and the arts. This initiative consists of, among other things, a novel advertising campaign in magazines, a television commercial by the film director Wire Wenders, a testimonial campaign, and informative events on the subject of early diagnosis, which will be held in the workplace. In addition, analogous to Colon Cancer Awareness Month in the United States, the first German Colon Cancer Awareness Month (March 2002) will be initiated with the cooperation of our partners in the battle against colon cancer. Along with an intensified presence concerning this subject in print, television and online media, during the month of March the foundation will work to convince companies and institutions that early diagnosis is necessary, and to inform the work force about the prevention of colon cancer. 1193 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF CUTANEOUS MALIGNANT MELANOMA R. Kaufmann, Klinikum der JW.Goethe-Universit~.t (Frankfurt am Main) Melanoma precursor lesions and stage I malignant melanomas are preferentially removed by excisional surgery, yielding high cure rates in patients with early tumor growth. Today, improved understanding of prognostic factors and of mechanisms involved in turnout progression as well as the outcome of several randomised treatment studies have stirred therapeutic principles towards both, a more conservative and a more selective approach. Excision strategy is based on prognostic factors with margins ranging between 1 cm and a maximum of 2- 3 cm. Any benefit of wider excisions in more advanced tumors (> 4ram thickness)in order to prevent tumor spread has not yet been demonstrated and is questionable regarding the control of local tumor recurrency. Reduced safety margins enable us to cover most defects by either primary wound closure or by simple skin flap techniques. In critical anatomical sites and in lentigo maligna melanoma migrographic surgery has gained recent importance in order to further minimize the extend of exsional margins. Also a therapeutical value of adjuvant surgerical procedures remains to be shown. However, the widely used technique of sentinel- node-biopsy can serve as a prognostic tool and enables a more selective use of subsequent lymphadenectomy in patients with demonstrated clinically occult micrometastases. 1194 PREDICTIVE GENETIC TESTING AND DIFFERENTIAL PROPHYLACTIC MANAGEMENT IN MEN2 G. Fitze, Universit~itsklinikum Dresden (Dresden) Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is an autosomal dominant inherited tumor syndrome comprising the medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) as an obligatory feature. MEN2 is divided into three subtypes in accordance to further tissue involvement: whereas familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) is characterized by an isolated MTC occurrence, MEN2A cases are associated to Pheochromocytoma and/or primary Hyperparathyroidism in approximately 50% and 15-30%, respectively. MEN 2B has a similar disease phenotype with an earlier onset of MTC, and rarely Hyperparathyroidism. In addition, MEN2B affected hyperplasia of the enteric nerve plexi, and in some cases delayed puberty. In about 95% of MEN2A and in up to 85% of FMTC families, germline missense mutations of RET protooncogene have been detected in each one of six cysteine codons within exon 10 (codons 609, 611, 618 and 620) and exon 11 (codons 630 and 634). The substitution of one of these highly-conserved cysteine residues results in RET monomers capable of constitutive dimerization in the absence of functional RET ligands. In addition to these common cysteine codon mutations, noncysteine mutations located within the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of RET (exons 13, 14 and 15) have been described with an increased frequency, in contrast, MEN2B is associated in more than 95% of cases with a point mutation in exon 16 (M918T). Because of the assumed complete penetrance of MTC in MEN2 families and the reliability of genetic analysis for MEN2-associated RET germline mutations, predictive genetic testing including the exons 10, 11, and 13-16 has become a routine procedure in management of MEN2 kindreds. According to the reported de hove mutation rate of up to 9% in MEN2A/FMTC, and a sometimes unknown family history, the genetic analysis should be expanded to all patients with an apparently sporadic MTC, aiming to identify index cases of new MEN2 kindreds. Such tests allow the presymptomatic identification of individuals at risk and a prophylactic thyroidectomy before C-cell carcinoma occurs. Accordingly, the age for the recommended prophylactic thyroidectomy is dependent on the different risk groups identified through Genotype-phenotype correlation. 1195 FIRS'I-LINE CHEMOTHERAPY IN ADVANCED OVARIAN CANCER A. du Bois, J. Pfisterer, Dr.-Horst-Schmidt-Kliniken, UFK (Wiesbaden, Kiel) Over the last decades, the principles of treatment for advanced ovarian cancer have not changed. They still consist of primary debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy. Progress in operative and perioperative medicine as well as development of more effective chemotherapies have substantially improved outcome in these patients. Cornerstones in the development of effective chemotherapies were the introduction of eisplatin in the late 70ies and the introduction of paelitaxel in the 90ies. Actual standard treatment consisting of a platinum-paclitaxel combination chemotherapy achieves an objective response rate in about 3/4 of patients. The most preferable standard regimen contains carboplatin AUC 5 combined with paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 given over 3 hours every 3 weeks over 6 courses. Ongoing studies evaluate three options to improve efficacy of first-line treatment: (a) incorporation of further non cross-resistant drugs into first-line regimens; (b) modification of the sequence of treatment modalities; (c) modifications of dose intensity with either intraperitoneal therapy or high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell support. The recently closed or presently ongoing trials of the AGO Studiengruppe Ovarialkarzinom evaluated the role of incorporating a third non drug in first-line protocol Furthermore, an AGO-Ale study evaluates the role of highdose chemotherapy. However, even the best primary treatment and the highest remission rates cannot prevent from relapse in a substantial proportion of patients. Therfore, future studies will have to focus on how to maintain the high remission rates achieved with primary therapy and translate them into Iongterm survival. New treatment modalities including immunotherapy (anti-idiotype antibodies), small molecules (EGF tyrosine-kinase inhibitors), anti-angiogenic drugs, as well as conventional maintenance therapies are among the candidates being evaluated in next generation trials in ovarian cancer. Further progress can only be achieved by performing well design clinical trials with adequate patient numbers recruited within reasonable time periods. Therfore, participation in clinical trials is of crucial importance (open protocols see www.ago-ovar.de). 1196 SURGERY IN OVARIAN CANCER J. Pfisterer, A. du Bois, Klinik for Gyn&kologie und Geburtshilfe (Kiel, Wiesbaden) In early stage (FIGO la - Ila) ovarian cancer (OC) surgery plays an important role: The extent of disease can be determined only following exploratory laparotomy and careful evaluation. Operations on women with a adnexal mass that may represent OC should be carried out through a vertical abdominal incision. Aspira- tion of ascites or peritoneal lavage should be performed (cytology). An adnexal mass should be removed intact, since rupture and spillage of malignant cells will increase stage and affects the prognosis adversely. A complete abdominal exploration should be carried out, including evaluation of all intestinal surfaces. Any suspicious area should be biopsied. Omentectomy and random peritoneal biopsies should be per-formed. TAH and BSO is standard of care. A pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection is essential for staging. Approximately one third of patients will be upstaged. Inadequate surgery often results in understaging,inadequate adjuvant chemo-therapy and might have a negative impact on survival. In advanced stage (FIGO lib -IV) OC cytoreductive surgery is a crucial component of therapy. The impact of optimal surgery was confirmed by a recently presented metaanalysis including almost 7000 pts..In multivariate analysis the percentage of cytoreductive surgery was the most important independent prognostic factor. So, removing as much as possible macroscopic tumor is themain goal. The S 38 Invited Speakers surgical standard includes a vertical abdominal incision, cytology of ascites, in < stage IIIb cases random peritoneal biopsies, TAH, BSO and omentectomy. The role of systematic pelvic and paraortic lymphonodectomy remains unclear at this point in time, but might have an impact in pts. with palpable nodes. In approximately 35% of cases bowel resection is nec-essary to achieve a small intraabdominal residual tumor. Effective surgical management requires competence in surgical anatomy, cytoreductive techniques and inter-disciplinary approaches. If these criteria are met, tumor reduction to microscopic disease can be achieved in 50% of pts.. Further 25% of pts. can be reduced to residuals <2cm. The rate of major complications reaches 10%, and 30 days mortality ~ 2%. The median operation time is 5 to 7 hours. The benefit of surgical debulking is also apparent in stage IV cases. Every surgical procedure must be followed by a state of the art chemotherapy. 1197 ADJUVANT TREATMENT STRATEGIES IN GASTROINTESTINAL AND UROGENITAL TUMORS H.J. Schmoll, Martin-Luther-Universit~it Halle (Halle) The field of adjuvant treatment strategies in GI- and GU-cancer is rapidly moving in particular due to the increasing use of combined modality approaches and neoadjuvant timing of effective treatment strategies. For colorectal cancer stage Ill it has been demonstrated that postoperative adjuvant 5FU-based chemotherapy significantly improves survival whereas in stage II there is conflicting data which patient should be treated by adjuvant chemotherapy. Multiple randomised studies investigating the role of oral 5FU or combinations including Irinotecan or Oxa]iplatin are done and results will be available in 2003, hopefully further increasing the survival of rate. For rectal cancer adjuvant treatment with bolus or infusional 5FU plus Radiotherapy is standard in stage II and III, whereas in locally advanced or deep tumors neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery should be standard. The role of combinations including Irinotecan and Oxaliplatin plus 5FU in these patients, as well as oral 5FU(Capecitabine and/ or UFT) is currently evaluated in combination with pre- or postop-Radiation. In gastric cancer the US-intergroup study with combination of 5FU and radiation has achieved a significant survival benefit in all stages of operable gastric cancer and therefore set a new standard for USA as well as many countries in Europe. A further improvement may probably achieved with more effective combination chemotherapy protocols which are currently investigated in combination with radiation. Meanwhile, it has also been demonstrated that a preoperative course of combined chemotherapy with ECF can improve survival in oesophagical cancer; at least in UK this approach is new the current standard of care. In testicular cancer it has been clearly demonstrated that adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery of lymph node metastases or in high risk stage I achieves cure rate of >98%; however, currently the neoadjuvant application of chemotherapy is widely used which limits the surgical approach to a minority of patients in stage II. In locally advanced bladder cancer it is still unclear whether adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy can improve survival; there for this approach should be in particular followed within clinical trials which are running presently. 1198 ADJUVANT THERAPY OF BREAST CANCER V. M6bus, St~idtische Kliniken (Frankfurt) Recommendations and guidelines for postoperative adjuvant systemic therapy of breast cancer have becoming complex. The use of tamoxifen for 5 years in hormone-receptor positive patients reduces significantly the risk of relapse and death. Combined chemotherapy and tamoxifen was proven to be superior to tamoxifen alone in several trials. Adjuvant chemotherapy is more effective in premenopaueal than in postmenopausal patients and anthracacline-based regimens, on average, Full-dose epirubicin-based effective than moderate-dosed regimens. However, a lot of major questions remain open: - the optimal anthracycline containing regimen and its duration - the role of taxanes - the role of GnRH agonists as an alternative to chemotherapy in premenopausal, hormone-receptor positive patients - the role of tamoxifen plus GnRH agonists versus tamoxifen alone after chemotherapy in premenopausal patients who maintain ovarian function. - tamoxifen alone vs. tamoxifen plus chemotherapy in postmenepausal, hormone- receptor positive patients with good prognosis - the increasing role of specific aromatase inhibitors in comparison to the ,,gold standard\" of tamoxifen in postmenopausal, hormone-receptor positive patients. Should the established standard of care be replaced by these new treatment options (outside of clinical trials )? New available informations from trials examining these important questions will be discussed. 1199 CESAR-EWlV: A PLATFORM FOR DEVELOPING NEW ANTICANCER AGENTS. C. Dittrich, D. Arndt, J. Beck, D. Behringer, W. Berdel, C. Bokemeyer, M. its mission the Central European Society for Ant]cancer Drug Research - EWlV (CESAR-EWlV) has undertaken during the founding process which started in June 1999 until now great efforts in performing early drug development, phar- maoodynamic-kinetik correlative studies and phase I- and II-studies or in partici- pating therein, respectively, via the respective working groups and the CESAR- Biometry based on the comprehensive biostatistical expertise of the DKFZ. As a result of the CESAR-AWO, two novel CDK inhibitor indirubin are to enter clinical phase I studies. Further novel classes of ant]tumoral agents are inhibitors of tors of 06-methylguanin-DNA methyltransferase. Special input has been devoted to the subject of drug targeting. CESAR-APOH performed a population pharmacokinetic trial in order to find out the influence of the metabolic hepatic function on the PK of anthracyclines. CESAR-APOH and the Working Group CESAR-Phase I investigated two derivatives of the anthracene-9,10-diones with preclinically high ant]tumor efficacy and less cardiotoxicity than the parent com- pound on the base of an accelerated dose escalation scheme (Novuspharma, Hesper]on). The doses for ongoing further phase II-testing in gastric and prostate cancer, respectively, were determined within less than a year's time. CESAR- EWlV has been participating in a phase II-programme of Klinge Pharma-Fujisawa testing iv administered methotrexate-albumin (MTX-HSA) in pts with metastatic renal cancer w/wo prior cytokine therapy, with hormone-refractory prostate can- cer and mesothelioma. CESAR-EWlV has been participating in a randomized phase ]l-study investigating 0Cl-779, an analogue of the immunesuppressive sirolimus, at different dosages in pts with advanced/metastatic breast cancer. Actually, CESAR-EWlV is planning a prospective phase II-study of the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin alone or in combination with ZD1839 (lressa\u00ae) in advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium. 1200 CLINICAL TRIALS WITH MISTLETOE therapy in cancer is a special issue with multiple facets. One facet is a continuing and controversial debate on the efficacy of this treatment modality, although there are results of more than 60 clinical trials to shed light upon this topic. What are the key results of these investigations, and why does the discussion about the efficacy of mistletoe therapy seem to be never-ending - in spite of the existing ,,evidence\" ? In 1994 the dutch biostatisticians Jos Kleijnen and Paul Knipshild systematically reviewed all controlled trials on mistletoe therapy in human cancer patients. Although a clinical benefit was described in nearly all these trials, the authors concluded that the efficacy of treatment with mistletoe extracts is net really substantiated because of the ,,disappointingly poor\" quality of most of these investigations. In the following years several new clinical trials, some smaller pilot-studies, a large-scale, complex cohort analysis and four randomized controlled multicenter trials (RCTs) of mistletoe treatment in cancer have been completed. Whereas the smaller studies and the cohort analysis indicated in parts an astonishing efficacy, three out of four RCTs failed to show a clinical benefit of mistletoe therapy. The positive results - a better quality of life in patients with breast cancer - of the remainder are widely propagated but have not yet been published adequately up to now.Summing things up it must be stated that the proof of the efficacy and effectiveness of mistletoe therapy according to the criteria of evidence based medicine is still pending. Debate concerning this critical appraisal sometimes arises, because results of a single or a group of studies are often interpreted without emphasis on their methodological quality by the advocates of mistletoe therapy. Finally the heterogenity of mistletoe treatment itself with its different preparations, concepts and possible indications raises difficulties in making sim- ple judgements. 1201 ONKONET THORINGEN- INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION IN ONCOLOGY St. Kirn, Inst. of Information Systems, TU Ilmenau (llmenau) 1. Challenge Onoological diagnosis and therapy is one of the most complex, and most expen- sive treatments in medicine. A major problem for all persons involved - patients, their families, nursing personel, doctors, scientists - is the management of related information: generation, identification, access, interpretation, consolida- tion, and storage of all relevant medical as well as social information. An effec- tive, and efficient information management is necessary in order to achieve maximal survival rates, and an adequate quality of life of patients. 2. Problem The current focus of healthcare information management, however, is on patient records, especially on information about clinical courses on different levels of abstraction. Local perspectives are dominating, neglecting the interrelations among different actors (patient ... doctors), and different institutions, and their patient-/ disease-related knowledge. A further problem concerns the generally insufficient integration of patients in all treatment-related information management, and de- cision processes. These shortcomings cause limitations in treatment quality, they enhance workload of medical professionals, and they lead to increased budgets. 3. OnkoNet ThQringien e.V. In order to approach these challenges, OnkoNet-ThiJringen e.V. was founded in S 39 Invited Speakers 1998. The aim is - to develop, and to provide a WWW-based information platform for oncological treatments, - with local, and mobile access for authorized persons/institutions storing, main taining, retrieving, and accessing patient-/disease-related data, and information - in order to achieve a much better integration of patients, and of medical professionals in all information-related activities during diagnosis, therapy, and care. A major concern in OnkoNet-Th0ringen e.V. is therefore the inherent mobility of lots of patient-related medical informations, and information-gathering devices. Focusing on mobile computing - the presentation introduces into the technical approach, the information management processes, and the advantages achieved for patients, nursing personel, doctors, and the institutions involved. 1202 ELECTRONIC DIARIES USED FOR CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS H.B. Bludau, T. Riepe, A. Koop, 1. New procedures in pain therapy Drugs therapy as well as preventive arrangements still are basic aspects of modern pain therapy. AWMF and WHO guidelines consider pain logging and documentation, whereas psychic, social and spiritual Aspects are highlighted. Additional it is advised to assign the patient an active part during the development of the individual treatment plan: The assessment of pain intensity and its documentation has to be done by the patient himself. Only after assessment and documentation a valid therapy plan might be established. To realise this demands for outpatients, too, University Heidelberg is performing a multi-modal therapy concept with electronic pain diaries, individual drug treatment and psychotherapeutic approach. In our lecture we will present the technical part of this approach and show first results. 2. Technique The pain dairy will be realised on Palm-PDA using Java 2 Microedition (J2ME) by Sun Microsystems as well as the Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) and the Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP). To adopt the system into different clinical situations a modular concept of implementation was chosen. A desktop application is used to create the single questions of the diary, which will be transferred to the handheld devise as XML-file. Aside of the content, the logical dependency of the single questions as well as the rhythm of program activating is implemented in this file, toe. The answers of the patients is logged as a database entry in encrypted XML. Further development of this approach will be the implementation of wireless data transmission. The advantage will be that data can be appraised direct and a recommendation may be send back to the patient. 3. First results Electronic diaries enable a faster and more detailed data retrieval and appraisal compared with the paperbased version. By time analysis and parallelizing specific conclusion about the applied therapy and intervention is possible, resulting in an ameliorated opportunity of adoption of the treatment strategy to the individual needs of our patients. Fulfilling the needs of the patients will improve their quality of life. 1203 MOBILE AND WEB-BASED INFORMATION AND INTERACTION OFFERS FOR CANCER PATIENTS - STATE OF THE ART AND OUTLOOK . H. Krcmar, Lehrstuhl for Wirtschaftsinformatik, Universit~t Hohenheim (Stuttgart) New media have changed the information seeking behaviours dramatically: Many cancer patients and families nowadays utilise the internet as a information source and communication channel in daily life more often. But what cancer-related websites exist and what kind of services do they offer? Is there a possibility to contact other cancer patients? Who operates these websites and what are their financing models? Is the access to these services restricted through conventional internet access devices like a pc or do mobile services for cancer patients already exist? The objective of this contribution is to give an overview of web-based information and interaction offers for cancer patients. In contrast to other studies we do neither just analyse the quality of some websites with respect to a single type of cancer nor do we just name several cancer related websites. All different identified services on the basis of t00 selected German and English language websites are listed. These services are classified as generic or personalised information services and interaction services. The presentation will show that in the class of generic information services there are many similarities between German and English language websites whereas personalised services are mostly found on English language websites. Interaction services like Email, Chats and discussion boards are also widespread, but rarely used. Thus networking and social interaction among cancer patients can seldom be stated. This lack of use of interaction services on one hand and the potential benefit of virtual communities for cancer patients on the other hand is a starting point for further research. Designing and implementing virtual communities for cancer patients, in which patients and their relatives exchange information and emotional support independent of time, cost, stage of disease, mobility and independent of structures inherent in self help groups seem to be a promising challenge. This task lies at the heart of the COSMOS project. COSMOS stands for Community Online Services and Mobile Solutions. For further information on COSMOS please visit the website under http://www.cosmos-community.org. 1204 REALTIME CONTROLLED MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN CLINICAL APPLICATIONS G. M011er, T. Eymann, E. systems are essential for the automated processing of accumulated data and to manage patient care procedures. Example applications in patient logistics are patient/resource scheduling and transport path optimization, which create plans in recurring cycles. The application environment, however, is characterized by emergencies, delays and cancellations at any time, which can not be anticipated. The result of this discrepancy between application requirements and technical capabilities are lacking information feedback and frequent postponement of resource allocations. This leads to (a) discontentment among patients and to discrepancies in the treatment schedule, (b) to expensive idle time for resources, (c) to high work loads for staff, (d) to a patient transport system which can not schedule in advance and (e) to an increased and costly duration of patients' stay on the hospital wards. A unique combination of today's existing technologies (software agents, mobile user devices, multiagent systems coordination, data bases, ubiquitous computing technologies, autonomic computing) is sufficient to build an information system that supports real-time coordination of distributed, mobile hospital resources. It can provide (1) real time comparison between the actual and required state of the application environment and (2) spontaneous networking of the technical resources using automated reconfiguration without the necessity of manual intervention. The key component is the deployment of Iocatable, interactive Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) to connect human resources to the information network; other physical resources are connected by means of Iocatable Radio Frequency identification (RFID)-Chips. In addition, each device is represented in the information system by an autonomous software agent. Through interaction with the human user, and by tracking the device's position in the physical sphere, software agents can detect inconsistencies like unavailable transports or occupied examination rooms. In this case, the resource agent will negotiate a change of plan autonomously and decentrally with other software agents and thus establish a new individual plan of action. Adding new resources (patients) and removal of old resources (e.g. maintenance) accordingly leads to an automatic reconfiguration of the system as a whole. 1205 PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: STATE OF RESEARCH AND Universit~t zu K~ln, Medizinische Psychologie (K~bln) The paper highlights the different psychological and psychotherapeutic approaches in the light of the available research and regarding clinical necessities: educative/ informational approaches, individual psychological support/intervention, behavioral concepts, and group formats. Possible effects of these various approaches will be discussed in regards to the following three perspectives: ,crisis intervention', ,coping', and ,time available', and will then be compared on the basis of the three mentioned perspectives. Future research necessities will be discussed. 1206 GROUP INTERVENTIONS IN THE FOLLOW-UP OF CANCER PATIENTS J. Weis, Klinik f~Jr Tumorbiologie (Freiburg) Within the last two decades psychosocial group interventions have been developed to help cancer patients to cope better with the psychosocial sequelae due to cancer diagnosis and treatment. Most of these support programs are well- structured and short-term programs including the following domains: delivery of information, emotional and social support, improvement of coping strategies based on the cognitive behavioral approach as well as training of relaxation techniques. A lot of studies have shown that structured group interventions for cancer patients improve mood (especially the reduction of anxiety and depression), quality of life and coping. Even positive effects on survival have been reported, but these effects have not been proven yet. in Germany, up to now, there is a lack of randomised trials evaluating the effects of such intervention programs. Psychosocial interventions play an important role in rehabilitation and aftercare of cancer patients. Group interventions are established in rehabilitation clinics for many years as a part of the inpatient rehabilitation program whereas outpatient psychosocial care is still deficient. Therefore group interventions and outpatient programs for cancer patients in the aftercare are requested not only by the health professionals but also by the patients themselves. The presented paper focuses on the peculiarities of psychosocial group interventions in the follow-up. Clinical experiences as well as preliminary results of evaluation studies have such interventions are addressing more the problems of Iongterm adaptation, psychosocial functioning, health prevention and the individual resources. Based on empirical data the problem of the need and the demand for such interventions will be discussed with respect to research desiderata for the future. S 40 Invited Speakers 1207 EARLY DIAGNOSIS, RISK ASSESSMENT, RISK FACTORS, PRECANCEROSIS A. Schneider, Frauenklinik der Friedrich-Schiller-Universit~t (Jena) High risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) cause cervical cancer. Molecularbiologic data show that continuous expression of the viral oncogenes E6 and E7 is decisive for the transformation of the HPV infected keratinocyte. Besides these viral genes additional risk factors such as different cellular genes seem to be important for carcinogenesis. Screening for cervical cancer can be improved by the detection of high risk HPV types. However, testing for HPV leads to a higher rate of false positive results which may induce unnecessary psychologic stress for the women concerned. In addition, the quality of HPV testing under routine conditions has not been evaluated and quality control has not been established so far. introduction of HPV screening has therefore to be considered premature. This recommendation may be changed when it can be shown that negativity for high risk HPV guarantees long lasting protection and/or when therapeutic vaccines become available. The first vaccination studies with experimental HPV vaccines are in process and show encouraging results. Little side effects are noted and the induction of a specific immune response was partially accompanied by curative effects. Therefore, there is hope that HPV infections and HPV associated neoplasia can be avoided by vaccination in the near future. 1208 OPERATIVE THERAPY OF THE CERVICAL CANCER M.W.B. Beckmann, Universit~ts-Frauenklinik (Erlangen) The incidence and mortality of cervical cancer has decreased in the last 15 years. The carcinoma in situ of the cervix is more abundant than invasive carcinoma. 25 % of the women with invasive cervical cancer are younger than 45 years. There are two age peak with one at 35 - 39 years and the main peak between 62 - 64 years. As therapeutic options there is (1) the operation as well as (2) the combined radio- chemotherapy. Especially at young age the extensive discussion about the short and long term complications should lead discussed of the different therapeutic options. The discussion should be to an individual decision about the join of primary therapy. For young patients operability and the option of preservation of the ovaries in early stage of disease support the operation as the therapy of choice. In early stage lal and la2 adaptive operative techniques including conisation or tachelectomy with laparoscopic lymphonodectomy as well as the simple hysterectomy without resection of the parametrium but dissection of the pelvic lymphnodes are all therapeutic options with identical long term results. From stage I b to II a the operation according to Wertheim-Meigs (Piver-Typ 3) is the technique of choice. Up from stage II b there is a discussion about the therapy of choice. Centres specialized in operative techniques tend torwards for operative treatment including paraaortic lymphonodectomy. In stage Ill and IV disease combined radiotherapy is indicated. In individual cases primary exenteration with the aim of intraoperative disease free resection and good prognostic criterions maybe an option. Other operative techniques including the technique according to Schauter in addition with laparoscopic pelvic lymphonodectomy is only performed in elective centres and is not a routine technique of operative treatment of cervical cancer. There are ongoing studies which try to evaluate the operative staging as the basis of decision of therapy and the value of sentinel-lymphnode-biopsy. All studies attend to perform a stage adapted treatment and reduction of morbidity related to treatment of cervical cancer. These studies are prospective randomised trials performed by the Organkommission Uterusmalignome of the AGO. 1209 OESOPHAGEAL CARCINOMA: THE ROLE OF CHEMOTHERAPY IN MULTIMODAL TREATMENT M. Stahl, Kliniken Essen-Mitte (Essen) Due to the superficial system of lymph drainage OEC's present with lymph node metastases at an early stage of tumour extension (65% in T2, 85% in T3/4)and most of the patients (pts.)also have (occult) distant metastases. For this reason CTX has been included in combined treatment modali-ties since more than 20 years for improving the poor prognosis of the pts. Despite numerous phase II and a couple of phase 11 trials have been performed, only a few questions were solved regarding the role of CTX in localized OEC. CTX is used in two different resectable carcinomas (stage II): About 90% of these turnouts can be completely resected by experienced surgeons, but 40%(adenoca.,AC) to 50% (squamous ceil ca.,SCC) develop distant recurrence shortly after surgery. Due to a 50% remission rate in localized OEC, CTX should be able to reduce this risk. However, only 1 of 4 randomized trials in SCC and f of 2 trials in AC proved a benefit for combined treatment. The are a variety of reasons for that. (2)Locally advanced carcinomas (stage Ill): RO-resection can at best be achieved in 45%(SCC) to 75%(AC) of the pts. and 15% to 25%, only, will survive 5 years. In this situation CTX aims to increase the rate of R0-resection, which is the basis for long term survival, and it should improve distant tumour controll. Phase II studies seem to reach this goal, but phase III data is lacking. In conclusion a lot of work has still to be done for improving the poor prognosis of pts. with localized OEC and for defining the role of CTX within multimodal treatment approaches. 1210 USING COANALGESICS IN CANCER PAIN - EVIDENCE OR CLINICAL EXPE- RIENCE? M. Weber, Universit~.tskliniken Mainz (Mainz) During the last decades coanalgesics have emerged as valuable drugs in cancer pain management. Evidence based data supporting their use are mainly derived from non-cancer pain settings. It seems difficult however to perform placebo controlled double blind studies with coanalgesics in the setting of severe cancer pain due to several reasons; one of them being that coanalgesics usually require careful titration over several days up to weeks. When time is limited participation of cancer patients tormented by pain in such studies might be difficult to be justified on ethical grounds. Clinical experience shows that cancer pain syndromes with a neuropathic component regularly benefit from coanalgesics such as antidepressants or anticonvulsants. Recent studies have shown stimulating results in particular for gabapentine which is principally marketed as add-on antiepileptic. Other options include the use of NMDA-receptor-channel-blockers such as ketamine or amantadine. 1211 THERAPY Klinik und Poliklinik (Tumorforschung) (Essen) Opioids are the mainstay of cancer pain therapy. According to the WHO analgesic ladder, weak opioids such as codeine, dihydrocodeine, tilidine and tramadol, are recommended for moderate up to severe pain. Strong opioids are preserved for pain which can't be adequately palliated with step II opioids. The increased number of available opioids and different preparations enforces an adaptation of the traditional WHO guidelines for cancer pain therapy to the options of the European health care system realizing the principles of evidence based medicine. The importance of this task has become obvious by analysing the level of evidence of some recommendations concerning the use of opioids. if analgesia remains insufficient with non-opioids, the addition of weak opioids should preceed their replacement by strong opioids. There is only one study comparing the risk-benefit ratio of weak and strong opioids at equianalgesic doses. The availability of transdermal fentanyl weakens the priority of the oral application. The value of different application modes needs to be more specified with regard to the specific pain syndromes (stable, periodic, break through pain). There are several reasons to doubt the first rank of morphine. The metabolism of morphine leads to two active metabolites (3 and 6-glucuronide), which accumulate in renal insufficiency and cause severe side-effects. Other strong opioids lack active metabolites. Moreover, the oral bioavailibilty of morphine correlates significantly with the first pass elimination capacity of the liver. In comparison to morphine the value of other I~-agonists or application modes remains still unclear. This especially holds true in risk patients like e.g. renal or liver insufficiency, severe constipation, cerebral metastases, elderly patients or neuropathic pain. The efficacy of opioid-rotation has only been demonstrated in retrospective studies. Nevertheless, it is recommended in cases of unmanagable side effects. Oral transmucosal fentanyl seems to be most suited for the therapy of break through pain. However, there is only one randomized controlled trial concerning this point. In conclusion: Validation studies of an adapted guideline are strongly recommended. This can be done by operationaiisation of key points. 1212 SUPPORTIVE CARE - RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY C.B. Bokemeyer, Universit~.tsklinik T~bingen (T~Jbingen) Strategies using or reduce toxicities of chemo- or radiotherapy have been in rapid development in recent years. Prevention of chemotherapy- induced emesis by 5-HT3-antagonists for highly emetogenic chemotherapy is considered standard therapy. New agents targeting the treatment of delayed emesis (> 24 hours post chemotherapy) are in development. These drugs act as neurokinin (NK)-I-receptor antagonists and have shown to improve both the severity of acute emesis in combination to 5-HT3-antagonists and to reduce the incidence of delayed emesis. For hematopoetic growth factors following chemotherapy guidelines have been developed particulary for the use of G-CSF. Recombinant human erythropoetin (rh-EPO) is now increasingly used in cancer patients in order to reduce red blood cell transfusions, improve well being and symptoms of fatigue. Trials are looking at an improvement in ant[tumor response by maintaining high hemoglobin levels with rh-EPO application in combination with radiotherapy, chemotherapy or combined modality treatment. The development of a novel erythropoiesis stimulating protein (NESP) may further impact on anemia management in cancer patients. Another field of investigation is protection from toxic effects of cancer treatment. The thiol-derivate amifostine has been shown to reduce cisplatin-associated nephrotoxicity and radiation-induced xerostomia. Studies are testing its potential for toxicity reduction in combined modality treatment and with high-dose chemotherapy plus autologous stem cell transplantation. Dexrazoxane, a protective agent used to decrease antracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is studied to define its role in routine care. Myalgias following paclitaxel and neurotoxicity following oxaliplatin treatment are important side- effects for patients receiving these drugs and gabapentin (g-aminobutyric acid analog) is investigated to ameliorate these toxicities. Areas of investigation are the preservation of fertility after anticancer treatment and the reduction of the risk for secondary malignancies. Results from preclinical models and early clinical trials need to be confirmed in prospective studies in order to define the role of supportive therapeutics in patient care. S 41 Invited Speakers 1213 ETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY the vulva. Over the last two decades, the prevalence of VlN has increased predominantly in white women younger than 35 years, for whom the incidence rate has nearly tripled. This increase parallels similar trends in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and is associated with changing sexual habits, human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, and smoking. However, the incidence of vulvar cancer remained stable. Clinic-based studies have suggested that human papillomavirus might play an important role in the aetiology of VlN because 30-90% of the lesions harbour HPV DNA with HPV 16, 18, 33 and 39 being the predominant types. HPV are small, non- enveloped DNA viruses with a circular, double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 8000 base pairs. Nearly 100 different HPV types are currently recognized. The hallmark of HPV infection include a restricted tropism for human epithelial cells with a localization depending on the HPV type and a viral cycle linked to differentiation of host keratinocytes. Women with vulvar HPV infection are at an increased risk of the infection spreading. About 25% of the VlN patients will have persistent disease or recurrences which are more common in women with multifocal vulvar disease and, additionally, in patients with multicentric disease involving cervix, vagina and/or anus. A monocIonal derivation for vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia has been shown. Two different entities have been postulated for the aetiology of VlN 3 / vulvar cancer: 1.Vulvar cancer of the elder, usually non-smoking women (> 70 years) is associated with the histologic subtype of well-differentiated squamous cell cancer, rare presence of HPV and rare association of other genital neoplasia. 2. Vulvar cancer of the younger, frequently smoking women with VlN being the precursor lesion and a frequent HPV detection, which is associated with a basaloid or warty histology. Often, other genital neoplasia may be found. However, these two entities do show significant overlap. There is a substantial risk that untreated VlN 3 will progress to invasive cancer, however, the actual percentage of malignant transformation is unknown. After VlN therapy, there still remains a 5% risk of progression which requires careful follow up of the patients. 1214 IS THERE A ROLE OF CYTOTOXIC THERAPY IN VULVA CARCINOMA W.S. SchrTder, ZKH St. JQrgenstraae (Bremen) As the administration of cytotoxic drugs in vulva carcinoma is limited because of higher age at the time of diagnosis and the results of various regimen were generally disappointing, only a few studies with small numbers of patients are reported. Summarizing the data in the literature there is no preferable cytotoxic drug and no general recommendations for their use can be given. Currently, in analogy to the treatment of cervical cancer cytotoxic drugs were mainly used in combination with radiotherapy. Cis-platinum,5-Fluorouracil and Mitomycin are the preferably administred compounds. Despite the lack of systematic prospective studies with larger number of patients the following situations seem suitable for radiochemotherapy: 1. locally advanced vulva carcinoma. 2. pelvic and/or distant metastases. 3. neoadjuvant (?). 4. Ioco- regional relapse. Regardless the different therapeutic approaches and study designs a clinical complete remission could be observed in about 50% of the cases with primary radiochemotherapy. Partial remissions are of no survival benefits for patients with advanced vulva cancer. Considerable toxicity, particularly of the skin, and treatment related deaths had to be notified. in conclusion, radiochemotherapy seems to be more efficient than radio- or chemotherapy alone, but the data are only weak. In selected cases avoiding of pelvic exenterations appear possible and radiochemotherapy can also be considered in local-regional recurrences. However, toxicity in these usually elderly patients is remarkable and has to be considered in making a therapeutic decision. 1215 TREATMENT TRENDS IN OPERABLE CARCINOMAS OF THE VULVA R. KL~rzl, I. Frauenklinik der LMU M~nchen (MQnchen) The standard procedure for the treatment of vulvar cancer is the radical vulvectomy with groin dissection, formerly made en-bloc using the butterfly incision, today using separate incisions. The question arises under which conditions it would be possible to renounce radical vulvectomy and/or groin dissection. According to studies, although not randomised controlled, the following reductions in local and/ or regional treatment procedures are established. Local reduction: Radical local excision is possible in T1 tumors, that means lesions up to a maximum diameter of 2 cm, if localized laterally or posteriorly. In these cases the clitoris is not involved and can be preserved. The recurrence rate for this method is 5.3 percent versus 8.1 percent for radical vulvectomy. Regional reduction: In Tlb or T2 inguinal lymphadenectomy is sufficient: positive contralateral lymph nodes could be found in only 0.4 percent when ipsilateral lymph nodes were negative. However, if there are ipsilateral lymph node metastases, the lymph nodes of the other side must be removed, too, Local and regional reduction: Radical local excision and no inguinal lymphadenectomy is sufficient in Tla tumors. These superficially invasive carcinomas are defined as lesions with a maximum stromal invasion of 1 mm up to a diameter of 2 cm. The method of measuring tumor invasion is part of Tla classification: from the deepest point of tumor invasion to the basement of the most superficial dermal papilla. Lymph node metastases were never found in those superficially invasive carcinomas. Similar therapeutic reductions are also valid for two special tumor types: basal- cell carcinoma and verrucous carcinoma of the vulva. These tumors infiltrate only the surrounding local tissue without lymphatic spread. The mentioned conditions are only rarely fulfilled, so that the possible reductions could be realized accordingly seldom. According to recent studies, however, dealing with the sentinel node method in vulvar cancer it is to be hoped that in the near future at least inguinal lymphadenectomy can be dropt in patients with a negative inguinal sentinel node. 1216 VIN - CURRENT TREATMENT-STRATEGIES AND PREVENTION OF RECUR- frequency of vulvar intraepithelia[ neoplasia (VIN) is increasing among younger women. Treatment, especially in younger women, should be done very carefully; the anatomy of the vulva should not be mutilated so that the vulva can maintain its function. Today conventional local excision by cold knife or CO2-1aser therapy is the treatment of choice. Independent of the method of treatment applied, recurrence of disease has been found in 10-50% of patients. At the dysplasia clinic of the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital, D0s- seldorf we evaluated possible risk factors for recurrence of VlN: menopausal status, smoking, method of treatment, HPV-status, grade and focality. We treated 102 patients with VlN with a mean follow-up of 3,5 years. Recurrent VlN correlated with the grade (P<.OOl) and focality (P<.05) of the disease. V[N recurrence developed in 36.6% of patients. Therefore we discuss, that eventually adjuvant treatment strategies might help reduce the recurrence of VlN. In the future we try to examine the effectiveness of Imiquimod, an immune response modifier, administered in the third week after the surgical treatment, lmiquimod has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of external genitoanal warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Patients should be treated with self application of one sachet (Imiquimod 5% cream) twice per week, for a maximum of four, six or eight weeks. 1217 SURGICAL OPTIONS IN ADENOID CYSTIC CARCINOMA OF THE MAJOR Eckel, Univ.-HNO-Klinik KTIn (K6In) Adenoid cystic carcinoma are a distinct tumor entity arising from major and minor salivary glands. Occasionally, they can be found in lacrimal glands, breast, Bartholin's glands, ceruminous glands, and prostate. Clinically, they are characterized by slow growth, long standing symptoms before the final diagnosis is settled, and high local recurrence and pulmonary metastases rates following initial therapy. Primary surgery is treatment of choice whenever feasible. Moderate local and regional surgery that avoids marked mutilation and physiologic compromise is indicated whenever feasible. Liberal resection of facial, hypoglossal or lingual nerves and mandible solely because they are ,,in the field\" no longer dominates surgical philosophy. When irradiation is employed for advanced, inoperable adenoid- cystic carcinoma, it offers useful palliation but is rarely, if ever, curative. Postope- rative irradiation, however, seems to improve local control and survival in patients with operable adenoid-cystic carcinoma following initial surgery. No established standard chemotherapy is available to date because of a lack of formal trials with adequate number of patients. Cisplatin/Carboplatin based trials have shown highest response rates in published series, and there may be an emerging role for taxanes (Paclitaxel/Docetaxel) in future trials. Neither hormonal nor biologic therapies have been adequately studied. Cumulative 1O-year survival rates reaching 75%, 43%, and 15% for stage I, stage II, and stage III to IV disease have been reported in the literature with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy, and cause-specific survival at 10 years was as high as 94% in patients with stage I disease. Only the clinical stage (not grade) seems to have a significant impact on survival. The prognosis in patients with early stage lesions may be better than has been appreciated The clinical course is frequently characterized by a high rate of pulmonary metastases with very slow clinical progression. Long-lasting disease free survival following surgical salvage for local treatment failures can be achieved, even in the presence of pulmonary metastases. Further clinical research work, including the implementation of novel cytotoxic agents, trials on concurrent chemo-radiation following surgery, induction chemo-radiation prior to surgery, or modified adjuvant therapy may be needed before more promising treatment results become reachable. 1218 ADENOID-CYSTIC CARCINOMA OF THE ORAL CAVITY A. Hemprich, Universit~.t Leipzig (Leipzig) Introduction: Although adenoid-cystic carcinoma accounts for only about 4 % of all malignancies in the maxillofacial region long term studies based on a relatively high number of cases are necessary to understand its hidden malignant character, the course of local recurrences and general metastases. Material and Method: The author overlooks 104 ACCs of the oral cavity from 1955 S 42 Invited Speakers until 1997 analysed under his supervision in 3 hospitals. A histological reclassification was undertaken according to Perzin et al. (1978) distinguishing solid, cribriform, and tubular subtypes of the ACC. An assessment of the influence of primary symptoms, the radicality of the primary operation and histological subtypes on survival rates, the number of recurrences and the appearance of metastases was undertaken. Results: The over all 5-year-survival-rate was about 75 to 80 % in all groups. The tumour free survival after 5 years was only 50 %, however. In the following years recurrences and metastases could subsequently be observed, even more then 15 years after the primary treatment (according to Kaplan-Meyer). A significantly better survival could be found in cases of R O resections during the primary operation (p = 0,002) and in the absence of neurologic symptoms or mucosal ulcers at the time of turnout diagnosis (p = 0,01). Although the best surgical results were achieved in the cribriform ACC and the worst overall results were observed in the solid ACCs, no statistic significance could be established as for the histological turnout subtype. Discussion: ACC of the oral cavity can best be treated with a radical primary operation using a safety margin of at least two centimetres. Radio- and chemotherapy do not seem to play a significant role for the improvement of long term results. Since local recurrences could be observed in 77 % of the patients within 15 years and metastases even 25 years after the onset of an ACC in the oral cavity a regular long term follow up far above the usual 5 year term is necessary. 1219 MUTATIONS OF THE INK4A-ARF LOCUS AS PROGNOSTIC gene locus, located on chromosome 9p21 codes for two different proteins, 161NK4a und p14ARF, representing the link between the Retinoblastoma- (Rb)- and the p53 gene mediated signaltransduction of cell cycle regulation. After microdissection of turnout tissue, we examined the status of p14ARF and p161NK4a in 49 squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Mutations were located by direct DNA-sequencing, the status of each promoter was tested by RE-PCR as well as MSP-PCR, deletionen were detected by LOH-analysis and Allelic Dosage Analysis. The expression of the gene products of p14ARF and p161NK4a was determined with Multiplex-RT-PCR as well as immunohistochemistry. Exon 4 to 9 of p53 were directly sequenced. A promoter methylation with consecutive loss of mRNA of p14ARF was deletion of both INK4a-ARF -exons. Mutations of p53 were found in 21/49 Carcinomas (43%). Only one of the squamous cell carcinomas exhibited simultaneous mutation of p53 and inactivation of p14ARE There was no significant correlation between INK4a-ARF alterations and prognosis. Our data demonstrate a high frequency of INK4a-ARF alterations in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, confirming their role in turnout development of this region. However, so far the methylation status and mutations of the INK4a- ARF locus do not present a prognostic impact. 1220 MUTATION RESPECTIVELY INACTIVATION OF THE TUMORSUPPRESSOR P53 IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER H. Bier, Universit&t D0sseldorf (D~sseldorf) Many attempts have been made to establish p53 as a marker for the development, progression, response to antineoplastic treatment, and prognosis of cancer. In general, these investigations have focused on mutations of the p53 gene. In squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN), numerous papers have reported a considerable range of mutation frequencies based on either partial sequence analysis (core domain) of genomic DNA or immunohistochemical detection of accumulated protein, and discussions on the predictive value of p53 mutations are dominated by contradictory results. Therefore, we determined the p53 status (immunohistochemistry and transcript analysis of the entire coding region) in an extensive in vitro model of SCCHN, including 30 established cell lines derived from 23 patients. In addition, we determined the sensitivity of all cell lines to cisplatin and irradiation. 27 of 30 cell lines (90%) have mutated p53 transcript. Four of these mutations (19%) are located outside exons 5-9, and protein detection tailed to recognize nine mutations (43%). Eventually, this experimental system revealed no correlations between chemo/radiosensitivity and p53 mutational status. The results suggest, however, that the frequency of p53 mutations in SCCHN may be underestimated due to limitations of commonly employed determination methods. Thus, we looked for p53 mutations in a series of 123 unselected patients with SCCHN. Full length transcript analysis identified 97 mutations (79%), including 68 missense and 6 nonsense point mutations, 20 deletions, and 3 insertions. Besides mutations, other mechanisms may cause p53 inactivation, e.g. complex formation with the HPV protein E6 entailing accelerated p53 degradation. Therefore, we additionally determined the HPV 16/18 status (PCR) disclosing 10 positive p53 wild type SCCHN. Since 107 of 123 tumors (87%) appear to harbor inactivated p53, this has to be considered a very typical event in SCCHN, which is unlikely to have predictive significance. 1221 TUMORIMMUNOLOGICAL PARAMETERS OF HEAD AND NECK CARCINOMAS T.E. Reichert, Universit~it Mainz (Mainz) Lymphocytes isolated from human solid tumors or peripheral circulation of patients with advanced cancer, including head and neck cancer (HNC), often are functionally deficient. Functional deficiencies range from the complete lack of responsiveness to T-cell mitogens to a partial inhibition of proliferative, cytotoxic, or cytokine- producing functions. Here we show that in comparison with normal T lymphocytes, those isolated from tumor-involved lymph nodes (LNL) or blood (PBL) of patients with HNC have a variety of defects in expression and function of signalling molecules, including significantly decreased expression of TcR-associated zeta (z) chains, decreased Ca2+ flux, as well as impaired kinase activity following triggering with anti-CD3 antibodies. Some of these alterations were demonstrable not only in isolated LNL or PBL but also in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in patients' biopsies. Immunohistology for expression of the CD3z and CD3e chains in TIL was performed in 138 paraffin-embedded primary oral squamous cell carcinoma tissues and 10 nontumor, inflammatory lesions. Semiquantitative analysis of the staining intensity for zeta chain expression and number of zeta chain expression-positive cells distinguished tumors with absent or low zeta expression (42 of 132) from those with normal z expression (90 of 132). zeta chain expression was inversely correlated with the tumor stage. Survival was significantly lower in patients whose TIL had absent or low z expression, controlling for stage (p=O.003) and lymph node status (p=O.O0O5). The prognostic value of zeta chain was restricted to patients with stage III or IV tumors. The data indicate that absent or decreased zeta expression in TIL combined with tumor stage or nodal status defines a group of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma who have an extremely poor prognosis. In attempting to explain the mechanisms responsible for these local and systemic immunological defects in patients with HNC, we have performed a series of functional studies. We could demonstrate that the Fas/FasL pathway is responsible, at least in part, for functional defects and apoptosis of lymphocytes at the tumor site and the peripheral circulation. It is apparent that biotherapies with vaccines, cytokines, dendritic cells or other modalities designed to augment antitumor immune responses will not be effective unless the cause of tumor-related immu- ne cell dysfunction and death is addressed. 1222 MOLECULAR GENETICS AND CANCER PREDISPOSITION I. Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ. Gene-environmenta] interaction play a major role in a number of cancers. Particu- larly in cigarette-smoke related malignancies heredi- tary variances of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes were subject of numerous molecular-epidemiological studies. First evidence was shown for the impact of the acetylation polymorphism as susceptibility factor for bladder cancer espe- cially in subjects with a history of smoking or occupational exposure. Meanwhile, there is more understanding of the relationship between both human arylamine N- acetyltransferases NAT1 and NAT2, which both exhibit diverse genetic polymorphisms. However, arylamines are also subjects of activation by myeloperoxidase, an enzyme predominantly expressed in neutrophilic granulocytes. High active variants are more prone to lung cancer, as was confirmed in four large independent studies. Therefore, the interplay between different toxifying or de- toxifying enzymes like glutathione S-transferases appears to be of major impor- tance regarding an individuals risk to suffer from lung cancer. Moreover, the role of genetically heterogenic transport enzymes like P-gp or MRPs may contribute to the extent of reactive intermediates and the formation of DNA adducts. Large investigations had been also performed on hereditary polymorphisms of DNA repair enzymes, but as well of of factors involved in signal transduction and cell growth regulation. To date, the knowledge on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is rapidly increasing. However, investigations of SNPs, interactions and division into sub- groups require large sample sizes. Such studies were initiated e.g. in the field of lung cancer in Germany, enabling the identification of defined at risk genetic patterns. This should help to understand the etiology of cancer development but also give a basis for prevention of the particular disease. Moreover, there is some evidence that in the near future, the defined pattern of genes involved in drug kinetics and response will allow an individualized chemotherapy to lower drug side effects and enhance the clinical outcome. 1223 EXPRESSION PROFILING: A TOOL FOR DIAGNOSIS? S. WSlfl, Klinik for Innere Medizin, FSU Jena (Jena) The effect of therapies of tumors, which despite comparable pathological phenotype can originate from different cellular or molecular causes, is often difficult to evaluate based on established diagnostic methods. To optimize the decision which therapy should be used for the individual patient, various new molecular and in particular genetic tests were established. The aim of all these methods is the assessment of the response of the individual patient to a specific therapy. In particular: (i) more precise identification of the molecular causes for the development and progression of the specific tumor; (ii) thus enable a better classification of the actual disease and (iii) allow the appropriate consideration of the genetic predisposition of each patient. Until now only a fairly limited number of parameters is analyzed. A new approach for optimized diagnosis is the analysis of gene expression profiles from disease (tumor) and healthy tissue. This method of S 43 Invited Speakers / Plenary Sessicn functional genome analysis allows the identification of a large number of molecular changes in a single analytical assay. Limiting the analysis to active genes it becomes possible to give a detailed description of fundamental pathologic changes with a comparable small number cf analytical parameters. Together with the detection of individual physiological differences, expression profiles can provide an important method for the development of a therapy focused on the individual patient (,,Individualcrientierte Therapie\"). possible to establish a well functionig cooperation between the single cancer registries to allow a nationwide compilation and interpretation of data on cancer morbitity in Germany. Plenary Session 1224 PHARMACOGENETICS AND CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY M. Schwab, Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch-Inst. f. Pharmakologie (Stuttgart) Cancer therapy is characterized by a significant intersubject variability in responses and tcxicitJes. Appropriate dosing is a major problem and particu-larly important in oncology because anticancer agents generally have a narrow margin of safety. Inherited differences in the metabolism and dis-position of drugs can have a pronounced influence, which have been shown for various anticancer agents such as thiopurines, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), irinotecan and oxazaphosphorines.Thiopunnes 6-MP) are among the most widely used antileukemic agents.Their metabolism can be severely affected by the genetic polymorphism of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT). Several case reports and clinical studies have shown that patients with very low TPMT activity (1:180 individuals) are at high risk of developing severe, potentially fatal hematctoxicity (e.g., pancytopenia) caused by the accumulation of cytotoxic metabolites after standard dosing. Recent data indicate that heterozygous patients (-10% of Caucasians) are also at greater risk of thicpurine toxicity. It has become possible to detect TPMT deficiency with up to 99 % concordance between geno- and phenotype by screening of the relevant clinical mutations. Genetic variations in the dihydropydmidine dehydrogenase (DPD) gene may have a role in pharma- variability of 5-FU and related toxicity since DPD catalyzes the detoxification cf 5-FU. As the molecular basis for DPD deficiency various mutant alleles have been proposed. Active investigations are in progress to determine DPD pheno-/genotype relationships and to determine optimal screening procedures to prevent 5-FU-induced toxicity. The UGT1A1 enzyme is responsible for the detoxification of the active metabolite (SN-38) of irinotecan which is used in primary and second line treatment of co[orec-tal cancer. Its clinical use is characterized by significant diarrhea caused by SN-38. Pheno-/genotype correlation indicated a significant relationship between in vitro SN-38 glucuronidatJon in human liver and UGTIA1 promotor UGT polymcrphisms may be predisposed irinotecan-induced diarrheal episodes due to decreased glucuronidation of SN-38. Whereas the current practice in clinical cncology is to dose patients based on body weight and surface area pharmacogenetically derived dosing may be offer a novel alternative to identify subpopulations of patients who may be deficient in certain key enzymes. 1225 WHAT IS THE ROLE OF HEALTH ECONOMICS IN ONCOLOGY? M. Hartmann, Apctheke des Klinikums der FSU (Jena) New strategies in cancer care have been evaluated on the basis of safety and clinical efficacy in the past. Now, current concerns over escalating German health care costs and limited resources have led to an increased interest in the economic evaluation of cancer care. The need for health economics analyses is based on the situation of limited financial resources and the costs of cancer care can no longer be ignored. As pressure on budgets will grow, increasing emphasis will be placed on identifying and improving value for money. Economic evaluation includes assessment cf both costs and benefits of cancer therapies and offers a range of techniques for the evaluation of healthcare activities. Each has its place, but it is important tc ensure that the appropriate method is being used and that the perspective of the economic evaluation is clear. Economic analyses will be increasingly connected with cancer clinical trials to asses the cost-effectiveness of cancer care and patient quality of life after treatment. The first logical step is to establish the clinical performance of the new therapy. After the clinical role has been established the economic performance can be assessed, sometimes using data from clinicar trials, sometimes using results of observational studies and data derived from large administrative data- bases in order to get the real world. The results of these economic evaluations will provide important data to assist Oncolcgists in selecting optimal treatment strategies for cancer patients and help to inform health policy decision-makers about the importance of specific cancer care. 1226 SRUCTURAL CONDITIONS OF EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CANCER REGISTRATION IN GERMANY W. U. Batzler, Arbeitsgemeinschaft BevSIkerungsbezogener Krebsreg (Stuttgart) Epidemiological cancer registration has a long tradition in Germany. In 1927 the first cancer registry ever was established in Hamburg. Further cancer registries were established in Germany in the former GDR, Saarland and M0nster (Northrhine- Westfalia). Due to the Federal law 'Bundeskrebsregistergesetz (KRG)' from 1995 the other states of Germany were obliged to establish epidemiological cancer registries on a legal basis till 1999. This has been done successfully. Although the KRG proposed a unique model of cancer registration it was possible for the single states in Germany to define their own registration modus, especially under aspects cf data protection and population coverage. The presentation dicusses the diffe- rent aspects of epidemiological cancer registration in Germany and how it is SP227 PERIOPERATIVE STAGING FOR DISTANT METASTASES IN PRIMARY OPERABLE BREAST CANCER PATIENTS IS MOSTLY NOT INDICATED B. Gerber, A. Seitz, A. Krause, H. M011er, Rostock (Rostock) Purpose: Is perioperative staging of breast carcinoma (BC) indicated in all BC patients or exist subgroups that could be excluded from these expensive exami- nations. Materials and methods: Between 1991 and 1998 totally 1076 asymptcmatic patients with an operable BC were treated at the Dept. Ob/Gyn at the University of Rostock. Pericperative staging of breast carcinoma (BC) patients includes chest radiography, bone scanning, and ultrasonographic examination of the liver. In cases of suspicious findings, an ongcing diagnostic (CT, MRT, PET) was initiated or examination was repeated immediately. The findings of staging were correlated with patients age, body mass index, tumor size, grading, nodal status; hormon receptor expression, HER2 and treatment. All diagnostic tests were analyzed with respect to a potential prognostic advantage and the costs involved. Results: Staging examinations revealed 30 (2.8%) distant metastases and 130 (12.0%) suspicious (=false-positive) findings, whereas metastases were excluded in 916 (85.2%) patients. Due to ongoing diagnostic tests or repeated examinations within the following 6 months, distant metastases were confirmed in additional 7 of the 130 patients. Thus, the number of patients with distant metastases amounted to totally 37 (3.4%). By multivariate analyses a correlation was found between confirmation of distant metastases and number of involved axillary lymph nodes (>3: p=0.002) and tumor size (> 50 ram: p=O,08). A limitation of staging tests to patients with > 3 involved lymph nodes and / or a tumor size of > 50 mm would include 36 of 37 patients with detectable distant metastases. Simultaneously, in 807 patients without these conditions the staging test could be avoided resulting in reduction of costs of more than * 105,000. Moreover, 130 women with suspicious tests had tc wait for a final confirmation or exclusion of metastases for 4 months on average. The costs for additional tests in the meantime amounted to 86,000. A systemic treatment was recommended in all 37 patients before and irrespective of the detection of distant metastases. How- ever, the 5-year overall survival was 41%. Conclusion: A very low frequency of distant metastases in asymptomatic breast cancer patients with up to 3 involved lymph nodes and / or tumors smaller than 5 cm does not warrant an expensive staging with a high rate of false-positive findings in these patients. SP228 DOSE-DENSE VS SEQUENTIAL COMBINATION AS PREOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY IN OPERABLE BREAST CANCER (T2-3, N0-2, M0) - INTERIM ANALYSIS OF THE GEPARDUO-STUDY A. du Bois, G. v Minckwitz, G. Raab, M. SchiJtte, J. Hilfrich, BIohmer, B. Gerber, S Costa, E. Merkle, H. Eidtmann, H. Lampe, C. Jackisch, A Tulusan, A. Caputo, M. Kaufmann, For the complete response (pCR) - rate of almost 10% (GEPARDO trial). The GEPARDUO trial compared this 8 weeks ADOC regimen with a more conventional 24 week schedule sequential regimen cf adriamycin in NSABP-B-27). Tamoxifen (20mg/ d for 5 years.) was given simultaneously. 1000 pts were planned for recruitment to allow demonstration of equivalent pCR-rates (difference less than 10% vs 15%, odds ratio <0.63). 77 centers enrolled 913 pts between 6/99 - 9/01, when the trial was closed prematurely (458 AC-DOC, 455 ADOC) due to a recommendation of an independ- ent Data Monitoring Committee. A second interim analysis had shown a differ- ence in pCR rates of 19.5% (99%Ch 10.1 - 28.9%) between both arms. An estimation including models for the remaining pts. could rule out that equivalence could be achieved by further recruitment. (probability < 0,1%) Data from the interim analysis including 395 pts are available (197 AC-DOC, 198 ADOC).. Median initial tumcur diameter by palpation was 4 cm and 60% of pts had no palpable axillary lymphnodes. AC-DOC was associated with a higher rate of grade Ill/IV nausea and vomiting (15.3% vs 6.3%), Different rates of neutropenia were observed (69.3% vs 39.8 %), but G-CSF was given prophylactically only with ADOC. Infections were seen infrequently in both arms (1.1% vs 3.1%). Therapy was discontinued early in 14.6% (21.3% AC-DOC, 8.4% ADOC). Efficacy criteria are still blinded. The pCR rate in the whole population was 14.8%. Breast conser- vation was possible in 75.8% of pts. with a difference of 7.9% between both arms. The data will be unblinded with respect to treatment arm after completion cf treatment in all pts (Spring 2002). S 44 Plenary Session SP229 THE TRANSFECTION OF THE KERATIN 18 GENE INTO HUMAN BREAST CANCER CELLS INDUCES REDIFFERENTIATION AND A DRAMATIC DROP IN MALIGNANCY. H. BL~hler, B. Duvnjak, S. Tamm, I. Universit~t Bochum (Berlin, Bochum) In vitro experiments as well as clinical studies revealed that the expression of keratin 18 (K18) in breast cancer tumors is associated with a favorable prognosis and a less aggressive phenotype of the carcinoma. To prove the principle we transfected the human K18 gene into the aggressive MDA-231 cell line and isolated a permanently overexpressing clone. These cells grow in dense monolayers with epithelial morphology whereas wild type and mock transfected control are of the dedifferentiated, malignant type with cells appearing spindle shaped, motile, and only loosely attached. The K18-transfected clone is characterized by a high expression of the adhesion proteins plakoglobin, desmoplakin, desmoglein, and E-cadherin in contrast to wild type and control which are virtually devoid. In addition, keratin 8 the indispensable dimerisation partner of K18 in keratin filament formation is upregulated too. Conversely the mesenchymal filament protein vimentin, forming the intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton in MDA-231 wild type and control, is completely down regulated in the K18 clone. The high invasiveness of the wild type in the Boyden chamber is dramatically reduced for the K18-clone. In the nude mouse no metastasis could be observed for the K18- cells whereas wt and control metastasized into lung, liver, and bone marrow. In epithelial cells the intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton are formed by keratins and K18 is a marker of well differentiated mammary lumenal cells. The loss of K18 and its replacement by vimentin is part of a general loss of differentiation along with the malignant transformation. An additional aspect of this process is the loss of adhesion proteins. This dedifferentiation seems to be reversible, at least in part, by the re-expression of K18. To reconfirm this hypothesis by approaching from ,,the opposite\" we established an epithelial subclone of the MDA-231 cells without gene transfer by selecting adhesive cells in weekly trypsinations over a period of 9 month. This clone is not only characterized by the expression of plakoglobin, desmoplakin, desmoglein, and E-cadherin but also by high levels of keratins 8 and 18! In addition the same impressive drop in invasiveness and metastasis as for the K18-transfected cells could ETOPOSIDE AND CARBOPLATIN, ETOPOSIDE SCLC A Ill-TRIAL M. Reck, J. Pawel, H. Macha, E. Phase II studies Paclitaxe], Etoposide and Carboplatin has shown great activity combined with low toxicity in first-line treatment of SCLC. We now established a phase III trial to compare the value of this new combination with the standard regimen Carboplatin, Etoposide and Vincristin. Methods: From 1/1998 to 606 chemoneive patients with an SCLC (LD or ED). 599 were evaluable for toxicity and 547 for response. Patients were randomized to receive Paclitaxel 175 IV 1-3 IV day 4 (TEC) or Carboplatin AUC 5 IV day 1, Etoposide 110/140 mg/m2 IV (ED/LD) day 1-3 and Vincristin 2 mg IV day 1 and 8 (CEV). Treatment courses were repeated every 21 days up to 6 cycles. Results: We observed an response rate of 84.3% (CR 21%) (TEC) versus 81.3% (CR 23.5%) (CEV). The median survival time was 12.6 versus 11.6 months (TEC v CEV) with a 1- and 2-year survival rate of 52% /21% versus 48% / 16% (TEC v CEV). p = 0.025. Hematologic toxicity was with 3/4 Thrombocytopenia (TEC v CEV). In the CEV-group we saw significant more heavy anemia and thromocytopenia. Heavy non hematologic toxicity occurred rarely. Conclusion: TEC is an safe and highly active regimen in treatment of SCLC. The survival time was significant longer in comparison with CEV.

Manegold, active, selective EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown efficacy in Phase I trials in advanced NSCLC (Kris, 2000). The primary objectives of this study were to investigate the response rate (RR) and the safety profiles of two doses of Iressa Jn patients (pts) heavily pretreated for NSCLC including platinum-based chemotherapy. Secondary objectives were disease-related symptom improvement using the FACT-L lung cancer subscale and disease control(RR + stable disease). 210 pts (M/F, 148/62; aged 28-85 years; performance status (PS) 0/1/2:38/145/27 pts) were randomized to Iressa, 250 or 500 mg/day. Pts were not selected by tumor EGFR status. Tumors were assessed q4w after the start of treatment and q8w after 4 months of treatment. 208 pts were evaluable for RR with a minimum follow-up of 4 months. Overall RR was 18.7% (95% and median progression-free survival was 84 days with 34% of patients progression free after 4 months. There was no difference between 250 mg/day and 500 mg/day for any of these efficacy endpoints. Multivariate analysis suggested that demographic factors such as gender, PS and histology type were predictive for RR. Overall disease-related symptom improvement rate was 38.7% (95% CI: 30.5%-47.4%); the median time to improvement in symptom score was 8 days. Fewer pts on ZD1839 250 mg/day experienced grade 3/4 AEs (32.0%) than those on 500 rag/day (50.9%). 9.4% of patients on 500 mg/day withdrew due to drug-related AEs compared with only 1.9% of those on 250 mg/day. Grade 3/4 AEs included G3 diarrhea (250 mg, 1.0%; 500 mg, 8.5%) and G3/4 rash (250 rag, 1.0%; 500 mg, 6.6%). In summary, these results suggest that Iressa 250 rag/day provides equal efficacy and is better tolerated compared with 500 mg/day. Iressa has antitumor activity and provides clinically meaningful symptom relief as 2nd/3rd-line treatment in patients with NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based therapy. Iressa is well-tolerated when given once-daily. Iressa is a trademark of AstraZeneca plc. SP232 ADJUVANT RADIO-CHEMOTHERAPY FOR RECTAL CANCER STAGE UICC II AND IIh RESULTS OF A GERMAN PATTERNS-OF-CARE STUDY INCLUDING 534 PATIENTS FROM 6 INSTITUTIONS J. Wulf, K. Kr~mer, C. Van Aaken, F. Dietzel, UICC stage I] and III has been recommend by the NCI in 1991 and in Germany in 1994. Randomized studies had shown a significant decrease of local recurrences with a trend to significant survival benefit. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the treatment results in basic medical care. Materials and Methods: Results of adjuvant RChT from 6 radiotherapy institutions were evaluated for local control (LC), disease free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and treatment related toxicity. Of 534 patients treated from 1993-1998, 527 were evaluable (99%). Median age was 62 years Results: 5year actuarial local failure rate was 24.6% for all patients (16.1%- 36.7%) with no significant difference between UICC-stage II and III. T-and N-stage, grading, resection status and RChT (positive) or RT (negative) had significant influence on local control. Radiotherapy parameters were not significant, if a dose >45Gy was applicated. Distant metastases occurred actuarial after 5 yrs in 44% (37-66%). Actuarial was 53% (42-59%). Actuarial 10% (small intestine), 1.5% (rectum) and 0.4% (urinary bladder). Serious late toxicity for small bowel/rectum was 4% (grade 3) and 0.4% for each of grade 4 and 5. At the urinary bladder only grade 3 late toxicity was documented (1.2%). Retrospective evaluation of quality of life according to the patients physician was good (65%), fair (27%) and bad (8.3%). Conclusion: While the rate of LC is inferior to randomized studies, OS is not decreased. Patient selection by the surgeon with unfavorable criteria for adjuvant therapy might have influenced the results. Under the estimation, that adjuvant RChT increases local control to a significant amount, it must be considered, that the surgical results of published studies are not reproduced in an area of basic medical care. Therefore questioning the consensus for adjuvant treatment should only be considered in an individual institution, if the surgical data on local control are available. SP233 RESULTS AFTER MULTIMODALITY TREATMENT IN RECURRENT PELVIC COLORECTAL CANCER COMBINING EXTENDED SURGERY AND FRACTIONATED INTERSTITIAL (Kiel) Introduction: Approximately one third of the patients who have received curative resection for colorectal cancer develop local recurrence which is limited to the pelvic region in up to 50%. Extended surgery often fails to achieve a R0-situation and incomplete resection does prolong survival for about 3 months only. Therefore we developed a treatment concept which combines surgical resection and post- operative fractionated inserted BT-tubes. Patients and methods: Between 1992 and 2001 we have treated 45 patients (pts) with recurrent co]orectal cancer (17 female, 28 male) according to this concept. Patients age ranged from 38 to 80 years, median 59. The mean interval from primary resection to treated recurrence was 29 months (5-75). Extended en bloc resection was carried out in all cases and multivisceral resection was necessary in 62% (28 pts). Microscopically tumor free margins were stated in only 40%. After resection plastic tubes were positioned directly on the tumor bed or mJnimal residual tumor marked with titanium clips. IMBT was performed after 3D-CT reconstruction of the target volume within 2 weeks postoperatively with an average S 45 Plenary Session / Breast Cancer (Surgery and Radiotherapy) dose of 28.3 Gy. The HDR-protocol (25 pts.) comprised 2x2,5Gy daily dose with an interval of 6 hours, the PDR-protocol (20 pts) daily 5xlGy with intervals of 2 hours. In 23 pts IMBT was combined with EBRT (45Gy), 18 of them had not undergone EBRT previously. Results: The mean patient survival of 23.5 months (3 to 96) resulting in an overall 5-year-survival of 23% was not significantly influenced by the resectional-status (RO-R2) or the interval to recurrence treatment. The PDR-group survival of 35% after 5 years differed significantly from the HDR-group with 13% (p=0,013). Over- all 5-year-survival improved to 36% if EBRT could be added to FMBT in primarily non irradiated patients, whereas no patient without additional EBRT due to initial irradiation therapy survived longer than 31 months (n=17). Conclusion: Multimodality treatment of recurrent colorectal cancer combining extended and postoperative interstitial IMBT applied by intraoperatively inserted BT-tubes offers an improved local tumor control and survival whenever residual tumor is proven or has to be suspected. In this setting PDR is significantly superior to HDR. SP234 PROSTATE CANCER - IN C.S. Stegmaier, MFAGS, RKI (SaarbrQcken, Berlin) Background: Prostate Cancer has been in 1998 for the first time the leading site in male cancer incidence in Germany. With 11 417 (10,5% of all cancer) deaths, prostate cancer is second following lung cancer as the underlying cause of cancer deaths in men. Until now only 10 to 15% of all prostate cancers are still in a localized stage at the date of diagnosis. As a result of a consensus conference of experts in June 2001 a formal demand to implement PSA testing in Germany as Prostate Cancer Screening for men in the age of 50 - 75 years was launched. Data Base and methods: Longtime trends for Incidence in Germany are prepared by the Saarland Cancer Registry only. Trends in mortality are available from the nationwide officical mortality statistics. Incidence estimates for the whole of Germany are based on the Saarland incidence rates and the national mortality data by means of log linear models. The estimates are performed at regular intervals by the Federal Cancer Reporting Unit in the RKI Berlin. Results: According to a recent estimate (June 2001) the number of new diagnoses of prostate cancers in 1998 amounted to 31 600 cases accounting for 18,7 % of all new cancers in men. The median age at diagnosis was 72,3 years and approximately 90 % of all new patients had already completed 60 and more years of life. In the Saarland State age standardized incidence rates were rising sharply from the beginning of the seventies, then followed by a more than ten years period of constant rates. At the beginning of the nineties again a steep increase and now, since 1996/97, seem to have reached a plateau. Mortality figures in Germany have been fairly constant over the whole period since 1970 with only marginally rising rates. In Europe Germany holds an intermediate position. Highest rates are found in Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands, lower rates in the south-european states Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy. The international Comparability is influenced by highly differing diagnostic technics. Discussion: The recently increasing numbers of incident cases are mainly due to a progressive aging process in the german population This process will be still enhancend in the future. Thus the impact of prostate cancer on public health ressources will increase considerably. Breast Cancer (Surgery and Radiotherapy) Oral Presentation 0235 192-1R PULSED-DOSE-RATE BOOST IRRADIATION OF BREAST CANCER: PERIOPERATIVE MORBIDITY, ACUTE TOXICITY AND COSMESIS O. Ott, M. Letter, R. Sauer, Universittit Erlangen-N~Jrnberg (Erlangen) Purpose: To evaluate perioperative morbidity, acute outcome in patients with interstitial 192-1R pulsed-dose-rate (PDR) brachytherapy boost irradiation after breast-conserving surgery and external beam radiation of the whole breast because of breast cancer. Patients and Methods: From 1998 to 2001, 40 patients were selected for this study with a median follow-up period of 12 months (range: 2-32 months). External radiation therapy was administered postoperatively to the breast in all patients. Mean given dose was 50,4 Gy the mean dose with the PDR brachytherapy boost in absence or presence of residual disease. Patients have been examined for perioperative morbidity, acute toxicity and cosmesis. Results: Perioperative complications (i.e.: bleeding, infectious wound complications, sepsis) were found in no patient (0 %). 25,6 % (10/39) of the women developed a grade I, 5,1% (2/39) a grade II radiodermatitis. In no case the inflammatory response of the skin was restricted to the boost area only. An excellent or good cosmetic result was obtained in 97 % of patients, cosmetic results in one patient were judged as fair. Conclusions: Interstitial 192-1R PDR-brachytherapy boost in breast cancer is applicable without a significant increase of perioperative complications, does not increase acute toxicity and probably does not generate worse cosmetic results. If the PDR-brachytherapy-mode is superior to the HDR-(High-Dose-Rate)- brachytherapy-mode in regard of the cosmetic results has to be proved with bigger numbers of patients recruited in randomized trials. 0236 BILATERAL BREAST CANCER AND LOCAL RELAPSE: A HOSPITAL-BASED STUDY OF THE PREVALENCE OF BRCA 1 AND BRCA 2 GENE MUTATIONS M. Bremer, K. D6rk, J.H. of the BRCA 1/BRCA 2 genes strongly predispose towards the development of contra[ateral breast cancer. We therefore investigated a hospital- based series of patients with bilateral breast cancer and a comparison group of patients with unilateral breast cancer, pairwise matched by age and family history, for mutations of the BRCA 1/BRCA 2 genes. Material and methods: Between 1995 and 2000 genomic DNA from blood samples of 75 patients with bilateral breast cancer, who received postoperative radiotherapy, was analysed for mutations of all coding regions and flanking intron sequences of the BRCA 1/BRCA 2 pelymorphism analysis (SSCP) and sequencing of aberrant findings. The results were compared to 75 unilateral breast cancer patients who were screened for common mutations in the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes. Treatment results of patients with bilateral disease were analysed with regard to a possible carriership of a BRCA 1/BRCA 2 gene mutation. 8138del5 und 4772delA) were identified in 6 patients with bilateral breast cancer. After a median follow up of 76 months (first cancer) and 38 months (second cancer) 3 of 6 (50%) identified carriers developed local relapse, whereas this was the case in 10 of 69 (14.5%) non-carriers. This difference was even more pronounced when regarding local relapse following adjuvant radiotherapy: in carriers 3 of 12 (25%) irradiated breast/chest walls relapsed locally compared to 5 of 114 (4.5%) in non-carriers. In the comparison group of patients with unilateral breast cancer 3 pathogenic BRCA 1 mutations were identified. Conclusions: We did not find a significantly increased prevalence of BRCA 1/BRCA 2 mutations in a hospital-based cohort of German patients with bilateral breast cancer. Local relapse seems to be more common in mutation carriers after adjuvant radiotherapy putting into question the optimal treatment strategy for this subgroup of breast cancer patients. 0237 THE QUALITY OF BREAST CANCER INFORMATION WEB SITES IN GERMAN AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE S. Jonassen, M. Neumann, The Intemet is a powerful tool to provide information about health topics. The purpose of this study is to evaluate breast cancer Internet sites by using published criteria about website structure. Another intention is to examine the content of disease related information, especially the treatment. Additionally, it is the goal to check, if Breast Cancer Patients in Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg use the Internet to seek information about their disease. Methods: Two searches are undertaken with the keywords ,,Brustkrebs/ Mammakarzinom\" and ,,breast cancer\" with the Copernic meta-search program (software tool, that collects hits from the 19 most important Internet search engines), with a result of 10.616 URL addresses. These addresses are visited one after the other and evaluated using a questionnaire (100 items relating to form and content, particularly clinical aspects). Results: Of 3.812 addresses in German language only 65 (1.7%) and of 6.804 English language search results 131 (1.9%) contain detailed information on Breast Cancer treatment. Information on special parts of the disease (e.g. mammography screening) is given in 8.6% (German sites) and in 13.7% (English & American sites). Owner of the relevant websites are institutions or organizations in 45%, industry in 41% and private in 14%. Conclusions: Just a few breast cancer web sites contain exact information about treatment options. These sites are hard to find in this mass of available search results. In this information age University web sites should not be under-represented any more. Patients want trustworthy sources. Physicians should know about good sites to recommend them to their patients. 0238 A COMPARISON OF MORBIDITY BETWEEN THE SENTINEL NODE BIOPSY AND THE STANDARD AXlLLA DISSECTION IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS Ostertag, S. Woelcke, D. Bauerschlag, Universit~tsfrauenklinik Kiel (Kiel) Question: Breast cancer patients who undergo a standard axillary dissection (SAD) have postoperative complications in the arm. The sentinel biopsy has to prove the same oncological accuracy and a significant reduction in postoperative morbidity to become a routine procedure in breast cancer treatment. In this study we want to show the reduction of morbidity by SLN biopsy using a valid examination system according to Kuehn et al.. Methods: Investigations focused on the subjective and objective morbidity in patients included in the KiSS study. The standardised examinations took place preoperatively, on the 1st, 7th and 30th postoperative day and after a 3 month period. According to a morbidity score the subjective life quality, the arm exercise, the strength, the swelling and the tingling of the upper arm, in comparison to the other arm, were investigated. Results: Of the 42 patients already randomised 37 underwent a SAD. 25 patients were treated by SLN biopsy alone after no metastases or tumor cells found in the sentinel node. In 3 patients a secondary axilla dissection was carried out as serial section and immunhistochemical staining revealed a tumor cell complex in the sentinel lymph nodes. The SAD following the SLN biopsy was performed 30 days S 46 Breast Cancer (Surgery and Radiotherapy) after the primary operation so data from the first 30 days are available. In both groups the preoperative average score was 98.6 points with a difference of 0.06 points. On the first postoperative day the SLN group scored 21.6 points more in the SAD group. This benefit increased to 26.3 points on the 30th post-op day. The assessment of data form the 3, 6 and 9 month postoperative time are not reliable because of the small number of cases. Howerver data show that there are improvements in both groups. Discussion: The renunciation of standard axilla dissection in breast cancer patients with a negative sentinel node reduces the postoperative morbidity dramatically. Our data show a benefit for the patients in the SLN group. The follow up period must be extended to more than one year to be able to reach a final conclusion 0239 INFLUENCE FACTORS FOR THE DETECTION RATE OF THE SENTINEL LYMPH NODE IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS H. Ostertag, A. Hohn, lymph node dissection is the most significant prognostic indicator in invasive breast cancer. 60% of the patients are node negative but undergo an axillary dissection with its known morbidity. With the SLN technique it is possible predict the axillary lymph node status without complete dissection. But not in every patient a SLN detection is possible. This study evaluates the SLN detection rate and its influence factors. In 205 Patients 99m Tc-Nanocol and patent blue were injected peritumoral and subareolary 0,5 to 21 h preoperatively. The sentinel lymph node was detected with a hand gamma probe and given to frozen section. In 192 patients a complete axillary dissection was performed afterwards. All lymph nodes were evaluated by serial section and IHC staining. 60% of the patients were node negative. The sentinel node (SN) could be detected in 89%. In 22% only the SN was found to be infiltrated. The detection rate decreases in older patients. The BMI, tumor size and grading showed no influence of the detection rate. Skip metastases was found in only 2 cases. By the combination of 99m Tc-Nanocol and patent blue the sentinel node could be detected in 89%. In 99% the SN predicts the axillary node status correctly. The renunciation of the complete axillary lymph node dissection is supposed to reduce the morbidity, maintaining the axillary lymph node status as the most important prognostic factor in invasive breast cancer. Poster P240 INFLUENCE OF THE PREOPERATIVE MR-MAMMOGRAPHY ON THE SURGICAL THERAPY OF BREAST CANCER T. Liersch, A. Buttler, Uniklinik G~ttingen (G~ttingen) Introduction: In a prospective study the validity of magnetic resonance mammography (MRM) in the diagnosis of multifocal, multicentric and bilateral breast carinomas was evaluated and compared with the standard conventional methods: senography and mammography. Methods: In 140 patients who were expected of having breast cancer due to the findings of the conventional examination methods an additional MRM was performed. Every suspect lesion was resected completely and examined histopathologically. Results: 107 of 140 patients (76%) had malignant lesions. The sensitivity and specifity of mammography, eonography and MRM were: 58, 89 and 97% and 67, 85 and 30%. The surgical therapy was extended due to MRM-findings in 35 patients (25%). In 30 patients additional tumofoci were detected ipsilateral (16 multifocal lesions: quadrantectomy in 12, mastectomy in 4 cases; 14 multicentric lesions: mastectomy in all cases. 5 further malignant lesions were detected in the oontralateral breast only by MRM and treated by breastconserving procedures in 4 cases and by mastectomy in 1 case.The MRM showed false positive findings in 22 patients (10 ipsi- and 12 contralateral). Conclusions: As further malignant lesions could only be detected by MRM in 25% of all patients we consequently believe that MRM plays a very important role in the planning of operative procedures in breast cancer patients. P241 INTENSITY MODULATED RADIOTHERAPY BASED ON INVERSE TREATMENT PLANNING FOR ADJUVANT TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER C. Thilmann, A. Zabel, B. Rhein, (IMRT) provides better sparing of normal tissue. Current methods for IMRT in breast cancer use forward planning based on equivalent radiological path length to design intensity modulated tan- gential beams which is limited to tangential beam configuration. Compared to conventional tangential techniques dose reduction of organs at risk is limited. Recently, we developed a method for inverse optimisation of intensity modulation of multiple beams for adjuvant radiotherapy of breast cancer. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer. Patient and methods: Three cases were selected in which no satisfying dose distribution was obtained by conventional radiotherapy. For a patient with right sided breast cancer and funnel chest (patient A), a patient provided for irradiation of the left breast including parasternal lymph nodes (patient B) and a patient with bilateral breast cancer (patient C) IMRT was carried out in ,step-and-shoot'- technique. Treatment planning was based on inverse optimisation for 12 intensity modulated beams with 6 intensity steps. Additional treatment plans were calculated using conventional techniques. We analysed conformality and homogeneity of target volume and dose distribution within normal tissue and evaluated feasibility of treatment.Results: Dose conformality and dose homogeneity was substantially improved by IMRT in all cases compared to conventional treatment with tangential wedged 6MV photon beams combined with an additional electron portal. Volume of ipsilateral lung irradiated with a dose higher than 20 Gy was reduced from 40,1% to 22,1% with IMRT for patient A, from 19.1% to 16.3% for patient B. Lung volume>20 Gy was equivalent with both techniques for patient C. Heart volume irradiated with a dose higher than 20 Gy was reduced from 11.9% to 9.1% with IMRT for patient B and from 45.2% to 31.9% for patient C. No reduction of heart volume>20Gy was seen for patient A. Mean treatment time was 19.5 and 20.2 min in unilateral treatment and 32 min for patient C. Treatment was tolerated well by all patients without relevant side effects. Conclusions: Inversely planned multibeam IMRT is feasible in adjuvant radiotherapy of breast cancer. In the presented situations it was superior to conventional techniques. It is particularly suitable in therapeutic situations in which no satisfying dose distribution can be applied with conventional methods. P242 SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY (SLNE) IN UNSELECTED PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER (BC) N. Fersis, S. Schulz, and evidence that lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification and lymphadenectomy can predict correctly the nodal status of the axilla. In a prospective study the accuracy and prognostic value of the method were evaluated. Methods: ]n a series of 160 patients with BC underwent a lymphatic mapping using preoperative 99mTc-Nanocoll and intraoperative Patent blue V. The SLN was identified and removed, followed by a complete axillary node dissection. All SLNs were independently from the axillary specimen examined with H&E and by cytokeratin immunohistochemical. Results: The SLN was successfully identified in 133 (83.1%) of the patients. The prediction of the axillary pathology status based on the SLN status in our series had an overal accuracy of 82% (109/133) a sensitivity of 91%. The false negative rate was 7.6%. Conclusion: This study confirms that lymphatic mapping is possible in unselected patients with BC and that the histological characteristics of the SLN probably reflect the histological characteristics of the rest of the axillary lymph nodes. P243 SURGICAL MANAGEMENT AFTER PREOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY IN PA- TIENTS WITH PRIMARY OPERABLE BREAST CANCER. FIRST RESULTS OF THE GEPARDUO-TRIAL S. Petrich, G.v.M. Introduction: Preoperative chemotherapy has become a promising therapy option for patients with breast cancer and has been object of a number of studies. Yet data about the surgical aspects is missing. We wanted to get an overview about the surgical practice in Germany. Methods: In this retrospective analysis we evaluated surgical and histopathologi- cal reports of 95 patients from 22 German hospitals with primary operable breast cancer who participated in the preoperative Geparduo-Trial. As chemotherapeutic agents Adriamycin, Cyclophosphamid and Docetaxe] a sequential design or Adriamycin and simultaneously. segmentectomy, a quadrantectomy. Mastectomy was performed in 15 patients (=16%) and otherwise specified operations in three patients. Reconstructive surgical proce- dures were done in 32 % of the patients: When breast conserving therapy was combined with a reconstructive procedure intramammarian transposition flap was the method of choice (22% of all patients). If mastectomy was necessary latissimus dorsi flap or expansion prothesis were preferred as reconstructive procedure (n=7) if any. Second surgical procedures have been necessary in 16 patients resulting in secondary mastectomy in 43% of these patients. Median tumor size before chemotherapy measured by palpation was 3,9 cm (range 2 to 15 cm ) and was independent from the type of surgery which has been performed. However, median palpable tumor size before surgery was 1,7 cm for tumorectomy, 2,3 cm for for mas- Conclusion: After preoperative chemotherapy breast conserving surgery without oncoplastic reconstruction can be performed in the majority of the patients. The type of sugery is chosen mainly according to the tumor size after downstaging. This results in a low proportion of mastectomies in a selected population with large breast tumors. Further patients will be evaluated. S 47 Breast Cancer (Surgery and Radiotherapy) P244 THE INTERNET AS A SOURCE OF MEDICAL INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER G. Witucki, S. Jonassen, A. Tsekos, To evaluate the Intemet as a source of medical information for patients with breast cancer. The present survey examines the use and the influence of the tnternet and other mass media on tumor patients. Methods: From 07.02.2001 to 23.11.2001, 667 patients with breast cancer which were referred to the Dept. of Radiotherapy were analyzed using a 36-item questionnaire developed in Freiburg. Results: Mean age of all patients (n=667): 60 years (range: 26 - 91 years), male: 1,5%(n=10) vs. female: 98,5%(n=657). Level of education or the Internet (n=297): fear of high 26%(n=76), other reasons: 53%(n=159). Making use of other information sources than the doctor treating the patient (n=525): 58%(n=307). If the layman-system was used as an information source they used as an information source (n=248): of the medium Internet as a source of information for tumor patients with breast cancer in Freiburg is currently still low but likely to increase. The percentage of intemetuser in the ,,normal population\" over 50 years is only about 16%. Only 5% of our patients have visited the homepage of the department of radiotherapy at the University Clinic of Freiburg (http://www.ukl.uni- freiburg.de/rad/strahlen/homede.html or short cut: http://go.to/radiotherapy). The demographic structure and a further spread of Internet-access will lead to a gain of popularity of the Internet among breast cancer patients. P245 AGE INDEPENDENTLY PREDICTS THE RISK OF COMPLICATION IN BREAST CANCER SURGERY F.D. Vog[, UIm) Nearly 50% of patients diagnosed with breast cancer (BC) are 65 years and older and the rate of older BC patients is even growing due to demographic developments. Elderly women often have a higher degree of comorbidity than younger patients. This may have major impact on patients' ability to tolerate surgical treatment. We evaluated the importance of age and comorbidity as independent risk factors for complication in BC surgery. Methods: 801 consecutive female patients aged 40 years or older with BC undergoing surgical therapy between 1994 and 1999 were included. Lumpectomy was performed in 32.1%, lumpectomy with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or mastectomy with or without ALND in 67.9% of patients. Mean age at surgery was 61.8+11.1 years. Age groups were 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, 70 to 79 and 80+ years. Results: An intra- or postoperative complication occurred in 129 patients (16.1%). 78 patients (9.7%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). In univariate analysis, significant risk factors for complication were age (OR 1.45 per 10-year age group; 95%CI 1.23 - 1.70), type of surgical treatment (extended surgery vs. lumpectomy; OR 3.66; 2.15 - 6.24) and a previous cancer diagnosis (OR 1.94; 1.08 - 3.49). Comorbidity and current medication were not associated with the complication rate. Risk factors for admission to ICU were age (OR 1.63; 1.33 - 2.00), extent of surgery (OR 9.45; 3.41 - 26.18), number of prevalent diseases (OR 1.49 per one disease; 1.21 - 1.84) and concomitant drugs (OR 1.68 per drug; 1.38 - 2.06). Multivariable regression analysis identified age (OR 1.47; 1.22 - 1.76) and extent of surgery (OR 3.96; 2.11 - 7.44) as independent predictors for complications. Admission to ICU was independently predicted by age (OR 1.37; 1.07 - 1.76), concomitant drugs (OR 1.52; 1.20 - 1.92) and type of surgery (OR 7.95; 2.83 - 22.36). Conclusion: Age and surgical strategy, but not comorbidity, are the main factors for a-priori prediction of complication and admission to ICU in elderly BC patients. P246 SKIN SPARING MASTECTOMY AND IMMEDIATE AUTOLOGOUS RECON- STRUCTION: ONCOLOGICAL RISKS AND AESTHETIC RESULTS KiJchenmeister, T. Reimer, Rostock (Rostock) Objective: Is the oncoiogical safety of skin sparing mastectomy (SSM) with immediate autologous reconstruction and improved aesthetic results comparable to postoperative findings in patients treated with modified radical mastectomy (MRM)? Material and method: Sixty patients (pts.) with T1-2 breast carcinomas and contraindications for breast conserving therapy were treated by SSM and were compared to 81 pts. of the same age groups and MRM with regard to oncological and aesthetic data. In 33 (55 %) pts. the nipple areola complex (NAC) could be spared. For autologous tissue TRAM- and Latissimus dorsi-flaps were used. The mean follow-up was 40 (range 20 - 71) months. Results: The observed local recurrence rates were not significantly different (p = 0.443) after SSM (n=3; 5.0 %) or MRM (n=5; 6.2 %). Distant metastases and death were seen in 26,7 % and 15.0 % (SSM), respectively, and in 25.9 % and 13.5 % (MRM), respectively. Body mass index, operation time and postoperative hemoglobin concentration differed be- tween both groups significantly (p < 0.001) but not the rate of complications (p = 0.232). Aesthetic results of SSM were judged as excellent or good in 90.0 % of patients and in 83.4 % of surgeons. Nine pts. (11.1%) after MRM underwent a secondary breast reconstruction. Furthermore, 12 (14.8 %) pts. with MRM would prefer a SSM with immediate reconstruction in a similar situation. Conclusion: Skin-sparing mastectomy improves aesthetic result greatly without increasing of local or distant recurrence rates. Skin-sparing mastectomy should be offered to selected patients with breast cancer as an alternative to modified radical mastectomy. P247 TUMOR SIZE IS NOT THE ONLY REASON FOR MASTECTOMY IN ELDERLY BREAST CANCER PATIENTS 1-. Volm, To compare the distribution of results from tumor staging in different age groups and to investigate the role of age on the decision of mastectomy Jn patients with invasive breast cancer at different stages. Patients and Methods: 640 consecutive patients with primary invasive breast cancer were diagnosed between March 1994 and June 1999 at the Dept. Ob/Gyn UIm. Mean age at time of diagnosis was 62 4- 11 years. In 508 patients (79.4%) primary surgical treatment consisted of lumpectomy with axiliary clearing. 132 patients (20.6%) had mastectomy. Information on grading and TNM staging was obtained from the pathology report. In univariate analysis the chi-squared test and Pearson's correlation were applied. Two factor analysis of variance was used to test for an association of the surgical treatment with patients' age and tumor size. Results: Age was highly correlated with T-stage (r=0.19, P<0.001). Lymph node involvement and metastasized stage were not associated with age. Gradings were equally distributed in all age groups. The frequency of mastectomy increased with T-stage (P<0.001). However, also age showed a significant effect on the probability of mastectomy, even after adjusting for tumor stage. In stratified analysis, an increased frequency of mastectomy was observed in higher age groups, independently of tumor stage. This association was strongest in patients with T1 and T2 tumors. Discussion: Although increasing age is associated with larger tumors, tumor size is not the only reason for the higher frequency of mastectomy in older breast cancer patients. There must exist additional non-medical factors influencing the decision on mastectomy in the elderly. P249 SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSIES IN BREAST CANCER A. Hess, M.O. FI~iB, C. Nestle-Kr~mling, is not only important as a prognostic factor, but also influences therapy. However, axillary lymphadenectomy is often accompanied by high morbidity. The sentinel lymph node biopsy should reduce the morbidity, but give the same prognostic and safety value. In 97,5% cases metastasis occurs in lymph nodes of level I first, and only less than 3% directly in lymph nodes of level I1. The first draining lymph node can be identified either by radioactive material or colouring technique. Method: Patients with primary breast cancer (41 cases, age 30-80) received peritumoral 1-3 ml nanocolloid containing 99m-technitium one day before surgery, with scintigraphy performed 30-120 minutes later. Alternatively 2 ml Patentblue (2,5% Byk Gulden) was applied during the surgery 15 minutes before the axillary lymphadenectomy. The marked lymph node was separated and sent to the Institute of Pathology with the other lymph nodes. Results: 17 patients received 99m-technetium-nanocolloid, 21 patients Patentblue. 3 patients were treated with both identification methods. Out of 41 patients, 14 had axJllary metastasis at the moment of surgery. Comparison of radioactive labelling showed no false-negative results, but 7,3% false-negativity was obtained with the colour method. Publication only P'250 DETECTION OF MICROMETASTASES BY SENTINEL NODE BIOPSY IN DClS D. biopsy is a widely used technique to predict the axillary lymph node status in invasive breast cancer. Recent studies have shown that even in patients with DCIS lesionsdetection of lymph node matastases by SLN is possible. S 48 Breast Cancer (SurQery and Radiotherapy I / Breast Cancer (Systemic and Supportive Therapy) Is the SLN-biepsy an useful technique for DCIS patients? Methods: We report on two cases with the diagnosis of DCIS in the preoperative needle biopsy, one pre- and one postmenopausal woman, who where found to have micrometastases in the axillary lymph node, detected by SLN. Results: One 43-year-old patient with the preoperative diagnosis of high grade DCIS was treated by SLN biopsy and lumpectomie. In the last serial lymph node section stained by IHC a small tumor cell complex was found. The breast specimen showed no invasive carcinoma. The second, 62-year-old patient also had the preoperative diagnosis of an intermediate DC]S lesion. The immunhistochemical analysis of the SLN showed lymph node metastases. The examination of the lumpectomie specimen revealed a focus of invasion. Discussion: We report on 2 cases of diagnostic conversion of DCIS to invasive carcinoma by detection of micrometastases in lymph nodes sampled by the SLN technique. Over the last ten years the diagnosis of DCIS has increased 10-fold. DCIS currently represents approximately 20% of all breast cancers (Bijker et al. 2001). The most important prognostic factor is the width of the excision margin (Cote et al. 2000). Even though there is a risk of 1-4 % of axillary lymph node metastases, axillary dissection - which is the most significant prognostic indicator in invasive cancer - is not considered necessary in the treatment of DCIS. Recent studies with SLN and IHC found axillary micrometastases in 6 to 12% (Klauber-DeMore et al. (2000), Pendas et al. (2000) and Dupont et al. (2000). The importance of micrometastases in DCIS is open to controversial discussion, while in invasive cancer the detection is associated with poor DFS and OAS. We would like to initiate a prospective study to investigate the clinical importance of SLN biopsy in DCIS patients. P'251 A DIFFERENTIATED INDICATION FOR MICROSURGICAL BREAST RECONSTRUCTION J.C. Bruck, T. Wermter, Martin-Luther-Krankenhaus (Berlin) The goal of reconstructive breast surgery after amputation or resection of large volumes of the gland is a surgical result that resembles the breast in as many aspects as possible.The usual criteria are plasticity, temperature and sensitivity in symmetry to the contralateral side.Technical considerations are the simplicity, availability and safety of the surgical procedure with minimal donor-site morbidity in close relation to the desired result.The classic procedure of immediate reconstruction with a tissue-expander and a silicone implant yields a result which is usually firm, cold and has little sensitivity and is a two stage procedure. Studies show that the amount of corrective procedures add after two years up to an operating-time equivalent to a complex microsurgical reconstruction with autologuous tissue.Reconstruction with regional flaps from the back (M.lat.dorsi)or the abdomen (TRAM)have to incorporate large muscles in the flap,rarely transport enough tissue to match the contralateral side and in case of the TRAM-flap compromise the static and dynamic stability of the abdominal wall. Microsurgical reconstruction by means of perforator-flaps from the abdomen or the buttock do not interfere with muscle-function and meet all the desired criteria for breast reconstructionbut demand high technical skills and logistic expense.Since 1999 perforator-flaps from the abdomen(DIEP)or the buttock(SGAP)are the prefered means of breast reconstruction at unit.The micresurgical anastomosis to the A.and V, mammaria int.is a reliable source of revascularisation,ample volume offers a wide range for shaping the brest in symmetry to the other side and to meet the subjective criteria to the patient mentioned above. Out of 54 procedures three were lost to technical problems.The complexity of surgery however does make this procedure not suitable as the standard of reconstructice breast surgery. The alternatives have to be offered and discussed with every patient to meet a balance of effort and result.An algorythm for decision-making in view of the whole range of reconstructive options will be presented together an appeal to leave all options for reconstruction for those who can offer them and specifically not to ligate the A.and V. epigastr, inf. at the time of amputation to block the way to microsurgical reconstruction. P'252 MRI-GUIDED ULTRASOUND SURGERY OF BREAST CANCER J. R. Rastert, H.P. Purpose: Breast-conserving therapy (BCT) in patients with invasive breast cancer generally includes open surgical excision combined with adjuvant radiotherapy. Although BCT is not a major procedure, it is invasive and cosmetically undesirable in some patients. The purpose of this study was to assess a new noninvasive approach, the feasibility of focused ultrasound treatment of human breast cancer under thermo-imaging with MRI. Methods: Ultrasound can be focused through the intact skin and can result in the localized thermal therapy of tumor tissue (55-90\u00b0C) within a few seconds. We developed and constructed a ultrasound therapy unit inside a clinical 1.5 Tesla MR scanner and tested the unit first in healthy sheep breast in vivo. The method was then applied in a 56-year-old menopausal female patient with core-biopsy proven single non-metastatic invasive ductal breast cancer. In one session the tumor target was defined on MR planning images, therapy planning was performed using stereotactic coordinates, and the patient was treated with focused ultrasound. The temperature elevation was noninvasively measured by MRI showing a maximum of 70\u00b0C. The patient received no general or local anesthesia, and experienced no pain during the 1.5 h therapy. Standard BCT was performed 5 days after ultrasound therapy. Results: Immediately after ultrasound therapy centrast-MRI showed a hypointense, sharply demarcated area with a hyperintense boundary zone suggesting a complete interruption of blood perfusion in the treated area. In this area the tumor histology revealed necrotic cells and mostly sublethal damage. The immunohistological stains on the cut core biopsy taken before ultrasound revealed strong staining for ER and PR (in 100% of the tumor cells) and p53 was detectable in 30% of the tumor cells before ultrasound. In contrast, after ultrasound, ER and PR was consistently negative, and p53 was up-regulated with up to 90% of the tumor cells. Conclusion: The noninvasive thermal therapy of breast cancer using MRI- guided focused ultrasound is feasible and effective. Because its immediate effect can be realized without anesthesia and damage to the surrounding healthy tissue, this new image guided therapy approach may potentially improve the local therapy of breast cancer in selected cases. Breast Cancer (Systemic and Supportive Therapy) 0253 SEQUENTIAL DOSE-DENSE EPIRUBICIN (E), PACLITAXEL (T) AND CYCLO- PHOSPHAMIDE IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH 4-9 POSI- TIVE NODES; FINAL RESULTS OF A PHASE Untch, Sequential dose-dense chemotherapy is believed to be a superior treatment option in comparison to conventional combination chemotherapy. The effectiveness and toxicity of adjuvant therapy were evaluated in 102 breast cancer patients (pts) with 4-9 positive lymph nodes, who were recruited between 12/96 and 12/98. This regimen is called ,,ETC\". Three cycles of each drug were given at seven different dosing levels at 2-week intervals and supported by G-CSF (5 mcg/kg/day on days 3-10). The median age of the pts was 49 years (20-65 yrs) and the mean value of positive nodes was 6,1. 90% of pts received all nine cycles. No cardiac toxicity was reported. Haematological toxicity varied among the agents and dose levels used. The incidence was highest during treatment with cyclophosphamide and modest during treatment with paclitaxel. Over all dose levels grade Ill/IV neutrepenia occured in 22,6% of epirubicin cycles, only in 1,7% of paclitaxel cycles and in 51,8% of cyclophosphamide cycles. In contrast anemia grade Ill/IV was mild. Only 26,6% of the pts received RBC's during 5% of all cycles. Only one patient required platelet transfusions. 16 cases (16,7%) of febrile neutropenia were reported. Dose-limiting non-haematological toxicity (grade III neurotoxicity) observed with mg/m 2) in 7/27 evaluable pts (25,9%). Neurotoxicity was fully or partially reversible in all pts. With a median follow-up of 39 months, disease- free survival is 79,6% and overall survival is 90,4%. We conclude that ETC is a feasable and promising treatment option in high-risk breast cancer pts. A randomized study comparing this regimen against conventional dosed chemotherapy has begun. 0254 INFORMATION AND PSYCHOSOCIAL NEEDS OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS AND THEIR RELATIVES AS REFLECTED IN THE INQUIRIES TO THE CANCER INFORMATION SERVICE KID A.E. Gaisser, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (Heidelberg) Background: Breast cancer is the single most frequent cancer in women in Germany with 46000 to 50000 women being diagnosed each year, accounting for 13,5 % of the annual cancer incidence. The prevalence is estimated at over 200000. These figures are reflected in the inquiries reaching Cancer Information Service (KID). Over the past 15 years KID has answered more than 185000 inquiries individually. Almost 50 % concern female cancer patients, and 45 % of these relate to breast cancer. Objectives: In view of this it seemed of interest to specify breast cancer patients\" and their relatives\" needs of information and support and identify areas of unmet needs. Methods: A detailed retrospective analysis of a 4 year sample of breast cancer related inquiries was conducted with stratification according to relevant subgroups such as age and stage of disease. Results: 2515 breast cancer related inquiries were identified (22,6 % of total). Almost two thirds were from patients themselves, whereas in the overall KID clientele the patient-relative ratio is 50:50. 75 % of patients calling were under 60 years old while only 40 % of breast cancer patients in Germany are diagnosed before age 60. The full range of treatment options were the predominant subjects of inquiry (70 %). Over the course of the disease, new and experimental treatment options become of increasing interest. With patients, the wish to speak about the personal situation and/or coping and support increases over the course of the disease. Patients use KID especially after primary treatment while relatives ,,take over\"at recurrence. Callers\" expectations were predominantly assessment of treatment, reassurance and ,,2rid opinion\", individual counseling and orientation, S 49 Breast Cancer (Systemic and Supportive Therapy) reflected in the high demand for information on addresses of cancer centers and specialized clinics. Conclusions: Information provision by caregivers does not fully satisfy patients\" and relatives\" needs and the wish to be reassured about the adequacy of treatment is high. The results show that breast cancer patients have continuing need of information and support at all times and at all stages, revealing also changing areas of interest and concerns according to the stage of disease. Especially patients under age 60 seek information actively and may be motivated for shared decision making. The comparison of inquiries from patients and relatives indicates differences in involvement and concerns at different points of time. 0255 ANTHRACYCLINE/TAXANE (AT) COMBINATIONS IN METASTATIC BREAST CANCER (MBC): RISK BENEFIT ASSESSMENT WITH A NEW KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY G. Jaenel, M. Kuebrich, Oncology World (Planegg) Objective: The role of single-agent (SA) vs. combination therapy (CT) in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is still in controversial discussion. There is a clear rationale for an AT combination in patients with MBC, given their high individual activities and partially non-overlapping toxicities. To assess a scientific rationale, the main issue is the evaluation of available data and their transformation into useful knowledge. We are using a new information technology to accomplish this proc- ess. The aim of this approach is to bring together reliable data to elucidate the risks and benefits of a AT-regimen by a knowledge discovery process (KDP). Methods: 537 published reports addressing paclitaxel (P)/doxorubicin (DOX) or epirubicin (EPI) were selected from peer-reviewed journals by a knowledge dis- covery process (KDP). After independent assessment by two reviewers 30 (23) phase I/ll and three (two) phase Ill trials have been identified for P/DOX (EPI) and were implemented in our knowledge base system for analysation. The main outcomes for efficacy were response rate, time to treatment failure and overall survival (OS). For safety the focus was on common side effects, but also on cardiotox, as a major point of concern. Results: The outcome indicates that cardiotoxicity is minimized when the individual dose (D) of DOX is less than 50 mg/ m2, when the cumulative D of DOX is less than 360 mg/m2, and when an interval of 4 to 24 hours separates the infusion of DOX and R The DOX/P regimens led to improved overall response and complete response compared to sequential SA therapy or standard DOX -containing CT [Anthracycline/Cyclophosphamide (AC) or 5-Fu/AC (FAC)] in MBC. In one trial the median time of survival was significantly prolonged in the DOX/P arm. The combination of EPI/P was as active as EPI/ Cyclophosphamide (C), but associated with a lower rate of primary progression. The results were not associated with a significant difference in median progres- sion free survival. Neutropenia without febrile episodes was the main toxicity in both arms. Cardiotoxicity was rare. In the second study EPI/C and EPI/P had similar progression-free survival and OS when used first line in MBC. Conclusion: A new KDP allows to evaluate mass data in a context-specific scientific rationale. P/DOX (EPI) are suitable alternatives to more standard anthracycline-containing regimens for the treatment of MBC. 0256 IN-VIVO ASSESSMENT OF CHEMO-SENSITIVITY USED FOR DECISION MAKING IN THE GEPARTRIO-TRIAL OF PREOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY IN PRIMARY BREAST CANCER. G. von Minckwitz, B. Gerber, S. Costa, H. Eidtmann, J.U. Raab, Essen, M0nster, Halle) Purpose: Neither clinical nor biological factors have been identified so far that predict anti-tumor effect of preoperative chemotherapy reliably. Therefore we analyzed the value of ,,rapid clinical response after 2 cycles of chemotherapy\" for predicting complete pathological responses (pCR) in two study populations. Patients and Methods: Patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of previously untreated, operable, and measurable primary breast cancer (7\"2-3, N0- 2, M0) were treated in prospectively randomized trials with either four cycles of dose-dense (biweekly) doxorubicin and docetaxel (ddAT) chemotherapy, yon Minckwitz et al. JCO 2001) or ddAT versus four cycles of doxorubicin / cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel (Geparduo-trial, Jackisch et al., Breast Cancer Res Treat 2001) prior to surgery. Rapid clinical response was defined as a decrease in tumor area > 50% assessed by palpation after 2 cycles of ddAT or AC. Efficacy variable was the detection of a pathological complete response (disappearance of all invasive or non-invasive tumor cells in the breast at surgery). Results: 248 patients have been analyzed in the Gepardo trial. 125 (50%) patients had a rapid clinical response after 2 cycles of ddAT and had eventually a pCR in 17% at surgery after 4 cycles of ddAT. 123 patients showed no rapid reduction in clinical tumor size. 60% of these patients still obtained a clinical partial or complete remission at surgery, however pCR rate was only 3%. Rapid response after 2 cycles was the best predictor (odds ration 16.4, p=0.01) for pCR in a multivariate analysis including menopausal status, tumor size, nodal status, estrogen- and progesterone receptor status, Her2, p53, Ki67 and bcl2. 59% of 223 patients showed a rapid response after 2 cycles of ddAT or AC in the Geparduo-trial. These patients had a pCR rate at surgery in 17%, while only 5% of the patients with no rapid response achieved a pCR. Conclusion: We could consistently demonstrate on two study populations that response after two cycles of chemotherapy can predict paR. It has therefore been used for decision making in the recently started GeparTrio trial. Patients with no response to 2 cycles of Docetaxel/ Adriamycin/Cyclophosphamide (TAC) are randomized to either continuation of TAC (4 additional cycles) or a salvage regime of 4 cycles Vinorelbine / Capecitabine before surgery. Poster A WELL-TOLERATED CYTOPROTECTOR IN POLYCHEMOTHERAPY OF ADVANCED BREAST CANCER AND ADVANCED OVARIAN CANCER M. Geberth, M. Eichbaum, F. Beldermann, demonstrates a unique ability to protect normal but not tumor tissue from cytotoxic damage induced by chemo-therapy. However, transient vomiting and associated with amifostine infusions limit its routine use. The aim of this study was to reduce this side effects by giving amifostine sequentially in divided doses. Methods: We prospectively evaluated 20 patients with advanced breast cancer or advanced ovarian cancer who received a polychemotherapy consisting of epirubicine 90mg/m2 and docetaxel 75rag/m2 day 1 (10 patients) or carboplatin area under the curve 4 and docetaxel 75 mg/m day 1 (10 patients) as 2nd or 3rd line therapy. Each chemotherapy was repeated every three weeks for up to six cycles. Amifostine 500 mg was administered over 15 minutes immediately before each cytotoxic drug. During infusion vital signs were monitored every five minutes. Following each chemotherapy we performed weekly blood counts and BUN tests. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography before and after chemotherapy. Results: No hypotension or deterioration of cardiac function was observed. Only one patient experienced vomiting shortly after infusion of amifostine. Myelotoxiaity was moderate. Ten patients received granulocyte colony stimulating factor to prevent febrile neutropenia. No grade 4 neutropenia appeared. However, compared to a retrospective cohort of patients treated without amifostine there was no apparent decrease in the number of transfused red blood cells or platelets. Conclusion: Amifostine, given in divided doses in a sequential schedule, seems to be a well-tolerated cytoprotector in platin- or anthracyclin-containing polychemotherapy of advanced breast cancer and advanced ovarian cancer. The ability of amifostine to protect normal tissues without protection of tumor cells might help to enhance the therapeutic ratio of a variety of anticancer drugs and thereby improve patient outcome. Further prospective randomised trials are needed to assess the impact of amifostine on chemotherapy toxicity and patient outcome P258 TAXANES ARE THE MOST ACTIVE SALVAGE CHEMOTHERAPY OPTION FOR METASTATIC BREAST CANCER PATIENTS FAILING FIRST-LINE ANTHRACYCLINE-CONTAINING SYSTEMIC TREATMENT A. Schneeweiss, T. Geberth, F. Beldermann, G. Bastert, Universit~it Heidelberg (Heidelberg) In order to assess the clinical benefit of salvage chemotherapy 79 metastatic breast cancer patients formerly treated with anthracycline- or taxane-containing first-line regimens were retrospectively analyzed until september 2001. First-line chemotherapy was based on anthracycline-regimens in 37 pts (A) and on taxane+_anthracycline-regimens in 42 pts (B), respectively. Patient characteristics at first line chemotherapy for metastatic disease were (median(range)) age: 53 negative estrogen receptors: 29%. Median overall survival of all patients was 24 mo (range, 1-103+) with a median follow-up of 33 mo. in group A response rate (RR) of first line chemotherapy was 27% and 38%, 22%, 6% in patients receiving salvage chemotherapy as second, third and fourth line. Progression-free survival (PFS) was 6 mo for first-line and 6, 5 and 4 mo for second to fourth line treatment, respectively. Group B shows 56% RR with first line chemotherapy and 21% or 0% in patients receiving salvage chemotherapy as second line or third fine. PFS was 7 mo for first-line and 5 and 4 mo for second and third line treatment. in comparison RR and PFS were strikingly superior with taxane-containing (tc) compared to non-taxane-containing salvage PFS-ntc: 8 mo vs 5 mo (2nd-line), 9 mo vs 3 mo (3rd-line), 7 mo vs 3 mo (4th-line), respectively. In group B no other cytotoxic agent or antibody including vinorelbine, gemcitabine, mitomycin, bendamustine and trastuzumab produced significant better results compared to each other. This retrospective analysis strongly suggests the application of a taxane-based salvage chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer patients after failure of first- line anthracycline-containing therapy. Only a small number of patients receiving taxane\u00b1anthracycline as first-line chemotherapy showed additional benefit to following palliative treatment. S 50 Breast Cancer (Systemic and Supportive Therapy) P259 ARIMIDEX (ANASTROZOLE) - THE RATIONALE FOR ADJUVANT TREATMENT OF OPERABLE BREAST CANCER: EFFICACY, TOLERABILITY AND aromatase inhibitor (AI) to show a significant mature survival advantage over megestrol acetate (p=0,02) in advanced breast cancer (ABC) in postmenopausal (PM) women following progression on tamoxifen (TAM). It was also the first AI to demonstrate superiority over TAM in median ]q-P (p=0,022, 2-sided) in the analysis of 611 PM pts with ABC known to be hormone receptor positive. Another trial with 238 ER positive PM pts with ABC, previously untreated with endocrine treatment, demonstrated a significant better overall survival (p=0,036), \"Iq-P and clinical benefit for AX vs. TAM. These efficacy advantages in ABC offer the possibility that AX may offer efficacy benefits over TAM in the treatment of early disease. In the adjuvant setting, tolerability is of greater importance, since therapy continues for longer durations in women who are disease free and potentially ,,cured\" following surgery. The different pharmacological activity of AX compared to TAM suggests that the increased incidence of thromboembolic events, eye diseases and endometrial changes including endometrial cancer, observed in PM pts receiving TAM may not occur with AX. This is supported by tolerability data from comparative trials in ABC. Benefical effects are known from TAM on lipids and bone densitiy. Results from an AX vs. TAM trial showed no influence of Anastrozole on total cholesterol, HDL and LDL levels compared to pre-treatment levels. The incidence on bone fractures, a major sign of osteoporosis and low BMD, were comparable in TAM and AX pts in ABC trials. AX is highly selective for aromatase enzyme inhibition. In contrast to other AI no influence of adrenal steroid secretion in ACTH stimulation even in 10 times higher concentration are reported. SHBG levels are also not affected. Studies showed no interaction between AX and antipyrine, cimetidine or warfarine. In contrast to steroidal AI no steroidal effects, no androgenic or estrogenic properties are know for AX. AX appears to be more effective as TAM in hormone sensitive ABC and a well tolerated as well as highly selective AI. This makes AX an ideal candidate for replacing TAM in adjuvant disease setting. Results of a large comparative adjuvant trial (ATAC) in PM pts will be available end of 2001. P260 ENHANCED ANTITUMOR EFFECT ON ANTIESTROGEN RESISTANT BREAST CANCER IN VITRO AND IN VIVO BY A COMBINATION OF TAMOXIFEN AND ALKYLPHOSPHOLIPID against tamoxifen is the most serious problem during hormonal therapy of patients with breast cancer. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether it is possible to overcome this resistance using tamoxifen in alkylphospholipid liposomes. In vitro results: Cell culture studies were performed with the estrogen sensitive MCF-7 and the estrogen cross resistant NCI/ADR breast cancer cell lines. The antiestrogen was incorporated into liposomes prepared from the cancerostatic octadecyl-(N,N-dimethyl-piperidino-4yl)-phosphate (OPP). For in vitro experiments, instead of tamoxifen, 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (HT) was used because of its higher affinity to ER. Using the MTT proliferation assay, it was found that liposomal HT inhibited the tumour cell growth significantly stronger than free HT. The coincubation with about 10 12M free HT induced apeptosis as it was determined with the ApoGIow-assay, whereas HT-liposomes of up to 100 IJM did only inhibit proliferation. HT-OPP-liposomes had already a clear cytolytic effect at these concentrations. The cellular uptake of free HT, quantified by HPTLC, was comparable for both cell lines after 6 hours of incubation. Surprisingly, the intracellular level of HT following liposomal application was lower for both cell lines than that of free HT, but the resistant NCI/ADR cells accumulated significantly more liposomal HT than MCF- 7 cells did. The in vitro results suggest that different cellular pathways may recruited in dependence on the formulation of the antiestrogen. In vivo results: The relatively tamoxifen-sensitive breast cancer xenograft model 3366 and MCF7 as well as a subline with acquired resistance (3366/Tam) were used to follow the therapeutic effect of tamoxifen. Tumour bearing mice were treated once/week for 4 weeks with free or liposomal tamoxifen. The 3366 tumours responded equally well to i.p. free or tamoxifen/OPP liposomes, while ,,empty\" OPP containing liposomes were inefficient. Oppositely, the growth of the resistant 3366/Tam tumour was significantly reduced by applying tamoxifen liposomes with a decrease in the relative tumour volume down to 47 % while the free drug had only a weak effect (84%). A similar significant improvement was obtained with orally administered tamoxifen- liposomes in MCF7 xenografts. In conclusion, it could be demonstrated that the encapsulation of tamoxifen into alkylphospholipid liposomes modify its antitumor effect vitro and in vivo beneficially. P261 LETROZOLE AS NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT IN LOCALLY ADVANCED BREAST CANCER M. Breidenbach, M. to be effective in neoadjuvant treatment of advanced breast cancer but letrozole has recently proven superiority over tamoxifen in the metastatic setting. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of letrozole 2,5 mg as preoperative treatment in locally advanced breast cancer (tumor size > 3 cm). Methods: Twenty-three postmenopausal patients with estrogen- and / or progesterone receptor-positive primary breast cancer were treated for 12 weeks. Response was measured by change in tumor volume according to WHO-criteria. Tumor volumes were assessed clinically, by mammography and ultrasound. Results: All but one of the 23 patients were estrogen receptor-positive, mean age was 71,8 (range: 63-85) years. There were 4 complete clinical responses, 18 partial clinical responses and 1 patient with stable disease. Accounting for an response rate of 95,6 %. Breast conserving surgery could be performed in 18 of the 22 (81,8 %) responding patients. There were no notable side effects associated with the treatment. 13 of the patients investigated suffered from different serious underlying diseases (e.g. hypertension, cardiac insufficiency, coronary arteriosclerosis) which could be improved during the preoperative treatment by appropriate therapy. Conclusion: Letrozole used in a neoadjuvant setting is highly effective and well tolerated in postmenopausal patients with primary breast cancer, allowing for breast conserving therapy even in patients with serious medical disorders. P262 FIRST RESULTS OF THE ADJUVANT ATAC (ARIMIDEX, TAMOXIFEN, ALONE OR IN COMBINATION) TRIAL IN POSTMENOPAUSAL PATIENTS WITH OPERABLE BREAST CANCER W. Distler, G. (anastrozole, AN) was the first hormonal agent to show mature survival advantage vs. a progestin and the first to show superiority vs. Tamoxifen (TAM) in hormone receptor positive postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer. The ATAC trial evaluates AN in a three-way randomised double-blind design, either AN alone (n=3125) or [n combination with TAM (n=3125), compared with TAM alone (n=3116). Endpoints include recurrence-free survival, to]erability, time to distant metastasis, overall survival and incidence of new breast primaries. For the trial 9366 pts (median age 63 yrs) from 380 centres (21 countries, 30 mths) were recruited. 21% of pts had received chemotherapy prior to randomisation, 61% were N-ve and 64% had turnouts 2 cm or less. 73% of pts were receptor positive. Mastectomy was performed in 48% and 96% had axillary surgery. After a median follow-up time of 33,3 mths the first efficacy and safety results were as follows: AN had a significant advantage over TAM in recurrence free survival (RFS), HR 0,83 (95%CI 0,71-0,96); p=0,0129. In hormon sensitive patients even greater HR 0,78 (95%CI 0,65-0,93); p=0,0054. The rate of secondary (contralateral) primaries was significant reduced in the AN arm (HR 0,42 (95%CI 0,22-0,79); p=0,0068. The combination (AN + TAM) had no favourable effect compared to TAM. AN alone was more effective in RFS and reduction of secondary primaries compared to the combination. Main tolerablity results were also in favour of AN: weight gain, hot flushes, vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, endometrial cancer, thromboembolic events and ischaemic cerebral events were significant less frequent observed. However, TAM was better tolerated regarding muscular-skeletal disorders and bone fractures. Conclusion: The ATAC trial is the largest adjuvant trial ever conducted in post- menopausal patients with early breast cancer. Anastrozole is the first and only aromatase inhibitor showing a significant efficacy and tolerability advantage over TAM in the adjuvant setting. The results of ATAC trial will possibly change the therapeutic standards for treatment of early breast cancer in postmenopausal patients. P263 BENDAMUSTINE IS A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OPTION FOR PRETREATED PTS, WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER: RESULTS OF A PHASE II STUDY U. Reichmann, C. Zeeb, C. Bokemeyer, cross-resistance to other alkylators and anthracyclines. In this study we investigated the impact of Bendamustine (B) on pretreated pts. with metastatic breast cancer. 23 pts. with a mean age of 58 years (range: 37-75) had undergone a medium number of 3 (17.4%) (bone, or 7/23 (30.4%) 7/23 (30.4%) 4 metastatic sites including bone, brain, lung or liver. 120 mg/m 2 B was administered i.v. for 30 min. day 1+ 2 every 4 weeks. Prophylactic antiemetic therapy with serotonine-antagonists was given routinely. A total of 91 courses was administered, the median number per patient was 4(range: 1-8). Treatment was well tolerated, grade 3/4 toxicities occured very rarely. Only 1 patient experienced grade IV thrombocytopenia (4%). 4 pts. had grade Ill leukopenia (17%) and 1 pt grade III thrombocytopenia (4%). others below 10%. Response rates were as following: complete remission (CR) 0/23 (0%), partial S51 Breast Cancer (Systemic and Supportive Therapy) remission (PR) 5/23 (21.7%), no change (NC) 12/23 (52.1%), progressive disease (PD) 5/23 (21.7%). Our study confirms the results of a recently published multicenter trial by H6ffken et al. in a comparable patient population. We conclude that B given at a dosage of 120 mg/m 2 at day 1+ 2 of a four week treatment course is a highly effective salvage treatment regimen for metastastatic breast cancer in multiply pretreated pts.. Overall safety and tolerability was excellent. P264 NORMALISATION OF BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS OF BONE FORMATION COR- RELATES WITH CLINICAL BENEFIT FROM THERAPY IN METASTATIC BREAST CANCER D. LLfftner, A. Richter, R. Geppert, Biometrie (Berlin) Background: Collagen Type I is the most abundant protein of bone. We measured the a panel of biochemical markers of bone metabolism including the amino- terminal propeptide (PINP), the carboxy-terminal alkaline phosphatase and serum calcium levels and CA27.29 as mass tumor marker in 73 breast cancer patients with bone metastases under specific antitumor therapy and supportive treatment with pamidronate. Methods: Representative single time point evaluations of all markers were correlated to response assessment in UICC criteria. Restaging was done by standard procedures. PINP and ICTP were measured using standardized radioimmunoassays with established cut-off values of normal of 84 #g/I for PINP and 5 IJg/I for ICTR DPD was measured using chemiluminescence assay a cut-off of 13 nmol/mmol. Results: The only parameter to show a statistically significant correlation (p=0.003) to tumor response was the alkaline phosphatase level. PINP showed the second best result with p = 0.008 just missing statistical significance. The mass tumor marker CA27.29 failed to reflect the tumor burden using the normalization of the CA27.29 level as reference. Conclusions: Clinical benefit from systemic therapy was primarily accompanied by a normalization of biochemical markers representing bone formation. Among the degradation products of type I collagen, ICTP showed the best correlation with clinical outcome. P265 PREDICTABILITY OF SUCCESSFUL INPATIENT CANCER REHABILITATION FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS - A MULTICENTER TRIAL A. Luebbe, N. Krischke, D. Berger, D. Rosemeyer, KSIn, St. Peter- Ording) It was the intention to identify possible medical functional parameters that have a high predictive value regarding 1.) successful inpatient rehabilitation as well as 2.) the ideal duration of inpatient rehabilitation. These data could help in the decision to offer the best rehabilitation program to the proper patient at the right time. Therefore, health-related quality of life data (EORTC-QLQ-C30 and SF 36), functional tests and physician's rated objectives of 162 breast cancer patients (ages 18-75, stages pT1-4, pN0/+ M0) were assessed. About 50% of our patients stayed for 21 days. Those, who stayed longer (28 days) had less chemotherapies, yet, they had more overall intensive primary treatment with 68% radiation treatment in the 4- week, 62% in the 3-week-group. In the 4-week-group we saw more patients with antihormonal treatment. Only 29% in the 4-weeks-group benefited from lymphodema treatment, whereas 38% did so in the 3-week-group. There was significant improvement in overall physical performance, in quality of life data by inpatient rehabilitation, but there was no difference between the 3- and 4-week- group. Taken together, our results demonstrate that arm lymphedema and nega- tive side effects from antihormonal treatment by tamoxifen as well as functional impairment in shoulder-arm movement were more significant in the group that stayed longer. Overall inpatient rehabilitation was beneficial to the majority of the patients. In conclusion, we identified lymphedema and functional limitation in the humero-scapular joint in the arm and antiestrogene treatment as being the 3 parameters, that verified longer inpatient rehabilitation stay in the breast cancer group. P266 CHANGES IN EXPRESSION OF IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS IN BREAST CANCER (BC) TISSUE OF 73 PATIENTS AFTER NEOADJUVANT THERAPY (NT). IS THERE A PREDICTIVE VALUE FOR RESPONSE TO TREAT- MENT? U. Krainick, N. Fersis, D. University of Tuebingen, Department of Gynaecology, University of Tuebingen; Department of Gynaecology, University of Tuebingen, Institute of Pa- thology, University of Tuebingen, Institute Institute of Biometry (Tuebingen) Objective: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) has been proven to be equal to adjuvant chemotherapy in primary BC concerning DFS and OAS. Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NHT) is under clinical investigation. We examined whether specific changes of immunohistochemistry (IHC) in BC may be correlated with response to NT. Methods: After receiving pathological diagnosis and IHC by microbiopsy 73 pa- tients (pts) with T2 and more advanced BC were treated with NT regimen for 12- 16 weeks (58 pts with anthracycline and/or taxane containing NCT, 15 pts with NHT: tamoxifen, letrozol or exemestane). Clinical data, response rates, pathologi- and immunohistochemical data (ER, PR, p-53, c-erb B2, Mib-1) before and after NT were compared. Results: 7 pts showed complete response (CR 9,6%), 38 pts partial response (PR 52.1%), 24 pts stable disease (SD 32.9%), 2 pts progressive disease (PD 2.7%) and 2 pts could not be evaluated (2.7%). 8 pts achieved pathological CR (11%). We found no significant changes in ER, PR, p-53, c-erb B2 after NT. There is a trend to decreasing values of PR and a significant decrease in Mib-1 expression after NT (p<O.0001). Except of the above mentioned results after NT there was neither a different IHC pattern detectable in the subgroup with NCT (n=58), the subgroup with NHT (n=15) nor in the group with objective response (CR+PR, n=45). Conclusion: We could not find an immunohistochemical marker predicting re- sponse to NT although a decrease in Mib-1 values seems to be favorable. Larger numbers of pts and further investigation with other markers like S-phase, ploidy, proteases or growth factors are necessary. P267 RANDOMIZED PHASE II STUDY OF DOCETAXEL VS. EPIRUBICIN/CYCLO- PHOSPHAMIDE TO OPTIMIZE FIRST-LINE THERAPY OF METASTATIC BREAST CANCER (MBC): PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF THE TIPP STUDY M. Friedrich, C. Wasemann, M. Holl~.nder, K. Schmidt, Universit~t des Saarlandes (Saar)) Background: Docetaxel is the most active single agent in the treatment of MBC and may produce higher response rates than current standard regimens. To define the therapeutic role of docetaxel more clearly, we initiated a randomized phase II study of docetaxel versus epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC). Methods: Patients with MBC, no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease, and WHO performance status 0-1 are eligible for the study. Accrual of 40-60 patients is planned. Docetaxel is given at 100 mg/m 2 with standard oral dexamethasone premedication. Patients in the EC arm receive epirubicin 90 mg/m 2 as an intravenous bolus followed by intravenous infusion of cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m =. In both arms cycles are repeated every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles. Results: To date, 17 patients have been randomized (docetaxel 7, EC 10), and 6 patients (docetaxel 2, EC 4) have completed chemotherapy. Three patients died of progressive disease. EC was given at full doses, while the dose of docetaxel was reduced to 75 mg/m 2 in one elderly frail patient. No dose delays were required. G-CSF was used in 5 patients. 27 cycles of docetaxel (mean, 3.9) and 44 cycles of EC (mean, 4.4) are currently evaluable for toxicity. Toxicity was mild to moderate except for alopecia. To facilitate comparison of toxicity between treatments we calculated mean WHO grades per cycle. No difference for any specific toxicity was seen: mean grade was <1 for all toxicities except nausea/vomiting in the EC arm (1.2) and alopecia in both arms (docetaxel 2.6, EC 2.7). Conclusion: Both treatment regimens are equally safe and well tolerated. More mature data including response rates will be presented at the meeting. P268 DOCETAXEL AND DOXORUBICIN COMBINATION IN SALVAGE THERAPY OF METASTATIC BREAST CANCER M. Altinbap, H. Copkun, (~. Er, Anthracycline containing regimens are effective in first line treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Recently taxane consisting combination regi- mens have promising results in treatment of MBC. In this study efficacy of docetaxel and doxorubicin (DD) combination was evaluated retrospectively. Method: DD combination was administered to 34 MBC patients who relapsed after first line treatment between January 1999 and March 2001. Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV on first day, doxorubicin 50 rag/m2 iv on 1st day were administered every 3 weeks. All patients but one were female. Median age was 51 years (38-69). 28 patients were evaluable for response. 22 of them had prior anthracycline contain- ing chemotherapy regimen. 2 patients had 3rd line, one patients 4th line and others had 2nd line treatment. Median 6 cycles (2-7) were administered. Results: Metastatic sites prior to chemotherapy were lung 8, liver 7, bone 4, bone and liver 2, lung and bone 2, liver and lung 2, liver, lung and bone 1, local, brain and lung 1, liver, bone and plevra 1. One complete response, 11 partial response totally objective response in 12 patients (42.9%) was obtained.Median progression free survival (PFS) was calculated as 10_+1.5 months (95% CI 7.07-12.99), median overall survival (OAS) 17_+5.05 (95% CI 7.06-26.94). One year PFS and OAS rate was calculated as 21.6% and 54.4% respectively. Grade 3-4 myelotoxicity was observed in 9 patients (32.1%). Grade 3-4 nonhematologic toxicity was not observed except alopecia. Conclusion: DD combination is an effective treatment choice in MBC. P269 PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED INTERVENTION TRIAL IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS TO CLARIFY THE RELEVANCE OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF RECURRENT DISEASE BY DETERMINATION OF TUMOR MARKERS P. Stieber, M. Untch, H. Sauer, D. Nagel, H. Hepp, D. Seidel, Inst. of Clinical Chemistry, University of Munich, Dept. of Gynecology, University of Munich, Dept. of Intern. Medicine Ill,University of Munich (Munich)The methods of follow up after primary treatment of breast cancer patients are discussed controversially. Especially the use of sensitive diagnostic methods for the detection of recurrent disease is seen critically as up to now the benefit of an early applied therapy is not proven. To clarify this question S 52 Breast Cancer (Systemic and Supportive Therapy) / Breast Cancer (Basic Research) we developed a prospective randomized intervention trial for the follow up care of women after intentionally curative treatment of primary breast cancer. The main objective of this study is the prolongation of the symptom free and the overall survival in the study group with early therapeutic intervention. During a monccentric pilot phase we verified the logistics of our study. Patients participating in this trial were controlled every 6 weeks by the determination of the tumor associated antigens CEA and CA 15-3. In case of an (in advance defined) increase of CEA and CA 15-3 based upon the individual baseline values, the asymptomatic patients were randomized (hormonal treatment versus no interven- tion) if there was no sign of metastatic disease in medical imaging. Up to now 244 patients could be recruited: 190 patients are under observation, 32 patients discontinued for various reasons, 8 patients had a relapse of the carcinoma without tumor marker increase and 14 women had an increase of either CEA, CA15-3 or both. The main experience from the pilot phase is that the time for randomization has to be changed. Despite intensive personal information of the patients concerning the lack of evidence in oncology whether an earlier treatment would prolong disease free intervall or overall survival randomization at the time when tumor markers increase and recurrent disease is probable was not tolerated by the patients concerned. Randomization is now done after the end of primary therapy at the beginning of follow-up care. Publication only P'270 GOOD REMISSION OF EXCESSIVE, RECURRENT BREAST CANCER LIVER METASTASES USING A COMBINED CHEMOTHERAPY CONSISTING OF MITOMYCIN, FOLINATE AND 5-FLUOROURACIL AFTER WALL STENT IMPLANTATION IN THE COMMON BILE DUCT - CASE REPORT OF A 64-YEAR OLD WOMAN M. Eichbaum, T. de Rossi, M. Geberth, A. Schneeweiss, F. Beldermann, G. Bastert, Universit~ts-Frauenklinik (Heidelberg) We report about a 64-year old woman with excessive, recurrent liver metastases from breast cancer. Patient's history: After primary diagnosis of breast cancer the patient was operated with modified radical mastectomy revealing an invasive ductal carcinoma with 15 axillary lymph node metastases, ER and PR were negative, HER2/neu was overexpressed. In the adjuvant setting the patient received a chemotherapy consisting of four cycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamid, local radiotherapy and three cycles of a CMF-chemotherapy. Five months after primary diagnosis multifecal, disseminated liver metastases initially occured. The patient received several chemotherapies or combination therapies consisting of docetaxel/herceptin, vinorelbine/herceptin and gemcitabine with only short remissions or progressive disease. Finally the patient presented with excessive jaundice and fulminant hepatic metastases. Diagnostic parameters: The patient presented in weak physical conditions. Sonographic evaluation of the liver showed multifocal metastatic lesions with a maximum turnout of 10 cm diameter. The common bile duct was dilated up to 15 mm. Blood chemistry showed a hyperbilirubinaemia with 20 mg/dl at maximum, liver enzymes were increased more than three-fold, CEA was at 430 IJg/I, Ca 15-3 at 158 U/ml. Therapy: Cholangiopancreaticography was performed and a wall stent was successfully placed inside the common bile duct with rapide improvement of hyperbilirubinaemia to 4 mg/dl. chemotherapy was startet consisting of mitomycin, folinate and 5-fluorouracil in escalating dosage over six cycles altogether. Results: Six months after stent implantation and start of the described combination therapy the patient is still alive and presents in slightly reduced but adequate conditions. Tumour markers still continue to decrease (CEA at 57 pg/I, Ca 15-3 at 87 U/ml). Bilirubin decreased to 0.6 mg/ml and liver enzymes normalized. Ultrasound diagnostic described a partial remission of all hepatic lesions. Conclusions: 1. In patients with excessive jaundice due to bile duct compression by breast cancer liver metastases, an endoscopic wall stent implantation should be evaluated to improve the liver capability for chemotherapy 2. Combination therapy of mitomycin, folinate, 5-fluorouracil is a promising, well tolerable regimen for patients with recurrent breast cancer liver metastases, especially for the elder patient or patients in reduced physical conditions. P'271 FASLODEX (FULVESTRANT): LONG-TERM RESPONSE AFTER FAILURE OF TAMOXIFEN AND AROMATASE INHIBITORS IN A POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMAN WITH INFLAMMATORY BREAST CANCER: A CASE REPORT. U. Albrachts Universit~t (Kiel) Fulvestrant ('Faslodex'; FAS) is the first in a new class of treatment for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women; an ER Downregulator. Two phase Ill studies in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer after Tamoxifen Failure recently have shown a similar efficacy of FAS with the aromatase inhibitor ~,nastrozole. We report a case of a 61-year-old women with advanced disease. Inflammatory 3feast cancer of the right breast was diagnosed in June 1984. After radiotherapy ',50Gy), mastectomy of the right breast was performed (11/84) followed by adjuvant 3olychemotherapy (VAC, 12/84-4/85). After Iocoregional recurrence of the right axillar lymph nodes and scar recurrence, excision and a chest wall operation (1/ 39) was followed by chemotherapy (6xCMF) and radiotherapy (20Gy). Mastectomy 3f the left breast was performed after contralateral recurrence with lymphangiosis (11/89). Multiple skin lesions were excised over several years, but no distant metastasis has occurred to date. Tamoxifen (20mg/d) started in 11/89 and continued until resistance developed (6/97). Subsequent Anastrozele (AN; lmg/d) gave complete remission. After 23 progressed further progression. Subsequent CMF (3x2 double cycles) induced stable disease. The patient received, by named- patient supply, im FAS 250mg monthly from 7/00 to 8/01. After 4 weeks, partial remission of the skin metastases occurred. After 7 months' therapy isolated lesions developed near the scar. Stable disease was maintained until 7/01, the lesions near the scar faded but new progressing lesions on the right arm developed. Endocrine treatment has continued with FAS 250mg + AN lmg/d (14.08.01 to 21.09.01) and then 2mg/d. Stable disease is ongoing. FAS was well tolerated and a marked improvement in quality of life was reported during FAS therapy. In conclusion, FAS has shown to be an additional endocrine treatment option for advanced breast cancer, giving clinically relevant benefits after multiple previous endocrine treatments and improving quality of life. P'272 A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF CA 27,29 AND BONE SIALOPROTEIN (BSP) AS SERUM MARKERS IN METASTATIC BONE DISEASE OF WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER R. Gallinat, M. Bg.uerle, A. Kafka, M. Schulz, R. Kreienberg, Uni-Frauenklinik UIm (Ulm) We retrospectively investigated the role of two serum markers in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and bone metastasis before and during bisphosphonate therapy as possible markers for monitoring of metastatic bone disease. We have serum probes of 90 women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and bone metastasis. We measured the levels of CA 27.29 and Bone Sialoprotein (BSP) serum markers 1 year before the start of a bisphosphonate therapy and 1 year after and/or before and after the detection of progression of the bone metastasis under bisphosphonate therapy. For detecting bone metastasis we used scintigraphJes and radiographies of the bones. For evaluating the course of disease we used serum markers CEA and CA 15-3. It was our aim to detect potentially valuable serum markers for monitoring the metastatic bone disease in women with breast cancer in this investigation. This might give us a rationale for a prospective investigation of the role of bone specific serum markers in MBC with bone metastasis under bisphosphonate therapy. Breast Cancer (Basic Research) Oral Presentation 0273 COMBINATION OF INVASION FACTORS UPA AND PAl-1 ENABLES INDIVIDUALIZED THERAPY DECISIONS IN PRIMARY BREAST CANCER N. Harbeck, R. Kates, M. Schmitt, and its inhibitor PAl-1 as individual factors is well established in breast cancer. The improvement in clinical risk assessment gained by combining these factors and resulting consequences for patient management are evaluated here. uPA and PAI- l levels were prospectively measured by ELISA (American DiagnosUca Inc., Greenwich, CT, USA) in tumor tissue extracts of 761 primary breast cancer patients. In the clinically important subgroup of node-negative patients without adjuvant systemic therapy (n=269, median follow-up 60 months), the clinical value of testing both uPA and PAl-1 is demonstrated: the criterion ,,either or both high\" identifies with high sensitivity those patients at high relapse risk while keeping more than half in the low-risk group, uPA/PA]-I is the strongest predictor of DFS and OS; patients with high uPA/PAI-1 have risk (p<0.001; RR 4.8; 95% Ch 2.5-9.1), in particular for early relapse. Even within risk groups stratified by established criteria (nodal or menopausal status, tumor size, grade, steroid hormone receptors) uPA/PAI-1 provides significant risk group discrimination. In the whole collective, the significant interaction between uPA/ PAl-1 and adjuvant systemic therapy suggests a benefit from adjuvant therapy in high-risk patients as defined by uPA/PAI-1 (p=9.001; RR 0.3; 95% Ch 0.2-0.6). In conclusion, the clinical relevance of the two tumor invasion factors uPA and PAI- l is greatest when used in combination. The particular combination uPA/PAI-1 (both low vs either or both high) is superior to either factor alone and supports risk- adapted individualized therapy decisions. 0274 IDENTIFICATION OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH HIGH RISK BY GENE EXPRESSION PROFILING A. Ahr, T. Karn, T. Seiter, C. Solbach, K. Strebhardt, U. Holtnch, M. Kaufmann, Universit~ts-Frauenklinik (Frankfurt) We have performed DNA array analyses to establish a molecular profiling of breast cancers. By cluster analysis a subpopulation of breast cancers was identified, which contained a high number of nodal positive tumors and frequently had developed distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. Correlation of follow up data (n = 55) with this cluster analysis revealed that despite a relative short follow up time (23.5 months) already 50 % of the patients in the identified subpopulatien S 53 Breast Cancer (Basic Research) progressed to metastatic disease (11/22). Strikingly, three of five patients classified as NO in this subpopulation developed distant metastases. Taken together, our analysis identifies breast cancer patients with a high risk of disease recurrence, as a first step towards improved patient adapted therapy. 0275 NON-GENOMIC EFFECTS OF ESTROGENS ON SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAYS IN TUMOR CELL LINES B. Hanstein, Benten, P. Dall, H.G. Render, Heinrich Heine Universit&t (Desseldorf) Research so far has concentrated mainly on the classical Steroid hormone (SH) receptors and the underlying mechanisms of antihormone interactions with these receptors. This is mainly because in the conventional view, Estrogen (E) and Progesterone produce most of their effects through interaction with cellular/ nuclear receptors with subsequent alteration of the gene regulating machinery. However, emerging data suggests that these lipophilic hormones are also able to produce rapid effects within several seconds, which cannot be adequately explained through the classical mechanism. Further investigation has recently led to the discovery of membrane-bound forms of E-receptors, that are coupled to cytosolic signal transduct[on proteins. These rapid responses have been observed in several tissues such as myometrial cells, neurons, endothelium, osteoblasts, granulesa cells and some breast cancer cell lines. The binding of E to these cell surface forms of E-receptors is thought to be coupled to G-protein activation, followed by the activation of several second messenger systems such as calcium, leading to the activation of different protein kinases. One such kinase is thought to be the Mitogen Active Protein (MAP)-kinase, which serves as a stimulus for cell proliferation. Our data suggests the possible functional existence of such receptors in the human breast and endometrial carcinoma cell lines in vitro. Using spectrofiuoremetry to measure the intracellular calcium concentration, data has been gathered to suggest that the addition of E to these cells, may lead to a rapid rise in the intracellular calcium concentration of the cells, depending on the cell type and culture conditions. Confocal laser microscopy has been performed in order to investigate the existence of these membrane-forms of E receptors on different cell lines. Such a mechanism may be of relevance in order to further understand the various proliferation stimuli arising at the cell membrane in these estrogen-sensitive cells, and this initiation point may lead to the activation of different protein kinases with subsequent proliferation. 0276 EXOGENEOUS HORMONES (OC) AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON PROGNOSTIC FACTORS IN BREAST CANCER 1. Sch6nborn, M. MOhner, W. Lichtenegger, Charite, Humboldt-Universitg.t, BA f. Arbeitsmedizin (Berlin) Objective: The question of whether oral contraceptive(OC) use Before diagnosis has an effect on tumorbiology and prognosis of breast cancer remains a subject of discussion. Methods: A nested case-control study was conducted to investigate the effect of OC use on prognostic factors and the outcome of breast cancer patients. In 471 breast cancer patients histomorphological (tumortype, grading, PR) and factors (c-erbB-2, p53) and their association to OC use were studied. Results: In current users a significant increase in node-positive (OR 2.14) and poorly differentiated tumors (OR 2.01) and of tumors with high proliferative fraction (OR 2.69) was observed. Past users had significantly more ER-positive tumors (OR 2.16-3.69) with a moderate increase in proliferative activity (OR 1.64-2.69) compared to never users. In multivariate survival analyses long-term OC use (HR 0.55, 95%CI 0.34-0.90) and first months before diagnosis (HR 0.49, 95%CI 0.26-0.92) were associated with a significant improvement in survival, whereas current OC use ( HR 2.29, 95%CI 1.02-5.17) was related to a significant decrease in survival rates. Conclusions: OC use covering a biologically sensitive period in tumor development might be more important for the prognosis of breast cancer than duration of use. 0277 MOLECULAR GENETIC ANALYSIS OF DNA REPAIR GENES RAD51, XRCC1, XRCC2, XRCC3 AND XRCC5 IN SPORADIC BREAST CANCER B. Betz, H. Jiang, P. might contribute to genomic instability and cancer progression. The repair of DNA damage plays a key role in protecting the genome of the cell against cancer-causing agents. The development of breast cancer is based on genetic alterations of tumor-suppressor genes, for which loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is a hint for gene inactivation. Five DNA repair genes Rad51, XRCC1, XRCC2, XRCC3 and XRCC5 are potential tumor suppressor genes. The role of these genes in breast carcinogenesis were examined through LOH and mutation analysis in 224 sporadic breast cancer. PCR based fluorescent technology for detection of microsatellite polymorphisms was applied for LOH analysis. A total of 224 breast cancer with matched normal tissue were examined. DHPLC were established as screening method for the analysis of XRCC2 and XRCC3 genes. The DHPLC positive samples were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Frequent LOH was found at for the frequency of LOH Rad51 (p=0.008), XRCC2 (p=0.006) and XRCC3 (p=0.039) XRCC3 status, LOH of XRCC5 correlated with negative estrogen receptor status (p=0.029). Positive correlation was found significantly for LOH of Rad51 and LOH of all XRCC gene loci analysed. allele loss of XRCC2 (n=34) and XRCC3 (n=28) were selected for mutation analysis using DHPLC. In the XRCC2 gene two novel sequence variants (Intronl: C19609T; exon3: G31479A), the XRCC3 gene only one point mutation (exon3: C8634T) were found. The frequently occurring LOH of analysed gene loci in sporadic breast cancer can not be explained by mutations in these candidate genes. Promoter hypermethylation or haplo-insufficiency may be other mechanisms for inactivation of the five genes. The effect of the ,,missense\" mutation within the XRCC3 coding sequence need further investigation. Poster P278 NUMERICAL ABERRATIONS IN CIRCULATING EPITHELIAL CELLS OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS \"17 Fehm, K. Heselmeyer-Haddad, T. Ried, L. , UT Southwestern School (Erlangen; Bethesda, Downers Grove, Dallas, USA) Numerical aberrations in circulating epithelial cells of breast cancer patients Background: Epithelial cells can be detected in the blood of breast cancer patients. The malignant nature of these cells, however, has not been proven. Numerical aber- rations are an early event in breast cancer. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate (1) whether circulating epithelial cells in breast cancer patients are aneusomic and (2) do their aberration pattern match that from the primary tumor, thus indicating common clonality. Methods: Eighteen breast cancer patients with cytokeratin-positive cells in the blood were selected for this study. Anticoagulated blood samples were first enriched for epithelial cells by positive immunomagnetic separation before cytospins were prepared. Epithelial cells were identified by immunofluorescent staining using a monoclonal pan-cytokeratin antibody. were then genotyped with centromeric DNA-probes (CEP 1, 3, 7, 8, 11 or 17) by dual or tricolor-FISH. Touch preparations of the primary tumor tissue could be obtained from 8 of 18 patients and were hybridized with the same set of probes used for genotpying of corresponding blood slides. Results: The number of CK-positive cells ranged between 1 and 25 cells per cytospin. Epithelial cells showed numerical aberrations in 14 of 18 patients for at least one of the centromeric probes. In 8 of these patients, two or more cytokeratin-positive cells could be genotyped. A cytogenetically heterogenous population of epithelial cells was observed in three cases whereas five patients had cytokeratin-positive cells with a homogenous pattern of numerical aberrations. Touch preparations were available from 6 patients with aneusomic epithelial cells. The aberration pattern matched a clone in the primary tumor in 5 patients. The matching clone was the main subpopulation in the touch preparation of 4 patients. Conclusion: The majority of circulating epithelial cells in the blood of breast cancer patients is aneusomic. Comparison of the aberration pattern of circulating epithe- lial cells and primary tumor can be used to prove the malignant nature of epithelial cells in these patients. P279 DEVELOPMENT OF METASTATIC BREAST CANCER IN YB-1 TRANSGENIC MICE S. Bergmann, E. M. Dietel, H. for Molecular Medicine, Institute for Pathology, Charite, Humboldt University of Berlin, Insitute of Pathology, Charite (Berlin) YB-1, a human member of the Y-box protein family, was previously shown to play an important role in controlling transcription of the MDR-1 gene encoding P- glycoprotein. YB-1 is significantly overexpressed in human breast cancer tissues and predicts drug resistance and patient outcome in breast cancer independent of clinically relevant tumor biologic factors HER2, uPA and PAl-1. To evaluate its impact on breast cancer development, we overexpressed YB-1 in mammary epithelial cells in transgenic mice under control of the beta-lactoglobulin promoter. Here we report that overexpression of YB-1 resulted in abnormal mammary cell proliferation including the development of metastatic mammary adenocarcino- mas. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying YB-1 induced breast car- cinogenesis we analyzed gene expression profiles in transgenic mammary glands and in metastatic breast cancer by using mouse specific cDNA filter arrays. A set of genes was identified which distinguished wild type tissue from a YB-1 transgenic mammary gland and a YB-1 induced adenocarcinoma. We conclude that YB-1 is an important factor for the development of breast cancer. The establishment of a novel animal model for breast cancer development will allow the identification of YB-1 controlled genes and other genetic events important for this process. S 54 Breast Cancer (Basic Research) P280 ANALYSIS OF THE VITAMIN D-SYSTEM IN NORMAL BREAST TISSUE AND IN BREAST CANCER M. Friedrich, T. Mitschele, W. Tilgen, W. Schmidt, J. Reichrath, Universit&tsklinken des Saarlandes Aim: In vitro studies have demonstrated that 1,25(OH)2D3 suppresses proliferation and induces differentiation in various cell types, including epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to analyze the vitamin D-system in normal breast tissue and in breast cancer to evaluate whether breast tissue possesses the capacity to produce 1,25(OH)2D3 and whether metastatic breast carcinomas may be a target for the treatment with precursors of biologically active vitamin D analogues. Method: Expression of VDR, real time PCR ( Light Cycler, 50 cycles). We used 10-fold serial dilutions of PCR products as external standards. Expression levels were determined as ratios between target gene and the reference gene GAPDH. For statistical analysis the nonparametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used. Splice variants of la-hydroxylase were using a expression of la-hydroxylase (p=0,007) and 24-hydroxylase (p=O,007) was significantly increased in breast carcinomas compared to normal breast tissue, while the expression of 25-hydroxylase was not increased (p=0,417). Both in benign and malignant breast tissue several PCR products for la-hydroxylase were detected indicating multiple variants of the la-hydroxylase gene as a result of alternate splicing. Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the first report demonstrating the expression of vitamin D-hydrylazing enzymes in normal breast tissue and in breast cancer. Interestingly the expression of la-hydroxylase end 24 hydroxylase, but not of 25- hydroxylase, was significantly increased in malignant breast tissue compared with benign breast tissue indicating the capacity to produce the biologically active vitamin D metabolite 1,25(OH)2D3. Thus, benign breast tissue and breast carcinomas are target tissues for preventive, adjuvant and palliative treatment with precursors of the biologically active vitamin D metabelites that exhibit little systemic side effects. P281 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF ESTROGEN RECEPTOR (ER) ALPHA AND BETA MESSENGER RNA IN BREAST CARCINOMAS BY REAL-TIME RT-PCR BASED ON f(3r Molekulare Medizin (Berlin) The estrogen receptors (ER) alpha and beta have been reported to be involved in growth and treatment of mammary carcinomas. There is some evidence for the importance of ER beta in carcinogenesis of breast cancer and its protective function, however, open questions still remain left. For the evaluation of disease prognosis and decision of treatment strategies it is necessary to have a valid and quantitative parameter for hormone dependency of breast cancer. It was our aim to establish a quantitative real time RT-PCR method (TaqMan) for the detection of both estrogen receptor mRNAs in breast cancer cells and tissues. For these experiments the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 (ER alpha positive) was used. Because of the very low ER beta expression, cells were transfected with an ER beta plasmid. ER alpha/ ER beta mRNA was generated by in vitro-transcription in order to obtain quantitative results. These ER RNAs with definite concentration were used to get a standard curve and to calculate the amounts of ER mRNA in the cells. The cells were treated with estradiol and tamoxifen to initiate or inhibit the ER alpha/ beta dependent transactivation of endogenous genes (pS2 and TGFa) and to observe an alteration in amounts of both ER proteins or mRNAs. The expression of ER alpha/ ER beta mRNA and protein was monitored by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot. Transfection with ER beta cDNA results in a MCF-7 cell line expressing a stable ER beta protein and mRNA at detectable levels. We could produce ER alpha/beta RNA in vitro to use it as standard for the quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The expression of ER alpha and ER beta is influenced by (anti)estrogens. We could establish a quantitative real-time RT-PCR method for the detection of ER alpha and ER beta mRNA in breast carcinoma cell lines. That method can be used for the monitoring and further comprehension of the biological function of estrogen receptors in breast cancer. P282 EXPRESSION OF TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENE MASPIN IN BREAST CANCER with tumor supressing function in breast cancer. Maspin expression was found in normal breast epithelial cells but was decreased during tumor progression. By using immunohistochem- istry and reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR the expression of maspin in breast cancer was examined. Methods A large series of archival breast tissue specimens has been examined, including normal glande (n=7), fibrocystic changes (n=128) their lymph node metastasis (n=65), using a specific monoclonal antibody. In addition, tumor specimens obtained from 45 primary breast cancer patients were analysed for maspin expression by a nested RT-PCR assay. Normal human mammary epithelial cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells function as positive respectively negative controls at the in vitro level. Recurrence free survival was evaluated and correlated to maspin expres- sion. Resuitsln epithelial cells the strongest immunohistochemical expression was found in normal breast and fibrocystic change. Significant stepwise decrease in maspin expression (p<O,OOOl) occured in the sequence DCIS-invasive cancer- lymph node metastasis. Subset of infiltrating carcinomas showed a strong maspin expression, significantly associated with a lower rate of lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis (p<O,Ol). The maspin transcript was detected in 29 (64%) breast cancer specimens whereas no expression was found in 16 (36%) cancer specimens. 6 out of 8 patients who developed distant metastasis within 2-3 years after initial diagnosis showed no maspin expression of the primary breast cancer (p<O,O5). Conclusions: Maspin expression in breast cancer is decreasing with increasing malignancy. These in vivo observation using immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase PCR are in keeping with data obtained in prior in vitro experiments. The lack of maspJn expression in breast cancer seems to be associated with a short disease free survival and supports maspin function as indicator of tumor aggressiveness and metastatic potential. P283 TUMORHYPOXIA OF T2 PRIMARY BREAST CARCINOMA IS ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVE HORMONERECEPTOR STATUS AND HIGH GRADING, G. Raab, more likely refractory to radiotherapy than non hypoxic tumors. They are also associated with a higher rate of local failure and a poor prognosis of the patients. As there is only few data about the influence of tumorhypoxia on the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy, we initiated a prospective analysis to examine the value of intratumoral oxygen tension (pC2) as prognostic and predictive factor in women with primary breast cancer prior to primary systemic chemotherapy. Method: In a first step we investigated the relationship of pC2 and tumor differentiation, hormonereceptor status and menopausal status in untreated operable T2 malignant breast tumors. All patients referred to our centre between 9/1999 and 9/2001 presenting a breast tumor between 2 and 5cm evaluated clinically or measured by ultrasound or mammography, received an ultrasound guided and documented polarographic measurement of intratumoral oxygen tension using the Eppendorf histograph (n = 180). Afterwards a high speed core cut biopsy was taken for histological evaluation. Only completely ultrasound documented pC2 measurements in malignant tumors were included for this analysis. Results: According to this criteria 71 patients were eligible. The median pC2 was unexpected low with 1,7 mmHg. 72% (n = 51) of the tumors were hypoxic (pC2 < 5mmHg). 22,5% (n = 16) tumors were hormonereceptor negative (ER and PR negative) and 34% (n = 24) were high grade. 31% (n = 22) of the patients were premenopausaL High grade differentiation in hypoxic vs. non hypoxic tumors was 35,3% vs. 25,0%. 27,5% of hormonereceptor negative tumors were hypoxic whereas 10% were non hypoxic. There was no difference between hypoxic and non hypoxic tumors concerning menopause status. Conclusion: In contrast to the literature, we found a very low median pC2 of 1,7 mmHg in primary T2 breast carcinomas. Tumorhypoxia seems to be associated with negative prognostic factors like negative homonereceptor status and high grade differentiation. Further investigation and correlation with response to primary systemic therapy will show whether tumor hypoxia is an independent prognostic factor and has some predictive value. P284 NEW CANDIDATE GENES POTENTIALLY INVOLVED IN BREAST CANCER S. Schindelmann, J. Windisch, R. Prognosis of breast cancer patients is mainly depending on the critical processes of invasion and formation of metastatic lesions by tumor cells. In an approach to find genes that are potentially involved in these processes, RNA-expression of 437 cancer-associated human genes in RNA pools from 12 invasive and 13 non-invasive mammary carcinoma-derived cell lines was analysed after hybridization to cDNA Microarrays. Differential gene expression of keratin 19, keratin 8, GOB-4, ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50 were found to be preferentially expressed by non-invasive cells whereas expression of vimentin was confirmed as a characteristic of invasive cells. Only differences in expression higher than 3-fold evident in three independent hybridization experiments were considered significant. Expression of mRNA coding for the adhesion molecule CD24 has also been quantified by real-time RT-PCR for all Jnvasive and non- invasive cell lines. CD 24 mRNA was found to be absent or weakly expressed by 9/12 (75%) invasive cell lines compared to 3/13 (23%) non-invasive cell lines. The correlation between 0D24 expression and invasiveness was calculated to be highly significant with chi^2 = 6,74 and p = 0.0094. CD24 was previously suggested to play an important role during tumor progression to more invasive phenotypes. Future analyses of primary breast carcinomas might reveal CD 24 to be a potential target for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. S 55 Breast Cancer {Basic Research) P285 INCREASED SERUM LEVELS OF SOLUBLE E-SELECTIN IN PATIENTS WITH LIVER METASTASES FROM BREAST CANCER - CORRELATIONS WITH CLINICAL AND HISTOPATHOLOGICAL FEATURES M. Eichbaum, T. de Rossi, G. Wittmann, M. Geberth, E Beldermann, A. Schneeweiss, S. Universit~.ts-Frauenklinik (Heidelberg) Background: The adhesion molecule E-Selectin is originally known as molecular agent in the early inflammatory activation of endothelium. Recently it has been demonstrated to be also associated with progression and metastasis of breast cancer. Furthermore it has been reported that especially patients suffering from liver metastases show increased serum levels of the soluble form of E-Selectin. The prognosis of patients with liver metastases from breast cancer is poor. It was the aim of this study to compare the clinical and histopathological features of the primary tumour with serum concentrations of soluble E-Selectin in patients with hepatic metastases in order to better describe the relationship between tumour biology and E-Selectin-related activation of endothelium during metastazation. Patients and Methods: We examined 69 patients with liver metastases from breast crancer who were selected to receive chemotherapy because of progressive disease (n=44) resp. new detected liver metastases (n=25). Serum concentration from soluble E-Selcetin (sES) were measured before starting the new therapy using a special ELISA test. Serum concentrations of sES were compared by several clinical parameters (age, stage of disease, DFS) as well as histopathological findings referring to the primary tumour (histology, grading, HER2/neu). Results: Patients younger than 50 years showed higher serum levels from sES compared to patients older than 50 years (85,8 ng/ml vs. 67,9 ng/ml (all 59,0 ng/ml (new liver metastases)). No differences were found between patients with positive or negative hormonal receptor status. Patients with HER2/neu- overexpressing turnouts showed significant differences in serum concentrations of ng/ml vs. liver metastases)). Grading, expression of Ki-67 and p53 were as well strongly associated with different levels of sES. Conclusions: In patients who suffer from breast cancer liver metastases the expression of E-Selectin seems to be increased with patients and tumours that show certain worse prognostic pattern (younger women, HER2/ neu-overexpression, low grade-tumours, increased expression of Ki-67 and p53). These data may indicate that agressive turnouts use the activation of endothelium for further metastastic progression more than less malignant tumour cells. P286 BONE MARROW ASPIRATIONS DURING THE FOLLOW-UP OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS MAY HELP TO DETERMINE PATIENTS' INDIVIDUAL RISK FOR RELAPSE W. Janni, B. Strobl, B. Rack, D. So far, no surrogate marker is available to evaluate the individual efficacy of adjuvant treatment in breast cancer patients before subsequent distant relapse. Detecting persisting disseminated tumor cells in the bone marrow (BM) may help to identify patients with increased risk for recurrence.Method: We analyzed bone marrow aspirates of 156 patients without evidence of recurrence at the time of primary diagnosis and a median interval of 19.8 months thereafter. Carcinoma cells were detected using a standardized immunoassay with monoclonal antibody A45-B/B3 directed against cytokeratin (CK). The average observation time was 46 months. Results: At the time of primary diagnosis, 44 of 156 patients (28 %) had a positive BM finding, while 37 (24 %) had a positive BM finding at the time of the second BM analysis. Among those patients with an initially negative BM finding, 19 patients (12 %) had a positive BM finding at the second aspiration, while 18 patients (11%) were BM-positive in both examinations. Patients with a negative BM status at the time of follow-up examination (n=119) had a significantly better overall survival than patients with a positive BM status at the time of the second BM aspiration (n=37), both by univariate analysis (P = .0014, Log-rank) and multivariate analysis (P = .003, Cox Regression).Conclusion: A considerable number of breast cancer patients remain BM-positive suggesting failure of primary therapy and risk of subsequent development of distant disease. P287 SUPPLEMENTARY CYTOTOXICITY OF EPIRUBICIN AND DOCETAXEL IN BREAST CANCER CELLS IN VITRO DEPENDENT are the most active cytotoxic agents in the treatment of breast cancer and combination therapy with both compounds is considered to produce the highest response rates in the neoadjuvant and palliative settings. Data from a prospective clinical trial (SABCS 2000, A23) showed that the overexpression of HER2 is possibly an independent predictive parameter for achieving a pathological complete response after administration of epirubicin, docetaxel, and G-CSF. To investigate the underlying mechanism of action, we tested three cell lines differing in their HER2 expression.Methods: After western blotting of the HER2 antigen, the cytotoxicity of epirubicin or docetaxe] monotherapy or combination was evaluated in the three breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 (HER2 using could demonstrate that breast cancer cells overexpressing HER2 (SKBR 3) showed the most cell lines with low concentrations of both cytotoxic agents for 72 hours, we demonstrated that incubation with docetaxel did not change the cytotoxicity of epirubicin, but incubation with epirubicin sensitized the tumor cells by a factor of 3,5 to docetaxel. Conclusion: These results provide in part a rationale for the clinical observation of the synergistic cytotoxic effect of epirubicin and docetaxel depending on the HER2-status. However, the cytotoxicity combining epirubicin and docetaxel in vitro in relation to the HER2-status and the possibly addtional effect of the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor as a modulating agent has to be investigated in further evaluations. P288 LEPTIN RECEPTOR AND INDUCIBLE NITRIC OXIDE SYNTHASE (INOS) ARE IN BREAST CANCER MASTOPATHIA U. (Dresden) Obesity is associated with increased serum leptin levels and is an independent risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer. Leptin is expressed in malignant epithelial cells of the breast. Leptin is known to be a promoter of angiogenesis. Nitric oxide pathway appears to play a key role in tumour angiogenesis. Aim of the study was to characterize the expression of leptin receptor and iNOS in breast cancer epithelial cells and benign breast tissue by immunocytochemistry. Methods: 20 invasive ductal carcinomas (2 grade I, 5 grade II, 13 grade III ) and 9 mastopathias were stained by using antibodies against the long (functional) form of the leptin receptor and iNOS. Controll sections with no primary antibody showed no staining. Results: Leptin receptor expression could be detected in 55 % of malignant turnouts. In 66 % of the mastopathic tissue leptin receptor expression could also be shown. No differences in expression of leptin receptor could be seen in benign and malignant breast tissue, iNOS immunoreactivity was also expressed in epithelial cells of the tumour (65 % of malignant and 66 % of benign breast tissue). In 9 benign tumours (mastopathia) was a high correlation of leptin receptor expression and iNOS (78%). In the malignant tumours only a weak association of iNOS and leptin receptor (45%) could be found. In two of three of the examined benign and malignant breast tissues with demonstrated leptin receptor expression iNOS immunoreactivity was present. Conclusions: Leptin receptor and iNOS are present in benign and malignant breast tumours, iNOS might be involved in mediating leptin effects in breast cancer. P289 ENDOTHELIAL (E) NITRIC OXIDE SYNTHASE (NOS) IN PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY BREAST CANCER S. Loibl, G. von Minckwitz, C. Strank, A. Buck, H.-P. Sinn, K. Strebhardt, M. Kaufmann, Universit~.tsfrauenklinik (Frankfurt am Main, Heidelberg) Purpose: Former studies of e-NOS and i-NOS in breast cancer patients have revealed controversy results. Previous studies of our group demonstrated with a small sample size that patients with e-NOS positive turnouts might have a more favourable prognosis than e-NOS negative patients. Method: 163 patients with primary breast cancer who have had primary surgery in Frankfurt between 1995 and 1998 have been included in our study. We performed immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of paraffin embedded tissue for e-NOS using a monoclonal antibody. Human umbilical cord was used as positive control. The staining of the IHC was scored from 0-4 (0: negative and 1-4: positive). Correlation with prognostic factors was performed. Results: The median age at the time of operation was 55y (31-88y). 39% were premenopausal whereas tumour size was 2cm; 40.5% of the patients had an involvement of the axillary lymph nodes. 84% of the turnouts were hormone receptor positive. 38% of the tumours stained negative for e-NOS; 62% stained positive with most positive tumours having a weak or medium staining for e-NO& The median time of follow up is 39 months, with 46 (28%) patients having a local recurrence or metastatic disease. A negative correlation of e-NOS with the receptor status was found (p=0.031). Conclusion: These studies on 163 patients demonstrate for the first time a negative correlation of e-NOS with the receptor status. The role of e-NOS in breast cancer is not yet defined. P290 EFFECT OF ANTHRACYCLINE-BASED PRIMARY CHEMOTHERAPY ON DISSEMINATED TUMOR CELLS AND CLINICAL RESPONSE IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS C. J~.ger, A. Kafka, J. Windisch, R. R. Kreienberg, UniversitAt UIm (UIm) Objective The leading cause of death from epithelial cancer is metastatic tumor relapse due to early dissemination of tumor cells. We evaluated whether primary, anthracycline- containing chemotherapy in locally advanced non-metastatic breast cancer can eliminate cytokeratin-positive cells in bone marrow. Furthermore we investigated the clinical response of the pr'imary lesion under preoperative chemotherapy. Methods From June 2000 to September 2001, 38 patients underwent primary anthracycline containing chemotherapy in breast cancer. For immunocytochemical tumor cell detection in bone marrow we used the monoclonal antibody 5D3 (Biogenex) which is directed against common epitope on cytokeratin polypeptides, including cytokeratin 8/18/19. S 56 Breast Cancer (Basic Research) Results 29 patients were included. 11/29 (33%) had tumor cells in bone marrow at time of diagnosis. 8/29 (24%) were tested positive after primary chemotherapy. Concerning the effect of preoperative chemotherapy on tumorsize, 13/29 had a no change situation, 13/29 a partial remission, 1/29 progressive disease, 2/29 a histopathologic complete remission. In the patient suffering from progressive disease the tumor cell count in bone marrow increased 20fold after chemotherapeutic treatment. Primary chemotherapeutic regimen was stopped in this patient and surgery was performed. 6 weeks later metastases in bone, lung and lymphnodes were detected. Both patients who had a histopathologic complete remission were tested positive for tumor cells in bone marrow before treatment; after therapy 1 patient was tested negative for tumor cells in bone marrow whereas the other was still positive. Conclusion We conclude that the detection of tumor cells in bone marrow of breast cancer patients is a parameter of dissemination of the disease. Primary chemotherapy seemed not to be capable to reduce the burden of disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow. One reason for that could be that these tumor cells rest in dormancy (G0-stade). Future studies must reveal whether there is any prognostic value for the behaviour of tumor cells in bone marrow under primary chemotherapy. P291 ISOLATION OF NATIVE BMP-3, A PUTATIVE INHIBITOR OF BMP-2, FROM THE BREAST CANCER CELL LINE A. KQhnemund, P. Hortschansky, M. member of the TGF-beta superfamily. Recently, Daluiski et al. (2001) reported, that BMP-3 might be an inhibitor of other BMPs via an activin receptor mediated signal transduction pathway. Additionally, it is proposed, that recombinant BMP-3 is not able to induce classic functions of BMPs like endochondral bone formation. In this study, we analysed various human breast cancer cell lines for the expression of BMP-3, isolated native BMP-3 and further characterized it. Methods: Expression of BMP-3 was estimated by RT-POR. BMP-3 was purified from SK-BR-3 supernatants and cell lysates by affinity chromatography using a polyclonal antibody directed against BMP-3 (H-73; Santa Cruz). Purified native BMP-3 was characterized by western blot analysis with other polyclonal antibodies (N-19, C-20; Santa Cruz) in comparison to recombinant BMP-3. Results: RT-PCR analysis revealed that BMP-3 is clearly expressed in the breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3, but in none of the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, BT- 20, BT-474, MDA-MB-453, T-47D. Therefore, we decided to use SK-BR-3 for purification of native BMP-3. A BMP-3-specific antibody was covalently immobilized on NHS-sepharose columns and supernatant from serum-free SK-BR-3 cultures as well as cell lysates from SK-BR-3 cells were loaded on the columns. Bound BMP-3 was eluted with an acidic glycine-buffer (pH 2). An aliquot of the BMP-3 preparations were subjected to Western blot analysis and detected with another BMP-3-specific antibody. We were able to purify large amounts of BMP-3 from cell lysates. To obtain significant quantities of secreted BMP-3 larger volumes of supernatant medium from SK-BR-3 cells will be necessary. Conclusion: We could show, that SK-BR-3 cells are a suitable source for the purification of native BMP-3. Although SK-BR-3 cells secrete BMP-3 we found that most of the protein is retained inside the cells. Daluiski, A., et al. Nat Genet, 27, 84-88. (2001). P292 DNA REPAIR GENES AND BREAST CANCER RISK B. Kuschel, A. Auranen, GB; Erlangen)lntroduction: Less than 2% of all breast cancer cases is due to mutations in the two major susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. An understanding of multiple lower penetrance alleles will be neces- sary to fully define genetic breast cancer susceptibility in the general population. Materials and Methods: In a British population-based case-control series (-2000 breast cancer cases and -1000 controls) we performed association studies by identifying and analysing pelymorphisms of potential functional significance in DNA-double strand repair genes. We studied genes within the homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways in which breast cancer susceptibility proteins as BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATM are now known to participate. Results: In HR we have identified a polymorphism in XRCC3 (T241M) which appears to contribute to an increased risk of breast cancer close to an ATPase activity domain and might have functional significance. Other polymorphisms in XRCC3 [A4541G, A17893G] are not associated with a significantly increased risk. Nor are Rad51 variants [G135C and G172T] Rad50, XRCC4 and Ligase IV have been studied so far and non of these variants have a significant effect on breast cancer risk. Discussion: Our results suggest that XRCC3 may be a potential modifier of breast cancer risk. Additional studies will be required to elucidate the biological basis for this association. P293 BMP2 ENHANCES INVASIVE PROPERTIES AND MODULATES PROTEOLYTIC ACTIVITY OF BREAST CANCER CELL LINES A. Geyer, I. Wenz, T. Kroll, P. Hortschansky, A. Naumann, Protein 2), a member of the TGF-beta superfamily of growth factors, regulates various genes in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in a time - dependant manner, e.g. the helix-loop-helix transcription factors ID1, ID2 and ID3 (1). Additionally BMP2 acts as a chemoatractant as well as a stimulus for invasion on these cell line. In this study we extended our investigations to other cell lines and perform initial experiments in order to elucidate responsible factors for the observed effects. Methods: We performed transwell-experiments with the breast cancer cell lines BT-20, BT-474, MCF-7, SK-BR-3 and T-47D in the presence concentration of recombinant human BMP2 (1-250 ng/ml). Furtheron, cultures from the above mentioned cell lines were incubated with 50 ng/ml rhBMP2 for 5 hours an then transferred to Boyden Chambers in order to analyse the invasive properties. Finally, MCF-7 cells were analysed for the expression of proteases and their inhibitors with a specially designed filter array after a 5-hour incubation with 50 ng/ml BMP2. Results: We could show that a maximal number of breast cancer cells migrate through the transwell membranes at a concentration of 50 ng/ml BMP2. The in vitro invasiveness of BMP2-treated cells was significantly enhanced after 1.5 to 2.5 hours in comparison to untreated cells. Additionally, the BMP2 effect was cell line specific (T-47D, MCF-7, BT-474>BT-20>SK-BR-3). Finally, the expression of Cathepsins unter the influence of BMP2. Conclusion: BMP2 enhances the migratory and invasive properties of breast cancer cell lines in a concentration-, time- and cell line dependant manner. BMP2 modulates the expression profiles of proteases and their inhibitors which might contribute to the observed in vitro invasive properties of MCF-7 cells.

Schwalbe, C. Gansau, M. R6der, N. Buske, M. Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universit~.t (Jena, Berlin, Greifswald) Aim: Disseminated tumor cells are the origin of distal metastases of solid tumors at various sites. There is growing evidence that detection of these cells in the bone marrow and the peripheral blood seems to indicate poorer prognosis. There- fore it is important to detect and eliminate disseminated tumor cells. In this study, we analysed the interaction of magnetic core/carboxymethyl-dextran nanoparticles with established tumor cell lines and with leukocytes. Methods: The breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, and core/carboxyme- thyl-dextran nanoparticles, whereby the average magnetite/maghemite core TEM- size varied between 3 and 15nm. Corresponding PCS-hydrodynamic diameters of the core/shell particles of 40 to 150nm were observed. The degree of carboxy- substitution was in the magnitude of 0.8-1.6. Magnetic nanoparticles were used either for long term cultivation in order to test biocompatibility or with and without leucocytes isolated from healthy donors. With the latter approach we investigated the dependance of the nanoparticle-cell interaction on the coating reagent, the pH, the salt concentration and the cell type. Cells were separated by MACS and analysed by FACS and epithel-antigen specific MCF-7 with carboxymethyl dextran-coated nanoparticles revealed, that the cells incorporate the nanoparticles and that even after 28 days a significantly higher subset of cells was separable by MACS in comparison to untreated cells. Comparing different cell lines, MCF-7 and K-562 showed a higher degree of interaction with magnetic nanoparticles than leucocytes from peripheral blood (85% versus 35%). This was also observed after mixing tumor cells with leucocytes (ratio 1:99 - 17:83). Finally, we found, that the amount of separable cells is affected by the ionic strength of the solvent, but not by the pH (range 6.8 - 7.4). Conclusions: We could show that carboxymethyl dextran coated magnetic nanoparticles are biocompatible and interact preferrably with tumor cells in con- trast to leucocytes derived from peripheral blood. We suggest that this selective interaction may be used for separation of circulating tumor cells from peripheral blood.This work was supported by the IN BREAST CELL LINE MCF-7 M. Lichtenberg, P. Hortschansky, morphogenetic proteins play akey role in vertebrate embryogenesis and organ development. There is growing evidence that these factors are also important regulators in adult tissue metabolism. Recently, we could show that BMP2 is able to regulate the expression of various genes in the breast cancer cell S 57 Breast Cancer {Basic Research) line MCF-7. In this study, we asked whether the BMP2 dependant signaling could be modulated. Methods: MCF-7 cell cultures were incubated with rekombinant human BMP2 (rhBMP2) for defined periods (5 - 60 rain) followed by a cultivation under serum- free conditions. After 24 hours cells were harvested and monitored for the expression of ID genes using RT-PCR. Furtheron, MCF-7 cells were incubated with rhBMP2 and the recombinant extracellular domain of the BMP receptor IA (eBMPRIA). Finally, the effect of cycloheximide and actinomycin D on the expression of ID genes was tested in the presence of rhBMP2 with and without eBMPRIA. Results: We could show, that an incubation time of 10 minutes is sufficient to induce the BMP2 dependant regulation of ID gene expression. The BMP2 effect was efficiently blocked by eBMPRIA with a stocheometry of 1:2. Actinomycin D inhibited the BMP2-dependant regulation of ID genes with the exception of ID3. Cycloheximide was not able to suppress the BMP2 effect. Conclusions: Even short time application of BMP2 was sufficient to upregulate ID gene expression. The extracellular domain of BMP receptor IA is a potent inhibitor of BMP2 signaling. The suppression of transcription disrupts the BMP2 effect on ID gene expression with the exception of ID3, whereas de novo protein synthesis does not affect the BMP2-dependant ID gene expression.

Kristiansen, C, Pilarsky, H. L. Essers, B. E. Dahl, metaGen Pharmaceuticals GmbH, Institut for Pathologie, Charite (Berlin) Candidates for novel tumor suppressor genes have been identified as differen- tially expressed in gynecological carcinomas by analyzing four million ESTs with software tools developed at metaGen Pharmaceuticals. The selected genes are validated on the RNA and protein level to confirm the in silico expression data. One of the candidate genes, bn42, encodes a secreted regulator of the Wnt pathway. The dysregulation of the Writ signaling pathway is known to play a role in cancer development. Among the target genes of this pathway are the known oncogenes c-myc and cyclinDl, bn42 is abundantly expressed on the RNA level in many human tissues, the strongest expression is observed in heart, kidney and mammary gland. The chromosomal localization of bn42 on the short arm of chromosome 8 is a site of frequent alterations in various tumors including spo- radic breast carcinoma. The bn42 mRNA transcript is specifically down-regulated in a breast tumors. Hybridization of RNA from microdissected normal and tumor tissues to a custom designed Affymetrix chip revealed a two-fold down-regula- tion of bn42 in 60% of the examined breast carcinomas. A down-regulation on the protein level was observed in breast tumor cell lines. We are currently analyzing the protein expression of bn42 in breast cancer patients by immunohistochemis- try on paraffin sections of 100 breast tumors. Strong immunostaining is detected in epithelial, myo-epithelial and endothelial cells of normal mammary tissue. Preliminary results suggest a lower expression in breast tumor tissue compared to normal breast tissue of the same patient. Future experiments will include functional studies to evaluate the anti-proliferative potential of bn42 after forced expression in established human tumor cell lines. The presented study is a research project within the gynecological cancer consor- tium SIALOPROTEIN II BY ANTISENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDES ADDS TO THE ANTI-CLONOGENIC EFFECT OF THE ALKYLPHOSPHOCHOLINE ERPC3 IN MDA-MB231 HUMAN BREAST CANCER CELLS H. (Heidelberg) Osteopontin (OPN) and bone sialoprotein II (BSPII) have been related to the occurrence of bone metastasis in breast cancer patients. In an approach to determine their importance in bone metastasis more precisely, we developed various phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) directed against the two genes. From a selection of ten variants each, those congeners where selected which were most active in reducing the respective protein expression after exposure in vitro. In order to further characterise these ASOs we tested their potential ability to inhibit the colony formation of MDA-MB 231 human breast cancer cells in vitro and used the alkylphosphocholine erucylphospho-N.N.N-trimethyl-propanolamine (ErPC3) as positive control as well as combination partner. As expected, exposure to ErPC3 inhibited the colony formation of MDA-MB 231 cells in a concentration dependent manner by 11% (10pM), 45% (14pM), and bone sialoprotein II (ASO-BSPII) were also effective. CIonogenicity of breast cancer cells was reduced by 15% (5pM), 39% (10pM), and 46% (20pM) 19% ErPC3 with the ASO-OPN resulted in colony Similarly, combination of ErPC3 with the ASO -BSPII caused reduction in clonogenic growth -BSPll). When comparing the observed inhibition effects of the combination partners with those expected, the combination effect could be assessed as additive.In conclusion, the observation that ASOs directed against osteopontin and bone sialoprotein I] can aid in inhibiting the colony growth of human breast cancer cells is new and warrants further investigation. P298 CIRCULATING HER-2/NEU, TUMOR TYPE M2 PYRUVATE KINASE AND signal transduction pathways are in the focus of interest for therapeutic interventions. The transmembrane oncoprotein HER-2/neu shows tyrosine kinase activity leading to phosphorylation and activation of numerous second messenger systems. One target of phosphorylation processes is assumed to be the tumor type M2 isoenzyme of the pyruvate kinase (TuM2-PK) which has been shown to be elevated in metastatic breast cancer. Material and methods: We measured the plasma levels of HER-2/neu, TuM2-PK and tyrosine-phosphorylated TuM2-PK (p-TuM2-PK) in 60 patients (pts) with advanced breast cancer (ABC) and correlated the levels to each other and to the classical tumor marker CA27.29 level. Samples were measured with ELISA assays while CA27.29 was determined with an automated chemiluminescence assay (Bayer Diagnostics, Tarrytown, USA, and Schebo Biotech, Giessen, Germany). For analysis, we formed 5 subgroups according to the HER-2/neu levels (group 1: < 15 n=4). Results: In all 5 HER-2/neu subgroups, there was a statistically significant, positive correlation between HER-2/neu and CA27.29 with the medians increasing from 35.6 U/ml to 1095.8 U/ml from group 1 to group 5 (p<0.004). There was also a trend for increasing TuM2-PK levels with increasing HER-2/neu levels (p=0.059). From the lowest extinction value (0.088) to the highest extinction value (2.167) of p-TuM2-PK, we found a 25-fold increase which was reproducible proving that TuM2PK is phosphorylated at tyrosine residues to a certain extent. However, there was no correlation between the serum HER-2/neu level and the level of p-TuM2-PK, Conclusions: The tumor isoenzyme TuM2-PK is phosphorylated at tyrosine residues in certain patients with metastatic breast cancer. Using the shed antigen of HER-2/neu in serum as surrogate marker, we did not find any evidence that this phosphorylation is initiated by the oncogene HER-2/neu. P299 FOLLOW-UP OF PATIENTS WITH DCIS OF THE BREAST EVALUATION OF PROGNOSTIC ED.Vogl, I.B. Runnebaum, R. Kreienberg International University of Freiburg (UIm, Lyon (F), Freiburg) Objectives: Patients with DClS of the breast are at high risk of recurrent disease and are subject to regular screening after primary surgery. The aim of this follow- up study was to determine the clinical outcome of patients diagnosed with DClS and to evaluate molecular markers with a potential prognostic value. Methods: 38 patients (mean age 55+13 yrs.) diagnosed with DCIS between August 1993 and March 1997 were followed for up to 95 months (median 36.5 months). Tumor size was measured and immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) of p53 and c- erbB2 were performed, in serum, presence of p53 autoantibodies (AAb) and fragments of c-erbB2 oncoprotein were determined using ELISA. Results: 26 patients remained free of disease during follow-up. Three patients (8%) developed an ipsilateral and one patient (3%) a contralateral recurrence of DClS. Eight patients (21%) were diagnosed with invasive cancer, one of whom after having had masteotomy. The median time until cancer diagnosis was 40 months (range 11 to 69 months).p53 IHC positivity and p53 AAb in serum were found more often in patients who experienced recurrence of disease compared to the disease-free group. These markers suggested an increased risk for recurrence, but the estimated risk ratios were not significant (p53 IHC: RR 2.67, 95% CI 0.52- 17.21; p53 0.33-16.18). Tumor diameter and c-erbB2 IHC were not associated with an increased risk for recurrence of disease. Values of c- erbB2 fragments seemed to be lower in serum of patients with relapse, however the difference was not significant. Conclusion: We observe a high incidence of recurrent disease, particularly of invasive cancer, after treatment for DClS. p53 seems to be a molecular marker associated with the risk of recurrence of DClS or invasive cancer, but due to the small sample size our study could not reach statistical significance. Larger studies may identify molecular alterations that could help the clinician to predict clinical outcome and develop adequate treatment strategies. P300 SERUM LEVELS OF THE OSTEOPROTECTIVE PROTEIN OSTEOPROTEGERIN IN DIFFERENT STAGES OF BREAST CANCER D. L0ftner, A. Dieing, A. Grosse, M. Fenner, J. inhibiting, osteoprotective factor osteoprotegerin (OPG) is just being placed into the focus of scientific interest as marker of bone metabolism in benign - and cancer-induced bone disease. We investigated this protein in 2 patient subgroups (breast cancer patients without evidence of disease; stage IV breast cancer patients with osseous involvement) to test for distribution, age-dependent variations and to establish a (putative) cut-off of normal,Material and methods: Serum OPG standardized ELISA assay (Immundiagnostik AG, Bensheim, Germany). Serum samples were taken from 78 breast cancer patients without evidence of disease and 65 stage IV breast cancer S 58 Breast Cancer (Basic Research) patients right at the time of the first diagnosis of metastatic spread to bone before initiation of bisphosphonate therapy. Results: The natural logarithm of OPG (InOPG) followed a normal distribution. The mean OPG serum values were 51 pg/ml (InOPG= 3.75; s = 0.63) and 63.6 pg/ml (InOPG= 4.02; s = 0.53) for patients without evidence of disease and patients with metastatic spread to bone, respectively. There was no difference in age distribution between the patient subgroups with a mean age of 55.8 years and 58.0 years (p=0.25) for after-care patients and stage IV patients, respectively. Serum OPG increased slightly with age within both groups (p=0.01 each; Pearson's correlation coefficient in 2-sided test). ROC analyses between the subgroups did not indicate any cut-off of normal which would help to separate these subgroups or indicate a risk subgroup for (early) osseous metastatic involvement. Conclusions: Serum OPG levels increase slightly with progressing age. After-care breast cancer patients without evidence of relapse don't show different serum OPG levels as compared to stage iV breast cancer patients with bone metastases. This indicates that breast cancer patient generally show an increased bone turnover being postmenopausal (naturally or after chemically-induced castration), irrespective of the stage of the disease. Subanalyses within the stage IV subgroup according to severity of bone spread, osteolytic/osteoplastic pattern and response to specific therapy may reveal a predictive and/or monitoring quality of the marker. P301 PREVENTATIVE BISPHOSPHONATE TREATMENT PRESERVES BONE MICROSTRUCTURE IN EXPERIMENTAL BREAST CANCER BONE METASTASIS A. are an established treatment of bone metastases. They are able to reduce the number of skeletal complications by inhibiting osteoclast mediated bone destruction. Investigations into the use of bisphosphonates are now directed to understand the effects of a preventative treatment on tumor osteolysis. The 3-D microstructure of bone is one factor influencing its mechanical behavior. In the present experimental study, we investigated the effect of a preventative application of a bisphosphonate on the 3-D microstructure of bone in a rat model for tumor-induced osteolysis. Method: \"45 SD rats were randomly assigned to three study groups. In the (T)-group, Walker 256 tumor cells were implanted into the left femur without treatment. The (PT0-group first underwent a pretreatment with Ibandronate (0.003 mg P/kg/d), then tumor cells were implanted and treatment was continued. The (TI)-group received Ibandronate treatment only after tumor-cell implantation. Micro computed tomographic (IJCT) was used to analyze Bone Mineral Content and architectural parameters in the femur metaphyes. Bone volume density (BV/TV), trabecular (Tb.Sp) were calculated. ANOVA with SNK post-hoc analysis was performed to determine if the measurements differed significantly (p<0.05). Results: The IJCT analysis revealed greater values for BMC in the PTI group and TI group compared to the T group. BV/ TV was significantly higher in the PTI and TI groups compared to the T group by 133% and 106%, respectively. These results are most likely due to an significant increase in Tb.Th in the PTI and the TI group compared to the T group by 211% and 95%, respectively. Additionally, Tb.Sp decreased in the PTI and TI group compared to the T group by -74% and -73%, respectively. PTI values were 13% greater for BV/TV and 60% for Tb.Th compared to TR Discussion: This study demonstrated that Ibandronate given as a combination of preventative and interventional treatment bone mass and the 3-D structur in tumor-osteolysis. Compared to the interventional control group a more beneficial effect on density parameters and trabecular thickness was found. In conclusion, although both treatment schedules resulted in significantely greater bone mass and structural parameters compared to no treatment, preventative treatment provides the best protection against tumor- mediated osteolysis. P302 HORMONAL U. Shihada, R. Gust, Universit~.t Berlin (Berlin) Combination of the antitumor drug cisplatin with the hormonal active meso-l,2- bis(2,6-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylenediamine led to complex 1, which shows high estrogenic effects in vitro and in vivo. HO'~Cl CI~I~IOH CI H2N,, .NH2 CI i/Pt-. I However, the antiproliferative effects are nearly lost, which could be the result of a strong interaction with the ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER), which prevents Pt-DNA interactions.To enhance the cytotoxicity without loss of ER binding, we modified the ethylenediamine ligand. If the complex 1 is superimposed with estradiol (E2) one ring is oriented analogously to the 118 position. Since hydrophobic alkyl chains in 11B position of E2 enhance receptor binding affinity, as already shown by Katzenellenbogen[1], we exchanged one phenyl ring by alkyl chains. Furthermore the hydroxy groups - normally essential for receptor binding of this platinum complexes[2] - were protected as methyl ethers.The interactions with the ER were studied in a competition experiment with [3H]-estradiol and in a luciferase assay on MCF7-2a cells. Antiproliferative effects were determined at the human estrogen independent MDA-MB-231 and the estrogen dependent MCF7 breast cancer cell line. Both, the exchange of phenyl by alkyl and the protection of the hydroxy functions, reduce the receptor binding and increase the antiproliferative potency. The methoxyphenyl-alkyl platinum complexes lost their estrogenic potency, but these novel [1-(2,6-dichloro-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-alkylethylenediamine]diiodoplatinum(ll) complexes possess an even cytotoxicity than Napolitano, R. Chem. 38, 429-434 (1995).[2] R. Gust, V. Lubczyk, K. Schmidt, U. Shihada Arch. Pharm. Med. Chem. 334, 93-100 (2001). P303 GENERATION AND EXPANSION OF HER2 - REACTIVE T CELL CLONES IN A PATIENT WITH HER2-OVEREXPRESSING BREAST CANCER FOR ADOPTIVE IMMUNOTHERAPY C. Hermann, B. Schmidt, D. Busch, E. Schulz, H. C. overexpressed in a variety of cancers (breast, cervix, ovary, stomach, lung, pancreas). Overexpression in breast cancer is associated with a worse prognosis. Her2 is a transmembrane protein, consisting of 1260 amino acids and shows a high degree of homology to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Several peptides have been defined that bind to HLA-A2-molecules and are able to induce specific T ceils, capable of lysing peptide pulsed T2-cells or Her2 overexpressing tumor cell lines Peptides are derived from the intracellular (ELVSEFSRM), transmembrane (IISAWGIL) and extracellular (VLRENTSPK) domain of Her2. Here we describe the in vitro generation and expansion of Her2-specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL) - clones derived from a patient with Her2-overexpressing breast cancer. METHODS: Mature dendritic cells were pulsed with Her2 derived peptides and used for stimulating autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HLA-A2 positive healthy donors and breast cancer patients. Following several weekly restimulations CD8+/Tetramer+ T cells were sorted, cloned and further expanded. RESULTS: Baseline frequencies of CD8+/Tetramer+ Her2-specific T cells were < 0,01% of all PBMC. In a Her2-overexpressing breast cancer patient after 2 restimulations the frequencies of Her2-ECD specific T cells had increased to 0,04% of PBMC. These cells were sorted and cloned using allogeneic PBMC, EBV-B-celIs, anti-CD3 and IL2. T for lysis of peptide pulsed T2 cells and specific clones were further expanded. The calculated yield after 3 rounds of expansions was > lx1010 cells per clone, a number sufficient for several cycles of adoptive immunotherapy. The expanded CTL efficiently cell line (SKOV3-tA2). The generation of clones against epitopes from all 3 domains of Her2 from both, HLA-A2+ healthy donors and patients is currently underway. A program of adoptive transfer of CTL is initiated. CONCLUSIONS: Her2-specific CTL can be generated from patients with Her2- overexpressing breast cancer. Tetramer guided sorting of in vitro primed T cells allows early cloning of low-frequency specific CTL. The in vitro expansion of the tumorreactive T cell clones yields cell numbers sufficient for adoptive immunotherapy in patients with Her2 overexpressing carcinomas. P304 PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH (PCD) AS A SIGN OF THERAPY RESPONSE OF CIRCULATING TUMOUR CELLS IN BREAST CANCER B. Willen, K. Pachmann, U. Pachmann, TZB Bayreuth (Bayreuth) In breast cancer patients monitoring of therapy has so far been possible only by statistical anaylsis of relapse free survival after several years. Monitoring of the response of circulating tumour cells is now available using the MAINTRAC analysis (magnetic bead enrichment and immunofluorimetric detection of cells in blood expressing the human epithelial antigen).Combining this minimally invasive method with early detection of apoptosis by the tunel assay allows not only a quantitative but also a qualitative estimate of tumour response to therapy. Staining of tumour cells for the epithelial antigen was combined with incorporation of fluorescent nucleotides to fragmented DNA using terminal deoxynucleotidyitransferase, marking a point of no return in cell decay. We could show that thus sensitivity for the efficiency of chemo-, radio- or immunotherapy, was increased and induction of apoptosis preceded the decrease in cell number. This enables an even more precise tailoring of treatment of the individual patient Results can be photodocumented and stored and slides can be archived for additional subse- quent analysis of other markers if necessary S 59 Breast Cancer IBasic Research) P305 IMAGING OF NEOADJUVANT TREATED BREAST CANCER BY FLT-PET B. Smyczek-Gargya, B. M. Dohmen, U. Krainick, of FLT-PET for imaging and follow-up of breast cancer and to compare FLT uptake with morphobiological parameter. Patients and Method: Thirteen breast cancer patients (one with bilateral carcinoma) had a (18F)FLT-PET. 6/13 patients received neoadjuvant treatment with adriamycin/ Doxetacel. A simultaneous FDG-PET was performed in six patients. The FLT uptake was compared with morphobiological parameters (MIB-1, hormone receptor, cerb-B2, bcl2, p53). Results: An increased FLT uptake (SUV 4.8_+1.5) was detected in 13/14 tumors, one carcinoma was missed with a diameter of 5mm, Axillary lymph node metastases were detected in 9/13 patients (SUV 5.0_+4.0). One micrometastases showed no fokal FLT uptake. Two patients with sonographically suspected lymph node metastases revealed a negative FLT scan. The corresponding histology of surgical specimen was also node negative. A decrease in FLT uptake (21-83%) was seen after the first cycle of chemotherapy, which was followed by morphological changes of size. All tumors and their metastases were also imaged by FDG-PET, although tumor contrast to normal breast was weaker in comparison with FLT- PET. No correlation was found between SUV and morphobielogical parameters, including MIB-I. Conclusions: All primary tumors as well as their lymph node metastases showed increased FLT accumulation. For neoadjuvant treated patients, FLT-PET might become a staging method for axillary metastases. The early reduction of FLT uptake, which proceede morphological changes, may provide a basis for FLT-PET as follow-up method to assess early therapy response. P306 4,5-BIS(2-CHLORO-4-HYDROXYPHENYL)-2-1MIDAZOLINES: LIGANDS FOR THE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR WITH A NEW BINDING MODE M. yon Rauch, R. Gust, Freie Universit~t Bedin (Berlin) Tests on 4,5-bis(2-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-imidazolines in a competition experiment with [3H]-estradiol led to different results compared with those in a luciferase-assay on the MCF7-2a cells. While the 2-imidazolines are not able to displace estradiol (E2) from its binding site at the estrogen receptor (ER), they activate gene transcription in the cell-based assay.ill Therefore, we presume that the 2-imidazolines achieve hormonal activity through different interactions with the ER than E2. Instead of forming a hydrogen bond to Hie524, the 2-imidazolines seem to interact with Asp351 (Asp351 is not involved in the binding of E2 to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the ER).[2] Since Asp351 is knowrf as an important anchor for the binding of ,,Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators\" (SERM), like tamoxifen and raloxifeae, we tried to convert the 2-imidazolines into SERM. Therefore, we introduced basic side chains, like those of tamoxifen and raloxifene, in the 4,5-bis(2-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-imidazoline. We also tried to increase estrogenic activity by alkylation of the 2-imidazeline ring. [1] Gust, M., 753- 757 (1997) P307 MUTATION DETECTION IN FAMILIAL AND SPORADIC BREAST CANCERS BY DHPLC (DENATURING HIGH-PERFORMANCE B. is a recently developed method for mutation detection that gains in importance as a screening method in diagnostic routine examinations (analysing familial breast cancers for BRCA1/2 mutations) and in context with scientific questions (analysing TSG's and SNP's in heterogeneous tumor material). Reliability of this method as well as limits and the possibility to raise the sensitivity of mutation detection are discussed. Methods: DHPLC was established for mutation detection in BRCA1/2 diagnostic, using more than 200 different positive controls. Up to now 93 DNA samples from patients with familial background for breast cancer (BC) were analysed by DHPLC for BRCA1/2 mutations. Additional 136 sporadic BC were examined for p53 mutations analysing exons 5-8 by DHPLC. Positive results were confirmed by direct DNA-sequencing. Results: The reliability of DHPLC in BRCA1/2 mutation detection could be confirmed by analysing more than 200 positiv controls. The detection of mutations lying in high melting domains can be critical (BRCA1 exon 5: T300G). Nevertheless a sensitivity over 95% can be achieved. The analysis of 93 DNA samples from patients with familial background for BC revealed a number of mutations and unclassified variants (UVs). 23 different p53 mutations could be detected in 138 sporadic BC. Dilution of mutant DNA by wild-type DNA revealed the high sensitivity of this method: 5% mutant DNA are sufficient to achieve a positive DHPLC result. Thus microdissection of tumor material seems to be unnecessary. However confirming a positive DHPLC result by DNA-sequencing is difficult in heterogeneous tumor material. This problem can be solved by sequencing only the heteroduplex fragments after seperation from the hemoduplex fragments by DHPLC. Conclusion: DHPLC is a reliable high throughput technique for mutation detection in familial breast cancers as well as in heterogeneous tumor material. Due to a sensitivity over 95% this method is comparable to direct DNA-eequencing in mutation detection. P308 FGF-2 AND HEPARANSULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN INTERACTIONS IN BREAST A. (FGF-2) is a potent angiogenic stimulator. Binding of FGF-2 to its receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and cellular signaling (HSPGs) via their heparin-like heparan sulfate(HS) side chains. HS can be specific positive or negative regulators of FGF signaling depending on their ability to bind to both FGF ligand and RTK. Aim:The goal of this study was to localize different cell surface HSPGs in breast cancer and normal breast tissue and to examine their roles in EGF signaling. Material and Methods:HSPGs were detected immunohistochemically on paraffin embedded tissues using antibodies directed against the HSPG core proteins of Glypican-1, Syndeean-1 and Syndecan-4. Th.e ability of HSPGs to promote FGF- 2 signaling complex assembly was tested by using a FGF-2 ligend and a soluble RTK fusion protein (FR1-AP) as binding probes. Results: HSPGs are induced in the stroma of infiltrating carcinomas in a striking tissue compartment and cell type specific fashion. Syndecan-4 is dramatically induced in activated endothelial cells within infiltrating carcinoma tissue, while endothelial cells in normal breast gland are Syndecen-4 negative. Syndecan-1 is strongly up-regulated in fibroblasts within the desmoplastic stroma surrounding infiltrating cancer cells. Glypiean-1 is found in stromal fibroblasts in the immedi- ate vicinity of cancer cells. FGF-2 binds to HSPGs in all stromal compartments. FR1-AP binds FGF-2 immobilized stromal Syndecan-4 endothe- cells signaling complex assembly. Summary:Syndecan-1 expression co-localizes with FGF-2-signaling complex assembly and therefore is a likely regulator of FGF-2 cell signaling. Syndecan-4 is induced in tumor vessel endothelial cells of infiltrating ductal carcinomas of the breast, facilitating FGF-2 signaling and thereby likely promoting angiogenesis. P309 WEEKLY DOCETAXEL WITH OR WITHOUT CORTICOSTEROID PREMEDICATION AS FIRST OR SECOND-LINE TREATMENT IN Landshut) Objective: This large phase II study was designed to evaluate (1) the efficacy of a weekly schedule of docetaxel as first or second-line therapy and (2) toxicity with or without corticosteroid premedication. Methods: 120 pts (median age 58, range 37-80) with MBC were included in the trial. Docetaxel was given at weekly doses of 35 mg/m 2 x6, followed by a 2-week rest. Additional cycles with 3 weeks of treatment and 2 weeks of rest were administered until disease progression. The first 34 pts were randomized to receive dexamethasone 8mg prior to docetaxel or no premedication. Results: To date, 110 pts (first-line 16, second-line 94) were evaluable for toxicity, all had measurable disease and ECOG performance status \u00a32. All 99 pts who received >6 doses of docetaxel were evaluable for response. A total of 1367 doses of docetaxel were given (median 10, range 1-18). Response (first/second-line): CR 1/9 pts (7.1/10.6%), (35.7/23.6%). Overall response rate was 35.7/ 43.5%. Median time to progression was 6.6/5.8 months and median survival was 14.2 months (not yet reached for first-line pts). Hematologic toxicity was usually mild to moderate, with no difference between the two premedication groups. Non- hematologic toxicity in percent of pts (+/- delayed due to neutropenia in 99 cycles (7.2%), and omitted in 67 cycles (4.9%). Dose reductions of level 1/2 (-5/-10mg/ m2/dose) were required in 10/5 pts (9/4.5%). Conclusions: The results of this study confirm that a weekly schedule of docetaxel 35 mg/m 2 is efficient and safe. Corticosteroid premedication as generally recommended is mandatory. P310 MONOCYTE CHEMOATTRACTANT PROTEIN-1 SERUM LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER A. Lebrecht, L. Hefler, E. Ludwig, E. Ulbrich, E. Seliger, D. Lampe, H. Koelbl, Martin-Luther-Universittit, (Halle; Wien, A) PURPOSE: Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) have been reported to be associated with invasive and metastatic behaviors of human malignant tumors. In vitro experiments have shown that MCP-1 induces migrational responses in human breast carcinoma cell lines. Thus, a potential role of MCP-1 in the process of tumor cell invasion and metastasis was suggested. The aim of this study was to determine the relation of serum MCP-1 levels to the various indices of breast cancer and known tumor markers CEA and CA15.3. METHODS: Preoperative serum MCP-1 levels were determined in 131 women with breast cancer and compared with serum MCP-1 levels in 152 women with benign lesions, 30 with DCIS and 27 healthy female controls. Patients' blood was obtained 24-48 hours before surgery and was immediately centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 rain. The serum was frozen at minus 80\u00b0C until examination. For the S 60 Breast Cancer (Basic Research) measurement of serum MCP-1 a commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used. RESULTS: The mean value of serum MCP-1 in patients with invasive breast cancer was 209.8+/-105.9 pg/ml and those of DCIS, benign lesions and the group were 211.2+/-105.2 pg/ml, 205.9+/-148.8 pg/ml and 201.5+/-93.8 pg/ml, respectively. We found no significant differences between these groups (p>0.7). However, there were significantly higher serum levels of MCP-1 in the patients with more advanced primary tumor staging (P=0.03) and in the patients with more advanced lymph node status (P=0.046). Furthermore we found a signifi- cant correlation between MCP-1 serum levels and CEA serum levels (p=0.0Ol) in patients with breast cancer. We found no relationship between age, hormone receptor status, histological grading and CA 15.3. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to our results, MCP-1 could not serve as a differen- tiation marker in breast lesions. However, preoperative serum MCP-1 levels might reflect the severity of invasive breast cancer and deserve further evaluation. P311 EXPRESSION PATTERN OF LIV-1 IN HUMAN BREAST CANCER G. Kasper, U. Schwidetzky, R. Kunert, C. Pilarsky, E. Dahl, R. Lichtner, A. Rosenthal, metaGen Pharmaceuticals GmbH (Berlin) LiV-1 is proposed to belong to a new family of membrane bound zinc transporters and was first isolated as an estrogen regulated gene from the human breast cancer cell line ZR-75-1. In recent studies, LIV-1 has been shown to be associated with lymph node involvement within human breast cancer. In our study we analysed the RNA expression of LIV-1 in tumor versus normal breast samples using chip based analysis combined with microdissection, cancer profiling array and RNA in situ hybridisation. We observed an overexpression of LIV-1 in a subset of tumors with respect to normal tissue. Chip results of 26 tumor samples correlated with clinical data confirm the association of LIV-1 expression with a functional ER, indicated by the presence of the progesterone receptor. Using Northern blot analysis we showed considerably high expression of LIV-1 in various normal tissue with highest levels in ovary and prostate. To investigate the protein expression pattern, we used Western blot analysis to screen a wide panel of normal and breast cancer cell lines, from which RNA levels were formerly determined by real time RT-PCR. LIV-1 was abundantly expressed in these cell lines and results suggest no strict correlation between mRNA and protein levels. Considering that zinc has been shown to induce apoptosis, LiV-1 might be important for the survival of tumors in which it is differentially expressed. P312 SELECTIVE REGULATION OF THE PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR PROMOTER B BY ESTROGEN RECEPTOR ALPHA B. Hanstein, T. FI6totto, D. (D0sseldor0 Progesteronereceptor(PR)-expression represents an important prognostic factor in breast cancer. Although generally accepted as an estrogen target gene, the exact regulation of PR by estrogen remains largely unclear. The physiological effects of progesterone are mediated by the progesteronereceptor (PR) isoforms PRA and PRB, transcribed from a single gene, under control of two distinct promoters. Both isoforms display different transactivation properties that are both promoter and cell line specific. Upregulation of both isoforms by estrogen (E2) has been described, although the two promoters do not contain a classical estrogen resonsive element. To examine the role of different estrogen receptors (ER) in the regulation of PR-transcription, the promoter for PRB (PRB) was cloned into (HeLa), endometrial (Ishikawa) breast SK-BR-3) ovarian (Hey) carcinoma cell lines were cotransfected with PRB-Luc and expression plasmids for ERalpha or ERbeta. Luciferase activity was measured 24 hours after stimulation with estrogen or antiestrogens (i-amoxifen, Raloxifen). In HeLa cells PRB enhanced (5-fold) by ERalpha, but not by ERbeta. ERbeta was also unable to stimulate the transcriptional activity of PRB in BT20 and Ishikawa cells, in which ERalpha induced reporter activity 2-fold. Deletion of the transcriptional activation domain (AF)I but not AF2 of ERalpha resulted in a loss of the transactivation in all cell lines tested. Furthermore, in BT20 cells the ERalpha-mutant lacking the AF2-domain was a significantly stronger activator of PRB than wild type ERalpha. In SK-BR-3 cells both ERs repressed PRB activity, but strong stimulation was observed after deletion of AF2. Therefore, we conclude that PRB expression is stimulated selectively by ERalpha in a novel, AFl-dependent but AF2-independent mechanism. This mechanism may provide a potential target for therapeutic modulation of ER-dependent transcriptional regulation. P313 CHARACTERIZATION OF DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED CANDIDATE GENES ASSOCIATED WITH GYNECOLOGICAL TUMORS B. Betz, A. Sadr-Nabavi, M. Du, D. Schmidt, E. Dahl, S. Gelling, B. Hinzmann, R. Kreutzfeld, R. Berlin, Bonn) More than 600 candidate genes were identified as differentially expressed in gynaecological tumors by ,,in-silico\" approaches based on the analysis of more than 4 million ESTs derived from either normal or tumor tissue databases (metaGen Pharmaceuticals). Fifty candidate genes considered as putative tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes were selected for further analysis in sporadic gynaecological tumors. In order to characterize the putative tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) a common strategy including expression analysis, LOH (loss of heterozygosity) analysis and mutation screening were applied. To confirm the electronic Northern data seven putative TSGs were investigated by hybridization of cancer arrays (CIontech cancer profiling arrays). Two genes (designated bn39, bn4O) were found to be lower expressed in up to 80% of breast or ovarian cancer samples compared to matched corresponding normal tissues, respectively. In a set of 200 breast and 70 ovarian cancer samples gene specific LOH analysis with intragenic microsatellite markers was performed to find at least 20 tumors with allelic loss of the corresponding gene. LOH was found in 29% to 44% of informative cases. For each TSG candidate 20 LOH positive tumor samples were screened for mutations by DHPLC (denaturing high performance liquide chromatography). Positive results were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Several missense mutations could be determined and specified as polymorphisms. No functional mutations were found in six candidate genes, only one frame-shift mutation and one missense mutation were detected in one putative TSG (bn4O). To explain the differential expression found for the two candidate genes bn39 and bn40 other inactivating mechanisms like promoter methylation have to be considered. To characterize activation of putative oncogenes, gene expression was analysed by hybridization of cancer arrays and oncogene amplification was determined by real-time PCR (TaqMan) or quantitative differential PCR. One candidate gene (bt11) was shown to be frequently overexpressed especially in ovarian cancer but gene amplification could not be shown. Conclusions: About 30% of the nominated candidate genes identified by database screening were shown to be differentially expressed in-vivo. Down- or upregulation of gene expression in cancer tissues might be explained by epigenetic inactivation/ activation mechanisms rather than mutations or gene amplification. P314 EXPRESSION PATTERN OF THE ESTROGEN REGULATED GENE LIV-1 IN HUMAN BREAST CANCER G. Kasper, U. Schwidetzky, R. Kunert, C. Pilarsky, E. Dahl, R. Lichtner, A. Rosenthal, metaGen Pharmaceuticals GmbH (Berlin) LIV-1 was proposed to belong to a new family of membrane bound zinc transporters and was first isolated as an estrogen regulated gene from the human breast cancer cell line ZR-75-1. In recent studies, UV-1 has been shown to be associated with lymph node involvement within human breast cancer. We analysed the RNA expression of LIV-1 in tumor versus normal breast samples using chip based analysis combined with microdissection, cancer profiling array and RNA in situ hybridisation. We observed an everexpression of LIV-1 in a subset of tumors with respect to normal tissue. Chip results of 26 tumor samples correlated with clinical data confirm the association of LIV-1 expression with a functional ER, indicated by the presence of the progesterone receptor. Using Northern blot analysis we showed considerably high expression of LIV-1 in various normal tissue with highest levels in ovary and prostate. To investigate the protein expression pattern, we used Western blot analysis to screen a wide panel of normal and breast cancer cell lines, from which RNA levels were formerly determined by real time RT-PCR. LIV-1 was abundantly expressed in these cell lines and results suggest no strict correlation between mRNA and protein levels. Considering that zinc has been shown to induce apoptosis, LlWl might be important for the survival of tumors in which it is differentially expressed. P315 C-MYC NOT HER-2/ NEU CORRELATES cancer the frequency of amplification of c-myc (ddPCR, cut off 2.1) and HER-2/neu (ddPCR, cut off 2.0) amounted to 21.5% and 30.4% respectively. When undergoing the univariate analysis c-myc amplified cancers proved to have a significantly shorter disease free survival (DFS) already 36 months after the first diagnosis has been made (85.3% vs. 97.3%). 95 months after the operation the estimated DFS of c-myc amplified cancer patients only added up to 85.3% in comparison to 95.6% of non-amplified patients (p=0,0079). When being compared to non-amplified cancers, HER-2/neu amplified breast cancers did not show any significant differences (95.6% vs. 94.3%) after a period of 36 months and 95 months respectively (95.6% vs. 92.6%, p=0.5868). The multivariate analysis revealed that c-myc amplification and tumour size - in comparison to estrogen-receptor status, grading, age and HER-2/neu status - were the only independent parameter with regard to DFS. During the period of observation there was no proof that an ampli-fication of these oncogenes affected the overall survival (OS) in any way (c-myc: 36 months: p= With respect to different adjuvant therapies such as CMF, EC and tamoxifen no significant differences could be found with oncogene amplified patients as to DFS and OS. However, when c-myc ampli-fied patients did not undergo any adjuvant therapy they showed a significantly higher mortality rate (p= 0.0098) and a significantly shorter disease free survival (p= 0.0209) compared to non c-myc amplified patients, who are not given any therapy either. S 61 Breast Cancer (Basic Research) / Leukemia/Lymphoma/Stem Cell Transplantation P316 ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL MOLECULAR PREDICTORS OF RESPONSE TO NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH LOCALLY ADVANCED BREAST CANCER A. Kafka, R. Kaestle-Cavallo, V. M~bus, F.D. Vogl, R. Kreienberg, Frankfurt a.M.-HSchst; Lyon, F) Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer can result in clinical response rates of up to 90%, whereas pathological response rates reach only 4-9%. We initiated a prospective study to identify molecular factors that influence the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients and Methods: Complete data have been collected of so far 50 breast cancer patients who were treated with neoadjuvant anthracycline- or anthracycline/ taxane-based chemotherapy. Patients were recruited between 1996 and 2000, their mean age at diagnosis was 50 _+ 11 years. Upon diagnosis tumor size was measured by MRT. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded core cut biopsies obtained before treatment, were analyzed for Her2/neu by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), tumor suppressor gene p53, and proliferation-associated antigen Ki67 was determined by immunohistochemistry. To test for an association with the response, Fisher's exact test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test were applied. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results: Clinically, complete or partial remission was observed in 36/50 (72%) patients, but only 5 of these (14%) achieved histopathologically diagnosed complete response (pCR). The age at diagnosis of breast cancer was significantly lower in responders compared to non-responders (median 33 vs. 52 years, respectively; P=O.019, pCR). Age remained a significant indicator for response also after adjusting for type of chemotherapy (ORMH 0.91; CI 0.84 - 0.99). Tumor size, hormone receptor status, and the molecular markers Her2/neu, p53 and Ki67 were not associated with pCR. Conclusion: Our results confirmed previous findings of a much lower rate of complete response in the tumor itself compared to the clinically diagnosed response. There was some suggestion of a higher response rate in younger patients. The interim analysis could not identify an association between the investigated markers and the response, which may be due to the limited number of patients. Currently a larger patient population and additional molecular markers are being studied. P317 RISK STAGES OF RELAPSE IN BREAST CARCINOMA AND RESPONSE TO THERAPY OF THE CIRCULATING TUMOUR CELLS R. Schubert, R. Dengler, K. Lobodasch, K. Pachmann, spez. Immunh&m. und Gendiag Bayreuth (Regensburg, Chemnitz, Jena, Bayreuth) Adjuvant chemotherapy is now well establishen in breast cancer. According to the statistical probability of relapse, patients have been grouped into risk groups according to age, turnout size, involved lymph nodes, grading and receptor sta- tus. We have analysed 43 patients from two institutions (an oncologic practioner and womens hospital Rabenstein-Chemnitz) who received adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical resection of the primary tumour for their number of circulating tumour cells and the response of these cells to therapy. Out of these patients, none fell into risk group 1(>35 T1 NO G1 Rec+), 8 into T1-2 NO G1- 2 Rec+ Her2-), 4 into risk group 3 (others NO Rec+ Her2-), 6 into risk group 4 (others N0-1 (1-3) Rec+), 6 into risk group 5 (N1(>3) Rec+) and 19 into risk group 6 (N1(>3) Rec-). For analysis of the epithelial-antigen positive cells white blood cells from about 2Oral of anticoagulated peripheral blood were isolated by the lysis method, tumour cells enriched with magnetic beads, stained with fluorochrome-labeled antibody against human epithelial antigen and quantified using Laser Scanning Cytometry. More than 10 OOO suspicious cells in the circulation were found in 90% of patients initially with no differences between the risk groups. However, the number of positive cells decreased under therapy in 6 of 8 patients from risk group 2 (in part more than 2 logs), whereas in risk group 6 this number increased in 11of 19 patients during therapy. Thus, we show, that this minimally invasive proce- dure, which can be repeated frequently, allows monitoring of the circulating tumour cells during therapy and this may, in future, help to individually tailor adjuvant therapy. P318 HER2 GENE AMPLIFICATION AND OVEREXPRESSION OF THE HER2 RECEPTOR PROTEIN IN INVASIVE LOBULAR BREAST CANCER, I. Drechsler, K. Evers, H. Universit~tsklinikum Benjamin Franklin, Marienhospital Herne, Ruhr Universit&t Bochum (Berlin, Bochum) The last few years a wealth of publications has covered the prognostic relevance of HER2 overexpression in breast cancer in general or in the invasive ductal subtype (IDC) of the disease. However, very little is known about the significance of HER2 expression in invasive Iobular breast cancer (ILC). In a retrospective study on 68 cases of ILC we determined the HER2 protein expression as well as the amplification of the HER2 gene. All patients were free of metastasis at the time of primary tumor resection. The 10 years old paraffin embedded material was analyzed immunohistochemically (IHC) with DAKO's Herceptest, the number of gene copies was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridisatien (FISH) using the HER2 inform kit of Ventana. In ILC the overexpression of the HER2 receptor protein as well as the amplification of the gene were significantly less frequent compared to IDC. In detail we found for the protein expression an IHC score of O for 15 cases, of 1+ for 41, of 2+ for 6, and of 3+ for 5 specimens. An amplification of the gene was observed in only 9 out of 68 cases. HER2-posJtive in terms of protein overexpression were 16.2 % of the patients, in terms of gene amplification 13.2 %. The correlation of IHC and FISH is weaker than in IDC. Three out of 6 IHC 2+ specimens were amplified but also 2 of 41 tumors with IHC 1+ - a combination we did not find so far in IDC. A first approach in correlating disease free and overall survival of the patients with HER2 status did not reveal significant differences between the positive and negative group. This is in striking contrast to IDC but it has to be considered that the positive group is rather small. IHC score 0 1+ 2+ 3+ n n amplified 15 0 41 2 6 3 5 4 Publication only P'319 MONITORING CIRCULATING TUMOUR CELLS CARRYING THE HER2/NEU AMPLIFICATION BY FISH AS A RAPID AND DIRECT WAY FOR TIMELY ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY OF HERCEPTIN THERAPY IN BREAST CANCER K. Pachmann, D. HOttig, U. Pachmann, KIM II der Friedrich Schiller Universit~.t Jena, Labor f. Immunh&mat Gendiag Bayreuth (Jena, Bayreuth) Herceptin therapy has shown to offer survival advantage in metastatic breast cancer. Now a study has been launched to investigate its usefulness in the adjuvant situation where no manifest metastases are known and disseminated tumour cells are the target of the therapy. This seems meaningful since antibodies like Herceptin are assumed to reach circulating tumour cells better than cells in solid metastases. A prerequisite for the efficacy of the antibody is overexpression of the target, the Her2/neu gene product on the turnout cells. Overexpression has so far been analysed on cells of the original tumour, which is surgically removed. Positivity of the tumour for Her2/neu is an indication but no proof that the targeted cells, the circulating turnout cells, also will be positive. It is, however, possible to control Her2/neu amplification in the individual circulating cells by combining analysis of the number of circulating tumour cells with FISH analysis for the amplification of the Her2/neu gene on these same cells using Laser Scanning Cytometry. Thus, it becomes not only possible to analyse the true targets of the therapy for their reactivity to the antibody but also to tightly monitor the efficacy of therapy in the individual patient by controlling the reduction of the tumour cells carrying the amplification. Thus this method allows to determine therapy response of tumour cells in vivo and will enable individual tailoring of therapy in breast cancer patients before development of metastases. Leukemia/Lymphoma/Stem Cell Transplantation Oral Presentation 0320 BENDAMUSTINE SHOWS SUPERIOR RESULTS COMPARED TO STANDARD MELPHALAN IN THE PRIMARY THERAPY OF MULTIPLE MYELOMA W. P6nisch, P. Mitrou, K.H. Merkle, Between May 1994 and July 1998 136 previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma (MM) (stage II with tumor progression: n=11, stage Ill: n=125) were randomized in a prospective phase Ill study to receive Bendamustine/Prednisone (BP) or Melphalan/Prednisone (MP). 5 patients were not evaluable for response (inadequate modification of therapy: n=2; loss of follow up: n=3). 131 patients were therefore evaluable for response. 68 patients received BP (Bendamustine 150 mg/qm day 1+2, prednisone 60 mg/qm day 1-4) 63 MP 15 mg/qm day 1, prednisone 60 mg/qm day 1-4). Response to treatment was evaluated by SWOG criteria. Changes of the individual tumor cell mass (TCM) were determined by myeloma protein concentrations. TCM reduction of more than 75 % was defined as complete and between 25 % and 74 % as partial remission. Minor variations (-+24 %) of the TCM were designated as no change. In responding patients, chemotherapy cycles were repeated until no further TCM reduction was observed during the last three months. Results of the analysis performed after a median follow-up of 48 months showed that BP-therapy produced a significantly higher complete remission rate compared to conventional MP-therapy (32 % versus 13 %, p<0,01). The duration of response was significantly longer in the BP treated patients with a median of 14 months compared with 10 months in the MP group (p<0,03). The S 62 Leukemia/Lymphoma/Stem Cell Transplantation 3 year probability of remaining progression free survival was 14 % versus 4 % respectively. The 5 year post-diagnosis probability of overall survival was not significantly different between the both treatment groups (BP: 29 % and MP: 19 %). Minimal increased toxicity (leukopenia, gastrointestinal complaints) was observed with BP therapy. We conclude that the BP regimen shows important advantages over standard MP as primary treatment for MM. For the BP treated patients a higher rate of complete remissions with a shorter duration of therapy is achieved and for most patients a longer therapy free interval until the first progress was noted. The latter represents an important improvement in the quality of life of patients. O321 MUTATION OF P53 IN B-CLL: RELATION TO PRIOR ALKYLATING CHEMOTHERAPY, DISEASE PROGNOSIS AND IMPACT ON DISTINCT DRUG SENSITIVITY PROFILES I. Sturm, A.G. Bosanquet, S. Hermann, D. G~Jner, B. D~brken, HAmatologie, Bath Cancer Research Center, Charit6-CCM (Berlin; Bath, GB) Mutations of the p53 gene are known to occur in approximately 10% of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLL). Both mutations of p53 and deletions of chromosome 17p have been shown to occur in a subgroup of patients with poor prognosis. Such defects in the apoptosis signalling cascade by inactivation of p53 are known to confer drug resistance. Nevertheless, the majority of these data are derived from cell line experiments and few reports have directly shown such effects in primary tumor cells. So far, no conclusive data on the impact of p53 inactivation on sensitivity to a panel of therapeutically relevant drugs are available in B-CLL. To this end, we have investigated the p53 mutational status in 138 B- CLL and compared these findings with their ex vivo drug sensitivity towards a panel of relevant drugs (alkylating agents, fludarabine, anthracyclines, steroids and vincristine). As expected, patients with p53 mutated B-CLL show a shorter survival, interestingly, p53 mutations accumulate in patients who underwent prior DNA damaging chemotherapy. Furthermore, we show that p63 mutations are related to an impaired apoptotic response, especially to alkylating agents and radiation. In contrast, no effect was observed on the response to vincristine, steroids or doxorubicin as determined by an ex vivo drug sensitivity test. Here we show for the first time that treatment with alkylating DNA-damaging agents may induce p53 mutations in B-CLL. This finding could explain at least to some extent the development of resistance to second- or third-line chemotherapy in B-CLL. Therefore, in view of the differential effect of p63 inactivation on individual drug sensitivities, the analysis of p53 mutations could help to assign a specific drug treatment in B-CLL in the future. 0322 LONG TERM SURVIVAL OF CHILDREN ACHIEVED BY THE END OF THE 2ND MILLENIUM H. Brenner, P. Kaatsch, T. (Heidelberg, Mainz, L0beck, Hamburg, Hannover) Background. Prognosis in childhood leukemia has steadily improved over the last decades due to major progress in therapy. Much of this progress remains undetected yet in traditional estimates of long term survival rates, which essentially reflect the survival experience of patients diagnosed many years ago. Methods. We applied a new method of survival analysis, denoted period analysis, to provide up-to-date estimates of long term survival rates (1). Our analysis is based on data from the nationwide German Childhood Cancer Registry (2) and includes 8059 children diagnosed with leukemia between 1981 and 1998. We derived the most up-to-date 5-, 10, and 15-year survival estimates that may be obtained by period analysis and compared them to the most up-to-date survival estimates from traditional methods of survival analysis. Results. Period estimates (95% confidence intervals) of 5-, 10- and 15-year survival rates achieved by 1998 are 81% (79%-83%), 57% (49%-64%) for acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. Substantially lower estimates would have been obtained with traditional methods of survival analysis. Conclusion. These results from the nationwide German Childhood Cancer Registry reveal that cure rates of childhood leukemia achieved by the end of the 2rid millenium are higher than suggested by previous estimates based on traditional methods of survival analysis.

Reinhardt, A. Scheppokat, S. Diekamp, M. Schrappe, C. Langebrake, U. P&d. H~tmatologie/Onkologie (MOnster, Hannover) Acute mixed lineage leukemia (AMLL) is a rare subtype of acute leukemias. This retrospective study included 77 children (m 50; f 27) enrolled in the AML-BFM and ALL-BFM-etudies between 8/1986 and 7/2001. The patients fulfilled at least one of the following criteria: (1) immunological biphenotypic leukemia (EGIL-score; n=56) (2) morphological evidence of two distinct blast populations (n=l 1) (3) lineage switch (n=12). The median age (8.3 yrs, range 0.1-19.7) of the study group was comparable to AML-BFM study patients (7.9 yrs, range 0.0-18.0). The initial leukocyte count was significantly higher (median 61,900/pl; 1,200-732,000/pl) compared to AML patients (19,150/pl; 300-540,600/pl; p<0.0001). Considering criteria and immunophenotype one group with predominantly myeloid (n=35) and a second group with mainly lymphoid features (n=42) could be classified. Sixty-six patients achieved complete remission (86%). Twenty-six patients relapsed (34%). Overall, 35 of the 77 children survived (45%), the median follow-up was 3.2 yrs (0.3-15.3 yrs). The 5-yr-event free survival (EFS 26+-5%) and 5-yr-overall survival (OS 42_+6%) was poor compared to (EFS: OS 58+-2%; p log rank <0.01). Cyto- and moleculargenetics were available in 51 children. Favorable aberrations were rare. Most children showed intermediate cytogenetics such as normal karyotype (n=12), trisomy 8, different translocations or minor deletions Unfavorable or complex karyotype (n=3) were associated with a poor outcome (EFS 10+-9%; OS 16+-13% p log rank =0.02). In 26 children in whom cytogenetic data was not available, the EFS and OS were 23+-8% and 34\u00b110%. Cytochemica] positive peroxidase (>3%), typical in AML, could be identified as a poor prognostic factor (Cox regression p<0.03). By contrast, positivity of the cytoplasmatic T-cell antigen CD3 correlated with a better outcome (p<0.03). Regarding treatment regimes, children with lymphoid features had a OS of 59\u00b113% with an ALL-directed therapy versus 42_+10% with AML or mixed treatment schedules. Patients with myeloid features had an OS of 40+-10% with AML- therapy but an OS of 14_+13% with ALL-treatment. Summary: AMLL is a heterogeneous entity with an unfavorable prognosis. Treatment decisions should consider cytogenetics, cytochemistry, morphology and immunology. Prospective studies are necessary to optimize treatment and improve outcome. 0324 OUTCOME OF PATIENTS WITH HIV-RELATED LYMPHOMA IS STRONGLY PREDICTED BY EFFICACY OF ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART) C. Hoffmann, E. Wolf, G. F~itkenheuer, T. Buhk, A. Stoehr, A. Plettenberg, U. K61n, Hamburg; Boston, USA) Background: Recently, large epidemiological studies have yielded discordant re- sults regarding the impact of ART on the course of HIV-related lymphoma (HRL). We analyzed the outcome of HRL with respect to the individual use and efficacy of ART and to potential prognostic factors. Methods: Ongoing, multicentric cohort study of patients with systemic HRL diagnosed histologically between 1990-2001 in five German HIV centers. To evaluate overall survival (OS) and the effects of several variables on OS, Kaplan-Meier statistics and extended Cox regression analysis were performed. Response to ART was used as a time dependent variable and was defined as a CD4 cell increase of >100/IJI and/or at least one viral load of <500 copies/ml during the first two years following diagnosis of HRL. Results: We identified 221 patients with HRL, among them 29 cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD). Median CD4 cell count at diagnosis was 140/pl, and 33 % had had a prior AIDS event. Median OS was 11.2 months. Overall complete remission (CR) rate in patients treated with polychemotherapy was 59 % (ITT analysis). In the univariate analysis, no prior AIDS diagnosis, CD4 cells > 200/p], Ann Arbor stages I-II and A, no extranodal lesion, successful ART, and CR were associated with prolonged OS. In the extended Cox model, factors independently associated with OS were successful ART (relative hazard (RH) was significantly higher in patients with successful HAART and CR compared to patients with CR only (p<0.001). Median survival time in patients with CR only was 18.5 months (95%CI 8.6 - 44.9 months). In patients with successful HAART and CR, median survival time was not yet reached. After 18.5 months, 89 % of this group were still alive. Conclusions: Efficient ART led to a dramatic improvement of survival in this large cohort of patients with HIV-related lymphoma. Detailed information on patient's response to antiretroviral therapies is crucial for the evaluation of new treatment strategies for HRL. Poster P325 A MULTICENTRE TRIAL WITH TOPOTECAN, MITOXANTRONE AND IN PATIENTS WITH RELAPSED OR REFRACTORY AML OR CML IN BLAST CRISIS - INTERIM RESULTS B. Hoechsmann, H. D6hner, A. Ganser, C. Denzlinger, A. Harem, Frankfurt am Main) We designed a new combination therapy to improve the results of previous S 63 Leukemia/Lymphoma/Stem Cell Transplantation studies with topotecan in myeloid leukemias. In the ongoing prospective multicentre phase II study up to now 81 patients (pts) were enrolled, 59 pts were analysed for patient characteristics. Diagnosis included 10% refractory CML-BC. Median age was 57 years (18-71). 57% of the pts were male and 43% female. Karyotyp was normal in 29% of pts, 47% showed abnormalities, 13% had complex abnormalities and no result was available in 11%. 31% of the pts were pretreated got a PBSCT/BMT upon pretreatment. Relapse free survival (RFS) after initial therapy was in 43% of pts < 6 months and in 69% of pts < 12 months, the median RFS was 8 months. As re-induction therapy pts received MTC I+11 consisting day 3-7 per cycle. Consolidation was done by alIo-PBSCT/BMT or a third course MTC. Pts < 60 years without complications in the previous MTC cycles had the option of an intensified MTC Ill by dosage escalation of topotecan to 1,75 mg/m2. For toxicity and response so far 51 enrolled pts were evaluable after MTC I, 35 pts completed induction therapy and 10 pts received MTC Ill. Median duration of neutropenia < 0.5 G/I (thrombopenia < 25 G/I) was 21 (19) days during MTC I, 16 (15) days during MTC II and 15 (16) days during MTC III. Median duration of fever >38,5\u00b0C in MTC I, MTC II and MTC III was 2 days. Mucositis grade 3 arised in 3 cases of 79 cycles. 1 pt suffered from a reversible cardiac rhythm disturbance by hypokaliemia. During MTC I 3 pts died in aplasia, after hematopoietic reconstitution 1 pt died in sepsis. The overall post MTC I remission-rate was 64%. Remission rate after MTC I was 79% for relapsed AML with a RFS > 6 months after initial therapy and 17% for relapsed AML with a RFS < 6 months after initial therapy. CR-rate after MTC I was 66% for refractory AML. For CML-BC post MTC I remission rate was 50%. Consolidation part is finished by 16 pts, 6 pts received regular MTC III, 4 pts dose intensified MTC Ill, 6 pts got an alIo-PBSCT/BMT. The results suggest an encouraging treatment response in this poor prognosis patient group combined with tolerable toxicity of the MTC-regimen . P326 TEAM VERSUS BEAM CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMEN WITH AUTOLOGOUS PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (PBSCT) IN PATIENTS WITH RELAPSED LYMPHOMA C. Kasper, K. H~ffken, Friedrich-Schiller-UniversitAt Jena (Jena) It has been shown that patients (pts) with chemosensitive relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were more likely to remain disease-free when consolidate high- dose therapy (HDT) with stem cell support is used. Thus, a combination of carmustine, etoposid, cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM) or cyclophosphamide is considered standard therapy. To decrease pulmonary toxitity related with carmustine, we compared the efficiency of two regimens, BEAM and TEAM in a non-randomised phase II study, replacing one alcylating drug (carmustine) by another (thiotepa): Pts received either 300 rag/m2 carmustine or 200 mg/m2 on -3), 140 mg/m2 mephalan (day -2). Between 10/1996 and 10/2001 sixteen female and 17 male pts with chemosentitive relapsed NHL (n=16) or Hodgkin's disease (n=17) in first or consecutive remission with a median age of 36 years (range 18-61) were treated with either BEAM (n=24) or TEAM (n=9) chemotherapy followed by an autologuos PBSCT with a median of 2,94x106 CD34+ cells (range 1,23-9) and supportive treatment with G-CSE All pts engrafted in a median of 10 days (range 8-42), and became independent of platelet transfusions in a median of 12 days (range 5-34) without significant differences in both treatment groups.No treatment related mortality occurred .during the hospital admission. With a median follow up of 36 months (range 2-62) the overall survival are 79% for BEAM, and 78% for TEAM chemotherapy, respectively. Four out of five pts in the BEAM group died due to relapse, and one pt due to pulmonary toxicity in CR. Two deaths in the TEAM group were related to secondary AML (2 months after PBSCT) and infection, respectively. Two relapsed pts in the BEAM and one in the TEAM group are still alive following salvage therapy. In conclusion, TEAM seems to be safe and feasible as well as equally effective to BEAM in the treatment of relapsed lymphoma patients. It may offer an alternative treatment with reduced pulmonary toxicity. However, a longer follow up and a randomised study is warranted. P327 COMBINED STANDARD WITH inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme required for de novo synthesis of guanosine nucleotides in T and B lymphocytes. To decrease the risk of acute and chronic GvHD in patients (pts) with risk factors we added MMF to standard GvHD prophylaxes in allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Between 4/1999 and 8/2001 six female and 22 male pts with advanced haematological malignancies with a median age 42,5 years (range 20-59) received an unmanipulated blood-stem-cell graft with median of CD34+ (range 1,77-15,43) and 350,1x106 CD3+ cells (range 198-3340,8) from matched unrelated (n=24), mismatched (n=3), or identical family donors (n=l). Prior to transplantation 13 pts underwent 12 Gy fractionated total body irradiation and 120 mg/KG body weight cyclophosphamide, one pt additional etoposide, and 14 pts a reduced conditioning regimen of Fludarabin, Busulfan, and ATG, respectively. Standard GvHD prophylaxes consisted cyclosporine (CsA) 3 mg/KG as a continuous infusion started on day -1, and methotrexate (MTX) 15 rag/m2 on day mg/m2 on days +3, +6 and +10, respectively. In case of the reduced condition regimen MTX was omitted. Starting on day +10 until day +45 after transplantation pts received a dose of 1 g MMF iv. every twelve hours and changed to oral medication when tolerated. All pts engrafted in a median of 12 days (range 9-22), became independent of platelet transfusions in a median of 14,5 days (range 10-61), and were discharged from hospital on day 35 (range 15-72). Twenty out of 28 pts developed acute GvHD including 18% GvHD grade III or IV [4 pts (14%), 11 pts Iio (39%), 2 pts Illo (7%), and 3 pts IVo (11%)]. Subsequently, eight pts developed limited and one pt extensive chronic GvHD. With a median follow up of 17 month (range 3-30) overall survival is 64,3% and disease free survival 60,7%. Only two deaths were due to GvHD IVo. Ten out of 13 pts being CMV IgG positive became positive for pp65 indicating reactivation of CMV. However, CMV reactivation was independent from the donor status. MMF-related side effects were moderate (e.g. nausea and vomiting). In conclusion, MMF seems to be safe and feasible in the prophylaxes of severe acute GvHD for high risk pts but combined with a high risk for reactivating CMV in CMV positive pts. P328 HIGH DOSE RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY (RIT) MANTLE LYMPHOMA THE 1-131-LABELED target molecule for low-dose as well as high-dose, myeloablative RIT of B-cell NHL. MCL is an especially aggressive, prognostically unfavorable form of B-cell NHL. Recent evidence has failed to show convincing therapeutic efficacy of non-myeloablative RIT in MCL. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate whether high-dose, myeloablative RIT with the 1-131-1abeled Roche) may be therapeutically effective in MCL. A total of seven patients with chemorefractory or relapsed mantle cell lymphoma were studied so far (all of them having relapsed after high-dose chemotherapy, four of them combined with 12 Gy TBI). A diagnostic-dosimetric study was performed with 10 mCi of 1-131-C2B8 at a protein dose of 2.5 mg/kg. In case of splenic pooling, the protein dose was doubled in additional diagnostic scans until a more ,,favorable\" biodistribution was obtained. Therapy was performed with myeloablative activties of 261-495 mCi of 1-131-C2B8 at the previously optimized protein dose, aiming at lung doses of < 27 Gy. Stem cells were re-infused at whole-body activities < 15-20 mCi. Clinical follow-up was obtained for up to 38 months. Overall, in 6 patients the 2.5 mg/kg protein dose was used, whereas in one patient with splenomegaly, 10 mg/kg were necessary to overcome the splenic antigenic sink. All patients re-engrafted at 7-10 days after stem cell reinfusion. Non- hematologic toxicity was restricted to mild to moderate nausea, fever, transient bilirubine or liver enzyme elevations. Despite thyroid blocking, 5/7 patients developed hypothyroidism, requiring thyroxine substitution at 6-18 months after RIT. 6 patients experienced complete and one a partial remission. 5 patients are still in CR, and 6 are still alive for up to 38 months; one patient relapsed locally at 3 months, one systemically at 26 months after RIT. These data suggest that high-dose RIT with 1-131-1abeled anti-CD2O antibodies seems to be associated with a high response rate at moderate toxicity in patients with MCL. Further prospective clinical studies are indicated. P329 AMPLIFICATIONS OF REGIONS WITH C-MYC, NOT ASSOCIATED WITH TRI- SOMY 8, DETECTED BY DIFFERENT MOLECULAR-CYTOGENETIC METH- ODS - A CASE REPORT OF A CML PATIENT WITH BLAST is no doubt that there are still unknown or unidentified aberrations related to the progression of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). In order to gain more information and to evaluate the benefit of combining different molecular- cytogenetic techniques with conventional cytogenetics (CC), we applied (CGH) and in situ hybridisation (FiSH)- based methods with GTG-banding in a CML in blast crisis. Methods: Cytogenetic analysis was done in the male patient JC (age 55 years) with CML in blast crisis 9 months after his clinical admission. The patient later on achieved a partial haematological remission but proceeded to a second blast crisis followed by exitus. We applied CGH, metaphase dual colour FISH with painting probes (wcp) in combination with locus specific probes for 6p23 and 8q- telomer as well Multicolour-FISH (mFISH) in to the CC. Results: GTG-banding revealed the typical Ph-translocation in 22 of 22 investigated metaphases with additional trisomy 8 in 5 out of 22 cells. CGH detected a deletion in the 6p11-21 region, gains in 6q, and in 8q22-qter. To clarify the discrepancies between CGH results and CC dual colour FISH was performed with appropriate probes (wcp 6/LSI 6p23 and wcp 8/8q-tel) and showed a trisomy 6 combined with a deletion of 6p11-21 and 4 signals of 8q-ter of which two were located on two S 64 Leukemia/Lymphoma/Stem Cell Transplantation unidentified chromosomes. The mFISH confirmed in 4/4 metaphases the results found by CGH and in addition could identify the breakpoint 6p23 aberration as an unbalanced translocation between the chromosomes 6 and 8 instead of a deletion 6p. Combined molecular-cytogenetic analysis clarified the amplification of the 8q- ter as a result of the doubling of an aberrant chromosome 6 showing the translocation t(6p;8q). Summary: The combination of CGH, dual colour FISH, mFISH and CC proved to complement each other. New genetic changes may be discovered with future relevance for the progression of CML. The detected chromosomal gain in the 8q22-qter region most likely results in additional copies of among other genes the nuclear proto-oncogene c-MYC known to correlate with rapid growth of leukemic cells and the blast phase properties in acute and chronic myeloid diseases. The genes located on 6q or 6p11-21 are also candidates of interest. Investigations in different phases of CML to find a correlation between new detected aberrations and different phases of the disease are in progress. P330 A-SHAP THERAPY FOR REFRACTORY AND RELAPSING INTERMEDIATE OR R. Noppeney, Jr Novotny, U. DLihrsen, Universit~tsklinik (Essen) Combination chemotherapy is capable of curing many patients with newly diagnosed intermediate- and high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), but treatment of relapsed NHL remains problematic. In this retrospective study 24 patients were treated with the A-SHAP regimen, a combination of adriamycin (10mg/m2 by dl-5) given 3 to weekly. Patients: 22 patients with relapsed or refractory high-grade NHL, six of them in transformation, and two patients with mantle-cell-lymphoma were enrolled in this study. Results: 12 patients (50%) achieved CR and 4 (16,7%) achieved PR after an average of three cycles of A-SHAP for a total response of 66,7%. 1 patient achieved stable disease whereas 7 (29,2%) had a progressive disease. The principal toxicity was myelosuppression with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia of WHO grades Ill/IV in 87,5% and 75% of all courses. 7 (29%) instances of febrile neutropenia were seen. No fatal non-hematological toxicities such as mucositis, renal or gastrointestinal side effects or neurotoxicity were encountered. No treatment-related mortality was observed. At the time of analysis, 18 out 24 (75%) patients were alive. The median survival and the event free survival were 10 and 7 months. Of the 16 responders following A-SHAP, 10 were consolidated by high dose chemotherapy (HDCT). After a median follow-up of 10 months, 5 patients are still in CR, 3 suffered relapse and 2 have died of their disease. The six responders, who did not undergo HDCT, were consolidated by radiation therapy at a stage I or II of the disease. All patients are still in CR. Conclusion: The A~SHAP protocol is an active combination chemotherapy protocol when used as a salvage regimen or for remission induction before autologous stem cell transplantation in relapsed or refractory high-grade NHL. Factors predicting poor response between the patients who achieved a CR to A-SHAP versus those who achieved a PR, SD or PD, were an initially increased LDH (p=0,039), refractory prognostic index (p=0,044) and the stage (p=0,044) of the disease. These results confirm the results of Velasquez et al. and H&nel et al. (total response 69%). P331 CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, LIPOSOMAL DOXORUBICIN, AND DEXAMETHASONE (CLAD) G. HQtter, H. Szel~nyi, E. Thiel, U. Keilholz, UKBF (Berlin) INTRODUCTION Melphalan and prednisone (MP) is regarded as the palliative standard in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Three other cytotoxic agents were shown to be effective either as single compounds or in combination chemotherapy: cyclophosphamide, vincaalkaloids, and anthracyclines. Apart from the necessarity of prolonged infusion for doxorubicin, adverse effects include myelosuppression and especially cardiotoxicity. Liposomal formulation of doxorubicin increases the half-life manifold, mimicking the continuous infusion of doxorubicin and almost eliminates cardiotoxicity. PATIENTS AND TREATMENT In a phase II trial, we treated 21 patients between 1998 and 2000 with CLAD 3 weeks for a max. of 6 times)). Between February and November 2001 patients with histological proven MM were offered enrolment into a randomised phase II/111 trial comparing CLAD dl, prednison 60mg p.o. dl-4 (every 4 weeks for a max. of 8 times)) if they met the following criteria: stage III or stage II with progression, contraindications against a high-dose regime. Main exclusion criteria were renal insufficiency and severe cardiac disease (NYHA >11 or EF <50%). RESULTS 21 patients with MM were enrolled in the phase II trial. Safety analysis of 62 cycles revealed that the treatment was well tolerated. Aside from one patient with severe tachyarrythmia, no further cardiotoxicity was observed. Efficacy analysis of 19 patients showed a rapid remission induction after 2 cycles (70% PR in chemo naive and 27% in pretreated patients). To date twelve patients entered the subsequent randomised phase II/lll trial, evaluating CLAD vs. MR CONCLUSIONS CLAD with liposomal doxorubicin is safe in patients with mutiple myeloma and induces rapid remissions. The randomised investigation of CLAD vs. MP is ongoing. P332 LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP OF PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY INTESTINAL LYMPHOMA (PIL) - A SINGLE CENTER ANALYSIS OF 51 Primary lymphoma of the small or large bowel is rare. Incidence rates have been reported from Great Britain as small bowl 1.7 and large bowel 0.6 cases per million and year. Methods: A retrospective, single-center analysis identified 51 patients (pts.) with primary small or large bowel lymphoma treated between 6/1981 and 3/2001. Variables between groups were compared by Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and log rank test (SPSS). Because of two groups of patients with comparable baseline characteristics, no indication of positive or negative confounding was needed to be controlled for with multivariante Cox models. All p-values are two- tailed. Results: Twenty-five pts. were male and 26 pts. female with a median age of 56 years (range 22 - 84). Histological diagnoses included B-cell lymphoma (n=43), T- cell lymphoma (n=6), Hodgkin's disease and composite lymphoma (one each). Patients presented with abdominal pain (n=15), nausea (n=11), obstruction mass (n=2) or unspecified symptoms (n=8). In one patient PIL was diagnosed after heart transplantation. Three pts. with coeliac disease developed non- Hodgkin's lymphoma of the small bowel. Five pts. had an additional tumor treated before and another 6 pts. after diagnosis of PIL. Patients were treated by surgical resection alone (n=6), chemotherapy alone (n=7), a combination of surgery and chemotherapy (n=23), chemotherapy and radiotherapy (n=3) or a combination of all modalities (n=12). R0-resection was achieved in.16 pts, Rl-resection in 10 pts, R2-resection in 13 pts. In two patients the R-Status was not determined. 32 / 51 pts. are still alive (22 complete remisson, 9 partial remission, 1 progressive disease), while 19 / 51 pts. have died. The overall survival from diagnosis of PIL was 33% at 5 years for all patients. The overall survival of the 11 pts. with additional malignant tumors was 64%. The 5- year overall survival in the resected patients was R0 - 44%, R1 - 50% and R2 - 30%. Survival after macroscopically complete resection (R0/1) was 46 %. (R0/1 vs. R2, p=0.65). Conclusion. Survival was best following macroscopically complete tumor resection (R0/R1). In the absence of controlled trials, patients with primary intestinal lymphoma should undergo surgical treatment, if complete resection the advantage of markedly decreased cardiotoxicity but comparable or better efficacy as compared to the free drug. The improvement of the risk-benefit ratio of liposomal anthracyclines encouraged their use in relapsed or recalcitrant cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. We report on the use of liposomal anthracylines in 12 patients with CTCL stage Ib- iV. Ten patients have been treated with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx, Essex, Germany), two were treated with liposomal daunorub[cin (Daunoxome, NeXstar, Germany). The dose was 20 mg per square meter body surface once a months. The drugs were applied intravenously using a 3 hours or a one hour infusion. Therapy was performed as a single agent treatment. Tolerability was excellent with both formulations. In the Caelyx group a survival rate of 80% was achieved after 12 months of follow-up. The overall survival was 19.8 months. Skin biopsies disclosed a normalization of cellualr infiltrates and a change in the expression of lectin and lectin-binding site expression. Toxicity was generally mild. Only one case of grade 4 anemia was observed. One patient stage lib CD30-positive large cell anaplastic CTCL of skin disclosed a coomplete response after 3 infusions with Daunoxome. Tumors showed a rapid regression after 1-2 infusions. Tolerability was excellent with no side-effects. Another patients with relapsed CTCL, mycosis fungoides type, is still under treatment. Liposomal encapsulated anthracylines provide promising results in realpsing or recalcitrant CTCL as single agents. Multicenter trial are necessary to validate these observations. P334 PHASE 1/11 STUDY OF PEGYLATED LIPOSOMAL DOXORUBICIN IN COMBINATION WITH ETOPOSID AND DEXAMETHASONE (ELID) FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS > 60 YEARS WITH RELAPSED AGGRESSIVE NHL N. Bock, C. Pott, B. Glass, M. BrL~ggemann, even in relapsed aggressive NHL is proven, however treatment options for the elderly are limited because of cumulative cardial toxicity. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicine (Caelyx) has an increased half- time compared to the free drug (40-55 h vs. 16min) and a low cardial toxicity. It has proven to be highly effective in combination therapy of solid tumors and multiple S 65 Leukemia/Lymphoma/Stem Cell Transplantation myeloma. We initiated a phasel/ll study in patients > 60 years with relapsed aggressive NHL to prove applicability of Caelyx in a combination protocol with etoposid and dexamethasone and to evaluate remission rate, tumor control, toxicity and disease free survival after treatment. 10 pts. w[th stage IV disease ( 7 diffuse large cell, 1 transformed follicular, 1ALC and 1 MALT NHL) were enrolled in the study with a median age of 71 years. All pts. were extensively pretreated with a median of 3,5 therapies (Range 1-7) The study treatment consisted of 6 cycles of Caelyx 20 mg/sqm i.v. day 1, Etoposid 100 mg/sqm i.v.day and dexamethasone 8 mg orally twice daily day 1-5. Pts. received a median of 4,2 cycles (2-6). Myelosuppression occured with grade 3/4 neutropenia in 4 of 10 patients, in 3 of them only once after the first cycle. Grd. 3 mucositis occured in 1 and palmar-plantar erythrodysthesia (PPE) in 2 patients, respectively. No other grade 3/4 toxicity has been observed. CR has been documented in 1 patient with unmaintained remission now 10 months after start of treatment, 1 patient achieved a PR and further 5 a minor response. 2 lots. progressed under treatment with ELID , one did not show a response. The median time to treatment failure of 9 patients was 2,5 months, one patient skipped further observation. Conclusion: ELID is a feasable treatment option for elderly pts. with aggressive, relapsed NHL and is able to induce even CR in this heavily pretreated patients. P335 EXTRANODAL INVOLVEMENT IN HODGKIN'S DISEASE - A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF 297 PATIENTS S.L. (PS) for Hodgkin's disease (M. H.) were analyzed to relate nodal and extranodal involvement / 297. Results: Pulmonary extranodal disease was observed in patients with right cervical and mediastinal involvement in PS II, however in patients with left cervical disease only in Stage III.A multivariance analysis showed no prognostic difference in PSI and PS II, but was more evident in PS II] E. Extranodal involvement had a better outcome in PSI E and PS II E compared to PS III E and PS IV. Conclusion: Extranodal involvement is found seldom in Hodgkin's disease, compared to non -Hodgkin's lymphoma. Its development correlates with the stage, the side of the involved neck and B-Symptoms. in PS III E it shows a prognostic impact. P336 BAX EXPRESSION CORRELATES WITH CELLULAR DRUG SENSITIVITY TO DOXORUBICIN, CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE AND CHLORAMBUCIL BUT NOT FLUDARABINE, CLADRIBINE OR CORTICOSTEROIDS Research Center (Berlin; Bath, GB) In B-CLL, non-proliferating B cells accumulate due to defective apoptosis. Cyto- toxic therapies trigger apoptosis and deregulation of utes been impli- cated in resistance to cytotoxic therapy. We therefore evaluated ex vivo drug sensitivity of CLL, producing chemoresponse data which are prognostic indica- tors for in in the case of purine nucleoslde analogs. To analyse the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance, we compared endogenous Bax a'nd Bcl-2 expression to ex vivo response to eight drugs, and to survival in 39 B- CLL patients. We found that reduced Bax levels correlated well with ex vivo resistance to traditional B-CLL therapies - anthracyclines, alkylating agents and vincristine (all p<0.04). Surprisingly, no such relationship was observed for the purine nucleoside analogs or corticosteroids (all p>0.5). Mutational analysis of p53 could not explain the loss of Bax protein expression. Levels of Bcl-2 were not associated with sensitivity to any drug. In contrast to the ex vivo data, neither Bax nor Bcl-2 expression nor doxorubicin sensitivity were associated with increased survival whereas sensitivity to fludarabine correlated with better overall survival (p = 0.031). These findings suggest that the resistance to purine nucleoside analogs and corticosteroids in B-CLL is due to inactivation of pathways different from those activated by anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids and alkylating agents and may be the molecular rationale for the efficacy of purine analogs in this disease. P337 MORBUS HODGKIN ON THE INTERNET M. Neumann, D. (Freiburg) Purpose: Health related Information on the WWW becomes more and more important. For Patients seeking advice and Doctors, who are confronted with these so informed Patients. But what about the quality of information? This is the systematic evaluation of health-related information for Hodgkin-Patients available on the WWW. Methods: URLs from 19 major Search Engines with the Keyword-Search ,,Hodgkin\" were collected, using Copernic Pro, a professional Meta-Search-Tool (Search Date: 2001-05-15). Filemaker Pro including a special designed questionnaire (following published criteria for high-quality web sites) was used as database to analyse the 4589 URLs. These Internet sites were proofed for relevance, the owner of the domain, quality of health-content and items like link-popularity (Do other sites have hyperlinks to this one?) and Search Engine Ranking (What is the rank of these sites when they appear in major search engines?). Results: Only 4.1% hits lead to relevant information. 95.9 % of the URLs are not available or do not have helpful information for pat[ents searching advice about M. Hodgkin. 49.3 % of the Intemet sites are institutional, 31.3 % commercial, 19.4 % private. 54.8 % inform about the prognosis of Lymphogranulomatosis. 41.9 % about therapy options, 37.1% about aetiology, 37.1% give information about side effects of radiation and/or chemotherapy, 35.5 % have information about the risks of these therapies and only 19.4 % mention the duration of such therapies. Conclusion: Accessing health information on the WWW is difficult. In the year 2001 relevant health information can be found on the WWW via search engines, but it takes a long time and a lot of energy for patients to fulfil their information needs. Institutional sites lead to the most relevant information, though accuracy of the given information on most sites is sufficient. P338 EFFICACY OF DELAYED, LOW DOSE G-CSF APPLICATION FOR ENGRAFTMENT OF AUTOLOGOUS PERIPHERAL BLOOD Medizinische Klinik I Philippusstift (Jena, Essen) G-CSF is widely used for the promotion of engraftment after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). The substantial cost of hematopoietic growth factors has spurred attempts to optimize the dosing schedule in order to reduce the expense without impairing engraftment. We have retrospectively compared two dosing schedules using (a) standard dose filgrastim 480ug starting at day +1 after autologous PBSCT versus (b) low dose lenograstim 130ug starting at day +5 after autologous PBSCT in a case series of 24 and 14 lymphoma patients, respectively. Disease distribution and stem cell graft size were comparable in both groups. In the standard dose group the median time to engraftment was 10 days, in the low dose group 11 days. The median febrile days in the standard dose group versus low dose group were 2 days and 2,5 days, respectively. The use of platelet units (7 vs. 4) and red blood cell units (4 vs. 2,5) were slightly in favor of the low dose schedule. The median days between stem cell transplantation and hospital discharge (14 vs. 14,5) were not significantly different between the two groups. Since the use of hematopoietic growth factors is an important factor of expense in peripheral blood stem cell transplantation protocols, reducing the dose of GCSF without impairing engraftment may significantly improve the cost-effectiveness of the procedure. To confirm these data a randomized trial is currently conducted. 480 ug Filgrastim starting at day +l (24 patients) i CD34x10e6in Take FeverDays PlateletUnits I Red Blood Cel[ Days from Tx to Graft ] Units Discharge Median 2.83 10 2 7 4 14 Mean 3.12 10,26 3 8.30 4.13 15.[3 Min 1,8 6 0 3 0 I0 Max 8,8 20 15 26 8 24 130 ug Lenograshm starting at day +5 (I 4 patients) CD34 x 10e6 in Take Fever Days Platelet Unit Red Blood Cell Days from Tx to Graft Units Discharge Median 2.4 ! 1 2.5 4 2.5 14.5 Mean 2.5 10.93 2.79 5.21 2.5 14.93 Min 1.51 9 0 2 0 13 Max 3.68 13 10 16 5 18 P339 THE IMPACT OF INTENSIVE PREPARATIVE REGIMENS ON MOBILISING chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation is very effective in treatment of various malignancies. The intensive preparative regimens are a risk factor for sufficient mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). Retrospectively, we analyzed the results of mobilization of PBPC from 68 patients (pts) with hematological malignancies and 33 pts with solid tumours, total 101 pts, before stem cell collection. Particularly, we investigated 8 pts with AML, 10 pts with ALL, 6 pts with CML, 19 pts with myelomas, 21 pts with high-risk or relapsed NHL, 4 pts with relapsed Hodgkin's disease, 14 pts with advanced breast cancer, 8 pts with germ cell tumours, 5 pts with sarcomas, 2 pts with bronchial tumours and 4 pts with other malignancies. PBSC were collected from pts after myelosuppressive chemotherapy and administration of rhG-CSE Aphereses were started when absolute CD34+ cell counts in peripheral blood were more than 15,0 /ml (leukemias 10,0/ml) and performed with a Cobe- Spectra-blood cell separator. For assessing success of mobilization, we determined yields of CD34+ cells in PBPC collections on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer, Becton Dickinson. To test biological function we also determined granulocyte/macrophage-colony-forming S 66 Leukemia/Lymphoma/Stem Cell Transplantation units (CFU-GM) in PBPC harvest using a clonogenic methylcellulose assay (Methocult). From 30 pts we examined CFU-GM values in bone marrow before PBPC mobilization was started.Results: We found a sufficient mobilization of PBPC in 87/100 cases inspite of intensive prior chemotherapy. 1- 4 (median 2,7) aphereses were necessary for that. We could not reach enough yield of PBPC suitable for transplantation in 14/101 cases. With respect to underlying diseases, leukemias and relapsed NHL often showed a drastic reduction in the number of mobilized PBPC.There is a relation between CFU-GM values in bone marrow before mobilization and yields in PBPC collections. Thus, CFU-GM values may be a predictor of success in mobilising PBPC. P340 ANALYSES OF is recently introduced as a therapeutic approach for patients with haematological malignancies who otherwise are not eligible for transplantation due to special risk factors. Among these risk factors infections, age, and impaired organ dysfunction are of special importance. Patients belonging to this subgroup have a significantly worse outcome or are not suitable for conventional HSCT. We analysed different lymphocyte subpopulations before transplantion and after engraftment in patients (pts) with compatible allogeneic donors transplanted between 12/1998 and 08/2001 in our unit. Pts received cyclophosphamide (120mg/kg) combined with 12 Gy total body irradiation [TBI] (17 pts.), busulfan (3 pts), or antithymocyte globulin [ATG] (3 pts). Eighteen pts were given risk-adapted, condtioning regimens, consisting either of fludarabin, busulfan, and ATG (15 pts), low dose single TBI (2 pts), or single TBI with graft-versus-host disease the conventional group (n =23) and CSA alone in the dose- modified group (n=18). In addition, 11/23 and 11/18 pts received mycophenolate mofetil because mis-matched family or unrelated donor were used. Ten out of the 23 conventional and 14 out of the 18 of dose-modified had risk factors for cytomegalo virus [CMV]-disease or reactivation (recipient and/or donor with posi- tive IgG serology). Median age of conventional group was 32 (range 19-58, 11 AML, 9 CML, 3 AA) compared to median age 47 in dose-modified group (range 21- 59, 13 AML, 3 CML, 2 MDS). Before starting or chemotherapy lymphocyte subpopulations with FACe (Becton and including CD4/CD8 ratio, CD8 (T suppressor) cells, CD16/56 (NK) cells, and NK/CD8 ratio. In spite of differences of lymphocyte subpopulations in dose-modified regimen there was GvHD II-IV (,,conventional\" 48%, ,,dose-modified\" CMV (30% respectively 29%). Differences in lymphocyte status might be due to persistence of ATG. We suppose that use of ATG in dose-modified HSCT does not influence risks for GvHD or CMV infections while its immunosuppressive effects are still present in early lymphocyte reconstitution. conventional HSCT dose-modified Introduction: Edelson et al. (1989) were the first to use extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. A good response to ECP has also been reported for several cases of autoimmune diseases like lupus vulgaris, sclerodermia and pemphigus vulgaris. Patients and material:To conduct ECP white blood cells are separated from the patient blood. This buffy coat is then irradiated with UVA light. The leukocytes have to be photosensitized by the furocumarin 8-methoxypsoralene. In our study five patients with chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD) after stem cell transplantation have been treated with ECP (table 1): Results: Three of the five patients treated with ECP showed a significant improvement of the skin symptoms (improvement > 50%). Two of the improved patients (patient 1 and 2) showed a partial remission of skin sclerosis. At the same time oral doses of immunosuppressive therapy could be reduced. One patient (patient 5) lost the skin symptoms completely, but a sicca syndrome remained. However the skin symptoms came back after the intervals between ECPs were prolonged. Patient 3 reached stable disease. Currently this patient is being treated in intervals of two weeks as longer lapses quickly lead to aggravation of disease. Patient 4 died from rapidly progressing bronchiolitis after only five cycles ECP. Discussion: After allogene stem cell transplantation cGvHD is the main reason for morbidity after the first critical 100 days of transplantation. 15 to 60 % of patients develop cGvHD. Skin and mucous-membranes are among the first organs affected. However, organs like liver, lung and gut can also be involved. Rossitt[ et al. (1996) have presented eight patients with therapy resistant GvHD they had treated with ECE Four of them showed a dramatic improvement of the skin symptoms and a significant improvement of Karnofsky-index (40% and more). A study of Abhyankar showed an improvement of skin and mucous membranes in over 70 % of the 53 followed patients. We observed similar results. Three of the five treated patients showed an improvement of skin symptoms. But in our study we failed to show beneficial effects on the mucous membranes. ECP is a helpful additional therapeutic tool for adjuvant therapy of GvHD - especially for therapy resistant cases or cases with severe side effects through immunosuppression. age/so\u00d7 disease status at transplant donor donor-sex Conditioning regimen gra\u007fsource onset GVHD (month post-BMT) Interval BMT-ECP (month) Symptoms skin mouth lung Therapy pre-ECP Steroids cyclDsporin A Mycophene;at + C7clo rB~ + Cycle TB[ + Cycle rBt * Cycle TS[ + Cycle blood stem cells )toed stem cells blood stem Cells )lood stem ce{~s blood stem cel~s 12 13 1~ +++ ++++:+ n~mber of cycles 13 16 3~ 14 fellow up (month) 13 alive 16 alive 16 a~ive tO alive death after 4 month Itab[e I. TREATMENT OF WALDENSTRCIM'S MACROGLOBULINEMIA WITH INTERFERON ALPHA AND RITUXIMAB - 2 cytokines like Rituximab is admitted for therapy of relapsed or refractory NHL, remission rates of about 50% and a time to progression from 10-13 months are described. Theoretically a sequence of IFN- alpha followed by Rituximab should achieve better results than Rituximab alone because more lymphoma-cel]s could be destroyed by the antibody after CD20- up-regulation. Data from a recent phase II study on patients with CD20 positive low grade lymphoma demonstrated a higher initial response rate in the group treated with interferon alpha followed by rituximab than in the group treated with rituximab alone. We report two cases of patients with WM, which we treated with a sequence of IFN-alpha and Rituximab after several preliminary therapies have failed. The first patient shows now an ongoing partial remission since april 2001. The second patient had a time to progression of 34 months after sequential therapy with IFN- alpha and Rituximab. This could point to a superiority of the described regimen in MW also concerning duration of remission. Further clinical trials are needed. P'343 UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING AFTER ADMINISTRATION OF THE CD-20 ANTIBODY RITUXIMAB (MABTHERA) IN A administration of CD20 antibody Rituxim in a case of occult Richter's syndrome History and findings. A 58-year old patient with a history chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was hospitalized with worsening physical condition and cachexia because of progres- sive disease. Prior to admission he had been treated with several chemotherapies, including fludarabine. Investigations.Prior to administration of the humanized, monoclonal CD-20 antibody Rituximab peripheral blood and a peripheral lymphe node were analyzed by flow cytometry and no evidence of a high grade lymphoma was found. Diagnosis, treatment and courselnfusion of Rituximab was well tolerated. Only a transient rise in body temperature (39.9\u00b0C) was noted. Three days later he developed S 67 Leukemia/Lymphoma/Stem Cell Transplantation / Pancreatic Cancer and Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP) hematemesis and melena with a drop of hemoglobin to 8.5 g/dl and the patient was admitted. On endoscopic exploration three large gastric ulcers with no evidence of an acute bleeding were discovered. Histologiscal studies revealed a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. ConclusionAIthough analysis of peripheral blood and a peripheral lymphe node by flow cytometry did not show any sign of a transformation to a high grade lymphoma, the patient had developed a gastric transformation of CLL to diffuse large cell lymphoma (Richter's syndrome). It is suspected that the monoclonal antibody Rituximab effectively destroyed the highly malignant gastric lymphoma leading to an upper gastric intestinal bleeding. There are no pathognomonic clinical features for Richter's syndrome. If Richter's syndrome is suspected thorough examinations to exclude high grade lymphoma should be performed prior to administration of Rituximab. P'344 PRIMARY TESTICULAR PLASMACYTOMA FOLLOWING NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER. CASE REPORT. K.D. Haase, J. actually 76 years old male patient was diagnosed with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in September 2000. No surgery was performed. From November 2000 thru January 2001 the patient underwent radiotherapy (RT), given a total reference dose of 6,800 cGy. Follow-up reveared lasting local tumor control. In May 2001, the patient presented a swelling of the right and an induration of the left testicle, suspicious for testicular tumor. Method: Testicular biopsy led to the quick section diagnosis of a high-grade malignant ncn-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Findings were confirmed by further preparation of the specimens. Radiological examination showed bone metastases which were probably related to the pre-existing lung cancer, and abdominal lymphomas. Since the patient was non-symptomatic with respect to his bone lesions he received two courses of chemotherapy (CHOP) until July 2001 for stage 112E NHL, and then became a candidate for consolidating radiotherapy (RT). Results: Reviewing the patient's medical history on occasion of the RT planning procedure, some discrepancies occurred. Finally, the diagnosis had to be reverted from NHL into anaplastic plasmacytoma due to a report of the Kiel Lymph Node Reference Center. Therefore, testicular biopsy was repeated but was showing necrotic tissue only. At that time point there was no indication for further therapeutic measures. In November 2001 the patient experienced a testicular tumor relapse. Actually he is undergoing palliative RT of the testicles. Discussion: Primary plasmacytoma of the testicle is very rare, though publications on this primary tumor site are rare, as well. Especially, no data seem to be available referring to plasmacytoma in co-incidence with metastatic NSCLC. In addition, this case might point out the difficulty how to discriminate plasmacytoma from some subgroups of NHL. P'345 THERAPY WITH LIPOSOMAL-ENCAPSULATED DOXORUBICIN IN THE VAD-PROTOCOL FOR PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA: A PHASE I/ll STUDY G. Dingeldein, M. Hoffmann, G. H~bner, T. Kubin, H. Link, J. Fischer, M. Uppenkamp, Med.Klinik A, Klinikum Ludwigshafen, Med. Klinik A, Karlsruhe (Ludwigshafen, Kaiserslautern, Karlsruhe) Introduction: Standard first-line treatment for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who do not qualify for high-dose therapy and stem cell transplantation is melphalan/prednisone. Patients with relapse are usually treated with an anthra- \"cycline containing regimens, e.g. the VAD-scheme. We initiated in 02/2000 a phase l/If multi-center trial for patients with relapsed and progressive MM, stage II and III with Caelyx\u00ae (liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin) as cardio- and myelotoxic and does not induce alopecia. Because of the prolonged plasma half-life of approximately 48 hours, the treatment with ]iposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin can be given in a single dose intravenously without the necessity of a central venous catheter. Patients with the age ranging from 18-75 years who have relapsed from at least one pretreatment with progres- sive disease were enrolled. Patients: Seven patients have been treated up to now. Five patients between the age of 66-73 of age were treated with 3 cycles of VLAD at dose level I (liposomal doxorubicin 30 mg/m2); two patients at dose level II (40 mg/m2). 3 patients had been pretreated with 2 and 3 with 3 regimens. Three patients had received additional radiotherapy to the spine. received vincristine 1,4 mg/m2 i.v., Caelyx\u00ae 30 mg/m2 II) 9-12, and 17-20. was given in a dose of 100 mg p.o. twice daily to reduce the risk of hand- and foot syndrome. Results: All 23 cycles at dose level I and II were evaluable for toxicity assess- ment. No hematological toxicities WHO-grade Ill and IV, and no cardiotoxi-city were observed during the first three cycles. One patient exhibited fever WHO- grade Ill with a positive blood culture for listeria, without neutropenia. One patient suffered from a polyneuropathia WHO-grade Ill after 4 cycles of VLAD, probably related to vincristine. One patient had a mucositis WHO-grade IV and another patient suffered from skin toxicity grade II1. No hand- and foot-syndrome was seen in our patients. Conclusions: Application of the VLAD-protocol at dose level I (30 mg/m2) is feasible. The MTD has not been reached so far. After defining the MTD this study will be continued as a phase II trial to evaluate the activity of the regimen. Pancreatic Cancer and Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP) Oral Presentation 0346 PROGNOSTIC FACTORS IN DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE PANCREAS MLiller, (M~Jnster) The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate a variety of factors with reference to their prognostic significance for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with sprecial reference to the UICC classification from 1997. 265 patients 61.6 years _+10[25-82]) (1994-1998) with histologically verified ductal adenocarcinoma were included into the study. 86 (33%) tumors had been resected, 179 (67%) were irresectable. Tumors were classified according to the UICC criteria from 1997, survival estimates were determined according to Kaplan-Meier. Univariate analysis was carried out by Log-Rank-Test, multivariate analysis by Cox-Regression.Out of 26 factors univariate analysis identified the following as significant only: p=.O04). identified the following parameters to be of prognostic significance in all patients: M- (.001), G-category (.018), tumor diameter (.011), histological subtype (.017), CA 19-9 (.012), principal symptom (.018). In patients with resectable disease T- category (.021), stage (.008) as well as histological subtype (.004) and in patients with irresectable cancer N- (.047), M-category (.006) and postoperative complications (.001) were identified to be of prognostic significance by multivariate analysis. Median survival was 22.5 months (m) in patients with the most favorable combination of prognostic factors, and 2.5 m in patients with the most unfavorable combination (n=17) (p<10-4). One-year survival was 73% and stage are of prognostic significance only for patients with resectable disease. Thus UICC criteria for definition of stages are of limited value for patients with irresectable disease. Moreover our results indicate that resectable and irresectable tumors are determined by different prognostic factors. As a consequence the two entities must be differentiated in any classification. 0347 PHASE II MULTICENTER STUDY OF GEMCITABINE AND DOCETAXEL IN PATIENTS WITH INOPERABLE OR METASTATIC PANCREATIC CANCER C. Schmidt, J. Fahlke, E. Kettner, L. Greiner, R. Kuhn, K. patients with advanced pancreatic cancer is primarily aimed at improving quality of life. We combined gemcitabine with docetaxel, a new promising agent with a different mechanism of action, in an attempt to enhance therapeutic efficacy. In a previous dose-finding study we found that weekly doses of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 and docetaxel 35 mg/m 2 were well tolerated. Therefore we initiated a phase II multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy of this combination with regard to response and survival in patients with locally advanced inoperable or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Patients and Methods: To date, 51 patients have been enrolled in the study, and 37 are evaluable for toxicity (19 females, 12 males, median age 61 years [range 40-72]). Thirteen patients had primary inoperable, locally advanced disease, and 24 patients had metastatic disease, predominantly affecting the liver. Treatment consisted of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 and docetaxel 35 mg/m 2 given on days 1, 8 and 15, repeated every 28 days following restaging. Treatment was continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Results: Twenty-nine patients are evaluable for response. There were 1 CR (3%), 6 PR (21%), 18 SD (62%) and 4 PD (14%). Median survival was 9 months. Toxicity was generally mild to moderate except for elopecia. No WHO grade 4 toxicities were observed. Conclusions: Combined weekly gemcitabine and docetaxel chemotherapy resulted in an increased response rate and encouraging quality of life compared with a historical control group treated with single agent gemcitabine. Thus, a phase III comparison of gemcitabine/docetaxel versus gemcitabine alone appears worthwhile. 0348 VALUE AND RESULTS OF REGIONAL INTRAARTERIAL (I.A.) CHEMOTHERAPY IN ADVANCED PANCREATIC CARCINOMA F. Lippert, K. (Magdeburg) Locoregional i.a. chemotherapy may provide high cytostatic concentrations within the tumor &, simultaneously, a low rate of side effects compared with systemic administration of antineoplastic drugs. In addition, this may lead to an increase of tumor response rates & prolongation of survival time. The aim of the study was i) to evaluate the benefit of an i.a. infusion of cytostatic drugs via the coeliac trunc on tumor response rate & survival time, 2) to elucidate problems & risks, & 3) to achieve an improvement of overall therapeutic management in pancreatic S 68 Pancreatic Cancer and Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP) carcinoma. Methods: In 22 patients (12 females, 10 males; mean of age, 57.1 years) with advanced pancreatic carcinoma (confirmed by histopatholegy), i.a. chemotherapy was administered. Through a catheter, which was inserted via femoral artery (Seldinger technique) & placed with the tip in the coeliac trunc, 2 different drug combinations were given. Group A (n=12): Bolus injection of a gemisch, consisting of epirubicin and Amilomer (Spherex\u00ae), followed by short- time infusion of folic acid & 24-hour infusion of 5-FU. Group B (d2-4), & cisplatin (d5). Treatment was repeated in both groups every 4 weeks. Tumor response was assessed using computed tomegraphy every 8 weeks. Results: In group A, there was 1 CR & 1 PR, resulting in a remission rate of 16.6%. Two patients showed SD, while in 2/3 of patients (n=8), PD was found. Median survival time was 3 months, 1-year survival rate was 33.3% (4 of 12 patients). In group B, again 1 CR & 1 PR were observed (remission rate, 20%). In 3 cases, SD & in 50% of patients (n=5), PD were documented. Median survival was 7.0 months, 1-year survival rate was 20% (2 of 10 patients). Comparing both groups, there was no significant difference of the survival. In addition, no significant prolongation of survival time was found in comparison with patients treated with systemic chemotherapy. Though a tendency of poorer outcome of i.a. chemotherapy was seen comparing the Kaplan-Meier curves of survival, this difference was not statistically significant (log rank test, P=0.08). In conclusion, despite conceptional & pharmacokinetic advantages of Iocoregional i.a. chemotherapy, better outcome with regard to tumor response rate & survival time could not be found. I.a. chemotherapy is, therefore, still an experimental treatment option in pancreatic carcinoma & can, currently, not be recommended for routine use. 0349 ANTIANGIOGENIC THERAPY FOR PANCREATIC CANCER: SPECIFIC TARGETING DT-VEGF Buhr, UK Benjamin Franklin, FU Berlin, USC, Department of Medicine, UCLA, Department of Surgery, UCLA, Department of surgery (Berlin, Los Angeles) Background: Anti-angiogenesis is a novel treatment strategy for pancreatic can- cer (PaCa), which is almost resistant against radiochemotherapy. Activated en- dothelial cells of the tumor vasculature abundantly express receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key mediator of tumor neoangiogenesis. The aim of the present study was to specifically target and damage the vasculature of pancreatic cancer by fusing the VEGF isoform VEGF165 to the diphtheria toxin (DT), which inhibits the protein synthesis of target cells. Methods: VEGF165 fusion protein containing 390 amino acids of DT with the enzymatic and translocation domains was produced with GST in vector pGEX-KG and expressed in E. coil SG12036. In-vitro: Two human PaCa cell lines (AsPC-1, HPAF-2, moderately differentiated) and human endothelial cells (HUVEC) were exposed to increasing concentrations (1 ng/ml - 10000 ng/ml) of DT-VEGE Cell proliferation was assessed after 3 days by cell count and M]q-- assay. In-vivo: 1 mm 3 fragments of sc. PaCa donor tumors were implanted into the pancreas of nude mice which received either DT-VEGF (200 pg/kg, every other day) or vehicle (control) ip. for 14 weeks. Volume of primary tumor (TU-Vol), metastatic spread (Met-Score), and animal weight were determined at autopsy. Micrevessel density (MVD) was analyzed in CD31-stained tumor sections. Results: In-vitro: Proliferation of the PaCa ceils was significantly inhibited at high concentrations of DT-VEGF (> 1000 ng/ml). In contrast, DT-VEGF effectively de- creased growth of In-vivo: table (*=p<0.05 vs. Control) Conclusions: DT-VEGF fusion protein reduces tumor growth and metastatic spread of pancreatic cancer in vivo, resulting in increased 14-week survival of the animals, in vitro data and reduced MVD indicate that this effect is due to the toxic effect of DT-VEGF on endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature rather than to direct inhibition of PaCa cell growth. DT-VEGF therapy was not associated with systemic side effects such as weight loss in vivo. AsPC-1 AsPC-1 20 ASSOCIATED DETECTION OF DISSEMINATED TUMOR CELLS IN BONE MARROW AND VENOUS BLOOD IS OF LIMITED VALUE IN CARCINOMA OF THE PANCREAS H.H. Welters, C. Schleicher, (MOnster, M0nchen) Although the prognosis of pancreatic carcinoma is poor, there are stage related differences in survival. One cause for the development of systemic spread may be preexisting disseminated tumor cells in blood and bone marrow. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether tumor cell detection based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for cytokeratin (CK) 20, correlates with tumor stages in order to evaluate whether this method may serve as predictive indicator for the extent of tumor. Bone marrow and venous blood (pre- and postoperatively) of 16 male and 11 female patients (64 years (_+12 [31-82]) with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were investigated. Samples were taken before laparotomy and postoperatively. All samples underwent centrifugation with ficoll for isolation of mononuclear cells, with subsequent extraction of mRNA, reverse transcription and CK 20 specific nested PCR. Eleven (44%) patients underwent resection, in 14 (56%) patients tumors were irresectable. Only 1 (9%) patient with resectable tumors displayed a positive signal for CK 20 in the bone marrow, while this held true for 6 (43%) patients with irresectable carcinomas (p=0.09). Tumor stages n=2; stage Ih n=3; stage IV a n=12; stage iV b: n=3. In 7 out of 25 bone marrow samples (28%) PCR revealed CK20 specific bands with an increased frequency in high tumor stages: HI/Ill n=0, 18 (72%) patients displayed a positive CK 20 signal, while this held true postoperatively for 15 (60%). There was no association with tumor stages or resectability, since distribution of positive signals was highly variable among tumor stages. Tumor cell dissemination to bone marrow seems to be a late event, since only patients with stage iV had positive findings. This was substantiated by a trend for positive CK 20 signals in bone marrow samples from patients with irresectable tumors. In contrast venous samples displayed positive signals more frequently not correlating with extent of disease. This may indicate false positive findings due to hematogenous translocation of non-neoplastic epithelial cells during surgery which are unable to migrate to the bone marrow. Although follow-up of patients is too short to evaluate outcome, CK 20 does not be more informative with reference to the extent of disease than conventional stages and thus is of very limited value Poster P351 IN VITRO GROWTH INHIBITION OF HUMAN PANCREATIC CANCER CELLS BY THE NOVEL PHOPHOINOSITOL-3-KINASE LY294002 present kinase with intracellular second messenger function. Several key roles for cell differ-entiation, cell growth and cellular survival are being discussed. Four newly established pancreatic cancer cell lines (UKEPC-99, SCH-PC-00, KOE-PC-00, LEF-PC-00) were different concentrations (lpM, 5 #M, 10 #M) for different intervals (24, 48, 72 hours). Control assays contained DMSO. The num-ber of vital cells were counted using trypan-blue, furthermore, vitality was evaluated morphologically using HE staining. Presence and amount of apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL-assays. Incubation of the pan-creatic cancer cells with PI3K-Inhibitor LY294002 results in a time and dose related reduction of cell growth (e.g. UKE-PC-99: IlJM: 24 hours 1:260000\u00b120000, 48 the other three cell lines). HE-staining re-vealed significant morphologic changes of the cells, which correlated with concentration and time of incubation of the cells. Measurement of apoptosis revealed a significant correlation of amount of apoptoses with PI3K-Inhibitor incubation (e.g. results The PI3K- Inhibitor LY294002 is a potent inhibi-tor of cellular growth in human pancreatic cancer cells. The effect of this substance in an in vivo model is being tested now, furthermore the effect of LY294002 in the mouse model as well as possible cellular signaling of LY294002 by NF-kB is tested. P352 EXPRESSION OF TUMORSUPPRESSOR GENE MASPIN IN HUMAN PANCREAS inhibitor with tumor suppressive potential in breast and prostate cancer, acting at the level of tumor invasion and metastasis. Maspin is expressed in normal human mammary and prostate epithelial but down-regulated during cancer progression. In this study, we analyzed the expression of maspin in various human cancer cells using Northern blot and immunohistochemistry. Maspin gene expression was not detected in any of 6 gastric cancers, 4 melanomas, or 6 of 7 breast cancer cell lines examined. In contrast, 5 of 9 pancreatic cancer cell lines showed maspin mRNA expression, although maspin expression was not detected in normal pancreatic tissue. The expression of maspin in pancreatic cancer cell lines was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining using a monoclonal maspin antibody. Subsequently, ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas obtained from pancreatic cancer patients were examined by means of immunohistochemistry. A strong cytoplasmic staining was observed in 23 of 24 ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas. Intraductal extensions of S 69 Pancreatic Cancer and Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP) the carcinomas also showed positive staining, whereas ductal hyperplasia hyperplasia, was nega- tive. The only case that did not stain positively was a rare type of clear cell ductal adenocarcinoma. In contrast, no expression was observed in corresponding normal pancreatic tissues. These results indicate that maepin gene expression is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer, in contrast to its down-regulation in breast and prostate cancers. Our results show that maspin is a new factor associated with pancreatic cancer. In addition, the detection of maspin in pancreatic tumor tissues and its lack of expression in all normal pancreatic tissues suggest that maspin may be a useful marker of primary human pancreatic cancer. P353 PHASE II TRIAL OF A 24-HOUR INFUSION OF GEMCITABINE IN PREVIOUSLY UNTREATED PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED PANCREATIC CANCER F. Eckel, R. Schmelz, is not dose-response related but schedule-dependent. Based on the results of a published phase I study in patients with NSCLC (Anderson et al, Br J Cancer 1996) and a pilot study (Eckel et al, Cancer Invest 2002) we started a phase II trial of weekly 24-hour infusion of gemcitabine in previously untreated patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Methods: 18 patients with histologically proven and irresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were enrolled. Gemcitabine 100 mg/m 2 was infused over 24 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 in an outpatient setting. Treatment was repeated every 28 days until disease progression or limiting toxicity. Response was assessed every second course by computed tomography. The EORTC core questionnaire (QLQ- C30) was used for quality of life evaluation. Results: 18 patients (mean age 68 years) received a total of 356 infusions with a median number of 9 infusions/patient (range 2-49). There was no grade 4 hematologic toxicity. Short lasting neutropenia and thrombocytopenia grade 3 occurred in 1 and 1 patient, respectively. Nonhematologic toxicity was oral mucositis (1 patient grade 3), hand-foot-syndrome (1 patient grade 3), and flu-like-symptoms (1 patient grade 4). 1 partial response and 2 minor responses were observed, 4 further patients had stable disease. CA 19-9 levels decreased by more than 50% in 5 patients, while 2 patients had reductions of 45% and 48%, respectively. Median time to progression of disease was 4.4 months. Improvement of the EORTC-C30 scores of more than 10 points was observed in 6 patients (pain), in 6 patients (overall symptom scales), in 3 patients (overall functioning scales), and in 3 patients (global quality of life), respectively. Conclusion: Weekly 24-hour infusion of gemcitabine in previously untreated patients with advanced pancreatic cancer can be savely administered in an outpatient setting. It shows marginal antitumor activity in terms of response rate. However, the 24-hour infusion (100 mg/m 2) seems to be as active as the standard 30- minute gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2). Relatively long median time to progression of disease and improvement of symptom and quality of life scores suggest, that patients may benefit from 24-hour gemcitabine. P354 IS NEOADJUVANT RADIOCHEMOTHERAPY A RESULTS IN CURATIVELY RESECTABLE PANCREATIC CARCINOMA? T. Meyer, S. Merkel, adjacent vessels and lymphatic spread are among the main causes for the poor prognosis of pancreatic carcinoma. Even in curatively resected cases the chance for cure is limited due to Iocoregional or systemic recurrence. Patients and Methods: Between 1995 and 2000 180 patients (pts.) with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head were treated. 50 pts. presented with distant metastases and were excluded from analysis. Thin-slice CT scan was used to evaluate resectability. 42 out of 130 pts. (32 %) received neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy for advanced, primarily non-resectable carcinoma (5-FU 1000 mg/m2/d, 120 h continuous infusion, 1st and 5th week; Mitomycin C 10 mg/m2, d 2 Resectability was re-evaluated 6 weeks after radiochemotherapy. The remaining 88 pts. were excluded from surgery for Iocoregiona] irresectability or explored if judged resectable. Results: 36 out of 88 pts. (41%) without preoperative radiochemetherapy could be resected. Curative resection (R0) was possible in 78 % of these pts (n= 28). 14 out of 42 pts. (33 %) were resectable following neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy, 13 of these pts. (93 %) could be curatively resected (R0). Median survival time for the non-pretreated group (n = 88) was 9 months and 19.5 months for non-pretreated, curatively resected pts. In the neoadjuvant group (n = 42) median survival time rated 13.5 months. 8 out of 13 curative]y resected pts. are alive between 7 and 49.5 months postoperatively (median survival time not yet reached). Conclusions: Neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy is effective and increases the rate of curative resections. It also seems to prolong median survival. It is necessary to further investigate these observations in a prospectively-randomized multicenter phase III trial. P355 P161NK4A FAMILIAL PANCREATIC CANCER Bartsch, S.A. Hahn, M. Sina-Frey, S. Lang, R. Kress, B. Gerdes, R. GrL~tzmann, M. Colombo-Benkmann, J. Schmidt, A. Ziegler, H. Rieder, Department of Surgery, Philipps-University Marburg, Dept. of Internal Medicine Ruhr-University, Clinical Genetics, Philipps-University Medical Epidemiology, Philipps-University Marburg, Dept. of Surgery, Philipps-University Marburg, Dept. of Surgery, TU Dresden, Dept. of Surgery, University MQnster, Dept. of Surgery, University Heidelberg (Marburg, Bochum, Dresden, MOnster, Heidelberg) Introduction: The genetic basis of familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) is still widely unknown. Recently, it has been shown that germline mutations in the tumor suppressor genes p161NK4a and BRCA2 can predispose to the development of pancreatic cancer (PC). Therefore, the role of p161NK4 and BRCA2 germline mutations in FPC kindreds was evaluated. Methods: 14 FPC families with at least 2 first degree relatives with confirmed PC and 4 pancreatic cancer/melanoma syndrome (PCMS) families with at least one patient with PC and another first degree relative with malignant melanoma of the German national case collection of familial pancreatic cancer (FaPaCa) were analysed for p161NK4 and BRCA2 germline mutations by direct DNA sequencing. All participating family members were genetically counselled and evaluated by a three generation pedigree. Results: In 2 of 4 PCMS families and in 1 of 14 FPC families p161NK4a germline mutations were identified in affected patients, p161NK4a mutations were Q42X (c.188C>T) and R102X (c.323-324insG) in the FPC family. BRCA2 germline mutations were detected in 3 of 14 FPC families, but in none of the PCMS families. BRCA2 frameshift mutations identified were c.6819delTG and c.6672insT in exon 11. The third family revealed a double mutation, namely c. 9455G>A in exon 24 and c.10323delCins11 in exon 27, that is yet characterized as an unclassified variant. Notably, in 2 of these 3 families one female patient each developed breast cancer prior to the occurrence of pancreatic cancer. Conclusions: These data indicate that the accumulation of PC is associated with germline mutations in the tumor suppressor genes p161NK4a and BRCA2 in a significant proportion of FPC families, which might have important impact on screening modalities. P356 DOSE ESCALATION TRIAL USING HYPOFRACTIONATED SIMULTANEOUS RADIOCHEMOTHERAPY CANCER, with irresectable pancreatic cancer and poor overall prognosis. Materials and methods: 23 patients, mean age: 61.3 years (50-83 years), disease stage: II 17.5 %, III 52.1%, IV 30.4 %, have been treated from June 1995 to August 2000 with hypefractionated radiotherapy in a dose escalation trial. Conformal radiation techniques were used, all patients were treated with 4 times 3.0 Gy per week. 6 patients received a total dose of 24 Gy, 10 patients a dose of 30 Gy, and 7 patients a total dose of 36 Gy. 5-FU as a continuous infusion (300 mg/sq. 24 h, day 1-15 including weekends) was concurrently applied. Results: We observed no serious side effect except one oral mucositis II]% 53 % of the patients suffered from nausea which was controlled with oral medication. No late effects III \u00b0 occurred. In more than 50 % of the patients pain improved. Conclusion: Hypofractionated radiotherapy in 3.0 Gy fractions with concurrent continuous infusion of 5-FU is feasible to total dose of 36 Gy. It is a time sparing treatment for tHs patient group with a poor overall survival. The palliative effect is encouraging. This kind of treatment is now considered the standard palliative radiochemotherapy schedule in locally advanced irresectable pancreatic cancer in our clinic. It will be further evaluated in sequential concepts with neoadjuvant intention. P357 FROM DATABASE MINING TO PROTEOMIC PROFILING: A NEW APPROACH FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF TARGET PROTEINS IN PANCRATIC CARCINOMA I. AIIdinger, C. Pilarsky, M. Peiper, Eppendorf, (Dresden, Berlin, Hamburg, Mannheim) AIM Patients with pancreatic carcinoma still have, even with resectable tumor, a very poor prognosis. Despite of increasing knowledge about the molecular basis of pancreatic carcinoma no specific marker for earlier diagnosis nor a target protein for a new therapeutic approach have been identified so far. METHODS Mining both public (e.g. dbEST) and commercial (e.g. Incyte\u00ae) databases containing sequences that originate from cDNA libraries from different tissue cell types and tumors differentially expressed cDNA sequences have been identified. Using Affymetrix\u00ae technology a DNA micro array was designed representing 4000 genes and used to investigate the mRNA expression pattern of 10 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, five commercially available and five cell lines recently established from tumor of resected patients. Expression levels were compared to those of benign pancreatic duct cells. Commercially available antibodies against proteins encoded by differentially expressed genes were used for immunohisto- chemical staining of both tumor and normal pancreatic tissue. S 70 Pancreatic Cancer and Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP) RESULTS Genes differentially expressed in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines are presented, among them genes known to be involved in tumorigenesis such as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, but also ORFs and genes encoding for proteins of yet unknown function. Protein expression in human pancreatic tissue of a fraction of the differentially expressed genes is presented and compared to mRNA expression data of the cell lines. CONCLUSION DNA micro array technology has proven as a useful tool to sort out of the vast amount of genes involved in the cell cyclus a limited number suitable for further investigation. Gene expression profiling in tumor cell lines helps in the identification of proteins to be analyzed in human tissue. P358 RESULTS OF SURGICAL TREATMENT IN 220 PATIENTS WITH PANCREATIC CARCINOMA (CA) AND ITS PROGNOSTIC PARAMETERS AFTER R0 RESECTION Ridwelski, H. Lippert, Universit~.tsklinikum (Magdeburg) Currently, resection is the only established therapeutic option with curative potential in pancreatic Ca. The aim of the study was to analyze value of surgical therapy & to detect the relevant factors, which determine survival. Methods: 220 patients with pancreatic Ca (mean of age, 61.4 years; sex ratio, 104 females/116 males) underwent surgery. Histologic investigation revealed 19 Ca of the papilla of Vater & 201 ductal pancreatic Ca (head, n=174; body or tail, n=25; unknown, 2). In 126 patients, stage IVa/b of the tumor was found. In each patient with stage I (n=26), II (n=17) & III (n=51), underwent tumor resection with primary curative intention (50%): Pancreatic head (n=96), 2 total pancreatectomies, 12 left resections of the pancreas. R0 resection was achieved in 94 cases (42.7%; R1, n=10; R2, n=6). In gastroenterostomies, 17 biliodigestive anastomoses, 15x at both sites) & 50 laparotomies were performed. In 42.3% of patients, postoperative (p.o.) complications were found, but only 12 individuals letality, 5.4%; p.o. letality of pancreatic resections, survival time was 9.0 months, 5-year survival rate of Ca of the papilla of Vater & pancreatic Ca was 73.3% & (median survival time, 66.0 & 14.0 months, resp.). Taken all interventions together, median survival time ranged between 4.0 (palliative intervention) to 19.0 months (R1 resection). No patient survived 5 years. The most relevant prognostic factor was R0 resection. Prognosis is further determined by tumor site, staging of the tumor (according to UlCC), T&N category & grading. Conclusion: Resection of pancreatic Ca according to oncological criteria (tumor-free margins) can be considered a treatment option with curative potential. Despite relative high p.o. morbidity rate, only a low letality rate was found. The 5-year survival rate of 16.2% in ductal pancreatic Ca underlines the demand for the development of more effective multimodal therapeutic concepts. Interventions with primary palliative intention or resections with detectable residu- al tumor mass in situ lead to only marginal prolongation of survival time, can not be considered a reasonable treatment alternative & are of value only for the treatment of tumor-associated problems. P359 DELAY OF DIAGNOSIS IN PANCREATIC CANCER DUE TO SUSPECTED SYMPTOMATIC CHOLELITHIASIS M. B. Ghadimi, O. Horstmann, H. Becket, Universitaetsklinikum Goettingen (Goettingen) A single center study was conducted to examine the frequency of cholecystectomies, both open and laparoscopie, up to two years prior to the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. In particular, it was of interest to investigate whether a diagnostic delay exists in a significant number of pancreatic cancer patients and if these patients already have symptoms or findings at the time of cholecystectomy which might have been indicative of the underlying malignant disease. It is demonstrated that 17 out of 186 pancreatic cancer patients (9%) underwent a cholecystectomy within two years before cancer diagnosis. A significant number of these patients showed a considerable weight loss at the time of the cholecystectomy. It is hypothesized that symptoms which have led to cholecystectemies in these patients most likely were related to the pancreatic cancer. Due to the resulting delay of pancreatic cancer diagnosis the resection rate with curative intent decreases to 35% from 44% in the whole series. Patients suffering from cholecystolithiasis and showing atypical symptoms or other notable findings such as considerable weight loss might be assessed in more detail pre- as well as postoperatively in order to minimize the diagnostic delay in pancreatic cancer and to avoid unnecessary operations. P360 OUTCOME OF PATIENTS AFTER INCIDENTAL R1-RESECTION OF DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE PANCREAS M. Colombo-Benkmann, patients who undergo potentially curative resection for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The objective of the present retrospective study was to evaluate the outcome of such patients after Whipple's resection with special reference to further therapeutic regimens. In 26 (36%) out of 73 patients who underwent potentially curative resection from 1994 until 1998, postoperative histological examination revealed neoplastic infiltration of retroperitoneal resection borders. Twelve (46%) out of these patients (group A G:E= 8:4; 59 (_+13128-76])) while patients (group B G:E= 10:4; 60 years (_+12 [27-77])) underwent no further treatment. Comparative cohorts comprised patients who had undergone R0-resection with pT3/pT4-tumors (group C: G:E = 15:20; 62 years standardized (44.8 Gy; + leucovorin) after laparotomy = 22:19; 60 years (_+10 [25-75]). Stages were classified according to UICC criteria (1997), survival was estimated according to Kaplan-Meier. There were no significant differences between group A-C regarding tumor stages (A: II n=2, III n=6, n=2), pT-, pN-, and G-categories. In group D higher tumor stages were significantly more frequent (11 n=3; III n=4; IVa n=34, p<.001). There was a significant inverse correlation between diameter of the primary lesion and resectability (r = -.607; p<.001). Median survival 20.1 months (m) in group A, 10.1 m in group B, 15.5 m in group C, and 9 m in group D (p=.006). Two-year survival also differed not influence survival, if no additional treatment is carried out, since outcome is similar to patients who do net undergo resection. In contrast Rl-resection followed by subsequent radio-/radiochemotherapy, increases median and 2-year survival to similar percentages as observed after R0-resection. However there is no effect on Iongterm survival. Our results indicate that patients with incidental Rl-resection of ductal adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas may experience may benefit from postoperative palliative treatment. However further prospective studies are required to substantiate our findings. Publication only P'361 SIMULTANEOUS RADIO-CHEMOTHERAPY WITH PACLITAXEL (TAXOL\u00ae) IN NON-RESECTABLE ADENOCARCINOMA OF M. Wolf, R. Engenhart-Cabillic, Philipps-Universit~it-Marburg (Marburg) Objective: Goal of this therapeutic approach was to reduce severity of pain and to improve survival with a combined radio-chemotherapy with Paclitaxel (Taxol). Material & Methods: From 1994 to 2000 16 patients (12 male, 4 female) with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (1 T1, 1 T2, 6 T3, 7 T4) were treated. Patient age ranged from 45 to 74 years (mean 61 yrs.). In 12 cases the tumor was non-reeectable, 4 pts. had undergone palliative surgery. All patients underwent a three-dimensional planned percutaneous linac radiotherapy with single doses of 1.5 to 2.0 Gy (5 fx/wk) up to cumulative radiation doses of 30 to 51 Gy. In addition weekly repeated paclitaxel with a dosage of 80 mg/m2 was given intravenously. After delivering 36 Gy re-staging was performed. In case of partial regression or no change therapy was continued, otherwise the treatment was ceased (1 pt.). Results: Radiation doses ranged from 30 to 51 Gy (mean 46 Gy), 1 to 8 (mean 4.6) courses of chemotherapy were given. Treatment toxicity was mild. We observed 9/16 leucopenia. Anaemia, thrombocytopenia or side effects to the digestive tract did not exceed WHO \u00b011. Two abscesses occured, one subcutaneously in-field, one in the liver. 5/16 cases showed radiologically remission, 2x CR, 3x PR, and 9x NC. 5/16 patients suffering from severe abdominal pain reported complete (1/5) or partial remission (3/5) of their symptoms. In one case no change occured. 5 patients suffered from icterus and weight loss. These patients remained without pain. ]n 3/16 symptoms of disturbed gastrointestinal passage decreased during therapy. No information concerning initial symptoms could be obtained in 3 cases. Tumor markers decreased in 10/16, remained stable in one and increased in another one case, respectively. All patients died from tumor progression or metastases. The mean survival without progression after diagnosis was 13 months (minimum 3 months, maximum 14 months). Median overall survival was 14 months, one-year survival was 56%. Conclusion: The combination treatment with radiotherapy and Paclitaxel is well tolerated and improves the B-symptoms quite effectively. Nevertheless, this was accompanied only by a moderate survival improvement in comparison to the literature. This has to be proven in further studies. P'362 SIMULTANEOUSLY TRANSHIATAL ESOPHAGECTOMY AND PYLORUS PRE- SERVING PANCREATDUODENECTOMY FOR DOUBLE PRIMARY CANCER T. Zinner, L. Baron, N. Schuster, Krankenhaus Neuk611n (Berlin) A case of a 69 years old patient who underwent a transhiatal Esophagectomy and pylorus-preserving pancreatduodenectomy in a one-stage procedure for synchronous double primary cancer of the thoracic esophagus and the head of the pancreas is presented. To reconstruct the upper alimentary tract with the stomach, the gastroduodenal artery and right gastroepiploic vein were successfully skeletonized and preserved. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperativ day 22. After 9 month this patient died of liver metastasis without local carcinoma recurrence. The coexistence of these two lesions and the new surgical treatment has been reported one time in the literature in japan. S 71 Lung Cancer Lun 9 Cancer Oral Presentation 0363 INVASIVE STAGING OF NON SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER - A PROSPECTIVE STUDY S. Eggeling, J. B6ttger, T. Beinert, K. Gellert, KH Lichtenberg, Charite (Berlin) Objective: Clinical prognosis and treatment schedules of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are dependent on tumor stage. This explains the importance of an exact pre-treatment staging of the primary tumor and lymph nodes especially in locally advanced NSCLC, to differentiate between resectable and non-resectable disease. To assess the lymph node status of the upper mediastinum, the diagnostic value of mediastinoscopy is accepted to be superior to radiological methods. In contrast, thoracoscopy is not yet established as a standard staging tool. Patients and methods: 73 consecutive patients with CT-based suspicion of advanced NSCLC have been investigated as part of a phase II study on neoadjuvant treatment of NSCLC. All patients underwent mediastinoscopy and mediastinal lymph node picking. In the case of negative result we performed additional thoracoscopy. Results: In 52.1% (n=38) of the patients the invasive diagnostic methods led to results that were effectively differing from those of the radiological findings, in eleven patients (15.1%) CT-assessed lymph node metastases could invasively not be confirmed, whereas nine patients (12.3%) had mediastinal lymph node filiae but no corresponding CT-signs (diameter <1 cm). The results were achieved by mediastinoscopy in fifteen (20.5%) and by thoracoscopy in five (6.8.%) patients. A radiologicaily unexpected T4-stage has been found in four (5.5%) and a M1- stage in 4 (5.5%) patients by thoracoscopy. On the contrary, in seven patients a suspected infiltration of mediastinum or parietal pleura could be thoracoscopically excluded. 4 patients have been in an unexpected high stage of tumor progression at the moment of diagnostic procedures and therefore have been included in palliative therapy schedules. 10 patients have been ,,overstaged\" by radiological methods and benefited from a primarily curative resection after invasive staging. Conclusion: Of the 73 prospectively studied patients with locally advanced NSCLC 12 (16.4%) have been staged too low and 13 (17.8%) too high. If exclusively staged by radiological methods, about 34% of lung cancers have been classified incorrectly. Therefore, these tools are not a sufficient basis for diagnosis of stage III NSCLC disease. Mediastinoscopy with consecutive thoracoscopy is an essen- tial part of the therapeutic planning in locally advanced NSCLC, results are significantly superior to clinical staging 0364 PROGNOSTIC RELEVANCE OF HER2, RAD51, P53 AND BMP7 LUNG CANCER S. Weniger, J. Sb, nger, H. Maacke, R. Bonnet, A. Schmidt, Friedrich-Schiller-Universittit Berka (Jena, Bad Berka) Aim: Tumor development depends on various factors, e.g. extracellular factors, membrane-bound receptors, intracellular signaling molecules and nuclear factors. Aim of this study was to correlate the expression of HER2, RAD51, P53 and BMP7 on the RNA and protein level with histopathological parameters and clinical outcome in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: We analysed kryopreserved tissue samples from 110 patients suffering from NSCLC. Tumor specimen and samples from the tumor-flee resection margins were availabe. The transcription patterns were analysed by RT-PCR, and the protein content as well as the distribution were assayed by immunohistochemistry. These results were correlated with the clinical data of the individual patients. Results: BMP7, HER2, P53 and RAD51 could be detected in NSCLC on the transcriptional and protein level respectively. RT-PCR and immunohistochemietry exhibited similar results. In general, tumor samples showed a higher expression for all gene products analysed. BMP7 is almost expressed in adenocarcinomas. HER2 and p53 showed no significant correlation. None of the factors studied showed a significant correlation to survival. Conclusion: Our data indicate, that BMP7 is a potential marker for discrimination of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma in NSCLC. They further support our concept, that BMP7 is an epithelial marker for differentiation and keratinization.

Butts, N. Langer, R. Rosso, Krankenhaus GroBhansdorf, McGill University, Cross Cancer Institute, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital, EHoffmann- La Roche Ltd, Istituto Scientifico dei Tumori Genua, I) Introduction: Adding Herceptin to chemotherapy has produced improvements in survival and time to progression (TTP) in women with HER2-positive (pos.) meta- static breast cancer. As 10 - 15% of NSCLC are HER2-pos., combining Herceptin with a current widely used chemotherapy scheme was supposed to increase the response to treatment in these patients (pts). Purpose: Primary objective was to determine response rates (CR or PR). Second- ary objectives were 1. investigate safety profile 2. estimate and compare pro- gression free survival (PFS) 3. assess pharmacocineties of Herceptin tion with Gemcitabine + Cisplatin. Patients & Methods: The study recruited 103 pts, 101 were evaluable for analysis. Median age was 59 years (y) in the control (C) and 56 y in the Herceptin (H) arm, respectively. Other demographic variables were similar in the two treatment arms. 78% of pts.presented with Stage IV, 22% with stage IIIb NSCLC. Tumors were HER2-pos. as determined by immunohistochemistry vs 24%), fluorescence in situ hybridisation high of shed extracellular domain (> 15ng/ml 11,8% vs 18%). Pts received a of Gemeitabine 1250 mg/m2 d 1+8, Cisplatin +/ - Herceptin 2mg/kg (4mg/kg loading dose) weekly until disease progression. Results: The combination was well tolerated, Herceptin did not appear to add significantly to the toxicity of Gemcitabine and Cisplatin. This study provides no evidence, that Herceptin adds to the efficacy of Gemcitabine + Cisplatin in HER2- pos. NSCLC. m., PFS: 6,1 m. vs 6,7 m., respectively).

Clement, Bad Berka) Aim: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are important regulators of cellular differentiation. Besides playing a critical role in early stages of embryogenesis and organ formation, they are also found to be involved in growth regulation in adult tissues. Lung cancers differ widely in their morphological appearance. Until present, histological analysis of tumor samples at surgery is the most reliable method for long term prognosis. However, little is known about the origin and the developmental patterns of the different tumors based on histological classification. A particular challenge is that many lung tumors are described as mixed type tumors, e.g. adeno-squamous cancers. Methods: We therefore decided to conduct a thorough investigation of gene expression patterns in 15 lung cancer samples using cDNA-Arrays for expression analysis. Overall analysis revealed very complex patterns that allow only limited interpretation. As a focussed strategy, we analyzed the expression patterns of BMPs, TGF-beta and associated proteins. With a few exceptions, most of these genes are expressed at low levels, which nevertheless can be clearly detected using radioactive labeled cDNA (33P) for hybridization. Results: The genes expressed at significant levels in most samples, include e.g. TGF-betal and TGF-beta2; BMP2; as well as the BMP2 regulated genes Id2 and Id3, important mediators in vascularization. However, none of these genes showed any significant specificity for expression in tumor or ,normal' tissue. All other BMPs included in the study are expressed at quite different levels ranging from not detected to robust expression (BMP1, BMP3, BMP4, BMP5, BMP8, SKY, p21/K-RAS; differentially expressed in tumor and ,normal' lung tissue. Conclusion: Members of the TGF-beta/BMP signaling network are differentially expressed in lung cancer and normal lung tissue but, unfortunately, they do not fulfill the strict criteria of diagnostic markers.

SchQtte, Universittitsklinikum C. Halle (Saale)) Objective: Patients suffering from malignant disease present with a higher risk of thrombosis due to a subclinical activation of the coagulation-fibrinolysis system. Especially lung cancer is frequently responsible for thromboembolic events. The incidence of thromboembolism in cancer patients caused by malignancy is generally specified up to 11 percent. The aim of our study was to evaluate the thrombin activation and fibrinolysis before and after surgery and to analyse the influence of tumour resection on parameters of hemostasis. Method: We measured the coagulation and fibrinolytic state in 72 patients (7 female, 65 male) suffering from NSCLC before surgery by use of thrombin-antithrornbin III complex (TAT) and prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2) as indicators of thrombin activation. Additionally (DD) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAl) belonging to fibrinolytic system were analysed. Finally we performed coagulation tests on 30 patients after R0-reseetion of a NSCLC. Results: TAT, F1+2 and DD were increased before surgical treatment, therefore a concealed activation of coagulation may be postulated. However, a thromboembolic event was not to be seen at all. After R0-surgery all measured parameters of hemostasis were significantly decreased (TAT p<0,001; F1+2 p<0,005; DD p<0,005; PAl p<0,05) which could be respected as a normalisation of the hemostasis disturbed by malignancy. A pre-therapeutic increase of DD and decrease of PAl in patients with progressive disease indicate an imbalance of hemostasis caused by predomination S 72 Lun,q Cancer of fibrinolysis. Activation of coagulation can be concluded from an increase of TAT and F1+2 which is independent from stage and histological type of NSCLC. Conclusion: Non small cell lung cancer is an important risk factor for thrombosis. Prophylactic application of anticoagulants (for example low molecular weight heparin) in addition to the common perioperative prophylaxis should be generally considered. To evaluate the prognostic value of these parameters concerning the progress of NSCLC or other malignancies further studies are required. Poster P368 TREATMENT OF BRAIN METASTASES IN PATIENTS WITH NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER (NSCLC) of brain metastases in patients with solide tumors is associated with poor survival and impairment of quality of life. Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) requires at least 10 to 20 fractions whereas radiosurgery requires only one treatment. A restrospective study of patients with brain metastases from NSCLC is performed to identify patients who benefit from palliative radiosurgery and to determine prognostic factors for survival. Materials & Methods: Between May 1984 and July 2000, 86 subsequent patients with a total of 110 brain metastases from NSCLC were treated with linac-based radiosurgery in our institution. Median age at treatment was 59 years. Median dose was 18 Gy delivered to the PTV-surrounding 80%-isodose. A total of 22 patients received WBRT prior (11), during (6) or after radiosurgery (5). The 6 patients who received radiosurgery as a focal boost to WBRT were excluded from further analysis. Local control was defined as decreased or stable tumor size in MR imaging. A chi-square test was used to identify potential prognostic factors for local control of brain metastases and survival of the patients. Results: Median follow-up was 6 months (11/2-77 months) with 20/86 patients still alive. Median actuarial survival was 4.5 months. Median actuarial survival was significantly longer (p<0.004) in patients with metachronous onset of brain metastases in comparison to synchronous onset (8.3 versus 3.3 months). Survival was significantly increased after radiosurgery in the absence of extracranial tumor progression (p<0.03). Gender, age and Karnofsky performance status had no significant influence on survival. Eleven patients (14%) developed new brain metastases after radiosurgery after a latency of median 5 months. Actuarial rate of new brain metastases was 10% after 4.5 months and 20% after 1 year. Actuarial local control rate was 96% after 3 months. Local control was significantly increased with a prescribed dose >=18 Gy/ 80%-isodose (p<0.01). Neurological dysfunction was improved or stabilized in 97% (83/86) of patients. Conclusion: The incidence of new brain metastases in patients with NSCLC is low because median survival is short. We conclude that patients with poor prognostic factors and less than 3 brain metastases may be palliatively treated with radiosurgery. This approach allows to effectively control CNS manifestation of the disease and can be integrated into chemotherapeutic protocols. P369 CALCIFICATION IN CORONARY ARTERY QUANTITATED BY CT CORRELATE WITH TOBACCO CONSUMPTION IN PATIENTS WITH UNRESECTABLE NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER TREATED WITH THREE-DIMENSIONAL RADIOTHERAPY has been shown that radiological manifestations of coronary artery sclerosis are predictive of survival. We evaluated outcome and side effects after primary three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy in patients with unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) staged I, II and ILIA, depending on coronary artery sclerosis, aortic calcification, Karnofsky performance index (KI) and co- morbidity. Material and Methods: Between 1993 and 1999, eighty-nine consecutive patients with unresectable NSCLC (11 stage I, 29 stage II, 49 stage IliA) were treated with 3D conformal radiotherapy. Thirty-three were adeno-, 54 squamous- and 2 anaplastic carcinoma. Median age was 66.6 years, median KI 80%. All patients underwent 3D-treatment planning, based on CT-scans. Median total dose was 60Gy with 2Gy per fraction five times a week. Results: Mean survival was 12.9 months. Significant prognostic factors were KI and tumor stage. Patients with KI&#8804;80% had a median survival of 6.5 months, patients with Kl&#8805;90% of 14 months median (p>0.001). NSCLC stage I and II showed with 12 months (p>O.004) an also significant longer survival. A significant correlation was seen between pack years and coronary artery calcification (p=0.05). Fifty-five of 82 smoking patients (67.1%) with >=20 pack years had marked calcification in coronary arteries. Also significant was the correlation between age and vascular calcification. Forty-three of 58 patients >60 years showed marked calcification of coronary arteries (p=0.007) and in the arch of aorta (p=0.Ol). Side effects, e.g. pneumonitis, did not correlate with coronary artery calcification but correlated to the chronic obstructive lung disease in 19/89 patients. Conclusion: Conventional CT-scans for three-dimentional treatment planning are able to detect coronary artery calcification. There is a significant correlation between age, tobacco consumption and vascular calcification. However, coronary artery calcification were not predictive for progression-free and overall survival. P370 BENDAMUSTIN (RIBOMUSTIN) CHEMOTHERAPY IN PLATINUM PRETREATED SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER PATIENTS (EXTENSIVE DISEASE) W. K~ster, R. Rudolph, M. Stahl, Kliniken-Essen-Mitte, Praxis (Essen) Purpose: Ribomustin is an alkylating agents which induced an OR-rate between 41 and 50 % in first line treatment of patients with metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and showed very low hematological and non hematological side- effects. To evaluate the activity and tolerance of Ribomustin in platinum pretreated patients, we treated 24 patients with recurrent or refractory SCLC. Methods: From 12/99 to 9/01 24 patients with metastatic SCLC (19 male, 5 female / age between 42 and 78 years, mean 63 years / WHO-PS 0-11), were treated with Ribomustin 120 mg/m 2 on two consecutive days (qd 21). Results: Severe (grade 3-4) non-hematological side-effects were rare. Leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia WHO grade III occured in 9 % and 14 % of the patients, respectively. Leukocytopenia WHO grade IV was observed in 4.5 % only. No grade IV-thrombocytopenia occured. The overall response rate was 39 % (CR 9%), NC was seen in 35 % and PD in 19 % of the patients. Objective response was exclusively seen in patients with WHO-PS 0-1 compared to patients with WHO-PS II ( 50 % vs = 0 %, NC 33 % vs 60 %, PD 17 % vs 40 %). The time to progression was 12.4+ weeks (WHO-PS 0-1 14 vs WHO-PS II 6 weeks) with an overall survival of 18+ weeks (WHO-PS 0-1 21 weeks vs WHO-PS II 8.5 weeks). Conclusion: Bendamustin is an active drug with low side-effects in platinum pretreated patients with small cell lung cancer (extensive disease). Especially patients with WHO-PS 0-1 showed promising overall response rates, time to progression and overall survival. A phase II-study has started in the meanwhile to confirm these results in a prospective trial. P371 EVALUATION OF DIFFERENT MARKERS IN LUNG CANCER: PROGNOSTIC VALUE OF CONVENTIONAL TUMOR STAGING, TUMOR CELL DETECTION AND TUMOR MARKER ANALYSIS FOR TUMOR PROGRESSION AND OVERALL SURVIVAL, S. Kasimir-Bauer, N. Schleucher, R. Weber, R. Neumann, S. Seeber, Universit&tsklinikum Essen, Bayer Vital GmbH (Essen, Leverkusen) Background: Even in modern chemoradiation protocols, patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC) experience tumor recurrences due to hematogeneous or lymphatic spread of occult tumor cells at an early stage of primary tumor growth, regularly underestimated by currently available clinical and pathologic staging procedures. Here we compare the prognostic value of routine pathology, cytokeratin positive (CK+) cells in the bone marrow (BM) and serum tumor markers at the time of diagnosis with regard to time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). Patients: 80 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and 25 patients with small- cell lung cancer, staged as T2-4, N 0-3, M0 (n=64), M1 (n=41) were evaluated. Treatment included chemo-radiotherapy with cisplatin/etoposide and subsequent radical surgical resection. There were 31 complete responders, 65 nonresponders and 9 patients who died of non-lung cancer causes. The median follow-up was 12 months (range 1-44 months). Methods: Conventional tumor and BM staging was determined by the pathologists. Tumor markers including CEA, SCC, NSE, Cyfra-21, TPA as well as uPA and the oncoprotein Her-2/neu were determined by radio- or enzyme-immunoassay. Sin- gle CK+ cells in the BM were detected by immunocytochemistry (IC). Results: Patients classified as stage IV and patients with metastases had a significantly lower TTP and OS. In contrast, no significant correlation was demonstrated for grading, tumor size or number of involved lymph nodes. When tumor cell infiltration in the BM as determined by routine pathology and IC as well as tumor markers were correlated with ]q-P, the detection of CK+ cells in the BM by IC was the only factor which significantly correlated with a shorter TTP in a univariate and a multivariate model. When these parameters were correlated with OS, the tumor markers TPA and Cyfra 21-1 reached statistical significance in both statistical models. BM involvement as determined by routine pathology and IC significantly correlated with reduced OS in a multivariate model. Interestingly, conventional staging of the BM for tumor cell infiltration could not detect minimal residual disease in those samples where IC was able to find 1-4 CK+ cells among 2 Million BM cells. Conclusion: The detection of CK+ cells should be added to routine pathology and for tumor marker analysis, studies should focus on Cyfra 21-1 and TPA. P372 SECOND-LINE Several years ago malignat pleural mesothelioma was regarded as a chemo resistant tumor. By the introduction of new chemotherapeutic agents especially antimetabolites like Gemcitabine, objective tumor response is now achievable in 30 % and a symptomatic improvment in further 30 % of the MPM patients. Material and Methods: 16 patients with relapse or progression of MPM pretreated with different chemotherapy protocolls were entered to the study. The S 73 Lung Cancer time to progression ranged from 2 to 12 month. Patients with remission in first line treatment and stable disease over 3 month were re-exposed. Patients with progression under first line therapy or early relapse underwent chemotherapy with other new drug combinations. Results: By the second-line chemotherapy in the half of the patients stable disease and symptomatic improvement was achieved. In several patients even objective tumor remission was seen. Toxicity was not a problem in the second line chemotherapy. Conclusion: In patients with relapsing or progressive MPM a second line chemotherapy is feasible. This is documented by objective tumor remission or stable disease with symptomatic improvement. P373 CLINICAL TUMOR DOCUMENTATION AS AN INTEGRATED COMPONENT OF A HOSPITAL INFORMATION SYSTEM H. B01zebruck, E. Wendekamm, C. TraschiJtz, U. Major, G. Manegold, H. Hoffmann, H. Dienemann, R Drings, Thoraxklinik-Heidelberg (Heidelberg) In the past tumor documentation generally was performed retrospectively, with the data being recorded following treatment. The usefulness was limited in that it could not immediately be implemented for the benefit of the patients. Nowadays, with the possibilities offered by hospital-wide, patient-centered and integrated clinical information systems, a new era in communication has begun, allowing for a flexible integration of new information to be incorporated in treatment regimens. This report of our experiences with the realization of a documentation system for lung cancer and pleural mesothelioma is to serve as an example of just how such a system can become an integrated component of a comprehensive hospital information system. On July 1, 2001, a new information system was implemented in the Thoraxklinik- Heidelberg. The software was based on components of the R/3 product family offered by the SAP Company. Numerous new administrative program systems and the medical modules, IS-H and IS-H*MED of the SAP partner companies GSD mbH and T-Systems, were installed simultaneously. Both the documentation modules which are used for the entire patient collective of the clinic (case history, clinical examinations, surgical treatment, anasthesia documentation, etc.) as well as the specifically organ-related documentation developed for the patients with lung cancer and pleural mesothelioma were installed as parametered IS-H*MED documents. The system was designed to include the newest basic documentation parameters for cancer patients as recommended by the German Cancer Society (Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft) and the German Tumor Centers Study Group (Arbeitsgemein- schaft Deutscher Tumorzentren), as well as the data required by the Cancer Registration Act (Krebsregistergesetz). Furthermore, the system is also capable of including a large number of specific details for the validation of quality management criteria, for the validation of the latest internationally applicable tumor classification systems and to further develop new therapy concepts for lung cancer and pleural mesothelioma patients. The experiences we have had thus far using the new system would suggest that its integration in the clinical routine has significantly reduced the amount of time necessary to complete documentation and, at the same time, the data it has gathered has contributed to optimizing the patients's treatment regimes and schedules. P374 INFLUENCE OF CYTOKINE MODULATION ON SURVIVAL IN NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER A. Neuner, M. Schindel, U. Wildenberg, T. Muley, H. Lahm, J. production immunosuppressive interleukin-1O by NSCLC and increased plasma IL-10 concentrations in NSCLC-patients have recently been correlated to reduced survival. We earlier demonstrated suppression of IL-2 secretion in whole blood cell cultures of NSCLC-patients. We now analysed the influence of iL-2 secretion on survival in NSCLC-patients and the influence of IL- 10 on IL-2 secretion. Methods: IL-2 secretion in whole blood cell cultures was measured by ELISA prior to therapy in 90 NSCLC-patients. The correlation of IL-2 concentration at the time of diagnosis to survival was calculated by crit-level, the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank-test. For multivariate analysis of prognostic factors the Cox- model was used. Results: With a cut-off value of 1100 pg/ml IL-2 the difference in survival was significant with a p-value of 0.014. In the group with high IL-2 (n=38, 29 failures) and low IL-2 (n=52, 47 failures) median survival was 14.1 and 9.7 mo, respectively. In the subgroup of 33 surgically treated patients the difference in survival was significant with a p-value of 0.011. In 14 patients with surgical resection of the tumor and high IL-2 at diagnosis and 19 patients with surgical resection, but low IL-2 at diagnosis, median survival was 86.2 and 11.3 me, respectively. By multivariate analysis, metastasis,CEA and IL-2 secretion capacity were indepen- 0.001, 0.03 and 0.024, respectively. Secretion of IL-2 in whole blood cell cultures from healthy individuals was inhibited in a dose-dependent way upon addition of IL-10. Conclusions: IL-2 secretion capacity was correlated to survival in and had major prognostic relevance. Suppression of IL-2 secretion by immunocompetent peripheral cells could be inhibited in a dose-dependent way by IL-10. Since tumor-mediated increase of IL-10 has been connected to reduced survival in NSCLC, decrease of IL-2 secretion associated with reduced survival could, therefore, well be mediated by tumor-derived IL-10. P375 GEMCITABINE AND VINORELBINE IN ELDERLY OR UNFIT PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED NON SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER F. Lange, G. Heil, Waldklinikum Gera gGmbH (Gera) Objective: Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine are active in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This treatment trial evaluated the feasibility, toxicity and efficacy of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine used as therapy for elderly or unfit patients with advanced NSCLC who were not able to be treated under outpatient conditions. Patients and methods: From March 1998 to March 2001, 46 elderly or unfit patients (39 males and 7 females, median age 67 years, range 50-78, Kamofsky performance status of 90, 80, 70, 60 and 50 present in 4%, 30%, 37%, 15% and 13% of the patients, stage lilb (26%) or stage IV and 1000 rag/m2 gemcitabine on day 1 and 8 of a three-weeks cycle. Results: 42 patients (91%) were evaluable for response with 9 partial remission (21%), 14 stable disease (33%) and 19 progressive disease (46%). The response rate in patients with Karnofsky performance status of 60 and 50 was 25% (partial remission). The median survival for the 46 patients was 9,1 months (95% confidence interval, 6,8-11,4 months) with an one year survival of 37,5%. The median time to progression for patients with objective response or stable disease was 9,6 months (95% confidence interval, 8,2-11,0 months). WHO 3:3 pat. / 6,5%, infection WHO 3:1 pat. / 2,2%, nausea / vomiting WHO 3:1 pat. / 2,2%). Other side effects were usually mild to moderate. Conclusion: The combination of gemcitabine and vinorelbine is active and well tolerated in elderly or unfit patients with advanced NSCLC. This regime represents a tolerable and effective combination to apply in the palliative treatment of patients who can not be treated under outpatient conditions. P376 SURVIVAL DATA FROM TWO RANDOMIZED PHASE II STUDIES SHOW EFFECTIVENESS FOR THERAPY OF ADVANCED NSCLC BY SINGLE AGENT GEMCITASINE AND DOCETAXEL GIVEN SEQUENTIALLY IN VARIOUS DOSES AND SCHEDULES C. Manegold, L. Pilz, G. Koschel, and Docetaxel (T) have been shown to be active in chemotherapy- naive and pre-treated patients (pts) with no cross resistancy. We studied G and T in various doses and schedules giving G or T in up to 6 cycles first. The form of drug administration was in the first study IA q4w; G: D 1, 8, 15; 1000 mg/m2 q4w, T: D1, 8, 15, 35 rag/m2 and vice second study IIA 100 rag/m2 and vice versa again, respectively. In case of tumour progression, the opposite drug was used (up to 6 additional cycles). In total 480 pts entered the studies (IllS/IV 13%/ 87%; PS 0 or 1/>1:78/22%), and 392 have been analysed so far. Number of pts in IA/IB/llA/IIB were 95/48/126/123, the median survival (MS) in months were 8/5/6.2/ 9.2 with corresponding confidence intervals in months [5.5;10.5] / [3.0;6.5]/ [5.0;7.0] / [7.0;10.5], respectively. 1-year survival in % were 31/21/19/17 and the number of censored observations in % were 5/0/27/29, respectively. The final analysis of IIA/IIB is under work, that of IA/IB is finished. MS differs significantly between IA and [KM]), log-rank [Ir] p=O.023, rank sum [rs] there is only a slight difference between IIA and liB, log-rank [Ir] p=0.226, rank sum [rs] p=0.049. So far, IIA and lib should be considered in this interim analysis as equally efficacious, although the MS has been different. IA vs IIA and IA vs liB showed no difference in KM. liB is significantly superior to arm IB (Ir: p=0.018 and rs: p=O.O01). G and T as administered in IA, IIA and liB is efficacious and indicates that G and T given as first-/second-line treatment approach may be an alternative therapy option in patients not being candidates for combination therapy.

P377 ENDOCAVITARY AFTERLOADING THERAPY WITH RECURRENT AND RESIDUAL TUMORS OF LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT D.F Froehlich, benefit of endocavitary brachytherapy of the lower aitways with recurrent and residual tumors are to be reviewed. Patients and methods: We carried out radiation therapy on 106 patients with 257 applications of endobronchial and endotracheal HDR afterloading therapy with iridium 192.These patients presented 54 residual tumors and 47 recurrent tumors.With 5 patients the afterloading was primarily palliative therapy.Pre-treat- merit had been high voltage radio- therapy on the linear accelerator with a maximum focal dose of 60 Gy.The primary tumor Iocaliza-tions were 91 bronchial carcinoma,6 carcinoma(n=78),6 adenocarcinoma,6 small- celled carcinoma were predominant as well as 12 other histological statuses.The single dose was 5 Gy at a 1 cm distance from the source of radiation.Total dosage of brachytherapy ranged between 5 and 30 Gy. Results:A bronchologically-con- trolled remission could be achieved with 34 patients and partial remission with another 34 patients out of 106 patients.The rate of remission was 64,2%.An unaltered status was presented with n=12.We observed progressive growth of the tumor with n=26.With the majority of the patients(n=49)we administered 10 S 74 Lung Cancer Gy afterloading therapy.25 patients were administered 15 Gy,16 patients Gy afterloading. Teletherapy pre-treatment was given to n=100 out of 106=94%. The oneyear survival rate to remission was 52% after complete remission and 18% after partial remission. No change and progressive disease =11%.The 54 residual tumors show a one-year survival rate of 35%,the 47 recurrent tumors only 20%.The side-effects of therapy were minimal. 2 patients showed fistulation,2 had terminal bronchial hemorrhage. Conclusion:Endocavitary afterloading therapy for recurrent and residual tumors has confirmed itself to be a good palliative m ehod in advanced tumor stages.There is a high local control rate.With complete remission,there is a clear gain in survi-val time.An afterloading total dose of at least 15 Gy should be taken at a distance of 1 cm from the applicator.in integrating afferleading radiation into primary therapy of the bronchial carcinoma, the good local therapeutic effect is relativized by the occurence of distant metastases P378 ROLE OF HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUSES IN NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CAN- CER (NSCLC) - CORRELATION TO DIFFERENTIATION MARKERS K. Treiber, J. S~inger, J.H. Clement, A. Schmidt, N. Aim: papilloma viruses (HPV) play a crucial role during carcinogenesis of various tumors especially squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix. Their potential involvement in tumor formation and differentiation of squamous cell carcinomas of the lung is poorly understood. Therefore, we estimated the presence of HPV in squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the lung in correlation with differentiation markers. Methods: We peformed L1-PCR and virus-specific PCR from tumor samples from 130 patients. Additionally, in situ hybridization was done in order to evaluate the presence of HPV (low risk: used to detect CDla as marker for immune response and the cell-cycle protein p16 by immunohistechemistry. Results: PCR analysis revealed squamous cell carcinomas of the lung contained HPV DNA. None of the adenocarcinomas studied were HPV positive (n=34). These data could be confirmed with in situ hybridization. Distribution of CDla and p16 positive cells varied in relation to the location and the intensity of staining. Conclusion: Using L1-PCR we were able to detect HPV-DNA in non small cell lung cancer. Tumor samples were further characterized with CDla and p16. These two markers showed no direct correlation to the appearance of HPV-DNA. P379 MEDIASTINAL DOWN STAGING AND TUMOR REGRESSION IN NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER AFTER NEOADJUVANT THERAPY K. Junker, K. Langner, M. Thomas, F. Klinke, U. Bosse, K. MLiller, BG-Kliniken Osnabr0ck) Introduction: Multimodality therapy concepts are increasingly used for the treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; stages IliA and IIIB). In this context, the applicability of a morphological regression grading and its prognostic value as well as the impact of mediastinal down staging were to be investigated. Material and methods: In a multicenter phase ]1 trial, 54 patients with locally advanced NSCLC received neoadjuvant treatment (two cycles of ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide; followed by twice daily radiation up to 45 Gy with carboplatin and vindesine simultaneously). Forty patients underwent resection. Using the corresponding resection specimens of primary and regional lymph nodes a regression grading was established: Grade h no or only spontaneous tumor regression; Grade I1: morphological evidence of therapy-induced tumor regression with at least 10 % (Grade Ila) or less than 10 % (Grade lib) vital tumor tissue; Grade II1: complete tumor regression. Regression grading and the extent of mediastinal down staging were then correlated with the survival time. Results: Three tumors were classified as regression grade I, 10 as regression grade Ila, 20 as regression grade lib, and seven as regression grade II1. Patients with regression grades lib or III showed a significantly longer survival than those with regression grades I or Ila (median survival, 36 vs. 14 months; 3-year survival rate, 52 % vs. 9 %; p = 0.02). This came even true in completely resected patients (median survival, not reached vs. 23 months; 3-year survival rate, 56 % vs. 11%; p = 0.03). To assess the impact of mediastina] down staging on survival, the survival periods of patients with histologically documented post-surgical NO or N1 lymph node status (n = 26) were compared to those with persistent mediastinal lymph node involvement (N2- disease, n = 14). Here, different median overall survival periods of 29 and 23 months could be established without reaching statistical significance (p = 0.27). Conclusions: After neoadjuvant therapy of NSCLC the regression grading as proposed is of predictive value for long-term survival whereas the assessment of mediastinal down staging is of minor prognostic significance. Beyond the achievement of complete tumor resection (R0) a therapy-induced tumor regression of less than 10 % vital tumor tissue is pivotal for superior long-term outcome. P380 CARBOPLATIN PLUS IRINOTECAN AS FIRST LINE TREATMENT FOR EXTEN- SIVE DISEASE SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER: A PILOT STUDY A. Schmittel, G. H~tter, A. Ullrich, E. Thiel, U. Keilholz, Universit~tsklinikum Benjamin Franklin (Berlin) Purpose: Recently, a randomised phase Ill trial from Japan demonstrated a significant increase in survival and response rates for the combination of cisplatin plus irinotecan over cisplatin plus etopeside in the first line therapy of small cell lung cancer. Because of it's favourable toxicity profile and a similar activity in SCLC, we initiated a pilot study to determine the feasibility of a first line chemotherapy regimen consisting of carboplatin and irinotecan in patients with SCLC extensive disease. Patients and Methods: Nine patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed extensive disease small cell lung cancer were treated. Chemotherapy consisted of carboplatin AUC 5 on day 1 and irinotecan 50 rag/m2 on day 1, 8 and 15, cycles were repeated on day 28, as recommended in an earlier phase I trial in a Japanese population. CT based response evaluation was performed after cycle 2, 4 and 6 and every 2 months during the follow up period. Patients regularly received a 5-HT3 antagonist for prophylaxis of nausea and were instructed to use Ioperamide in case of diarrhoea. Results: Nine patients were treated within this pilot study. Median age was 62 years (58 - 73). One patient was female. All patients had extensive disease. Myelotoxicity was mild with three grade 2 anemias and three grade 2 thrombopenias. Grade 1 and 2 diarrhea was observed in 2 patients. One patient with diabetes mellitus developed a grade 3 neuropathy after the third treatment cycle. No complete response was observed, 8 patients had a partial response to treatment. One patient progressed with CNS metastases during therapy. Conclusion: The combination of carboplatin and irinetecan is effective with a mild toxicity in SCLC. Our study eliminates the necessity of a phase I trial in SCLC and justifies to immediately proceed with a randomised phase II/111 trial, in which we compare this regimen to the combination of carboplatin plus etoposide. P381 THE INTERNET AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER G. Witucki, J. Beranek-Chiu, C. Weir3enberger, Universit~.tsklinik Freiburg (Freiburg) Purpose: To evaluate the Internet as a source of medical information for patients with lung cancer. The present survey examines the use and the influence of the Internet and other mass media on tumor patients. Methods: From 07.02.2001 to 23.11.2001, 149 patients with lung cancer which were referred to the Dept. of Radiotherapy were analyzed using a 36-item questionnaire developed in Freiburg. Results: Mean age of all patients (n=149): 62 years (range: 41 - 81 years), male: 74%(n=111) vs. female: 26%(n=38). Level of education or the Internet (n=92): fear of high 26%(n=24), other reasons: 61%(n=56). Making use of other information sources than the doctor treating the patient (n=113): 33%(n=37). If the layman-system was used as an information source they used as an information source (n=43): of the medium Internet as a source of information for tumor patients with lung cancer in Freiburg is currently still low but likely to increase. The percentage of internetuser in the ,,normal population\" over 50 years is only about 16%. Only 7% of our patients have visited the homepage of the department of radiotherapy at the University Clinic of Freiburg (http://www.ukl.uni-freiburg.de/ rad/strahlen/homede.html or short cut: http://go.to/radiotherapy). The demographic structure and a further spread of Intemet-access will lead to a gain of popularity of the Internet among lung cancer patients. P382 GEMCITABINE/DOCETAXEL VERSUS SEQUENTIAL GEMCITABINE/CISPLATIN FOLLOWED BY DOCETAXEL CELL LUNG CANCER (NSCLC) - A RANDOMIZED PHASE II STUDY D. Binder, V. Sailer, M. Schweigert, B. Temmesfeld, B. Wobst, are usually more effective than single agents in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Although the addition of a third drug may result in a further increase in response rates, toxicity of these combinations has often been prohibi- tive in the palliative setting. Sequential regimens may help to circumvent this problem. Thus, we conducted a randomized study to compare a three-drug sequential regimen with a two-drug combination. Patients: A total of 140 patients with metastatic NSCLC will be enrolled to this study. At present, 35 patients have been randomized. Treatment in Arm A (19 patients) consists of gemcitabine 900 mg/m 2 (30-rain infusion) days 1+8 and docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 day 1, repeated every three weeks for a maximum of six cycles. In Arm B (n=16), patients initially receive three cycles of gemcitabine 900 mg/m 2 days 1+8 and cisplatin 70 mg/m 2 (1-hour infusion) day 1 every 3 weeks, followed by three cycles of three-weekly docetaxel 100 mg/m 2. Results: 34 patients are evaluable for response In Arm A, 8 of 18 patients (44%), and in Arm B, 7 of 16 patients (44%) had a PR after the first three cycles, and one additional patient in arm B achieved a CR. One patient has S 75 Lung Cancer not yet completed the first three cycles. More than 90% of all doses in either treatment arm could be administered without reduction or delay. Leukopenia was common in both arms, but was mild to moderate in most cycles. WHO grade Ill- IV leukopenia occurred in 5 and 4 patients in Arm A and B, respectively. Neutropenic fever did not occur. Two patients in Arm A had moderate cutaneous toxicity. Other toxicities (Arm Conclusion: Both regimens were active and relatively well tolerated. More mature results including preliminary survival data will be available at the meeting. P383 LUNG CANCER ON THE INTERNET J. Beranek-Chiu, S. Jonassen, (Freiburg) Purpose: Evaluation of the health related websites providing information about lung cancer for patients suffering the disease and as well for their physicians. Methods: Special software searching for keywords (e.g. ,,Lungenkrebs\" and ,,Brochialkarzinom\") in 19 well known Internet search engines; 2650 hits were found, sorted and checked for the importance of their contents. The relevant sites are analyzed by using a standardized questionnaire. Results: 61 of 2650 websites provide relevant information. 2589 of 2650 have no relevance. The providers of the 61 informative sites are 8.2% commercial, 11.7% private and 70.6% institutional. The detailed analyze of the 61 websites shows: 1,7% mention the side effects, 1.7% mention the duration of the therapy, 3.3% mention the risks of the therapies, 23.3% mention the cancer etiology, 36.7% mention the diverse therapy options, and 55% mention the prognosis. Conclusion: Almost none of the websites informing about the lung cancer is able to provide a complete and detailed coverage of lung cancer from one hand. Nevertheless, information given is accurate and up to date. P384 CNS-RELAPSE AFTER MULTIMODALITY TREATMENT OF STAGE III NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER A. M011er, P, From 1994 to 1996, 42 patients (pts) ( 37 male, 5 female) with NSCLC stage Ilia (14 pts) or IIIB (28 pts), ECOG 0-2, median age 52 years (range 30-67), and histologically confirmed NSCLC (23 squamous, 19 adeno) were treated with preoperative induction chemotherapy (ICT). Treatment: ICT consisted of 2-4 6 g/m2 and etoposide 360 rag/m2 q3w. Surgery was carried out in case of turnout response or no change after ICT and was followed by radiotherapy (RT) if indicated (pT4; pN2; R1-2). Results: We evaluated feasibility of treatment, response and resection rates, survival and pattern of relapse. Median follow-up of patients was 15 months. Clinical response rate to ICT was 49%. 69% of patients underwent thoracotomy, and radical resection was obtained in 79%. 57% of all patients included received RT. Best survival was seen in patients with response to chemotherapy followed by radical turnout resection with a median survival (MS) of 18,7 months (m) and a 2-year survival (2-yr-S) of 18,7 69,6% in 13%, distant in 52% and combined Iocoregional and distant in 4% of these patients. Relapse free survival (RFS) was significantly better for patients with initial stage Ilia compared to stage IIIB (23,7 m versus 10 m). Brain metastases were seen in 33% of all treated patients and in 30% of radical resected patients. In patients with brain metastases, histology of the primary tumour was squamous in adeno in 41%. In radical resected patients, 42% of distant metastases developed in the brain as only site of relaps. Thus, the brain was the most frequent single site of distant metastases. Summary: As multimodality treatment seems promising especially for early stage NSCLC patients, the high rate of isolated brain relapses needs to be taken in account. Former studies have indicated a positive role in preventing brain metastases by prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Therefore, PCI may be further investigated as a part of multimodaiity treatment concept in resectable NSCLC. P385 RANDOMIZED PHASE III STUDY OF WEEKLY VERSUS THREE-WEEKLY DOCETAXEL AS SECOND-LINE CHEMOTHERAPY FOR ADVANCED NON- SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER (NSCLC) W. Sch0tte, docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 given every three weeks is widely considered standard as second-line treatment for advanced NSCLC. This regimen was shown to be significantly superior to best supportive care and other chemotherapeutic agents. Methods: In an ongoing multicenter randomized phase III study we compare standard 3-weekly docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 (Arm A) with docetaxel 35 mg/m 2 given weekly for 3 doses then 1 week off (1 cycle = 28 days) (Arm B) as second-line therapy for stage ItlB-IV NSCLC. Patients in both arms receive a maximum of 6 cycles on an outpatient basis. Results: Since April 2000, 103 patients have been randomized, and 45 patients (22 Arm A, 23 Arm B) are currently evaluable for toxicity. They received a total of 134 cycles (median, 3 per patient). Treatment was discontinued due to tumor progression (64% of patients), toxicity (8%), or at patient's own request (8%). A full course of 6 cycles was given to 18% of the patients. WHO grade 3/4 toxicity (% of patients) in Arm A included neutropenia 4.5%, infection 9%, and myalgia 13.5%. In Arm B, the only grade 3/4 toxicity was myalgia in 9% of patients. None of the patients experienced grade 3/4 neurotoxicity, nail changes, nausea or mucositis. No hospitalisation due to toxicity was required in any of the patients. Conclusions: Both regimens were well tolerated in the se- cond-line setting and could be administered on an outpatient basis without significant problems. Weekly docetaxel appears to be a particularly attractive treatment option due to the lack of severe toxicity. P386 STANDARD (SOT) VERSUS DOSE-INTENSIFIED CHEMOTHERAPY (lOT) WITH SEQUENTIAL RE-INFUSION OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD CELLS (PBC) IN SCLC E. Buchholz, P. Drings, L. Braun, S. C. Objective: to determine whether a dose intensification of ICE chemotherapy may be associated with a survival prolongation in pts with good prognosis SCLC. Methods: Eligibility criteria included: Manchester Score (MASC) 0-1; <70 years, no prior tumor therapy, normal hematologic, renal, hepatic function, no brain metastasis. Chemotherapy consisted of 5g/m dl 2 dl, Etoposide 180 mg/m 2 d1+2. In pts on ICT, cycles were repeated q2w x6 and G-CSF (300-480pg) was given d4 to d13. Whole blood (750ml) was collected on d15 prior to ICT (cycles 2 - 6) and reinfused on d3. In pts on SCT, cycles were repeated every q4w x6. Results: From 10/96 to 5/00 a total of 54 pts have been entered, (ICT n=27, SCT n=27). Median age was 53,3 years, 30 pts had a MASC O, 24 a MASC 1. Male / female ratio was 42 / 12; LD / ED ratio was 51 / 3. A total of 301 CT-courses have been delivered (ICT: 157, SCT: 144). The main toxicity was hematologic, however, there was no difference in hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity between ]CT and SCT. 50 pts responded (CR / PR): 27 pts on ICT (16 CR / 11 PR), and 23 pts on SCT (9 CR / 14 PR). In pts on ICT, MS was 31,4 months, in pts on SCT 16,7 months 1-year-S and 2-year-S was 89% and 78% and 33% on SCT. Conclusion: ICE with whole blood - peripheral blood stem cell support is feasible and effective. Moreover, preliminary data indicate survival benefits for ICT over SCT. P387 SURVIVAL OF PATIENTS WITH NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER TREATED WITH RADIATION THERAPY ALONE - RESULTS OF A POPULATION-BASED STUDY A. Bollmann, J. Haerting, O. Halle-D61au (Halle) Introduction The role of radiation therapy in the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is currently under investigation. New therapeutic approaches use hyperfractionated radiotherapy for patients with good performance status or rnultimodality treatment in combination with chemotherapy. The purpose of our investigation was to demonstrate the importance of conventional radiation therapy in patients with NSCLC in terms of survival. Methods Between April 1996 and September 2000 217 patients with NSCLC (76.5 % male, 23.5 % female) were treated with conventional radiation therapy alone. Data of 168 patients (77.4%) were eligible for survival analyses. Results Median survival time and 1-year survival rates are shown in table 1. ConclusionsAfter conventional radiation therapy median survival differs between 18.8 and 7.0 months. Differences in survival compared to literature may be due to the population-based character of our study where higher frequencies of patients with poor performance status are expected. stage n MST (months) 95 % - CI 1 -YSR (%) I 27 18.6 11.0-23.9 66.7 Ii 17 13,0 4.6-17.6 52.9 III a 43 10.0 5.6-14.1 44.2 III b 81 7.0 4.4-8.8 29.6 \"able 1 : Survival of patients treated with conventional radiation therapy alone P388 FDG-PET AFTER INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY IN NSCLC IliA AND IIIB IS HIGHLY PREDICTIVE FOR DISEASE-FREE SURVIVAL (DFS) IN THE GROUP OF CT RESPONDERS F. Griesinger, F. Lahmann, J. Leugering, C.P. Crime, Andreas, Berka) S 76 Lung Cancer / Gastrointestinal Cancer including Liver (1) Objective: D/C combination chemotherapy (CTx) has shown high response rates in advanced NSCLC. Histologic tumor response after CTx as well as combined induction regimens are highly associated with systemic tumor control and potentially with cure. Metabolic tumor response by FDG-PET after induction CTx has been shown to be predictive of outcome in NSCLC. Finally, erythropoietin (EPO) may prevent the decrease of Hb values (median of -2.7 g% in a previous study) and thus may increase efficacy of induction CTx. Therefore, the aim of the study was to correlate FDG-PET after D/C-EPO CTx with NSCLC stage IliA and IIIB pts were enrolled and received D 100 mg/m 2 dl and C AUC 7.5 d2 q21 days for 4 cycles. Epo was administered at a dose of 3x10,000 IU/week s.c. All pts. received adjuvant radiotherapy. Results: Of the 45 enrolled patients, 38 are evaluable for response by CT scan. 25/38 patients (66%) achieved PR. 5 (13%) had SD and 8 (21%) PD. Of the 30 patients receiving post- 12 (40%) had metabolic complete remission (SUV <2,5), 12 PR (SUV <50% of baseline value), 4 SD and 2 PD. So far, 9 of the 12 metabolic CR patients have been evaluated morphometrically, and regression grades III and liB (Thomas et al, JCO 1999) were observed. At a median follow-up of 408 days, estimated 1-year survival is 83%, and 2-year survival is 53%. Median survival has not yet been reached. Analyzing CT responders (n=30) only, PET CR patients (n=12) had a DFS of 72% at 2 years, and non-responders with metabolic CR by FDG-PET. At a median follow-up of 13.6 months, post-induction FDG-PET and morphometry were highly significant predictors of disease-free survival in CT responders. Thus post-induction CTx-FDG-PET may represent a non-invasive diagnostic tool to predict pathologic response and long term outcome in stage Ill NSCLC. P389 BACKGROUND OF THE HIGH DIAGNOSTIC CAPACITY OF PROGRP IN SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER R Stieber, H. FQrst, A. Schalhorn, Inst. of Clinical Chemistry, University of Munich, Dept. of Surgery, University of Munich, Medical Department Itl, University of Munich (Munich) ProGRP (Pro Gastrin Releasing Peptide), is the mammalian counterpart to the amphibien bombesin being well known since years for the classification of lung tissues in pathology. At the time when an ELISA for the serum determination of ProGRP became available ('1\"onen, now ALSt, Tokyo, Japan) most investigations focused on lung diseases and lung cancer based on the promising histopathologi- cal findings. We investigated in a total of 1750 patient samples the overall profile of organ- and tumorspecificity of ProGRP as recommended by the EGTM (European Group on Tumor Markers) for the evaluation of new markers. The median concentration of ProGRP in healthy individuals (n=70) was 10 pg/mL, the 95%per- centile 22 pg/mL. In benign diseases (n= 390) the medians varied between 10 and 28 pg/mL, the highest single values up to 150 pg/ml were found in patients with renal failure. The respective cut off values at 95% specificity were calculated as follows: healthy individuals: 22 pg/mL; benign lung dis. 54 pg/mL; benign gynecological dis. 33 pg/mL; benign gastrointestinal dis. 95 pg/mL, benign urological dis. pg/mL; benign breast dis. 38 pg/mL. In cancer patients except lung cancer the medians varied between 11 pg/mL (liver and pancreatic cancer) and 29 pg/mL (bladder cancer), the highest 95%percentile was observed in colorectal (55 pg/mL) and renal cancer (52 pg/mL). The highest value observed among these cancer patients was 100 pg/mL. The corresponding sensitivities at a 95% specificity were 0% for stomach, liver, pancreatic, kidney and bladder cancer; 2 % for colorectal and 5% for ovarian cancer. In lung cancer patients (N=667) the medians were 19 pg/mL in and 64% in SCLC. Our findings reveal that ProGRP- due to the minor release by other benign and malignant diseases- is able to support diagnosis in patients with lung tumors of unknown origin. P390 ARE THERE QUALITY INDICATORS IN PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER? RESULTS OF A POPULATION BASED STUDY T. Blankenburg, H. Neef, J. Haerting, P. Schmidt, W. SchL~tte, Martin-Luther- Universit~.t Halle-Wittenberg (Halle) Introduction Up to now indicators for the quality of the diagnostic procedures and decision making are not established as jet. This is caused by a high proportion of co- morbidity and the poor prognosis of this disease. MethodsWe present results of population based study focusing of the quality of the medical care of patients with lung cancer, which was granted by the German Ministry of Health. The study covered an area of 1.5 million inhabitants, during 3,5 years 1698 patients were recruited and documented during the whole course of their disease. Survival data were obtained by cross-checking all death certificates of this region. Results 21,6% of all patients had Small- Cell Lung Cancer, 69,8% had Non- Small- Cell Lung Cancer and in 7,8% the histological tumor type was not available. The clinical tumor stage was missing in 22,3% of all patients, the performance status in 43,9%. Hospital related analyses showed a difference in missing histology between 4 and 17%, in missing tumor stage between 7 and 56%. Detailed analyses of all cases with these missing data justified the missing in 66%, in 33% there were no explanation for the missing data. Conclusion Missing these data can be a quality indicator or is due to worse performance status. Only detailed multi-variate analyses led to quality indicators in patients with lung cancer in our population based study. Publication only P'391 NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY WITH BENDAMUSTIN (RIBOMUSTIN) IN A PATIENT WITH SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER W. K~ster, M. Stahl, H. Wilke, Kliniken-Essen-Mitte (Essen) Purpose: Ribomustin is an alkylating drug which induced overall response rates between 41 and 50 % in patients with untreated small cell lung cancer (SCLC), extensive disease. In two phase-II-trials very low haematological and non- hematological side-effects could be demonstrated. Case-report: A 55 year old patient was diagnosed with a locally advanced left- central SCLC stage cT4cN3cM0 with obstruction of the left main bronchus. Several co-morbidities were diagnosed, such as severe coronary heart disease after myocardial infarction in 1994, (FS 25%), angina pectoris CCS III, peripheral occlusive disease stage III according to Fontaine-Ratschow, Diabetes mellitus type II a, Hypertension, Hyperlipoproteinemia and immobility because of an accident with fracture of both heel bones a few weeks ago and hip bone arthrosis on both sides. Because of these facts, standard combination chemotherapy could not be initiated and we started a treatment with Bendamustin 120 mg/m 2 on two consecutive days every three weeks for 4 cycles. A partial remission could be verified after the second cycle. During the complete time of treatment, no cardiologic, nephrologic, neurologic or infectiologic side effects occurred. Only a WHO grade I \u00b0 leukopenia and no thrombocytopenia or anemia developed. Afterwards, the patient reached a definitive radiotherapy at a dose of 54 Gy over a period of 5 weeks. Conclusion: Bendamustin is an effective drug in the treatment of small cell lung cancer patients and should be considered for patients with a high co-morbidity. P'392 EFFICACY OF BENDAMUSTIN IN THERAPY OF RELAPSED SCLC Mayer, R. Schick, U. Zeelen, A. Schoengen, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus UIm (Ulm) SCLC has a high sensitivity to chemotherapy, but is signed by rapid development of drug resistance under repeated chemotherapy. So, it is very important to find drugs, which are effective in the situation of recurrent disease. We discuss a patient, who presented in september, 1996 with SCLC and was treated with bendamustin after treatment with six other chemotherapy protocols. SCLC was limited to the left thorax, due to metastatic disease in the contralateral lymph nodes in mediastinum, he was classified as extensive disease. Perfomance status was very low at time of diagnosis, he suffered from a global respiratory insufficiency due to complete atelectatic left lung. A hematogenous metastatic disease was not seen at the time of diagnosis and had not been verified up to now. The following table shows the appiicated chemotherapy protocols with the treatment results: The shown protocols were applicated in the published dose schedules. Except of several episodes of febrile neutropenia there was no toxicity grade III or IV; more than one protocol with anthracyclines were not possible, because of the patients cardiac situation. During the last two courses of the sixth therapy the SCLC was progressive and we decided to try a therapy with bendamustin, because several reports showed the efficacy of bendamustin as primary treatment in SCLC. In our patient bendamustin was given in a dose schedule of 80 mg/m2 in day 1 and 2, repeated at day 22. No febrile neutropenia was seen, and also there was no toxicity grade Ill or IV. In CT scan a very good partial remission was documented up to now, so we decided to continue the therapy until the maximum of response. This case shows that bendamustin can be very effective not only as primary treatment, but also in the situation of repeated relapses and in case of progressive disease under chemotherapy. Gastrointestinal Cancer including Liver I1) Oral Presentation 0393 5-FLUOROURACIL PLUS LEUCOVORIN IS AN EFFECTIVE ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY IN CURATIVELY RESECTED STAGE III COLON CANCER: LONG TERM FOLLOW-UP Arkenau, K. Rettig, A. with fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin in curatively resected stage Ill colon cancer significantly reduces the risk of cancer recurrences and improves survival. In this study the impact of 5-FU plus leucovorin on survival and tumor recurrence was analyzed in comparison S 77 Gastrointestinal Cancer including Liver (1) with the effects of 5-FU plus levamieole in the prospective multieentric trial adjCCA-01. Patients and methods: Patients with a curatively resected UICC stage III colon cancer were stratified according to T, N and G category and randomly assigned to receive one of the two adjuvant treatment schemes: 5-FU 400 mg/m 2 body- surface area intravenously in the first chemotherapy course, then 450 mg/m 2 x 5 days, plus leucovorin 100 mg/m2; 12 cycles, (arm A), or 5-FU plus levamisole (Moertel scheme; arm B). Results: Six hundred eighty (96.9%) of 702 patients enrolled onto this surly were eligible. To date 261 patients died, 117 on arm A and 144 on arm B (P=0,007). After a median follow-up time of 82 months, the 5-FU plus leucovorin combination significantly improved disease-free survival (79.8 months in arm A versus 69.3 months in arm B (P=0,01)) and significantly incresed median overall survival (88.9 months in arm A versus 78.6 months in arm B (P=0,003)). Adjuvant treatment with 5-FU plus levamisole as well as 5-FU plus leucovorin was generally well tolerated; only a minority of patients experienced grade 3 and 4 texicities. Conclusion: After curative resection of a stage III colon cancer, adjuvant treatment with 5-FU plus leucovorin is generally well tolerated. For the first time it has been demonstrated that adjuvant treatment with 5-FU plus leucovorin given for 12 cycles is significantly more effective than 5-FU plus levamisole (Moertel scheme) in reducing tumor relapse and improving survival. Efficacy : 49 patients were 5-FU resistant and received Ox-lri as 2nd-line therapy Median \"FI-P and median survival this group was 5 months and 16 months respec- tively. 44 of this patients were evaluable for response : 5 CR, 10 PR, 15 confirmed NC , 5 not confirmed NC, 9 PD for an ORR of 34 % in evaluable 5-FU resistent patients. The efficay was poor in 19 patients who were pretreated with Ox, Iri, two chemotherapy lines or via a. hepatica. Conclusion : Weekly Ox-lri is active in 5-FU resistant CRC. Despite IDO objective and subjective toxicity of the reported regimen (mainly diarrhea and asthenia) was sustantial. Nausea, alopecia and neutropenia seem to be less pronaunced than in other Ox and Iri combinations.

Lipp, S. Hegewisch-Becker, A. Knuth, U. Keilholz, ~ c.i. 24h) and FA (500 mg/m ~) for six times per cycle has been shown as a very high active firstline therapy in advanced colorectal cancer with ORR of 42-65% (Douillard et al Lancet 2000; Vanh6fer et al, JCO 1999). Unfortunately the rate of severe side effects has also been high with diarrhea 35-44% \u00b0Ill/IV and nausea/vomiting \u00b0Ill/IV 13-18%. The aim of our the study is to observe the efficacy and toxicity of this combination therapy in diminished doses (irinotecan 80 mg/m 2, 6-FU 2.0 g/m 2 c.i.24h and FA 200 mg/m 2) and in the broad usage of different oncological and non-oncological units. Since 09/2000 in 40 german centers (university hospitals n=5, hospitals with oncological specialization n=10, country hospitals with lower oncological specialization n=12, oncologica] practices n=13) 130 patients of the 350 planned patients have been enrolled. For this first interims analysis n=102 patients are evaluable for toxocity and n=95 for response. The median number of cycles were 2,5 with a median treatment duration of 17 weeks. 11 patients were discontinued during first cycle due to toxicity (n=9), patient decision (n=2) and unknown (n=l). One patient died treatment-related with a septic infection of the port-a-cath system. The efficacy data were: ORR 54,4% (with CR 10,2% and PR 44,2%) and SD 37,4% and PD 8,2%. In 5 patients a secundary resection of their metastases could be performed \u00b0) 0%. The first interims analysis of this field study, performed in very different educated centres, undersign the safety and efficacy of the weekly combination therapy with irinotecan/5-FU and FA. Compared to previous data the toxicity rates could be decreased by diminishing the doses for 5-FU and FA without a loss in efficacy. The study will be continued up to the full planned enrollment of 350 patients. 0395 WEEKLY COMBINATION OF OXALIPLATIN (OX) AND IRINOTECAN (IRI) IN 5-FU RESISTANT METASTATIC COLORECTAL CANCER (CRC) (Berlin, Halle, Bremerhafen) Background: Ox and Iri are active as single agents in CRC after failure of 5-FU. In a phase II study the combination of weekly Iri and biweekly Ox showed a remark- able efficacy in this disease but only a minority of the treated patients had 5-FU resistance (in 14/36 the tumor progressed while receiving a phase II mult-icenter trial with Ox 60 mg/sqm and Iri 80 mg/sqm each given over 1 hour on days 1,8 abd 15 q 28d, without any use of G- CSF but with individual dose optimisation (IDO): rigorous predefined guidelines of omitting scheduled days, dose reductions in case of toxicity or dose escalations. Results : 68 enrolled patients received 1 to 10 cycles and are evaluable for toxicity : In 27 patients therapy was stopped due to objective or subjective toxicity before progressive disease occured and 9 patients had to be admitted to hospital mainly due to diarrhea. As predefined in IDO-guidelines in 26 of 253 cycles scheduled day 8 was omitted and in 69 of 253 cycles day 15 was omitted due to persisting diarrhea or neutro- penia. Iri was increased to 100 mg/sqm in 5 patients (no toxicity observed in cycle 1) and was reduced to 60 mg/sqm in 20 patients and to 50 mg/sqm in 5 patients in forthcoming cycles due to diarrhea or neutropenia. 0396 QUALITY CONTROLLED SURGERY IN ADJUVANT TREATMENT OF COLON CANCER UlCC IIh INTACT - A MULTICENTER PHASE III TRIAL, A. Wein, T. Lehnerf, T. Liersch, Franke, R. Hamburg) Objectives: meta-analysis showed a survival advantage of up to 5% in adjuvant treatment of colon cancer UICC III (Dub& 1997). These trials, however, did neither attach importance to the quality of the surgical therapy nor to the stratification of important prognostic factors (e.g. department/surgeon). Due to the wide range of surgical results, we analysed the efficacy of adjuvant therapy based on quality controlled surgery (QCS). Methods: Prospective controlled multicenter phase Ill trial. Inclusion criteria: standardised curative surgery (UICC Ill) and pathology, LN: = 12, therapy start:within 35 d, age: 18 - ECOG: emergency surgery FAP, G4, synchronous CRC, usual criteria in chemotherapy. QCS: definition of the surgical procedure, QCS prior to randomisation, ADT documentation (doc) (33 items). Quality controlled pathology: ADT doc (27 items); stratification: 1. department (surgeon), 2. pN1 vs pN2, 3. pT1- 3 vs pT4. Randomisation and by IMEREM (Nuremberg). Arm A: QCS versus Arm B: Arm A + adjuvant treatment with 5-FU/folinic acid as a 24-h-inf. over 6 months (too.). Interim analysis after 120 randomised patients with a follow- up of 1 year. Follow-up: every 3 mo. during the first 2 years, afterwards every 6 too. Date of analysis: 1.9.01. Primary endpoint: group shows a DFS of 61% and a local recurrence rate of 3,3%. Under these circumstances, with a DFS of 84% (p=0.006), adjuvant treatment seems to be particularly effective. Due to the positive results of adjuvant treatment, enrollment was finished. Long-term results of the total collective, however, remain to be seen. Supported by Theo u. Friedl Sch611er - Foundation. 0397 PHASE II STUDY OF WEEKLY GEMCITABINE AND DOCETAXEL IN ADVANCED OR METASTATIC GALLBLADDER CARCINOMAS R. Kuhn, K. with an extremely poor prognosis. The 5-year survival rate after aggressive surgical resection is less than 30%, and with symptom-oriented palliative therapy median survival is approximately 6 months. We combined gemcitabine and docetaxel in a phase II study to optimize palliative treatment for these patients in an outpatient setting. Patients and methods: Patients with unreaectable histologically proven gallbladder carcinoma and WHO performance status 0-2 received gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 and docetaxel 35 mg/m 2 given weekly over 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest (dl, 8, 15 q28d). Treatment was continued until disease progression. Results: Thirty patients (11 with Iocoregional and 19 with metastatic disease), 8 males/22 females with a mean age of 61.1 years (range 41-78), have completed treatment since initiation of the study in 1998. So far, 134 cycles (range 1-14) have been administered. 4 patients received prior chemotherapy: one had intraarferial chemoembolisation, 2 patients had systemic infusional therapy, and one patient had local cryotherapy. There was no CR, but 3 patients (10%) achieved PR and 16 (53%) SD. Eleven S 78 Gastrointestinal Cancer including Liver (1) patients (37%) had PD. Median time to progression was 5.6 months. At present, median survival is 11.3 months (1-65 months). WHO grade 3 hematologic toxicities were infrequent (5 patients), and no WHO grade 4 toxicities occurred. Sixteen patients (53%) had WHO grade 3/4 alopecia, 6 (20%) had nausea/vomiting, and 2 (7%) had severe mucositis. Treatment-related peripheral neurotoxicity WHO grade 3 was observed in 4 patients (13%). Conclusion: Combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine/docetaxel is a feasible, effective and well tolerated treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic gallbladder carcinoma. Poster P398 A PHASE II STUDY OF IRINOTECAN (CPT-11) AND 5-FLUOROURACIL/FOLI- NIC ACID (5-FU/FA) AS SECOND-LINE WITH COLORECTAL K. Ridwelski, E. Kettner, Kr6ning, A. aimed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of CPT-11 in combination with 5-FU/FA as second or third-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic CRC. Patients and methods: Eligibility: Patients with metastatic CRC, one or more measurable metastatic lesions, WHO performance status <=2, and adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function were eligible for the study. All patients had previously received chemotherapy with 5-FU/FA for metastatic disease. No prior treatment with CPT-11 or any other topoisomerase I inhibitor was allowed. Treatment: CPT-11 125 rng/m 2 was given as a 60-minute intravenous infusion, followed by FA 500 mg/m 2 given intravenously over 15 minutes and 5-FU 500mg/m 2 by intravenous bolus. Treatment was administered weekly for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest. Results: Thirty-one patients were entered into this trial (M/F, 23/8). Median age was 60.5 years (44-73) and WHO performance status 0 or 1. Primary tumor sites were colon (15 patients) and rectum (16 patients). Median number of involved sites was 1, and 48% of the patients had 2 or more sites (liver 77%, lung 35%, local recurrence 23%, lymph nodes 10%). Toxicity: Thirty-one patients were evaluable for toxicity. A total of 83 cycles were administered. Grade Ill/IV toxicity included neutropenia (23%), diarrhea (13%), nausea (10%) and vomiting (6.5%). Efficacy: 25 patients were evaluable for efficacy. One patient achieved a partial response (objective response rate 4%) and 14 patients (56%) had stable disease. Ten patients progressed. Median survival was 7.3 months (range, 4.1-10.4), and median time to progression was 3.6 months (95% CI 1.05 to 6.11 months). Conclusions: Our data suggest that this combination is active and well tolerated in heavily pretreated patients with advanced CRC. P400 STRONG OVEREXPRESSION OF THE PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE RECEPTOR IS AN UNFAVORABLE INDEPENDENT PROGNOSTIC FACTOR IN STAGE ScheriJbl, Universit~tsklinikum Benjamin Franklin (Berlin) Background: Ligand binding to the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) was shown to be increased 3- to 4-fold in colorectal cancer. However, the putative overexpression of PBR protein and its possible clinical relevance in colorectal cancer have not been evaluated so far. Methods: 116 consecutive patients (59 patients in UICC stage III and 57 patients in UICC stage IV), who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer at the Benjamin Franklin Clinics between 1989 and 1991 were followed up for five years. Paraffin- embedded sections of all tumors were investigated by immunohistochemistry using monoclona] anti-PBR antibody 8D7. A score system comprising staining intensity and the percentage of positive cells compared to normal mucosa was used. Kaplan-Meier-curves were calculated for detecting differences in the cumulative survival. Results: 88% of all tumors showed an overexpression of PBR protein compared to the respective normal mucosa. Moreover, 28% of all tumors displayed a strong overexpression. Patients with tumors strongly overexpressing PBR had a significantly worse prognosis (mean survival: 56.2 + 9.2 months) than those with no or only weak overexpression (mean survival: 86.8 + 6.6 months). Multivariate analysis identified a strong PBR overexpression as an independent unfavorable prognostic marker. In stage IV colorectal cancers PBR overexpression did not correlate with survival. Conclusion: This study shows that PBR is frequently overexpressed in colorectal cancer. Moreover, strong overexpression of PBR is an independent unfavorable prognostic factor in stage Ill colorectal cancer. Thus, strong PBR overexpression may help to define patients at risk for recurrent disease, and should be evaluated in future clinical trials. P401 EVIDENCE FOR FUNCTION OF HMSH2 IN INDUCTION OF APOPTOSIS S. Scherer, C. Kaiser, S. Maier, H. MLiller-Hermelink, C. Welter, P. Angel, is a well-characterized component of the DNA repair system. It is so far the most frequently impaired gene in hereditary nonpelyposis colorecta] cancer (HNPCC). Mutations in the coding region of the human gene (hMSH2) have been shown to be directly involved in microsatellite instability in HNPCC.After identification of a p53-binding motif in the proximal promoter region of the hMSH2 gene we stressed human keratinocytes by UV and we were able to show an UV- induced activation of the hMSH2 promoter. This activation was lost upon mutation of the p53-binding site. We could also show that this upregulation critically depends on functional interaction with c-jun. To study the time and UV-dose dependency of this activation, RT-PCR experiments were performed. The p53 and c-jun dependent activation of hMSH2 expression was confirmed. This activation was found to be time and UV-dose dependent. The highest hMSH2-expression was seen by 50J/ m2. At 75J/m2 the hMSH2 expression level decrease. Surprisingly, at 100 J/m2 hMSH2 expression increased again. The same dosage dependent function was seen on the protein level. To address the question of a second function of MSH2 in high dose irradiated cells, TUNEL-Assay were performed. A positive correlation between the level of hMSH2 protein and the number of apoptotic cells was found. It is well known that hMSH6 is necessary for dimer formation with MSH2 (MutSa) to detect the DNA mismatch. So far there are no data on a possible involvement of hMSH6 in apoptosis. We therefore analyzed hMSH6 protein levels in irradiated cells, hMSH6 was found to be expressed up to 50 - 75 J/m2, but no hMSH6 was detectable by UV-irradiated cells with 100 J. In summary, our data indicated that a tight regulation of hMSH2 and hMSH6 protein levels is involved in cellular response to DNA damage. P402 METHYLENETETRAHYDROFOLATE REDUCTASE (MTHFR) POLYMORPHISM enzyme that plays a central role in folate metabolism thereby affecting DNA methylation and synthesis. Aberrant DNA methylation is found frequently in esophageal cancer. A single nucleotide polymorphism at codon 677 (C to T) of the MTHFR gene has been associated with decreased enzyme activity and with increased risk for various chemically induced tumors such as lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Methods: DNA was extracted from normal tissues derived from 200 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 58 patients with Barrett's esophagus- associated adenocarcinoma (ADC) and from 254 healthy controls. The prevalence of the MTHFR 677T polymorphism was determined by restriction fragment polymorphism analysis following PCR. Results: The overall frequency for the 677T polymorphism was 35.2% in controls, 38.3% in SCC patients and 37.9% in ADC patients. The 677TT genotype was present in 13.0% of controls, in 13.0% of SCC patients and in 15.5% of ADC patients. These differences in the frequency of the 677T polymorphism were not statistically significant. Conclusions: The prevalence of 677T polymorphism of the MTHFR gene is only slightly increased in esophageal cancer patients in comparison with healthy controls. Determination of the polymorphism may therefore play no mayor role for the early identification of patients with an increased risk for the subsequent development of esophageal cancer. P403 THE USEFULNESS OF GENETIC COUNSELLING FOR HNPCC: THE COUNSELEES' PERSPECTIVE M. Keller, R. Jost, 1. To assess of the effects of comprehensive genetic counselling (GC)for HNPCC. 2. To compare the estimates of patients (pat) affected by CRC and healthy individuals(RP), across age groups and gender. Methods: Pat and RP at risk of HNPCC receive consecutive pre-test GC by geneticists, clinicians a standardised programm. 4-6 weeks after GC questionnaires are mailed to participants. Evaluation of GC using author-derived items is composed of counselees' estimate of 1. the counseling procedure and 2. of perceived effects; including knowledge, cancer worries, reassurance, assistance in decision-making and communication about the topic within the family. Answers are given on a five point Likert scale (1=not at all, 5 = very much). Results: So far, 65 counselees (n=31 pat, n=34 RP) completed the questionnaire in the ongoing study. The mean age was 50 years in pats and 37 in RR The vast majority of counselees (75-97%) experienced counselling highly useful, comprehensible and adapted to their specific needs, with no significant differences between disciplines (human geneticists, clinicians, psycho-oncologists). An inc[ease in knowledge specific to HNPCC was reported after GC, but varied between pats and RP. More than two thirds felt encouraged in their decision about genetic testing. One third reported on communicating more frequently about the familial condition. 42% of the pat but only 21% of the RP (p = 0.03) reported that their worries about the suspected hereditary condition had increased. Similarly, 50% pat and 28% RP (p = 0.002) pay more attention towards physical signs. Conclusion: Overall, counselees' response to multidisciplinary counselling is po- sitive. Positive effects are perceived in terms of reassurance, increased knowledge, learning about screening and assistance in decision-making about genetic testing. Of particular importance is that positive effects on communication within the family can be attained. On the other hand, some negative effects were revealed S 79 Gastrointestinal Cancer including Liver (1) by the results. An increase in worries and alertness towards physical signs of illness may indicate increased fear about the familial condition and one's risk , particularily among pats. This probably reflects their reaction to being confronted with the risk of HNPCC by their physicians. Future research should focus on identifying individuals at risk of increased fears about cancer and on adapting counselling strategies. P404 THE RELEVANCE OF PLOIDY AND DNA-HETEROGENEITY IN PATIENTS WITH CHOLANGIOCELLULAR CARCINOMA: A FOUR YEARS FOLLOW-UP STUDY H. AI-Abadi, S. Jonas, T. Steinrn011er, U. Settmacher, A. M(~ller, J. I. Rotter, P. Charite, Campus Virchow-Klinikum (Berlin) Aim: Tumor stage, grade, metastases and complete tumor resection are used as prognostic factors to predict the outcome of Patients with cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) after liver resection. But their clinical value seems to be limited. In this study, we investigated the predictive value of DNA-ploidy for outcome of patients resected due to CCC. Methods: This prospective study included 32 patients with CCC within a period of 4 years. All patients received liver resection. Tissue specimens were taken from the tumor immediately after resection. The DNA-analysis was performed by means of image cytometry. The results of DNA-analyses were related to the histopathological tumor grade, stage and the clinical course. Patients were followed up for 1 to 4 years after liver resection. Results: Tumor staging assigned 6% of patients to the tumor stage pT1, 8% to stage pT2, 35% to stage pT3 and 51% to stage pT4. Tumor grading showed mostly grade 2 (65%) and less frequent tumor grade 2 (22%) and grade 1 (13%). DNA-analysis classified (72%). Tumor-free parts were found in 57% (=R0- resection) of patients whereas Rl-resection occurred in 5% and R2-resection was recorded in 38% of patients.Survival was strongly related with ploidy. All patients afflicted from metastasis at time of operation or thereafter suffered from aneuploid tumors indicating a poor prognosis (p=0.00O6). Conclusion: We conclude that DNA-ploidy is a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying subgroups of patients with CCC that may be at higher risk for tumor progression and might not benefit from liver resection. P405 ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE MOUSE MLH1 PROMOTER REGION, AND TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATIONREGION C. Kaiser, F. Rauscher, W. Bernhardt, (WQrzburg) MLH1 is a well-known component involved in the DNA mismatch repair process. It is one of the most frequently impaired gene in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Absence of the expression of the MLH1 gene is discussed to be involved in the development of sporadic carcinomas. Different studies reported about hypermethylation in the promoter region of hMLH1 in cancer development. However, not much is known about the transcriptional regulation of the MLH1 gene. While the human MLHl-promoter region is sequenced the mouse mlhl promoter is unknown. To study transcriptional regulation of the mlhl gene we sequenced and characterized 1200 bp of the mmlhl-promoter region. It shows 90% similarity to the human MLH1 promoter region and no similarity to the human MSH2 or mouse rash2 promoter. Bioinformatic analysis for transcriptional binding sites and enhancer motifs revealed a multiplicity of putative motifs. In accordance will regulation studies on hMSH2 some similar binding motifs were found. We previously have shown that p53 and AP-1 play an important role in the transcriptional regulation of the hMSH2 gene. In a first step we identified a region in the rnmlhl gene for basal transcription. Therefore we constructed seven fusion plasmids carrying fragments of different length of the mmlhl promoter region. In a second step we started to analyze functional consequences of several transcription factor binding on the promoter motif in response to cell stress. P406 PRACTICAL EVALUATION OF TUMOR BOARD RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE CENTER FOR GASTROINTESTINAL ONCOLOGY AT TUBINGEN UNIVERSITY C. was founded at T0bingen university in order to coordinate the interdisciplinary management during diagnosis and treatment of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies. The center is formed by members of the department of surgery (Prof. Becket), gastroenterology (Prof. Gregor), medical oncology (Prof. Kanz), radiooncology radiology (Prof. Clausen) pathology (Prof. B01tmann). The ZGO is a disease orientated center working within the context of the Interdisciplinary Cancer Center at TSbingen university. Data from all patients treated within the university hospital are coflected and patient management is discussed at interdisciplinary tumor boards with members of all departments twice weakly. We have now evaluated the recommendations given and the performed diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in these patients presented at tumor boards between January 2001 and July 2001. All patients were documented based on a computer systeme (Giessener Tumordokumentatienssystem) and data were retrieved from discharge letters of these patients. Number of patients presented and recommendations given and follow up is presented in the following table: Table 1: Half of all recommendations were followed as given by the tumor board. These recommendations included 36 diagnostic procedures and 78 therapeutic recommendations. In 96 cases recommendations could not be evaluated due to missing data. Excluding these patients from the analysis, recommendations are followed in 85% of patients. Further analysis why recommendations were not followed in 17 patients (7%) wilt be given in detail. In 15 of these cases the therapy recommended was not chosen, but 13 of these patients received an alternative treatment strategy.This investigation reports a novel strategy of data analysis as a matter of quality assurance: Not only interdisciplinary based treatment recommendation are given for individual patients, but the center for gastrointestinal oncology also allows evaluation of treatment recommendations and outcome by trying to completely evaluate all patients with GI-cancers within TQbingen university hospital.

LShr, H. Joseph, A. Lehr, L. Goodman, M. Heike, Dept. Internal Medicine University Mainz, Institute for Pathology, University Mainz, Merck, Dept. Internal Medicine Universityt Mainz (Mainz, Darmstadt) Background: Multifocal metachronous lesions are common in hepatocelluar arcinoma. Unless liver transplantation effective therapeutic approaches are mis- sing. In order to look for new therapeutic options the expression of various integfins on proliferating endothelial cells were analysed. Methods: Liver tissue samples from seven patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or two control patients with liver cirrhosis and turnout samples from four patients with other malignant disorders were serially stained for alpha-v-beta-3 Staining with LM609 and 20H9 antibodies showed strong expression of integrins on vascular endothelial cells within the tumour areas in the seven analysed HCC patients. Using P1F6 and 11D1 antibodies vascular cells but also fibrotic and cirrhotic areas showed positive staining, Patients with colon or renal carcinoma and sarcoma had no alpha-v-beta-3 integrin expression. Colon carcinoma showed strong vEGF-R expression while the staining in sarcoma and HCC was rather weak. Conclusions: The systematic semiquantitative analysis of hepatecellular carcinoma revealed overexpression of alpha-v-beta-3 integrins on endothelial cells within the tumour areas and could promote tumour growth. Blocking of the integrin pathway by peptides (Cilengitide, Merck) could inhibit residual turnout cells and could, therefore, lead to new therapeutic approaches. P408 SECOND-LINE TREATMENT OF ADVANCED (HD-5-FU) (FA) AFTER FAILURE FOR HD-5-FU/FA R. Hofheinz, G. Hartung, S. Samel, A. (IRI) has shown to prolong survival and improve quality of life compared to best supportive care in colorectal cancer (CRC)-patients with pretreatment of bolus 5-FU. rate has been reported diarrhea 23%, nausea 12%. The present study investigated weekly IRI in combination with 24-hour HD-5-FU and FA as a second-line treatment after prior exposure to 24-hour HD-5-FU 2,600mg/m2 and FA 500rag/m2. Clinically known synergy between 5-FU and IRI was the rationale to combine both drugs for second-line therapy in order to overcome resistance to 5-FU. Weekly IRI was chosen to reduce toxicity compared to a 3-weekly schedule. METHODS: Patients (pts) were recruited in a single institution to receive 6x weekly IRI 80mg/m2, FA 20Omg/m2 and 24-hour HD-5-FU 2,000rng/m2. Treatment was repeated on day 57. RESULTS: 35 pts (m/f 22/13; median WHO status 1; median age 61 [range 25-781) are evaluable for toxicity and 34 for response. 6 patients (17%) achieved a partial S 80 Gastrointestinal Cancer including Liver (1) remission. In 14 patients (40%) no change was observed, while in 14 patients (40%) disease progressed. Median time to progression was 99 days (4 pts censored) and overall survival was 245 days (12 pts censored). 88 treatment cycles are evaluable for toxicity 4 toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION: Weekly IRI/HD-5-FU/FA is an active combination chemotherapy with tumor control rates in the range of other IRI-based second-line schedules. The toxicity profile in our study appears to be favourable compared to 3-weekly IRI. P409 META-IODOBENZYLGUANIDINE INDUCES GROWTH GASTROINTESTINAL CELLS M. HSpfner, Sutter, Barthel, K. Maaser, H. ScherQbl, UKBF FU Berlin (Berlin) Neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumors specifically take up, decarboxylate and store large of rnonoamines in secretory [MIBG] have been used for the detection of neuroendocrine tumors for many years. MIBG is selectively taken up by norepinephrine transporters (NET) localized in the plasma membrane of neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumor cells and thereby offers the possibility for specific, innovative therapeutic approaches. Therefore, we investigated the antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects of MIBG in the neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumor cell line STC-1 and for control in the non-neuroendocrine colorectal cancer cell line HT-29. RT-PCR revealed the expression of NET in STC-1 but net in HT-29 cells. MIBG dose-dependently induced cytotoxieity growth cells. It potently induced apoptosis in STC-1 cells as assessed by measuring the mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation. Moreover, MIBG altered the expression of several genes involved in proliferation, apoptosis and stress-responses as shown by cDNA-arrays. In contrast, neither cytotoxicity, nor growth inhibition, nor induction of apoptosis were detected in response to MIBG in the NET-deficient colorectal cancer cell line HT-29. Our data show that MIBG, specifically taken up by NET, induces growth inhibition and apeptosis in neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumor cells. Thus, monoamine transporters in the plasma membrane of neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumor cells are promising targets for innovative and specific therapies of neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumors and merit further elucidation. P410 QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH GASTROINTESTINAL CANCER M. Berend, J. Siebmann, Objective: Quality of life (QoL) assessment completes the picture that is obtained from clinical data when evaluating the course of illness and the impact of treatment. A routine assessment of QoL starting before the operation and with up to two years follow-up is part of the internal quality management in the pilot project ,,Operative Oncology\". The objectives of this study were to assess outcome in terms of quality of life in patients with gastrointestinal cancer and to describe differences between the diagnosis specific subgroups. Subject sample and statement of methods: In order to assess QoL in 7 diagnostic subgroups at 6 different points in time, a rather complex logistic system had to be established within the Department of Surgery. Diagnosis specific modules that complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 (core questionnaire) were developed prior to the study, so that detailed symptoms and problems of the different groups could be analyzed. From 4/98 to 12/00 670 patients with carcinoma of the colon, rectum, stomach, pancreas and esophageal have been entered into the trial and their medical data were recorded. Statistics: we calculated contrasts between the groups and the level of significance of the single tests was adjusted for the 15 scales of the QLQ-C 30 with 3 contrast each. Results: Negative long term changes in QoL are not found in the group of patients with colon carcinoma. After rectum cancer the patients describe negative long term changes in role functioning and they suffer from an increase of nausea and vomiting, but they experience as well positive long-term changes in their emotio- nal situation. Negative long-term changes in physical functioning are reported by patients with pancreatic and esophageal cancer. After 6 months the esophageal group suffers from an increase of dyspnoea and diarrhea. Patients with stomach carcinoma are the group with the most negative changes in QoL. Conclusion: The results presented are descriptive and give a summary of the quality of life of patients with gastrointestinal cancer. They show distinct differences in QoL in different diagnosis. The database allows an inside into the main problems of patients with different gastrointestinal carcinoma. Long-term assessment including multilevel analysis are necessary to validate the results presented. P411 DIFFERENT SURVIVIN VARIANTS IN GASTRIC CARCINOMAS AND NORMAL GASTRIC MUCOSA: FIRST CLUES TO A ROLE OF SURVIVIN-2B IN TUMOR PROGRESSION A. Krieg, C. Mahotka, med. Informatik (DLisseldorf) Objective: Recently, we identified novel alternative splice the apoptosis inhibitor survivin, differing whereas the antiapoptotic potential of survivin-deltaEx3 is preserved, survivin-2B has lost its antiapoptotic potential and may act as a naturally occurring antagonist of survivin. Because the in vivo expression of these alternative splice variants has not been explored so far, we analyzed gastric carcinomas of different histological subtypes, grades and stages. Methods: Total RNA from 30 gastric carcinomas and 14 paired normal gastric mucosa tissues was isolated by acid guanidium thiocyanate phenol chloroform extraction. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to determine the expression of survivin variants. Detection of survivin protein for 4 gastric carcinomas samples was analyzed by Immunoblotting. Results: 1. All gastric carcinomas express survivin-deltaEx3, survivin-2B and survivin, irrespective of their histological types, grades or stages. 2. Normal gastric mucosa expresses survivin and survivin-2B only on lower levels than paired gastric carcinomas (p = 0.005, p = 0.020) 3. Comparing the disease stages I + II with III + IV, expression of survivin and survivin-deltaEx3 remained un- changed. In contrast, a significant (p = 0.033) stage-dependent decrease in the expression of survivin-2B became evident. 4. The ratios of mRNA levels between survivin-deltaEx3 or survivin-2B on one hand and survivin as an internal standard on the other hand further confirmed the significant stage-dependent decrease of non-antiapoptotic survivin-2B (p = 0.037). 5. No statistically significant correlation became evident between the expression of survivin variants and clinicopathologi- cal parameters, such as histological tumor typing and grading, blood or lymphatic vessel invasion. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates for the first time the expression of alterna- tive splice variants in gastric carcinomas and provides a first clue to a role of survivin-2B in tumor progression. P412 OPTIONS OF PSEUDOMYXOMA PERITONEI THERAPY M. Federlein, M. Herzig, K. Zippel, H. Hollerbuhl, K. Gellert, Krankenhaus-Lichtenberg (Berlin) The knowledge of the most effective therapy of Pseudomyxoma peritonei is limited due to the rarity of affections and a small number of cases. The onset of the disease is often associated with a neoplasma of the appendix. Pathologically and anatomically, a proliferation of mucus producing cells with an abundant mucous accumulation appears in the peritoneal cavity. The level of dignity is often difficult to estimate and mainly determined by the course of the disease. Possible therapeutical approaches are indicated by a retrospective analysis of 9 patients. 21 operations on 8 patients were performed. 4 patients received a tumor debulking operation combined with an intraoperative intraperitoneally chemotherapy. In 2 patients intraoperative intraperitoneal application of Mitomycin and a postopera- tire lavage with 5-FU were combined. On one female patient Novantron was applied, and Cisp]atin was applied on another male patient. In one case a R0- resection was successfully performed. Instead of intraperitoneal chemotherapy 4 patients received an adjuvant systemically chemotherapy following the Ardalan-scheme because of their advanced stage after surgery. Due to his old age one patient was only punctured peritoneally. Distant metastasizes were not detected. The surgical therapy is the basis for the treatment of Pseudomyxoma peritonei. Additional means are intraperitonea[ or systemical chemotherapy. Within 9 years of postoperative monitoring after the primary operation 2 patients who received intraperiteneal chemotherapy died 5 and 6 years later. One patient is without any tumor after intraoperative chemotherapy and R0-resection. After systemical chemotherapy all four of the patients have survived for up to 9 years. P413 MICROSATELLITE ANALYSIS IN TUMOR AND SERUM DNA OF PATIENTS WITH ESOPHAGEAL CANCER C.F. an integral part of neoplastic pro- gression. They are valuable markers for detection of humann cancer. Material and methods: We tested 23 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma of all TNM stages with PCR-based micresatellites analysis of non neoplastic DNA, tumor DNA, and serum DNA with fluoreszent primers. Additionally, ten healthy persons served as controls. DNA was extracted from paraffin and kryo-preserved specimens, as well as peripheral lymphocytes (controls). The serum of the pa- tients was drawn preoperatively and the DNA was extracted. Three microsatellites markers on chromosom 17p(p53) were examined. Complete follow-up was avail- able for 21 patients. Results: 13 of 23 patients (57%) with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus showed one or more alterations in the tumor and 11 of 23 patients (48%) showed identical alterations in the serum. None of the controls showed alterations. Patients with- out LOH in the tumor or in the serum had a median recurrenc-free survival 20 months. Patients with LOH in the tumor and serum had a median recurrence-free survival of 11 months/7 months, respectively. Patients without LOH in tumor and serum had a median recurrence-free survival of more than 20 months, whereas patients with LOH in tumor and serum showed a median recurrence-free survival of seven months. There was no significant correlation of LOH in tumor, serum, or LOH in tumor and serum with the T-stage, or the N stage at this time of follow-up, but there was a clear trend towards shorter survival in patients with LOH in their DNA. Summary: Patients with LOH in tumor or serum, or in tumor and serum showed shorter survival with earlier recurrence. Microsatellite analysis of serum and $81 Gastrointestinal Cancer including Liver (1) tumor DNA represents a novelmethod for the detection of neoplastic DNA in patients with esophageal cancer. Microsatellite analysis could represent a new method in early diagnosis of malignant disease, it could be a new tool in the estimation of the individual prognosis and could help in the evaluation of the indication for adjuvant chemotherapie. P414 COLORECTAL CANCER ON THE INTERNET D. MOiler, (Freiburg) Purpose: To define and evaluate the quantity and quality of health-related information for patients with colon carcinoma available on the internet and the difficulty of reaching these sites via search engines. Methods: Using a special software tool all the hits from 19 search engines were collected, providing a result of 2218 hits for the keywords ,,Rektumkarzinom\" or ,,Darmkrebs\" for example. These hits were checked for dublettes and sorted in a database (date: 2001-0[}-01, 19:36). Then all URL addresses were visited and analysed with a specially developed questionnaire. Results: 1387/5268 (26,2%) hits linked to sites with relevant information to the topic, representing only 89 (1.7%) web projects providing complete or nearly complete informational content. 1039/5268(19.7%) were not available at the date of the analysis and 2842/5268 (53.9%) were not helpful for the patient concerning his personal disease. The in- depth analysis of the 1387 relevant resources showed: 63.9% were addressed to patients to read the information, 27.7% were addressed to physicians and 8.3% to patients and physicians. 32.4% had an industrial, 61.8% an institutional (mainly universities) and 5.9% a private origin. 51.3% provide information about prognosis, 10.8% about aetiology, 89.2% state therapy options, 27.0% the possible side effects, 75.7% the risks and 21.6% the duration of therapy. Conclusions: Getting health information from the web by using search engines (studies had clearly shown that this is the most common way to search informations on the Internet) is not very sufficient. There are way too many misleading hits and it is difficult to judge whether provided information is useful and supportive for the specific situation of the patient. Besides this, almost all of the few sites that give a full range of information about colon carcinoma do this very accurate. This means if patients get links to informative sites, they may get all the precise information they are looking for. P415 RESECTION OF GASTRIC TUMORS R.A. Lang, 20 laparoscopic gastric resections (3 x 2/3 resection and 17 ? atypic resection) were carried out. This feasibility study examines the clinical and surgical results with a maximum follow-up period of 10 years. Methods: The indication for 2/3-resection was a MALT-Lymphoma in 2 cases and one early gastric cancer. The reconstruction was done as a Billroth II procedure. The anastomoses were done completely intracorporally in two patients, and laparoscopically assisted in one case. The atypic gastric resections were done for malignant disease in 3 patients (2x gastrointestinal stroma tumor (GIST), lx early gastric cancer) as well as for GIST of unknown dignity (lx). Smaller resections werd In 5 patients laparoscopic simultaneous procedures were carried out (fundoplication, cholecystectomy resection for adenoma lx, uterus exstirpation). Results: Length of surgery including simultaneous procedures was 265 and 380 min (Median: 335 min) for Biilroth II procedures, between 65 and 300 rain (Median: 103 min) for atypic resections. The suture lines were examined endoscopically in all patients immediately after surgery. In one case a laparoscopic correction of the suture line was necessary. In 6 patients minor bleeding complications from the suture line were closed by laparoscopic application of clips. During laparoscopic colon resection one splenic lesion occured which was taken care of via laparoscopic application of Tabotamb. In one patient with malignant GIST a conventional subtotal gastric resection was performed after receiving the defenite histology. The median postoperative stay was 13 days for 2/3-resections and 9 days for atypic resection. During the study period no conversion was necessary, the postoperative morbidity rate is 6% (hypertensive crisis) and the postoperative mortality is 0%. Until now with a median follow-up of 53 months no recurrent malignant disease was observed. Conclusions: Laparoscopy offers a novel treatment option for anatomical as well as atypic gastric resection even in malignant disease which can be carried out without complications in selected patients. Laparoscopic gastric resections are safe and allow for radical surgery and, therefore, are a promising addition to the surgical spectrum for the treatment of gastric tumors. P416 HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA: CLINICAL ASPECTS OF NUCLER DNA ANALYSIS FOR LIVER TRANSPLANTATION. A FOLLOW-UP STUDY OF 12 YEARS H. AI-Abadi, 1-. SteinmiJller, S. Jonas, U. Settmacher, A. M011er, J. Langrehr, I. Rotter, P. Neuhaus, CharitY, Campus Virchow-Klinikum (Berlin) Aim: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of death in cirrhotic patients and is responsible for more than 1 milion deaths per year world wide and those remains a challenging medical problem. The histomorphological classification of HCC is difficult, mainly because there is no valid grading system so far, providing reliable and reproducible results. According to previous study, liver transplantation should only be considered as a treatment option for a selected subset of patients suffering from HCC. In a prospective study we investigated the clinical relevance of Quantitative DNA-Ploidy for patients receiving liver transplantation due to HCC. Patients and Methods: The study reviewed 1136 patients undergoing liver transplantation between January 1989 and December 1999. Thereof 115 patients receiving liver transplantation, presented HCC in the explanted liver. In a prospective study we enrolled 87 patients for which DNA-cytometry data were available. The follow-up period ranged up to 12 years. The DNA-ploidy was determined by means of image cytometry on nuclei isolated from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded material. Results: The results of DNA analysis were related to the tumor categories, histopathological grading, and the clinical course. A significant correlation was found between the results of DNA cytometry and the clinical course of the disease. Patients with diploid tumor cell lines had no metastasis and no local tumor progression during the follow up time whereas patients with aneuploid cell line suffered recurrence and tumor progression. The difference of tumor progression between diploid and aneuploid tumors were highly significant (P<0.001) Conclusion: Quantitative DNA-ploidy is a useful, additional diagnostic tool to predict clinical outcome of patients with HCC and therefore to select patients for liver transplantation. P417 IDENTIFICATION AND VALIDATION OF PROGNOSTIC FACTORS IN COLORECTAL CANCER THROUGH APPLICATION WAREHOUSE G.M. Walten, F.G.E. Perabo, Oncology-World (Planegg) BACKGROUND. The TNM the basis for the most important prog- nostic factors in colorectal cancer patients. In the last years various other prognostic factors have been dicovered. These may be tumor-related, especially molecular, biologic and genetic factors, host- related and enviroment-related. The aim of this ongoing study is to evaluate the relevance of each of them as well as the combination of two or more as a \"prognostic system\" on a patients therapy and outcome. METHODS. New technology in medical informatics will facilitate collection of comprehensive data. The combination of statistical methods, analysis of im- mense databases and networking of information will allow to evaluate the prog- nostic data. The molecular, genetic and biological factors that have been selected were inves- tigated in studies with at least 100 patients and published in peer-reviewed journals. RESULTS. More than 60 factors have been reviewed and evaluated. We catego- rized these factors corresponding to their tumorbiology in six groups \u00a7 Molecular tumor tissue markers (e.g. TS, CA 19-9) \u00a7 Gene alterations \u00a7 Cell cycle regulation (e.g. p27) CONCLUSION. New and promising prognostic factors may enhance the patients individual treatment. They can improve the prediction of tumor bahavior and consequently the patients oucome. However there is still a limitation in prognostication, further investigations have to be done. P418 APPLICATION OF 5-FU CONTAINING CHEMOTHERAPIES ARE FREQUENTLY ASSOCITATED WITH A CONTRACTION OF THE BRACHIAL ARTERY T. SLidhoff, M. Palke, (5-FU) to the most often used cytostatic drugs and 7-10% of the patients treated will develop cardiovascular complications. Nevertheless, the underlying pathophysiology is unknown and noninvasive diagnostic procedures which allow a risk stratification are not established. Methods: We investigated prospectively the influence of 5-FU infusions on the diameter of the brachial artery using high resolution ultrasound (Esoate/Biosound, 13.0 MHz tranducer) in 22 patients with solid tumors (18 x colorectal cancer, 2x pancreatic cancer, bolus, 7x continuous infusions). 23 patients (17 other cytostatic drugs (11x carbo-/cisplatin, 5x anthracycline, 7x cyclophosphamide) served as group. Additionally, plasma levels of big endothelin were serially assessed using a commercially available ELISA assay in 13 of these patients receiving 5-FU and 6 patients receiving cyclophosphamide. Results: 11 of 22 patients (50%) showed a contraction of the brachialis artery, defined as reduction of vessel diameter 3 4%, after the end of 5-FU application (median 11%, range 4,3-19,5), whereas no contraction was noticed in 23 pts of the control group. The big endothelin plasma levels were significantly increased 2 hours after start of 5-FU infusions compared to baseline fmol/ml (0.09-6.69), U-Test: there was no increase in big endothelin plasma levels after cyclophosphamide infusions prior to 5-FU applications prevented contraction of the brachial artery in the two cases investigated. Discussion: According to our data 5-FU is commonly accompanied by contractions S 82 Gastrointestinal Cancer including Liver (1) / Gastrointestinal Cancer including Liver (2) of the brachial artery, whereas arterial contractions are absent following infusions with platinum derivates, anthracyclines or cyclophosphamide. Measurement of big endothelin plasma levels favour a role of big endothelin in 5-FU-associated vessel contraction and is in accordance to the successful prevention of vessel contraction by glyceroitrinitrate. The ongoing investigation will clarify whether high resolution ultrasound of the A. brachialis may serve as an easy to use non- invasive prodecure to stratify the risk of 5-FU-induced cardiovascular complications in tumor patients. P419 EXPRESSION OF TRAIL RECEPTORS AND CD95 (FAS/APO-1) IN RO-RESECTED STAGE II/111 Walczak, apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) may selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells and may be involved in the protection from metastases. The four known specific TRAIL receptors (TRAIL-R1-4) belong to the TNF receptor (TNFR) mediate apoptosis while TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4 do not transmit a death signal and may act as decoy receptors, CD95 (Fas/APO-1) is another apoptosis-inducing member of the TNFR superfamily. To examine the expression of CD95 and TRAIL receptors in colon carcinomas, immunohistochemistry was performed on 129 R0-resected UICC stage II/lll turnouts. The results were analysed with regard to disease-free survival. While constitutively expressed in the normal colon epithelium, CD95 expression was reduced or lost in most carcinomas as compared to normal expression levels. TRAIL-R3 which is not expressed in the normal mucosa, appeared in 73 of 129 carcinomas although mostly at low levels. TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2 and TRAIL-R4 expression was quite variable and expression levels also varied between different areas of the same tumour. Interestingly, with these receptors, there was no general tendency towards a lower or higher expression level in tumours compared to the normal epithelium. CD95, TRAIL, TRAIL-R2, TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4 expression did not correlate with survival, but TRAIL-R1 expression was significantly associated with disease-free survival (multivariate analysis: p=0.002). We conclude that TRAIL-R1 factor in R0-resected UICC stage II/111 colon carcinomas and may thus influence the decision for adjuvant therapy. P420 POSTOPERATIVE RADIOCHEMOTHERAPY IN STAGE II AND III RECTAL CANCER PATIENTS: PROGNOSTIC FACTORS J. Purpose: Several studies have shown a substantial benefit in local control and survival for UICC stage I1 and Ill rectal cancer patients who receive radiochemotherapy after surgery. We analysed prognostic factors for overall survival, local control and metastasis-free survival in this subgroup. Patients and methods: 49 stage II and 96 stage III rectal cancer patients were treated between 12/1992 and 8/2000 with postoperative concurrent radiochemotherapy. A sphincter sparing procedure was performed in 103 and abdominoperineal resection in 42 pts. Histopathological examination revealed a R1- in 6 and R2-situation in 3 pts. All patients received 5 FU containing chemotherapy and a median radiotherapy dose of 50,4 Gy (9-59,4) in 28 fractions. The influence of UICC- and T-stage, nodal stage, margin status, grading, age, gender and chemotherapy dose on overall survival, local control and metastasis-free survival was analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method and in a Cox regression model after a median follow up of 43 months (9-104). Results: Stage had a major impact on metastasis-free survival (p<0.00Ol) and on overall survival (p<0.013) as well, while local control was independent of UICC stage. Margin status revealed an important influence on local control (p<O.OO3) with impairment of overall survival (p<0,OOl). After subdividing stage III in T1/2 N+ and T3/4 N+ (equivalent to C1 and 2 in the Astler Coller system) a clearcut difference between C1 and B2 / C2 became obvious. Local control was 100 % in C1, 82 % in B2 and 67 % in C2 pts.at 5 yrs (p<0.0045). Reduction of the foreseen chemotherapy courses by more than 25 % was associated with an impairment of overall survival (p=O.OO6) and local control (p=0.053). Conclusion: Margin status and stage are the most important prognostic factors in stage It and III rectal cancer pts. after postoperative radiochemotherapy. Only reduction of the number of chemotherapy courses had an independent impact on local control and overall survival as well. P421 EXON-14-SKIPPING-MUTATION OF THE DPD-GENE AND SEVERE Kliche, W. Schwabe, M. Raida, P. catabolism of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Deficiency of DPD as a result of various genetic defects has been linked to toxic side effects of 5-FU. The most prominent mutation of the DPD gene resulting in severe DPD deficiency is a G to A mutation in the GT 5'-splice recognition site of intron 14 (exon 14 skipping mutation). The corresponding mRNA lacks exon 14 and the enzymatic activity of the translated DPD protein is virtually absent. In a clinical setting both heterozygous as well as homzygous carriers are being observed. We developed an RT-PCR based assay suitable for routine identification of the exon 14 skipping mutation. Meanwhile we screened a control cohort of 851 normal control individuals, where 8 heterozygotes for exon 14 skipping mutation were detected (0.94%). Therefore it is safe to assume that the prevalence of the heterozygous state in the general population is around 1%. In addition we tested more than 1700 patients (prospectively as well as retrospectively) and have currently identified 54 so-called ,,exon-skippers\", 53 of them (98,1%) being heterozygous and one individual (1,9 %) was found to be homozygous for the exon 14 skipping mutation. Among these 54 patients 3 died due to therapy induced side effects, 44 experienced WHO grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression, diarrhea or mucositis, and 7 patients were prospectively identified. The lethal outcome was seen in the homozygous patient and two of the heterozygous cases. We conclude that carriers of the DPD exon 14 skipping mutation are at significantly increased risk to experience life threatening myelosuppression, diarrhea or mucositis upon 5-FU treatment even when the allelic status is heterozygous. These patients should undergo a specifically developped pharmakokinetic testing after 5-FU test doses. On this basis individual recommendations for the therapy with 5-FU can be made. In homozygous carriers of the exon-14-mutation 5-FU is strictly contraindicated. The testing for the exon 14 skipping mutation prior to 5-FU treatment is an interesting and clinically relevant example for the rapidly developing field of pharmacogenomics, which is an important step towards individually tailored therapy in cancer patients. P422 CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF DRUG METABOLISM POLYMORPHISMS IN RELATION TO THE ALPHA1-FETOPROTEIN (AFP)-LEVEL IN HUMAN HEPATO- CELLULAR CARCINOMA PATIENTS. U. Schotte, K. Farker, M. Hommann, A. Hoffmann, J. Scheele, Clinic of Surgery, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology (Jena) Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly malignant disease with a poor progno- sis. Because of a presumed interaction between the genetic polymorphisms of NAT2 (N-acetyltransferase 2) and the cancer risk we have to look for the risk factors, the right diagnostics and the consequences for treatment. Genotyping of NAT2 was performed in 56 HCC patients and 63 healthy volunteers with polymer- ase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphisms methods. The AFP-level was measured by the HCC patients. 69,6 % of the HCC patients were NAT2-slow acetylators in contrast to 54,0 % NAT2-slow acetylators in the group of volunteers. The difference was p = 0,080. An increased level of AFP was performed by 74,4 % of NAT2-slow acetylators and 98,2 acetylators in the HCC-group. NAT2-slow acetylators are problematic for early diagnosis based on blood AFP-tests. The NAT2 polymorphisms are associated with the development of HCC and it is important for the xenobiotic metabolism of drugs such as amonafide (topoisomerase inhibitor). We ought to look for the genetic polymorphisms in order to get a safe drug therapy. Gastrointestinal Cancer including Liver {2} Oral Presentation 0423 PREDICTIVE FACTORS FOR NEOADJUVANT THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH ESOPHAGEAL CARCINOMA A. Imdahl, G. was introduced to improve the outcome of patients with esophageal cancer (EC), but conflicting results have been published. Some 20 - 30 % of patients show a complete pathological response, however, the perioperative morbidity and mortality is increased. To search for factors indicating response prior to the onset of RCX we investigated the proliferative activity (MIB- 1), the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the capillary density (CD34) in samples of EC obtained by endoscopy prior to the start of the treatment. Forty six (MIB-1) and 21 (VEGF, CD 34) tissue specimens of ECs were available from 56 patients under going pretherapeutic endoscopy, RCX and surgery. Perioperative morbidity was divided in surgery and non-surgery related morbidity. The results were compared with a historical group of patients (n=32) operated without preoperative RCX. MIB-1, VEGF and CD34 expression were investigated immunohistochemically. Multivariate analysis was carried out to prove independence of investigated variables. Postoperative morbidity was noticed in 81 of 88 operated patients. There was a clear increase in recurrent nerve palsy/paresis combined with pneumonia in patients after RCX. 8 of 56 patients who received RCX died in hospital compared with 5 of 32 in the historical group. Survival was significantly different between the group of complete responders (n=15) and of non-responders (n=21; p=0,0026). Survival differences between patients with complete or partial response and the historical group were also significant (p=0,0051). None of the investigated tumor samples from patients with a complete response had a proliferation index of less than 45. Tumor samples from patients with a complete response showed a VEGF expression of 10,7 compared with 36,58 of tumors with no response (p=0,035). CD 34 expression showed a correlation with VEGF expression. The relation of mean S 83 Gastrointestinal Cancer including Liver (2) indices of VEGF-expression and proliferative activity in tumors from patients with complete, partial or no response was 10,7: 58,8, 18,3:53,8 and 36,6:43,5 respectively. According to these results it may be expected that tumors with a VEGF / MIB-I ratio of 1:6 or less prior to RCX will respond to this therapy. 0424 TUMORSPECIFIC IMMUNOTHERAPY WITH THE HUMAN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY SC-1 IN PATIENTS WITH GASTRIC CARCINOMA - FIRST CLINICAL RESULTS W. Timmermann, B. is monoclonal antibody directed against gastric carcinoma cells. SO-1 binds to a pathologic isoform of CD-55 and induces apoptosis in tumorcells independent from other immunological components. SC-1 inhibits growth of receptor positive tumorcells and leads to regression of tumors. Aims of the study were a) to determinate how many patients with gastric carcinoma express the receptor, b) how SC-1 is tolerated when used preoperatively and c) to investigate the effect of SC-f treatment on resected tumor specimen. Patients and methods: 125 patients with gastric carcinoma were tested preoperative for expression of the SC-1 receptor. 59 (47%) of them were positive. From 7/1997 - 5/2001 a total of 51 patients were treated with 20 mg SO-1 antibody each 48 hours before gastrectomy. After resection of the tumor the specimen were analyzed for apoptosis and tumor regression in comparison to the preoperative biopsy. Mean survival of treated patients was determined. Results: After antibody treatment 3/51 patients (6%) had reversible episodes of fever and shivering. In 84% of resected tumor specimen a significant rate of apoptosis (>30%) was seen. More than 60% of tumors showed clearly regression of tumor cells compared to preoperative biopsy. 35 patients were resected curative (R0) and followed up for a minimum of 12 month. Tumor stages according to UICC Seven of these patients died. Survival in the R0-resected group was 78% after 36 month. All patients after palliative resection (B1/R2) died from tumor disease, mean survival was 5,4 month. For the first time in bone marrow of one tumor patient tumorcells positive for both cytokeratin and SC-1 could be detected proving dissemination of tumor cells. Conclusion: Treatment with antibody SC-1 is an option for an additive tumorspecific and individual immunotherapy in patients with gastric carcinoma and positive SC- 1 receptor. SC-1 is well tolerated after intravenous application. The effect of SC- 1 antibody treatment could clearly be seen on tumor specimen triggering apoptosis and regression. SC-1 is could be used additional after curative resection to fight minimal residual disease through elimination of disseminated tumor cells. 0425 IDENTIFICATION OF HIGH-RISK GROUPS IN STAGE II COLON CARCINOMA AND LoW-RISK GROUPS IN STAGE Ill COLON CARCINOMA S. Merkel, U. Mansmann, T. Papadopoulos, W. Hohenberger, present (p)TNM classification for invasive colorectal carcinoma provides four stages. While stage I patients have an excellent prognosis, stage IV patients show a worse prognosis. However, there is a certain inhomogeneity in stage II and III colorectal carcinomas. The aim of our study was to identify high- risk groups in stage II colon carcinoma and low-risk groups in stage Ill colon carcinoma. Patients and methods: The data of 305 patients with stage II colon carcinoma and 350 patients with stage Ill colon carcinoma treated between 1978 and 1997 by radical surgery alone were analysed. Disease-related 5-year survival rates and rates of distant metastases were calculated according to Kaplan-Meier. In stage II patients proven and probable prognostic factors were analysed to identify risk factors for a worse outcome. In stage III patients three different subdivisions were performed according to pT, pN and pT pN. In both analyses the data were then compared with respective data from the German Study Group for Colorectat Carcinoma (SGCRC). Results: Emergency presentation, a primary turnout site in the left colon, pT3 tumours with a depth of invasion of > 15 mm beyond the outer border of the musculads propria, and pT4 lesions were identified as the major risk factors for stage tl colon carcinoma. Qn dividing patients into subgroups according to these risk factors, it was found that patients in the high-dsk group (n=63, 20.7%) had a significantly higher risk of distant metastases (29.6% vs. 10.6%) and a significantly lower disease-related 5-year survival rate (78.1% vs. 93.6%) compared with patients in the low-risk group (n=242, 79.3%). In stage III a subdivision according to pT and pN was found to be superior. The of the 5- 100%, 75.4% (95%Ch 69.1-81.7), and 43.2% (33.7-52.7). Conclusions: Among patients with stage II colon carcinoma, it was possible to identify a high-risk group of patients who may be candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy. Subdivision of stage III colon carcinoma into three substages according to the pT and pN categories resulted in subgroups which differed significantly in prognosis. 0426 INCREASE OF THE ADJUVANT TREATMENT BENEFIT IN ADVANCED RESECTABLE COLON CANCER WITH SYSTEMIC TREATMENT OF 5- FU+LEVAMISOLE; 5-YEAR SURVIVAL RATES AND RESULTS OF THE FOGT 1- TRIAL K. Link, E. Kreuser, adjuvant therapy in UICC II T4NOMO and UICC Ill colon cancer with 5-FU+Levamisole (LEV) is improved by modulating 5- FU+LEV either with Folinic Acid (FA) or Interferon alpha-2a (IFNa). Patients and Methods: In a multicenter controlled randomised trial 818 patients (pts.) with resected colon cancers T4NOM0 (55 pts) and T1-3N1-2M0 (763 pts) were included and stratified according to T- and N-stage and participating centers (63 hospitals). The standard treatment (arm A; 278 pts) consisted of 5-FU 450 mg/ m2, delivered as loading course dl-5, and, after 4 w intermission, weekly for one year LEV was administered orally at 150 mg/d, dl-3, q every 2 weeks. In arm B 285 patients were treated in addition to 5-FU+LEV with FA (200 mg/m2), and in arm C (255 pts), ]FNa at 6x106 IU 3x/week, q 1 w, was added to 5-FU+LEV after the 4 w intermission. Chemotherapy doses were adjusted to toxicity. Disease free- and overall survival were determined in addition to relapse rates and patterns. Results: Toxic events > WHO In, mainly leucopenia, diarrhea and nausea, occured 9.6%, 13.0%, 32.6% in arms A, B, and C, respectively. Compatibility-related discontinuance rates (toxicity, patient's decision) were 14.4%, 15.1%, and 20.8% in arms A, B, and C. Relapse rates were 36.7%, 29.5%, and 35.3% in arms A, B, and C. The survival curves differed with an advantage in disease free (p = 0.006) and overall survival of arm B (p = 0.016) vs. arm A. The 5 year overall survival and C. Conclusion: Adjuvant therapy with 5-FU+FA+LEV for 12m is superior to 5-FU+LEV 12m. The IFNa-modulation of 5-FU+LEV in our protocol added ,,Forschungsgruppe II STUDY 22953 F. Bosset, demonstrated that combined radiochemotherapy with 5FU and Mitomycin C significantly increased local control and colostomy-free survival in patients with locally advanced anal carcinoma. (J Clin Oncol 1997; 15:2040). RT consisted of 45 Gy pelvic close over 5 weeks and, after a gap of 6 weeks, a boost of 15-20 Gy. Chemotherapy was given during the first radiotherapy sequence: 5-FU: 750 mg/m 2 dl-d5 and d29-d33 and MMC 15 mg/m 2 dl. There was a considerable rate of tocal relapse and late toxicity. Treatment time was 13 weeks. Purpose: The EORTC Phase II trial 22953 was undertaken to assess the feasability of a more intensiv treatment scheme: i) to reduce the gap from 6 to 2 weeks; ii) to deliver MMC at the beginning of each XRT sequence and 5-FU continuously during both sequences. The protocol scheme: radiotherapy: first sequence: 36 Gy within 4 weeks, 16 days gap, second sequence: 23.4 Gy for 17 days. Chemo- therapy: during radiotherapy, MMC 10 mg/m day1 of each sequence. Patients and tumors: From 11/96 to 5/99 43 patients,were registered. Median age was 60y. ECOG status was 0 for 28 pts and 1 for 16 pts. Staging:T2<4 cm - T4 NO: 22 pts; T3-4 N1-3:17 pts. Median Follow up was 2 years (9-44 m). Toxicity: no grade 4 - 5 toxicity occurred. Diarrhoea grade 3 was observed in 12% during the 1st and in 3% during the 2nd sequences. Grade 3 pedneal skin reaction was present in 14% and 13% respectively. Compliance to treatment was 97%, median gap duration was 18 d (14-25). Treatment results: Complete remission rate estimated 8 w after treatment was 90.6% .At 2 yrs local controll was estimated 79,5% and colostomy free survival 81,2%. Severe toxicity free survival at that time was 84% and overall survival 94%. Comparative analysis of 22861 and 22953 show no difference in patient/ tumour characteristics. The 2 year estimated rates show comparable local control (76% and 79.5%); a trend of improvement for colcstomy free suvival (72% and 81.2%), severe toxicity free survival 84%) and overall survival (85% and 94%). Conclusion: The proposed scheme of the trial 22953 scheme is feasible. In comparison with the randomized EORTC trial 22861 it is promising with less late toxicity. - For the Radiotherapy and Gastrointestinal EORTC Collaborative Groups - Supported by grants from La Ligue Nationale Francaise de Lutte contre le Cancer S 84 Gastrointestinal Cancer includin~l Liver (2) Poster P428 MONITORING OF TUMOR GLUCOSE METABOLISM BY PET IN A PHASE I STUDY EVALUATING HORMONAL THERAPY IN ADVANCED PANCREATIC CANCER F. Eckel, C. Lersch, F. Lippl, E. Schulte-Frohlinde, V. Schusdziarra, H. Helmberger, J. Neverve, M. Decker, R. tomography (PET) provides determination of therapy induced changes in tumor glucose utilization. Experimental data indicates that cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulates pancreatic cancer growth. In the present study we evaluated the use of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET in comparison to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor hormonal therapy using a highly selective, non-peptide CCK receptor antagonist (SR 27897B) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Methods: 19 patients were enrolled into a 28-day course of SR 27897B. Initially four patients received 20 mg of SR 27897B. The following 9 patients received 40 mg and thereafter 6 patients 80 mg. Imaging studies including FDG-PET and MRI were performed at baseline and on day 14 and 28. Results: No significant changes in FDG uptake by the primary tumors were observed. Rate of progression of disease was 11 (61%) of 18 evaluable patients by MRI. Median survival of all patients enrolled was 2.7 months. SR 27897B was fairly well tolerated at all doses tested. The most common side-effects were gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea. Conclusion: SR 27897B, when used alone at the limited doses employed, led neither to an impairment of tumor glucose metabolism nor to a reduction of tumor size in advanced pancreatic cancer. P429 SELECTIVE CYCLOOXYGENASE-2 INHIBITION REDUCES GROWTH OF HU- MAN LIVER TUMOR CELLS M.A. Kern, D. Sahi, M. SchOneweil3, I. Moll, K. Breuhahn, P. Schirmacher, Institut for Pathologie (K61n) Recent studies have shown increased concentrations of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX- 2) in several human malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but it is unknown, whether COX-2 contributes to the malignant growth and whether inhibition of COX-2 function modifies the malignant potential of liver tumors. COX-1 and COX-2 expression was determined in four liver tumor cell lines (Hep 3B, HUH7, HepG2, Sk-hepl) by Northern hybridisation effects of the non-selective inhibitor sulindac and the COX-2 selective inhibitors celecoxib examined by Western immunoblot. COX-1 and COX- 2 expression was in all four tested liver tumor cell lines increased compared to normal human liver. Sulindac sulfide, celecoxib, and meloxicam reduced cell numbers significantly up to 80% in a time- and dose-dependent manner (p<0.05). At equimolar concentrations the effect was more pronounced in all cell lines when COX-2 was selectively blocked. COX-2 inhibition induced apoptosis and decreased the proliferation rate. Apoptosis after treatment with celecoxib was independent of BCL-2 -concentration and dephosphorylation of AKT/PKB and BAD but correlated with rapid cleavage activation of caspases-9, -3, -6 within 15 min. Thus selective inhibition of COX-2 markedly inhibits growth of human liver tumor cells based on the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation; it offers potential for therapy and possibly chemoprevention of hepatocellular carcinoma. P430 MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY IS AN INDEPENDENT PREDICTIVE FACTOR FOR SURVIVAL IN PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER UNDERGOING PALLIATIVE FIRST-LINE CHEMOTHERAPY W. M. BrLickl, T. Brabletz, K. W. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Microsatellite instability (MSI) has recently been reported to be a favourable prognostic indicator in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this work is to investigate the question whether there is also a relationship between mismatch repair deficiency and survival in CRC patients undergoing palliative chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 43 patients with metastatic CRC were prospectively treated with weekly 24-h infusions of high-dose 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid. In all patients, DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded colorectal tumour tissue and from unaffected mucosa. MSt analysis was carried out as recommended by the National Cancer Institute. Additionally, immunohistochemistry was performed with hMLH1 and hMSH2 antibodies. RESULTS: 7 patients (16%) were MSI-H (high instable) and showed a mismatch repair deficiency in either hMLH1 (n=6) or hMSH2 (n=l). These patients had a significantly better median survival (33 months, 95%CI 20-46) than MSS (microsateilite stable) patients (19 months, 95%CI 10-28) (p=0.021 log rank). Furthermore, MSI status was shown to be an independent predictive marker for survival (p=0.04; Cox proportional hazard model) after adjustment for ECOG status and response to chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further support for the hypothesis that MSI- H CRC might have a better prognosis than MSS CRC, even in advanced cases, and that MSI status might serve as a predictive marker. P431 ADENOCARCINOMA DEVELOPING IN CHRONIC ANORECTAL FISTULAS BASED ON disease are a common problem with a prevalence of almost 40% . Occurance of fistula carcinoma is likewise rare, but seems to be elevated over the last decade. Material and methods: In the time of 01/94 to 06/01 we have seen eight patients with Crohn's disease suffering from adenocarcinoma arising in chronic anorectal fistulas. In all patients cancer diagnosis was accidential by histological examination after routine excision of perianal abscess or fistula. The data analysed included risk factors, preoperative examination, surgical procedure, histologic growth pattern, adjuvant radiochemotherapy and postoperative follow up. Results: Features like early onset of disease, duration for more than ten years, high inflammatory activity, female sex (7w/lm), and persistance of anorectal fistulas in patients with active proctitis seem to trigger maligne transformation. Difficulties in clinical examination, overlap-syndroms with Crohn's disease and non-specific radiologic imaging lead to cancer diagnosis in advanced stages with poor prognosis. Two patients showed pT3 carcinoma, in six patients a pT4-situation was found, more than 50% of patients had Iocoregional metastases. Abdominoperineal rectal excision was performed in seven patients. Only one person showed disease-free survival after a follow-up period of four years, six patients died related to metastatic disease or local recurrence with a survival time of median 18 months (range 3-42). Conclusions: Extended perianal wounds after radical surgical resection in combination with delayed wound healing due to Crohn's disease inhibited immediate postoperative adjuvant radiochemotherapy. Early surgical resection of chronic anorectal leasons could reduce both, incidence of fistula carcinoma and perianal wound surface resulting in accelerated wound-healing. P432 IMMUNOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF NEOADJUVANT RADIO-CHEMOTHERAPY FOR ADVANCED RECTAL CANCER M.W. Wichmann, G. Meyer, C. M~Jller, M. a novel treatment option for patients with advanced rectal cancer. Despite promising oncological results no information is available regarding the immunological effects of preoperative administration of radio-chemotherapy in cancer patients. Aim of the present study, therefore, was to evaluate whether or not preoperative radio-chemotherapy for advanced rectal cancer results in significant immunological alterations and influences the perioperative course of immune parameters. Methods: 15 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer underwent preoperative chemoradiation. Control patients with rectal cancer were operated on during the same time period without preoperative therapy. Study patients received preoperative chemoradiation (2 cycles 5-FU, 45 Gy) and underwent surgery 6 weeks later. Blood samples were taken before neoadjuvant therapy, preoperatively and on days 1, 2, 5 after surgery. Cell numbers of lymphocyte subpopulations and NK-cells were determined by flow-cytometry. Circulating TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels were measured with ELISA. Results: Significant differences between study and control patients (p<0.05) were detected regarding circulating IL-6 and TNF-a levels with depression of the pro- inflammatory response to surgical trauma in patients with chemoradiation (data not shown). Similarly, T-lymphocyte-, T-helper-cell- and NK-cell-counts were significantly reduced after preoperative radio-chemotherapy with an even more pronounced depression in these patients after surgery (see figures below). Conclusions: Preoperative chemoradiation for advanced rectal cancer results in a significant pre- and postoperative immune dysfunction as indicated by depression of lymphocyte subpopulations, natural killer cells as well as a significant decrease of pro-inflammatory cytokine release. These findings are of importance since increased morbidity and mortality rates have been reported after preoperative chemoradiation. Additional studies are required to determine whether or not the findings are of oncological relevance and therefore justify preoperative immune stimulatory therapy. [ Prlitherapeutlseh I pr~o~)eratlv Postoperafiv 85 Cancer including Liver (2) P433 PROGNOSTIC VALUE OF CYCLIN B OVEREXPRESSION IN COLORECTAL CANCER K. Lickvers, H. Grabsch, O. Hansen, a key molecule for G2-M-phase transition during the cell cycle, recently has been suggested to have prognostic impact in lung and esophageal cancer. Since in colorectal cancer such a role still is unknown, we therefore evaluated the expression and prognostic value of Cyclin B1 in colorectal cancer. Methods: A series of 342 R0-resected colorectal carcinomas was immunohistochemically investigated using a monoclonal antibody and Cyclin B1 expression was compared with clinicopathological parameters and disease free as well as overall survival. Results: Expression of Cyclin B1 could be detected in all 342 investigated tumors showing strong intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity (1% to 80% of positive tumor cells). In 269 tumors (78.7%), a high Cyclin B1 expression of more than 10% of tumor cells regarded as Cyclin B overexpression could be observed. Concerning an association between Cyclin B1 overexpression and histopathological features, there was no correlation with pT and pN category and histological grade nor with blood or lymphatic vessel invasion and p53 expression. Concerning disease free as well as overall survival, by univariate analysis no prognostic impact could be obtained for Cyclin B1 overexpression. Multivariate analysis revealed the parameters pT and pN category as well as extramural blood vessel invasion and histological grade as independent prognostic parameters for overall survival. For disease free survival, the parameters pT and pN category and tumor Iocalisation could be verified as independent prognostic predictors. Conclusions: According to the present results on 342 R0-resected tumors, overexpression of Cyclin B1 is a frequent event in colorectal carcinomas. However, Cyclin B1 overexpression is not associated with clinicopathological parameters and cannot predict disease free or overall survival in colorectal cancer patients. P434 RESULTS OF A CLINICAL PHASE-II STUDY (G6ttingen) Metastatic liver disease is the commonest cause of death in patients with colorectal cancer. In patients with non-resectable hepatic metastases therapeutic options are limited. This study reports data of a clinical phase-II study performing treatment. Lasertherapy was performed with a Nd:YAG laser in 45 patients (mean age 61.6 years; range 38-79 years) with hepatic metastases of colorectal cancer. Each patient had stopped systemic chemotherapy because of tumor progression before lasertherapy was started. In addition, 38 patients with hepatic spread of other malignant tumors e.g. metastatic pancreas carcinoma or hepatocellular carcinoma were treated by laser-induced thermocoagulation. Ultrasonographic imaging allowed exact placement of the laser probe and estimation of the size of thermocoagulation by a hyperechogenic signal inhancement during laser light emission. In total, 83 patients (45 with colorectal cancer, 38 with non-colorectal cancer) were treated with 191 laser applications. No severe side effects occurred. The 30-day-mortality was zero. Response to laser-induced thermocoagulation was verified by ultrasonography, CT scans and measurement of tumor marker levels. In patients with colorectal cancer, the cumulative survival rate 15 months after initiation of lasertherapy was 0.665. Thirty of forty-five treated patients with colorectal cancer are still alive (mean time of observation: 9.8 months, range: 2-15 months). The present study shows that laser-induced thermocoagulation can be performed safely under ultrasonographic guidance even in elderly patients without occurrence of severe treatment-related side effects and that it could be a useful therapeutic option in palliative treatment of hepatic metastasized colorectal cancer. P435 ANALYSIS OF 0D97 EXPRESSION AND ITS ISOFORMS IN NORMAL GASTRIC TISSUE, GASTRIC ULCER AND GASTRIC CARCINOMA S. Leder, C. Boltze, O. Gimm, A. Bernstein, R. for Humangenetik (Halle/Saale, Magdeburg) Introduction Gastric carcinoma is the fourth most frequent carcinoma. Its incidence shows great geographical differences. In Germany the mortality rate is 30 in 100.000 male inhabitants. CD97 is a dimeric glycoprotein belonging to the secretin receptor superfamily. It is characterized by an extended extracellular region (Mr 75-85) with at least five epidermal growth factor (EGF)-Iike domains at the N-terminal region. The isoforms of CD97 resulting in alternative splicing possess either three (578bp), four (710bp) or five (857bp) EGF domains. CD97 is abundantly expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin and strongly expressed in undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas. The aim of the present investigation was to analyze the expression of CD97 and its iseforms in human gastric adenocarcinoma tissues. Materials and Methods Total RNA was isolated from 44 gastric adenocarcinomas (category ranging from T1 to T4), 23 normal gastric tissues as well as 6 gastric ulcers. We used RT-PCR for mRNA analysis. Additionally, frozen sections of some sample tissues were prepared for immunohistochemical staining. Results CD97 mRNA was detected in 91% of normal gastric tissue, in 89% of gastric carcinomas but only in 67% of gastric ulcers. The 578bp isoform was highly expressed (98-100%) in all gastric tissues investigated. In contrast, the 710bp isoform was highly expressed (98-100%) in normal gastric tissue and gastric carcinoma but found in only 83% of gastric ulcers. The 857bp isoform was found in 100% of gastric ulcers, Jn 91% of normal gastric tissue and in 82% of gastric carcinoma. Investigation regarding CD97 expression on the protein level using immunohistochemistry is still ongoing but our preliminary results show that CD97 protein is also detectable in gastric carcinoma tissues. The biological meaning of different expression levels of the various isoforms remains to be elucidated.

Sendler, K. Ott, U. Fink, J. R. Siewert, Chirurgische Klinik der TU M0nchen (MOnchen) The analysis of first sites of failure is essential to evaluate success and deficiencies of multimodal therapy in solid tumours. In a prospective phase II trial, 42 patients (pts.) with locally advanced gastric cancer (uT3/4, N+, M0) were treated leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil). Staging endosonography, an abdominal CT scan and a diagnostic laparoscepy to exclude peritoneal dissemination (PC). Following neoadjuvant CTx a total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenctomy was performed in all pts, 32 pts. were completely resected (76%). The pattern of recurrence of these patients were analysed. The median follow-up time was 58 months (38 - 80). Follow-up was done every 3 months during the first two years after resection, thereafter every 6 months. At every visit an abdominal CT-scan and an endoscopy were performed. The median survival time of the complete resected pts. was 32 month (8 - 80 month) after incomplete resection (R1,2) it was 7.5 month (6 - 73). Out of the 32 complete resected pts. 12 pts are alive without evidence of disease, 20 pts. developed recurrences. Out of these 20 pts., 3 pts. are alive with known recurrences, 17 pts. died on metastatic gastric cancer. The median time to recurrence was 19 months (3 - 74). The Iocalisation of the recurrences differs according to the Laur6n classification of the turnouts. In 7 pts. with intestinal tumours, 4 pts. developed lymph nodes failure, 2 pts. distant failure and one pts. developed PC. 9 out of 13 pts. with non- intestinal turnouts developed PC. This was combined with lymph node failure in 2 pts., with Iocoregional recurrence in 2 pts. and with distant failure also in 2 pts.. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy and consecutive total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy in locally advanced gastric cancer the development of Iocoregional and distant failure is a relatively rare event. This might be due to the effect of the chemotherapy on occult micro metastases and/ or the effect of the extended D2 lymphadenectomy. A main problem is the development of peritoneal dissemination in patients with non-intestinal tumours during follow-up. This raises the question, whether the development of PC in this tumours can be influenced by systemic neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. Future innovative trials should investigate additional intraperitoneal therapies in non-intestinal turnouts to ameliorate the prognosis of these patients. P437 RETROSPECTIVE VALIDATION OF PROGNOSTIC PARAMETERS IN 281 CON- SECUTIVE PATIENTS WITH HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA C. Herold, T. Reck, P. Fischler, T. Schneider, only follow up data regarding patients with hepatoceilular carcinoma (HCC) in Western Europe. Therefore, we evaluated the data of all patients with HCC advised to our hospital between 1988 and 1999. Methods: The parameters of 281 consecutive patients (236 m, 45 f, age: 66 _+ 11years) Pugh Score) as well as diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. We used international accepted criterias to determine the optimal treatment strategy for each patient. Survival time was correlated to stage and therapy. Results: In all patients cirrhosis was diagnosed. Serology for hepatitisB and C was positive in 80 patients. Etiology was alcoholic in 151 patients, hemochromatosis in six, a primary biliary cirrhosis in 3 and a cryptogenic cirrhosis in 21. Liver resection was performed in 72 patients and transplantion in 28 patients, while 31 patients received transarteriell chemoembolization and 14 percutaneous alcohol injection. 136 patients remained untreated. The Okuda - as well as the Child- Pugh classification reliably predicted a decrease of mean survival time with advanced tumor stages, whereas prognostic power of the UICC classification was poor. Conclusion: 1) In this large study HCC developed exclusevilyin a pre- existing cirrhosis. 2) Mean survival time correlated well with Child- Pugh Score, the S 86 Gastrointestinal Cancer including Liver (2) Okuda- classification and therapy (or no therapy). 3) The Okuda classification, which is easy to perform and based on clinical parameters, is superior to UICC- classification also in a western cohort. n : 281 su~ival suwival su~ival su~ival (months) (mpnth\u00a7) (months) ChJld-Pugh A 21 \u00b1 2 Okuda I 1 Okuda III n = 93 n -14- UICC IVb 6 INDUCES APOPTOSIS AND CELLS IN VITRO M. Ocker, C. Herold, M. Ganslmayer, H. carcinomas are among the most common malignancies world- wide. Chemotherapy of advanced stages is of limited success, it was shown that the fluoroquinolone Ciprofloxacin (CIP) inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in human bladder cancer cells (Aranha et al., Clin Cancer Res 6:891-900;2000). We investigated the effect of ClP on proliferation and apoptosis of colorectal (CC) and hepatocellular (HCC) carcinoma cells in vitro. Methods: The human CC cell line SW-403 was cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), CC-531 cells (CC) were maintained FCS. Human hepatoma cells HepG2 (DMEM, 10% FCS) served as controls. Cells were incubated with 100, 200 or 500 I~g/ml CIP for 18, 24 or 48 h. Cell proliferation was assessed by BrdU-incorporation ELISA and cell counting. Apoptosis was determined flow-cytometrically after propidium-iodide staining of cells. Mitochondrial by after JC-1 staining. Results: Apoptosis and proliferation of HepG2 were not changed by CIP, while CC-531 and SW-4O3 showed a time- and dose-dependent response. FACS analysis showed a cell cycle arrest at the S/G2-transition point in CC-cells. The breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential, an early event in the induction of apoptosis, was shown by JC-1 staining of CC-cells. leads to an early up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bax and to the activation of Caspases 3, 8 and 9 in CC-531 and SW-403 but not HepG2 cells. Conclusion: and dose-dependent antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect on CC cells but not on differentiated HCC cells. 2) CIP induces mitochondrial damages which lead to an activation of the caspase cascade and the Bax/Bcl-2 pathway of apoptosis. 3) The contribution of CIP to the chemotherapy of CC will be PROSPECTIVE MULTICENTER PHASE IV STUDY M. Moehler, T. Hoffmann, C. Zanke, H. Hohl, R Ehecheid, E Schwindt, K. Kurfess, P.R. Galle, M. (Mainz, Bad Ems, Simmern, Neuwied, Andernach, Bad Soden) The aim of our study was to analyze response rates and toxicity of the combination of CPT11 (125mg/m2), as first- line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer patients (pts) in outpatient clinics. After a recent report of unexpectedly high early mortality with this regimen in U.S. trials (2.5-3.5%; due to gastrointestinal toxicity or vascular events; JCO 2001,19:3801), the study was amended to replace 'Saltz\" protocol by the FOLFIRI protocol (Tournigand, Proc ASCO 2001, #494). In our study, pts were specifically informed about the possibility of severe delayed diarrhea and neutropenia, and about immediate countermeasures with Ioperamide, prophylactic antibiotics, need for hospitalization and parenteral rehydration in case of refractory diarrhea (>48 hours). Appropriate dose reductions were obligate already during the first cycle in case of toxicity >grade 2. Therapy was only applied to diarrhea-free patients. Patients and Methods: 47 metastatic colorectal cancer pts (a64, 42-73 y) with unresectability were treated with the 'Sa]tz\" protocol. 339 weekly doses were given (delays 26 times for 1 week). So far, 31 and 28/31 pts were evaluable for toxicity and response, respectively. Results: obstruction due to local recurrence, 1 unexplained vertigo, 1 renal failure due to urether obstruction. 1 early unexplained death occurred 12 days after start of treatment in apt with thrombosis of iliacal veins without diarrhea. 10/28 (36%) pts had objective responses (2 CR; 8 PR), 9/26 (32%) no change. Resectability of metastases was achieved in 3 pts (1 pathologically CR). Median progressionfree and overall survivals were not yet reached. Conclusions: The efficacy of CPT11/FA/Bolus-5FU ('Saltz') was confirmed. Tumor control (CR+PR+SD) was achieved in 70%, concordant with published data. Cases of severe gastrointestinal toxicity and thromboembolic events were observed as reported, but have not been fatal. Up-dated results will be presented at the meeting. P440 PALLIATIVE THERAPY FOR ADVANCED BILIARY cholangiocarcinomas (CCC) no standard chemotherapy regimens have been established. A few studies demonstrated activity of 5-FU and cisplatin chemotherapy regimens. New chemotherapy regimens are requested. The combination of oxaliplatin, high-dose (HD) 5-FU and LV shows activity in advanced adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract. This phase II study has been performed to determine the efficacy and toxicity of oxaliplatin and 5-FU/LV regimen in GBC and CCC. Patients and methods: 17 patients (11 M, 6 F) were included in this phase II study. Median age was 62 years (range 39-74). Inclusion criteria were histologic proven adenocercinoma of the gallbladder or cholangiocarcinoma, measurable disease, age < 75 years, ECOG PB < 2. Most frequent metastatic sites were: liver (100%), lymph nodes (57%), lung, peritoneum and adrenal glands (14%). 6 patients had surgery prior to chemotherapy. A total number of 152 cycles (median number of cycles per patient: 9; range 2-18) of combined 5-FU + LV (1500-2000 mg/m 2 and 500 mg/ m 2, d 1 + 2) was administered biweekly for advanced GBC (9 patients), intrahepatic (6 patients) and extrahepatic (2 patients) cholangiocarcinomas. Patients were assessed for response every 5 cycles. Results: Partial remission was seen in 3 patients (19%), stable disease in 6 patients (38%) and progression of disease in 7 patients (44%). In these patients the time to tumor progression was 4.1 months and median overall survival 9.5 months. The most common toxicity was grade 1-2 peripheral sensory neuropathy in 34 of 152 cycles (22%). Grade 3 toxicities occured in 11% of 152 cycles (thrombocytopenia, paraesthesia, decreased taste, infection/fever, alopecia and peripheral sensory neuropathia). Only 1 patient showed a grade 4 thrombocytopenia in one cycle. Conclusion: This phase II study confirms that an outpatient regimen of combined oxaliplatin and 5-FU/LV for advanced biliary tract carcinoma is well tolerated. Our preliminary data demonstrate a disease control in 57% of patients. P441 SOMATOSTATIN - (SS=) BINDING SITES IN PATIENTS WITH HUMAN GASTROINTESTINAL (GI-)ADENOCARCINOMA: LESS EXPRESSION IN DEDIFFERENTIATED CARCINOMAS Keiditsch, C. Lersch, TU MLinchen (M0nchen) SS plays an important role in the treatment of neuroendocrine GI-tumors. Presently the expression of SS-binding sites should be monitored on human GI-tumors for the indication of treatment with SS-agonists or -antagonists. Biopsies from patients with adenocarcinomas (n=25) of the human gastrointestinal tract - esophagus (n=5), stomach (n=10), colon and rectum (n=10) - and from normal gastric mucosa (n=3) were monitored for the expression of SS-binding sites. Half of the frozen sections from the biopsies were incubated with Fluo-SomatostatinR (Advanced Bioconcept) only and half additionally preincubated with native somatostatin. Fluorescence intensity was lower in 11 from 30 sections preincubated with native somatostatin as compared to those incubated with Fluo-Somatostatin only, thus indicating specific binding sites for somatostatin. The grade of tumor differentiation and the corresponding expression of SS- binding sites are shown in the figure. Fig. 1: Pathohistological Grading and expression of binding sites for somatostatin in human gastrintestinal tissue Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS analysis program of the samples from normal mucosa (n=3), and from patients with G2 (n=9) and of 0,254 (spearman) with p=0,101. This result is not statistically significant but shows a tendency towards a correlation between the expression of somatostatin binding sites and the differentiation of S 87 Gastrointestinal Cancer including Liver G2, 2x G3). But 5 of the 10 samples from patients with low differentiated gastric adenooarcinomae showed somatostatin binding sites, perhaps due to a high frequency of SS - binding sites in the normal gastric mucosa. For the treatment of solid GI-tumors with SS-agoniste or -antagonists it is noteworthy that SS-binding sites are perhaps higher expressed in high differentiated Gl-tumors. percent i 3O tissue P442 THE TUMOR SUPPRESSOR SMAD4 INDUCES DIFFERENTIATION OF HUMAN COLON CANCER CELLS THROUGH REGULATION OF CADHERIN/CATENIN DEPENDENT CELL-CELL-ADHESION A. Reinacher-Schick, N. Functional inactivation of the tumor suppressor Smad4 occurs in one third of metastatic colorectal cancers. The cellular mechanisms underlying its tumor suppressor activity, however, are not yet understood. Smad4 is a key intracellular transmitter of TGF-8 signals but there is recent evidence that Smad4 may suppress cancer development independent of TGF-13 gr'owth inhibitory properties. We sought to investigate mechanisms of Smad4 tumor suppression in human colon carcinoma cells in an unbiased approach. Methods: Smad4 was stably reexpressed in TGF-8 resistant SW480 human colon cancer cells. The cellular phenotype was studied by light and by confocal microscopy after immunostaining for cell adhesion molecules (cadherin, catenin) and differentiation markers (ZO-1, villin). Gene expression was analyzed by Northern and Western blotting. Functional activity of adhesion molecules was studied in aggregation assays. Activity of the border enzyme Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) was tested biochemically. Subcutaneous by immunohistochemistry. Results: Stable reconstitution of Smad4 in SW480 cells caused a robust change in cell morphology to an epitheloid, differentiated phenotype in vitro. Smad4 positive clones displayed transcriptional upregulation of functional cadherins and formed tight cell-cell contacts. The cadherin/catenin cell adhesion complex properly localized to the lateral plasma membrane as shown by immunofluorescence and after biochemical fractionation. Smad4 also caused recruitment of the tight junction protein ZO-1 to the apicolateral membrane, upregulated apical villin and elevated the activity of the ALP all suggesting an enterocyte-like differentiation caused by Smad4. Importantly, Smad4 induced differentiation was retained in vivo in nude mouse tumors. Smad4 negative SW480 cells formed undifferentiated solid tumors when injected subcutaneously. In contrast, tumors derived from Smad4 reexpressing cells were transient, displayed a growth pattern reminiscent of moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas with tubular structures strongly staining for E-cadherin. Conclusion: Here we present a novel mechanism of Smad4 tumor suppression in human colon carcinoma cells which involves induction of differentiation in vitro and in rive. Cellular differentiation may be caused by transcriptional upregulation of cadherin adherens junction molecules associated with the establishment of mature cell-cell adhesion. P443 CHEMOTHERAPY FOR PATIENTS OVER 75 YEARS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER (CRC) - A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS M. Schroeder, U. Sch~fer, C. Aul, M. Schroeder, St. Johannes Hospital, St. Vincenz Hospital (Duisburg) Adjuvant and palliative 5-FU-based chemotherapy (CTX) for patients (pts) with CRC is well established, but age over 65 years (yrs) often disqualifies from inclusion in clinical studies. Balducci considers an age limit of 75 yrs for the application of CTX. Due to the significant incidence of CRC in the 7th and 8th decades of life (two thirds of all female and more than 50 per cent of male pts with CRC are over 70 yrs at diagnosis), there is often only an individual clinical treatment approach. We report the follow-up of 30 pts > 75 yrs who were treated in an adjuvant or palliative setting at our institution over the last 3 yrs. Patient characteristics: n = 30 (13 female, 17 male). Diagnoses: colon cancer 17, sigmoid cancer 3, rectosigmoid cancer 3, rectum cancer 7. Group I (adjuvant treatment): n = 10, Mayo protocol in all 10 pts, plus radiotherapy in 3 pts. Group II (palliative treatment): n = 20, different treatment schedules (Mayo, de Gramont +/- oxaliplatin +/- irinotecan). Results: Group t lots alive disease free (median 18+ months), 2/10 pts died, 1/10 pt alive with metastatic disease controlled by CTX. Group II (n = 20): 6/20 pts died of their malignancy, no toxic death. 14/20 pts alive (median 15+ months) under CTX. Toxicity: 2/30 pts leucocytopenia 3 \u00b0 and thrombocytopenia 3 \u00b0, but no unusual GIT-toxicity. 1 pt (81 yrs) declined further CTX due to unacceptable toxicity. 2/6 pts acquired polyneuropathy 3 \u00b0 following 6 cycles of oxaliplatin. Conclusion: Our retrospective analysis of 30 pts aged 75 yrs and over suggests that CTX is feasible with comparable benefit as to that achieved in younger pts without increased toxicity or mortality. A geriatric assessment of all pts in this age group is essential for the individual therapeutic approach. P444 DETECTION OF CYTOKERATIN IN PERIPHERAL BLOOD OF PATIENTS WITH GASTROINTESTINAL CANCER IS INDEPENDENT FROM STAGE OF DISEASE B. Illert, C. Otto, W. Breithaupt, M. Koospal, of cytokeratin (CK) as a part of epithelial cells in peripheral blood is discussed as indication for minimal residual disease in tumor patients. Cytokeratin can be detected either with immunochemistry (IC) or with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A correlation of detection of cytokeratin in blood and the tumor stage in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer was performed. Methods: In a prospective study venous blood was taken preoperatively from 158 patients between 4/1999 and 8/2001. Stage of disease and Iocalisation of tumors had non- malignant disease of different origin. A protocol for a nested reverse transcriptase- PCR for detection of CK-20 was performed. Results: From 140 patients with GI cancer 75 (=53,6%) were positive for CK in peripheral blood, whereas only 3/18 (= 16,6%) with non-malignant disease were positive. According to the TNM classification no significant correlation was found for tumor stage technique of PCR is useful for detection of epithelial cells in peripheral blood. Detection of these cells is not correlated to the stage of cancer. But it is significant higher in cancer patients than in non-malignant disease. Monitoring cytokeratin in peripheral blood may be a suitable method for follow-up of tumor patients and offers a tool for estimation of the effectiveness of anti- tumor therapies. P445 THE ROLE OF NY-ESO 1 FOR HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA T.E Greten, A. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a very high incidence of occurrence worldwide. Current therapeutic approaches include surgical resection of the primary tumor or liver transplantation. In advanced stages, however, only local palliative therapy has shown to be effective. We are investigating possible immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of primary HCC, which are currently being tested mainly for malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. NY-ESO 1 is a tumor- associated antigen, which has been originally identified from a patient with esophageal cancer. Recent work has shown that NY-ESO 1 is expressed in a variety of tumor types. We are examining the possible role of NY-ESO 1 in HCC to investigate immunotherapeutical approaches for patients with HCC. We have isolated RNA from 15 different tissue samples from patients with HCC. NY-ESO 1 RNA expression was detected by RT-PCR using two different primer pairs. We also analyzed serum samples from 24 patients with HCC for the presence of NY- ESO specific antibodies by Western Blotting. All patients had liver cirrhosis (due to viral hepatitis, alcohol consumption and hemochromatosis) and HCCs were confirmed by pathological analysis of the primary tumor. 2/15 analyzed tumor samples expressed NY-ESO 1 mRNA. 3/24 patients were positive for antibody against NY-ESO 1. We are in the process of analyzing NY-ESO 1 specific T cell responses from these patients Our preliminary data suggests that patients with NY-ESO 1 positive HCC can develop a NY-ESO specific immune response without vaccination. However, the expression of NY-ESO 1 mRNA in about 10 % of the analyzed samples was much lower as expected and also lower as described for Asian patients. Therefore, NY-ESO 1 specific immunotherapy might be beneficial for a limited number of patients with HCC. P446 THE INTERNET AS A SOURCE OF MEDICAL INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER G. Witucki, To evaluate the Intemet as a source of medical information for patients with colorectal cancer. The present survey examines the use and the influence of the Intemet and other mass media on tumor patients. Methods: From 07.02.2001 to 23.11.2001, 127 patients with colorectal cancer S 88 Gastrointestinal Cancer including Liver (2) / Head and Neck Cancer which were referred to the Dept. of Radiotherapy were analyzed using a 36-item questionnaire developed in Freiburg. Results: Mean age of all patients (n=127): 65 years (range: 33 - 84 years). Level of education (n=114): secondary school 74%(n=84), A-level or college or the Internet (n=68): fear of high 15%(n=10), other reasons: 57%(n=39). Making use of other information sources than the doctor treating the patient (n=100): 46%(n=46). If the layman-system was used as an information source they used as an information source (n=34): Intemet: of the medium Internet as a source of information for tumor patients with colorectal cancer in Freiburg is currently still low but likely to increase. The percentage of internetuser in the ,,normal population\" over 50 years is only about 16%. Only 6% of our patients have visited the homepage of the department of radiotherapy at the University Clinic of FreJburg (http:// www.ukl.uni-freiburg.de/rad/strahlen/homede.html or short cut: http://go.to/ radiotherapy). The demographic structure and a further spread of Internet-access will lead to a gain of popularity of the Internet among colorectal cancer patients. P447 PROGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE OF TELOMERE LENGTH AND EXPRES- SION IN PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CARCINOMA R. Gertler, Stricker, replicative telomere losses by telomerase activation is an important step in carcinogenesis. Quantification of the catalytic telomerase subunit hTERT (human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase) is a new indirect measure for telomerase. Materials and Methods: Telomere length and hTERT expression in cancer tissue and adjacent normal mucosa of 57 patients with completely resected colorectal carcinoma (UICC stage I-IV, R0) were determined for correlation with histopathological parameters and survival. Telomere lengths were measured using Southern Blot. hTERT-encoding mRNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Results: Telomere length normal mucosa (r=0.54; p<0.001) and cancer tissue (r=0.52; p<0.0Ol). Only in normal mucosa did telomere length and hTERT expression decrease with ageing. Cancer tissue had significantly shorter telomeres (p<0.001) and significantly lower hTERT expression levels (p<0.g01) than corresponding normal mucosa. UICC stage I tumors (n=16) showed significantly stage II-IV tumors (p<0.002). Telomere length hTERT were significantly correlated with overall survival (p<0.002 and p<0.02, respectively) and proved to be independent prognostic factors. Conclusions: Telomere length and hTERT expression play an important role in ageing and carcinogenesis. Both parameters were identified as independent prognostic factors in patients with colorectal carcinoma. Publication only P'448 SUBMUCOSAL TUMOURS OF THE UPPER GI-SYSTEM: IS A DIAGNOSTICAL/ NECESSARY? of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) is still a field of intensive investigation. Since 1990 we performed exact clinical examination of GISTs of the stomach by which it was treated in ten years in this hospital, we report. Patients and method: This is a retrospective study of 18 patients with GIST that were treated in our hospital from 1990 to 1999. The invented parameters were diagnosis especially endosonography, surgical treatment, pathological diagnosis, TNM classification, and the prognosis. Results: 9 males and 9females with a mean age of 61 years (34- 83). In most of the cases the symptoms were unspecific. 13 patients suffered from nausea, 3 patients had stomach pain, and GI-bleeding was present in 2 patients. The diagnosis was achieved by endscopy and endsonography, a biopsy was taken in 2 cases. One of them showed a PAPII and other a PAPlil lesion. Liver metastasis was found in 2 patients before the operation. 8 patients received a total gastrectomy with splenectomy, 5 patients a distal gastrectomy, a gastric fundectomy was performed in 2 patients and 3 patients were treated by local resection. The 2 patients showing liver metastasis received a liver excision. The postoperative pathological diagnosis revealed in all of these cases GISTs. The lymph node metastasis was found to one patient. The average of tumor size was 10.3cm. 5 patients were T1, 13 patients showed T2. 10 patients were G1, 4 patients showed G2, and 4 patients were G3. R0 was performed in 17patients, and 1 patient was received R1. In 2 cases metastasis was found after operation, one of them showed peritonitic carcinomatosis. The death due to GIST,\" was showed with four cases , and the mean survival term was 52 months(range 4- 98, except for the other cause death). Discussion: Our data suggests that in absence of criteria for malignancy the resection of submucosal tumors is not indicated. GISTs causes metastasis only in few cases while metastasis of distant lymph node is very seldom. We perform close controls in these patients, in suspicious cases or if complications occur we performed a resection. P'449 URETERAL RECURRENCE OF A SIGMOID COLON CARCINOMA a rare site of recurrence of a sigmoid colon carcinoma that posed various diagnostic pitfalls and therapeutic problems. Case description: A 67 year old man was admitted because of recurrent fever for 4 weeks. 34 months before, an adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon (pT3, pN0, cM0, G2) had been resected in another hospital without subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy. Total colonoscopy and ultrasound in this hospital 23 months later had not yielded any sign of a recurrence. On routine ultrasound, a cystic transformation and possible turnout was now seen in the left kidney. The left ureter was dilated into the pelvis. No lymphadenopathy or metastases were seen. CT scan confirmed this finding, again no retroperitoneal turnout was identified. Renal artery angiography reported a central tumour within the left kidney with delayed contrast uptake. Turnout markers (Ca19-9, CEA) were normal. An urinary tract infection with enterococcus was treated with levofloxacin. Retrograde confirmed a stenosing the distal ureter. On urine cytology from both the renal pelvis and the bladder, tumour cells compatible with a clear cell renal carcinoma were seen. Median laparotomy was performed for suspected urothelial carcinoma. No metastases were detected within the peritonea] cavity or the liver. The left kidney was found grossly enlarged and was resected. The dilated ureter was surrounded by very hard tumour tissue extending into the paravertebral muscles and the colonic mesentery which could not be completely removed. Pathology reported a medium grade (G2) adenocarcinoma of the left ureter and periureteral tissue, compatible with recurrence of a sigmoid colon carcinoma. There was no tumour within the left kidney. The patient recovered well from the operation. He is being regularly watched and will be proposed palliative chemotherapy on detection of tumour progression. Discussion: Few reports on metastases of non-urological tumours to the ureter are found in the literature. As for colon carcinomas, there are very few reports on this site of metastasis. In this patient, a local recurrence due to an incomplete resection of the primary tumour must be considered more probable than a haematogenous or lymphogenic metastasis. However, laboratory, imaging, and preoperative pathological studies had not been able to distinguish primary urothelial carcinoma from a colon carcinoma metastasis. Head and Neck Cancer 0450 DIFFERENCES IN MHC-CLASS I SURFACE EXPRESSION IN HUMAN SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA CELL LINES OF THE HEAD AND NECK REGION R. Mandic, J.A. are elementary constituents of the cell mediated immune defense and are expressed, contrary to MHC-II, by virtually all nucleated cells. Cancer cells or cells infected by a virus utilize MHC-I for antigen presentation at the cell's surface, labeling these cells as ,,foreign\", which Ieads to recognition and lysis by cytotoxic CD8+ T- lymphocytes. A sufficient immuneresponse therefore should also depend on the expression level of MHC-I. In this study we investigated the MHC-I expression levels in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck region (HNSCC). Materials and by T.E. Carey (University of Michi- gan, MI, USA) and R. Gr6nman (University of Turku, Finland) and were derived from different HNSCC. The 745 HNSCC cell line was derived from an oropharynx carcinoma and the control keratinocyte cell line was generated from tonsil tissue. FACS analysis: Cells were washed in PBS and removed from the tissue dish with a cell scraper. Subsequently, the cells were resuspended in PBS and passed through a 50pm filter. The cells then were centrifuged for 10 min at 2000g and the pellet was resuspended in 200 pl 3%BSA/PBS. 10 pl of the respective anti MHC- I antibody was added and the cells were incubated for 1 hour on ice before performing FACS analysis. Results: A significantly different MHC-I surface expression level between the HNSCC cell lines was visible after staining with the anti MHC-I ABC antibody, which recognizes all three MHC-I subtypes. Interestingly, more than one fluorescent peak was visible in several of the HNSCC cell lines, pointing to differences in the expression level of the MHC-] subtypes. Subsequent investigations, utilizing S 89 Head and Neck Cancer MHC-I subtype-specific antibodies could verify these observations. Surface MHC-I of the HNSCC cell lines was found to be well expressed or even higher than in the control keratinocytes, except for the UT16a cell line, which was derived from a low differentiated HNSCC tumor (G3), that exhibited low MHC-I surface levels. Conclusion: Surface MHC-I is not necessarily downregulated in HNSCC cell lines as previously reported for HNSCC tissues [Grandis et al., Clin Cancer Res 2000 (7):2794-2802.]. Further investigations need to consider the possible prognostic and functional role of MHC-I and its subtypes in more detail. 0451 COMBINED MODALITY TREATMENT OF SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMAS (SCC) OF ORAL CAVITY AND THE OROPHARYNX INCLUDING NEOADJUVANT INTRAARTERIAL CISPLATIN AND RADICAL SURGERY FOLLOWED BY CONCURRENT RADIATION AND CHEMOTHERAPY WITH WEEKLY DOCETAXEL A.F. Kov~.cs, S. Mose, B. Turowski, H.B. B(bttcher, K. Bitter, Universit~.tsklinik (Frankfurt am Main) Overall survival of patients suffering from oral cancer is very poor in unseiected populations. For example, the survival of 169 stage I patients studied by the German-Swiss-Austrian Cooperative Group on Maxillofacial Tumors (DOSAK) in 1999 was only 67%, and results were even worse when surgery was the only treatment modality. In an attempt to improve survival, 68 patients with stage I to IV SCC of the oral cavity and the oropharynx were enrolled to a trial of combined modality treatment consisting of one or two cycles of neoadjuvant intraarterial high-pressure perfusion of cisplatin 150 mg/m intravenous infusion of sodium thiosulfate 9 g/m a followed by radical surgery and adjuvant concurrent radiation (51.3 Gy delivered to the primary tumor and regional nodes over 5 weeks in 27 fractions, with an additional boost of 20 Gy in case of R1 resection) and chemotherapy with weekly doses of 25 mg/m 2 docetaxel. A PEG tube was obligatory. The patients (17 females and 51 males) had a mean age of 57 years (range, 38-77). ECOG performance status was 0, 1, and 2 in 55, 12 and 1 patient, respectively. The sites of primary tumor were the oral cavity in 62 (91%), and the oropharynx and tonsils in 6 (9%) patients. Ten patients (15%) had stage l, 12 patients (18%) stage II, 9 patients (13%) stage III, and 37 patients (54%) stage IV disease. Clinical response to neoadjuvant cisplatin included 11 (17%) CR, 24 (35%) PR, 32 (47%) SD, and 1 (1%) PD. Complete pathologic response was seen in 6 patients (9%). Acute CTC grade Ill-IV toxicities docetaxel cycles was 5. At a median follow-up of 24 months for survivors (minimum 5 months), 59 patients (87%) were al]~/e, and 56 (82%) were relapse-free. Of 8 relapsed patients, 4 had a local recurrence, 3 had lymph node metastasis, and 1 patient distant metastasis. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall and relapse-free survival were 95% and 90% at 1 year, 85% and 79% at 2 years, and 77% and 74% at 3 years, respectively. These results are clearly superior to those of a historical group of patients with similar disease characteristics provided by the D(~SAK. In conclusion, this approach is reasonably well-tolerated and is associated with improved survival, primarily in patients with stage I to III SCC of the oral cavity and the oropharynx. 0452 HYPERFRACTIONATED ACCELERATED RADIO\u00b1CHEMOTHERAPY FOR ADVANCED HEAD&NECK CANCER - NONE RANDOMIZED PATIENTS EQUALLY WELL? T. Hehr, J. proven superiority of hyperfractionated accelerated radiochemotherapy to 70.6 Gy with concurrent MMC/5-FU to hyperfractionated accelerated irradiation to 77.6 Gy alone at equivalent levels of acute and late radiation morbidity in locally advanced head and neck cancer (Budach V. European Journal of Cancer Vol 37, Suppl. 6, October 2001, page 10). We now analyzed wether patient selection for randomization or non- randomization, respectively, had an influence on Ioco-regional tumour control, disease specific survival and overall survival. Methods: Between 2/1996-10/2000 at T0bingen University 42 randomized patients plus 45 none-randomized patients with stage Ill/IV head&neck cancer were treated according to this protocol. Reasons for non-randomization in 29 patients were myocardial infarction, age >70 years, laryngeal cancer, or 2nd primary. 12 patients were treated after the end of patient accrural, 3 patients refused randomization, 1 patient was treated due to the physician's decision. Results: After a median follow up of 26 months, 2 years overall survival (OS) was 49%, disease specific survival (DSS) 64% and Ioco-regional tumor control (LRC) 60%, respectively. OS after accelerated hyperfractionated radiochemotherapy (RCT) compared to accelerated hyperfractionated irradiation alone (RT) randomized patients was 57% (p=0,1), and DSS RCT compared RT 63% RCT RT in randomized patients was 53% and compared to 57% in cT2-4 cN1-3 tumors. Subgroup analysis of patients with involved nodes revealed a 2-year Ioco-regional tumor control of: 74% after complete remission of primary tumor and neck disease, 53% after complete remission of primary tumor and partial remission of neck disease. In patients with additional node picking Ioco-regional tumor control was 62%. Conclusions: Hyperfractionated accelerated radiochemotherapy was equally effective in randomized and non-randomized patients indicating that individual patient selection for radiochemotherapy by physician's decision wi[I be likely to translate into survival benefit compared to hyperfractionated treatment without concurrent chemotherapy. 0453 IMMUNOSELECTION OF HEAD AND NECK CANCER VARIANTS - IMPLICA- FOR IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES Mfiurer, Pittsburgh Cancer USA) Immunization with wild type (wt) p53 epitopes represents a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with p53 accumulating tumors. However, our recent studies suggest that only patients whose tumors cannot present the wt p53264-272 epitope are capable of generating T cells specific for this epitope in vitro (J.Immunol.165:5938-44, 2000). The possibility exists that p53264-272 specific T cells eliminate p53 overexpressing tumor cells, leading to an outgrowth of epitope- loss tumor variants. In the present study, blood of 30 HLA-A2.1+ head and neck cancer patients and 30 healthy individuals was evaluated for frequencies and characteristics of p53264-272 specific T cells by multicolor flow cytometry, using tetramer technology. Patients had significantly higher proportions of p53264-272 specific CD8+ T cells in the circulation relative to normal donors. Moreover, patients with p53 wt tumors showed significantly higher frequencies of wt p53264- 272 specific T cells (memory phenotype) as compared to patients with tumors accumulating p53 (na(ve phenotype). This reciprocal relationship suggests that in the presence of wt p53264-272 specific T cells epitope-loss tumor variants are selected in vivo. In order to induce an immune response in those individuals whose tumors accumulate p53 but whose T cells were non-responsive to in vitro stimulation with the parental p53264-272 peptide, we tested several peptide variants. Two variants were found to be capable of inducing T cells from \"non- responsive\" patients that subsequently recognized the parental peptide. The use of variant peptides of the wt p53264-272 epitope represents a promising approach for overcoming the non-responsiveness of certain cancer patients to self epitopes, thereby enhancing the potential of p53 based cancer vaccines for immune- therapy. 0454 NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENCE: RESULTS OF A MULTICENTER STUDY (NPC-91-GPOH) R. Mertens, cisplatin and fluorouracil (5FU) chemotherapy and of adjuvant IFN-8-therapy in advanced stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children and adolescents and the impact on event free survival, especially in ,,high risk\" patients. Patients and Method: From 1993 - 2001 59 study patients (58 ,, high risk\" patients and one ,,low risk ,,patient, median age 12 years, range 8 - 23) were treated at 27 hospitals in the co-operative GPOH-study NPC-91. The stage il patient received irradiation as initial therapy. 57 patients received three courses of preradiation chemotherapy (methotrexat 120 mg/m2, day 1, cisplatin 100 mg/ m2, day 1 and 5FU 1000 mg/ m2 /d, days 1 through 5). One patient received only one course because of reversible cardiotoxicity. After chemotherapy patients were treated with uniform radiation therapy stratified by stage. The cumulative radiation dose to the primary sites was 59,4 Gy with single doses of 1,8 Gy. A total dose of 45 Gy was delivered to the neck area. After irradiation all high and low risk patients were treated with 105 U/kg body weight recombinant IFN-8 three times a week for 6 months. Results: 59 patients were eligible for the analysis of the NPC-91-study. Except for one stage II patient, all were AJC stage Ill-IV at presentation. After combined modality therapy, 89,9 % complete clinical response rate was accomplished, and 53 patients are still in first continuous remission with a median follow up of 34 months (range 3 - 86 months). In three patients metastases (2 bone and 1 lung) were observed 11, 13 and 15 months and three patients had local relapse of tumor 5, 7 and 9 months after diagnosis. Four of these six patients died of tumor progression. Chemotherapy related toxicity: mucositis grade Ill or IV developed in all patients, in 3.5 % of the patients acute but reversible cardiotoxicity, relevant nephrotoxicity was not observed. Conclusion: Because of the rarity of this disease in children only a multiinstitutional trial may result in an improved treatment strategy. It is worldwide the greatest study of NPC in children and adolescents. Combination of cisplatJn, methotrexate and 5-FU and adjuvant IFN-6 can improve the prognosis, and particularly decrease the incidence of metastases. The good preliminary results of preradiation chemotherapy, radiation therapy and IFN-r3 encourage to continue the trial. S 90 Head and Neck Cancer Poster P455 A PHASE I/II-TRIAL WITH PACLITAXEL AND CISPLATIN IN COMBINATION WITH RADIOTHERAPY IN LOCALLY ADVANCED HEAD AND NECK TUMORS S.U. Pigorsch, Kuhnt, tolerated dose and toxicity of Paclitaxel and Cisp]atin in combination with radiotherapy for the treatmentof locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Material and Methods: The trial comprises of 23 patients,who were treated from 1998 to 2001. Three female and 20 male. The treatment schedule included Pacfitaxel at a dose of 25mg/m 2 twice a week over the whole treatment time. The Cisplatin dose was always 20mg/m 2 5 days/week in week 1 and 5. The Paclitaxel infusion was administered 6 hours and the Cisplatin infusion 30 minutes prior to radiotherapy. To block allergic reactions we gave a combination of H1- and H2-inhibitors. To minimize nausea and vomiting the patients received dexamethasone and Tropisetron. The total radiation dose was 70.6 Gy. The regimen was started with 2Gy/day until a total dose of 30 Gy, then the hyperfractionation of 2 x 1.4 Gy/day begun. From 51 Gy to 70.6 Gy a boost irradiation was given also hyperfractionated. Results: 13/23 pts. developed grade 3 (CTC) and 10/20 grade two mucositis.Two patients revealed grade 4, 5 grade 3 and 16 grade 2 (CTC) dermatitis. In one patient a grade 2 nephrotoxicity appeared, so the second course of cisplatin in week 5 was cancelled. 8 patients needed one blood transfusion also 8 patients were given 2 blood transfusion and in one case we gave 3 transfusion units, In 16/20 patients antibiotics iv were necessary. In all patients occurred only slight nausea and vomiting. After therapy in 12 patients a complete remission (CR) and in 11 patients a partial remission (PR) was seen. The mean follow-up was 28 (13-31) months. Two patients died of tumor. All patients developed only grade I or II late side effects as fibrosis or lymphedema and xerostomia. Conclusion: The combination of cisplatin and Paclitaxel with concomitant radiotherapy is a very effective treatment strategy for locally advanced head and neck cancer. It is important to care with a very intensified supportive therapy for side effects, after 15 years. The application of adjuvant radiation therapy had now influence to tumor-dependent survival. The prognosis was significantly worse after appearance of local recurrence. Distant metastasis and tumor-loca]isation in large salivary glands (e.g. parotid and sumandibular gland) were negative prognostic factors. But patients with distant metastasis and local recurrences survived a very long time with the tumor. There was no case of metastasis in regional lymph nodes in time of primary tumor operation.With resppect to the delayed appearance of recurrences and distant metastasis and the long survival time with this recurrences we would recommend a live-long dispensaries and the trial of operative therapy of this recurrences. P458 VALUE OF SENTINEL NODE CONCEPT IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER PATIENTS A.A. DOnne, A. Ramaswamy, B. Folz, T. results in sentinel node (SN) biopsy are met by only few investigations in SN biopsy in head and neck cancer patients. This study was initiated to clarify, if the sentinel node predicts neck lymph node status in ultrasound assessed NO neck patients. Patients and method: SN biopsy was performed in 60 patients with cancer of the lower lip (n=2), oral the SN was compared with the excised neck dissection specimen. Results: In all 60 patients a SN could be detected. In 51 patients the tumor negative SN reflected the neck status (pN0), while in 7 patients the SN contained an isolate metastasis (pN1). In the remaining 2 patients the SN was tumorfree, while a neighbouring lymph node contained an isolate metastasis (pN1). SN predict the lymph node status in 96,6%. Conclusion: SN biopsy is suitable to predict neck lymph node status. This approach may lead to a more exact definition of the occult metastatic spread in cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract, which is actually supposed to be around 25%. Future studies must show, if this method may contribute to more security, indicating a more limited type of neck dissection. P456 CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF TELOMERASE ACTIVITY AND INACTIVATION OF THE TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENE P16 IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER S.K. for Humangenetik und Anthropologie (Jena) In order to evaluate the expression of telomerase as a possible prognostic marker in head and neck cancer, we investigated telomerase activity in 80 squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) of the pharynx, larynx and oral cavity. Additionally, we screened the putative tumor suppressor gene p16 for inactivation in this tumor tissues.. Telomerase activity was detected in 60 tumor tissues (75 %). No correlation was found between telomerase activity and staging and grading of the tumors. In 69 cases we investigated surgical resection margins. All resection margins were histologically tumor-free, but in 55 % telomerase activity was detected. In 89 % of 55 investigated lymph nodes were found to be telomerase positive independent of the existence of metastases. Because telomerase is known to be expressed in activated lymphocytes, the enzyme seems not to be a reliable diagnostic marker for the detection of lymph node metastases.The reactivation of telomerase shows no influence to tumor-dependent survival und number of local recurrences, but the number of lymph node metastasis was higher in cases with telomerase activity in tumor tissue and resection margins.The tumorsupressor gen p16 may be inactivated by mutation, promotor region and Lost of Heterozygoty. By sequencing exon 2 of the p16 gene we detected only one so far undesoribed transversion G to T at position 322 (Aspl08Tyr) and a known polymorphism (Ala148Thr) in five cases. Additionally, the methylation status of the p16 promoter region was analyzed by an improved highly sensitive methylation- specific PCR protocol. P16 methylation inactivation was found in 29 %. The LOH was detected in 33 %. Our data indicate that p16 point mutations in HNC are less frequent, but inactivation by methylation of the promotor region could be involved in genesis and progression of HNC. In follow-up over at least 30 months, we found no influence of p16-inactivation of tumor-dependent survival. But the number of local and regional recurrences was tendencious lower in cases with p16-inactivation. P457 carcinoma with his high risk of local recurrences and distant metastasis plays a special role during malignant salivary gland tumors. We investigated 57 cases which there treated between 1950 and 1996 in a retrospective study. The tumors were located in nose/paranasal sinuses 12 cases, Oropharynx 12 cases, parotid gland 19, submandibular gland 11 cases, middle ear 3 cases, trachea 3 cases and Fossa pterygopalatina 6 cases. The 5-year tumor-dependent survival is very good with 78 %, but in long time observation it is decreased to 43 % after 10 and 15 years. Patients with inoperative therapy had the best prognosis. In this subgroup the tumor-dependent survival was 86 % after 5 years, 60 % after 10 years and 46 % P459 PRETHERAPEUTIC SONOGRAPHIC APPEARANCE OF LYMPH NODE METASTASES IN INOPERABLE HEAD AND NECK CANCER: A NEW PREDICTOR FOR LOCOREGIONAL CONTROL AND SURVIVAL B. Ultrasound is a highly valuable diagnostic tool in the detection of cervical lymph node metastases with a sensitivity and specificity above 80%. Can established malignancy criteria be helpful in predicting patients\" outcome after radio-(chemo-)therapy? Material and Methods: From 05/99 to 05/01 34 patients (28 male and 6 female) with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region and suspected cervical lymph node metastases UlCC stage IV were examined by B-scan and colour-coded duplexsonography. Altogether 422 neck lymph nodes were found. For all 119 lymph nodes exceeding 1.5 cm in maximal diameter the volume and the fulfilling of the following eight malignancy criteria were recorded: inhomogeneity of echotexture, lack of hilar sign, irregular surface, spherical form, matting, infiltration of surrounding tissue, aberrant intranodal vessels and intranodal cystic necrosis. All patients were treated by definitive radiotherapy up to 70Gy, 20 patients got additional chemotherapy. After a median follow-up of 595 days (range 217-826 for survivors) 19 patients have died, 10 out of 15 living patients show no signs of disease. Results: According to Kaplan-Meier-statistics overall survival (OS) was 51% after 1 year and 40% after 2 years. The strongest predictor for adverse outcome was fulfilling of 7-8 malignancy criteria in a single lymph node. For these patients OS was 24% and 16% after one and two years, whereas patients with 1-6 malignancy criteria survived in 76% and 62%, respectively (Iogrank: p<0,001). Similar differences were and - Iocoregional control (30% 56%, p<0,025). There was a trend towards lower OS-rates for patients with pretherapeutic anaemia, large lymph node volumes and absence of chemotherapy, but none of these factors reached significance in univariate testing. Conclusion: This is the first study revealing the strong predictive value of pretherapeutic cervical ultrasound in patients with head and neck cancer stage IV. As ultrasound examination is usually part of the diagnostic work-up anyway, this prognostic testing could be established in the clinical setting without additional cost. Patients fulfilling 7 or all 8 of the listed malignancy criteria in a single metastatic lymph node can be identified as having a particularly bad prognosis with regard to Iocoregional control, disease-free survival and overall survival. P460 ELEVATED EXPRESSION OF SERUM MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES IN PATIENTS WITH SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMAS OF THE HEAD AND NECK C. the head and neck (SCCHN) are considered to be highly invasive tumors with early Iocoregional metastatic spread. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their specific inhibitors (TIMPs) are endopeptidases, which are necessary for tissue remodeling processes and all S 91 Head and Neck Cancer MMPs are able to degrade extracellular matrix, which is essential for tumor growth. Thus, MMP-expression is suggested to have some tumor marker potential in various tumors. Patients and Methods: The serum concentrations of MMP-2, -3, -8, -9, -13, and TIMP-1 were determined in 73 patients with SCCHN and compared with 74 healthy individuals. A correlation with T- and N-status, UICC- staging, grading and tumor site was performed. Additionally, the serum C-reactive protein was determined, and categorical subdivision into patients with and without additional chronic inflammatory disease was performed to evaluate the influence of inflammation. Results: Significant differences between healthy individuals and patients with SCCHN were seen with MMP-3, -8, and -9. A significant correlation was found between MMP-8 serum concentration and T-status, N-status, and UtCC-staging. No correlation with the grading of the tumor was observed. Additio- nal inflammatory diseases did not affect MMP and TIMP expression significantly. Conclusions: Certain MMP serum concentrations seem to be elevated in SCCHN and especially MMP-8 shows interesting tumor marker potential and might be worth further investigations. P461 THE ROLE OF STEREOTACTICALLY GUIDED CONFORMAL RADIOTHERAPY FOR LOCAL TUMOR CONTROL OF ESTHESIONEUROBLASTOMA Zabel, conventional radiotherapy and stereotactically guided conformal radiotherapy (SCRT) in patients with esthesioneuroblastoma. Patients and Methods: Between 1991 and 1999 14 patients with esthesioneuroblastoma underwent radiotherapy in our institution. Median follow- up was 30 months (range 12 to 107 months). Treatment included adjuvant radiotherapy (9), adjuvant radiochemotherapy (3) or radiotherapy alone (2). Eight patients received SCRT with 3D-treatment-planning. For comparison a standard 3-field plan for these patients and dose volume histogram analyses were performed. Results: Local tumor control rate was 50% with conventional radiotherapy and 75% with SCRT. Overall survival was 33.3% and 62.5% respectively. Target coverage could be improved statistically significant (p<0.05) and dose to critical structures was reduced using SCRT. Greatest differences were seen regarding volume above the 30%-isodose as well as mean dose of brain stem (p<0.05). A reduction of maximum dose was seen using SCRT as consequence of a more homogeneous treatment. Conclusion: SCRT improves target coverage and sparing of organs-at-risk. Our clinical data although with low patient numbers suggest that the technical advantage translates into a clinical advantage. Thus the risk of complications in this area is minimized. Adjuvant radiotherapy is a save and effective treatment modality for local control of esthesioneuroblastoma. P462 HIGH RISK HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS (HPV) 16/18 IN P53 WILD TYPE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMAS OF THE HEAD AND NECK (SCCHN) K. Scheckenbach, H. Bier, U. Bockm0hl, K. HNO-Klinik, Pathologie Charit# (DLisseldorf, Fulda, Mannheim, Berlin) Besides mutation, a well established mechanism of p53 inactivation involves binding of the tumor suppressor to the E6 protein of high risk HPV 16/18, which entails rapid ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53 protein. We performed full length transcript analysis of p53 in tumor tissue of 123 unselected patients with histologically confirmed SCCHN. The HPV 16 status was determined by amplification of the specific E6 and E2 transcripts with a standard multiplex PCR. For analysis of HPV 18, the corresponding E6 transcript was amplified. Amplification products were checked in a 2% agarose gel. As positive controls served CaSki cells and the established SCCHN cell line UD-SCC2 for HPV 16, and HeLa cells for HPV 18. In order to increase the sensitivity of transcript detection, we performed Southern blotting with the RT-PCR amplificates and subsequent hybridization with specific probes for HPV 16. Ongoing investigations focus on hybridization experiments with HPV 18 probes. Mutated p53 transcript was found in 97 of the 123 SCCHN (79%). Within the remaining group of 26 p53 wild type tumors, employing only RT- PCR, 10 SCCHN (38%) turned out to be either HPV 16 or HPV 18 positive by detection of the E6/E2 transcript. Additional 9 HPV 16 positive tumors were identified by the more sensitive Southern Blot analysis, currently resulting in 19 HPV 16/18 positive probes among the 26 p53 wild type SCCHN (73%). So far, subject to the HPV 18 hybridization results, 17 tumors showed HPV 16 E6 transcript, one tumor carried HPV 18 transcript, and one tumor was infected with both HPV 16 and 18. For the analysis of p53 inactivation through HPV16/18, the significance to demonstrate E6 transcript has been emphasized, recently (van Houten et al.; int. J. Cancer, 93: 232-235, 2001). in the present study, increased sensitivity for the detection of HPV transcript was obtained through RT-PCR followed by Southern blotting and hybridization with specific HPV probes. We detected mutated p53 transcript or HPV 16/18 transcript in 116 of 123 unselected SCCHN. Thus, at least 94% of these tumors have to be considered to possess inactivated p53. P463 PROGNOSTIC FACTORS IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER: REVIEW OF 2894 PATIENTS F. Waldfahrer, H. Iro, Universit~its-HNO-Klinik (Erlangen) Objective: In the past several prognostic factors for head and neck cancer have been identified. However, in many examinations study groups were too small to reach statistic significance. The relevance of some other factors is still in doubt. Patients and methods: In a retrospective analysis of 2894 patients treated at our institution between 1970 und 1990 for head and neck cancer (excluding tumors of the nose, of the paranasal sinus and of the salivary glands) we evaluated the prognostic relevance of different factors. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazard model. Results: T-category and N-category proved to be the most important prognostic factors for disease free survival. No significant results could be demonstrated concerning the variables age and gender. The invasion of lymph vessels by tumor cells (,,lymphangiosis carcinomatosa\") was identified to be of prognostic significance (relative risk ~ 2,1; p=0,005), while extranodal spread of lymph node metastases was not (RR=1,35; p=0,12). Conclusion: In order to improve survival in head and neck cancer patients it is necessary to identifiy risk factors to enable the development of a risk-adapted therapy strategy. P464 SUPERPARAMAGNETIC IRON OXIDE ENHANCED MR IMAGING OF HEAD AND NECK LYMPH NODES M. Baghi, M. Mack, K. Teichert, W. GstSttner, Radiologische- Uniklinik (Frankfurt am Main) Purpose: The purposes of our study were to compare findings on SPIO enhanced MRI of the head and neck with resected lymph node specimens and to determine the effect of such imaging on surgical planning in patients with histopathologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Materials and Methods: 25 patients were examined with noncontrast and intravenous \u00b0) to detect possibel LN metastasis. Signal intensity decrease was evaluated by ROI measurements. Visual analyses was done by 2 radiologist by consensus. Initial planning of surgery was based on clinical examination and ultrasound evaluation and was modified, if necessary, based on MRI. Resected LN were analyzed by a pathologist and results were compared with MR findings. Results: A total of 350 LN were histopathologically evaluated, of which 27 were determined to be metastatic. Sinerem ?- MRI revealed 95%, Spezifit~it: 94%). Regarding the evaluation of LN levels, the Sinerem?- MR diagnosis was correct all of the 27 LN metastases. The best sequence for differentation between benign and malignant LN was the T2-weighted GE sequence. Conclusion: Sinerem\u00ae enhanced MRI has relevant impact on planning the extension of surgery. On a patient basis there was a very good comparison of Sinerem\u00ae enhanced MRI and resected specimens. P465 HEMOGLOBIN AS AN INDEPENDENT PROGNOSTIC FACTOR IN THE RADIO- THERAPY OF HEAD AND NECK TUMORS U. Sch~ifer, B. of this study was to analyze the prognostic value of pre- treatment hemoglobin prior to radiotherapy in patients with head and neck tumors. Material and methods: In a retrospective study with a median follow-up of 33 months, we analyzed the results of 228 patients irradiated for head and neck cancer between 1-1-1990 and 1-1-1998 (197 men and 31 women with a median age of 58 years). The treatment concept was adjuvant radiotherapy in 67 patients, 77 patients received definitive radiochemotherapy (RCT), 38 patients definitive radiotherapy (RT), and 46 patients re-irradiation for in-field recurrence (re-RT). Several known prognostic factors like sex, age (< median vs. > median), tumor stage (AJCC stage I-IV), tumor grade (G1-G4), general condition (AJCC 0-1 vs. 2- 3), and treatment concept were analyzed for their influence on overall survival and correlated with pre-treatment hemoglobin values (< 12 g/100 ml vs. > 12 g/100 ml).Results: Median survival of all patients amounted to 13 months (adjuvant treatment: 49 months, RCT 13 months, RT 8 months, re-RT 4 months). In univariate analysis, the following variables were significant prognostic factors for overall survival: treatment concept (p<0.0001), tumor stage (p=0.004), general condition (p<O.0001), and pre-treatment hemoglobin (p=0.039). Multivariate analysis (Cox) showed all these parameters to be independent from each other (treatment concept p=0.01, tumor stage p=0.0001, general condition p=0.001, pre-treatment hemoglobin p~0.024).Conclusion: In this retrospective analysis, pre-treatment hemoglobin proved to be an independent significant prognostic factor in the radiotherapy of head and neck cancer patients. Therefore there might be a sensible indication for the use of erythropoietin in patients treated for malignancies of the head and neck region. P466 IMPACT OF GENE ALTERATIONS AT 9P21 AND P53 MUTATIONS IN CORRELA- TION TO BLOOD HEMOGLOBIN LEVEL IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER PATIENTS M. Schiebe, U. Pinkert, K. Donhuijsen, studies have reported an impaired radiocurability in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients (HNSCC) with anemia due to hypoxia S 92 Head and Neck Cancer and consecutive radioresistance. Currently the potential value of tumor suppressor genes, microsatellite instability and cell proliferation as biological markers in the treatment of this disease is discussed. Previous studies indicated, that hypoxia may induce changes in gene expression, which precede malignant progression and tumor cell growth. The aim of our study was to investigate, as to whether there is any correlation between genetic markers, hemoglobin level and clinical outcome in advanced head and neck cancer patients treated with primary radiotherapy (XR'r). Material and Methods: Prior to XRT tumor DNA was sampled from 50 HNSCC patients irradiated with a total dose between 66 and 70.6 Gy. Leukocyte and tumor DNA were screened by microsatellite analysis of 9p21-22. To determine the frequency of mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53 single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain products was used. Correlation analysis of the pretreatment hemoglobin blood count and the p53 gene status was performed to clarify, if tumors which possess mutations in their apoptotic program have a survival advantage in a low oxygen environment. Results: Allelic loss was found in 64% of tumors, homozygous deletion of the 9p21 region occurred in about 54%. In one third of cases p53 mutations of exon 5 to 8 were detected. Univariate analysis revealed no significant correlation between p53 status and Hb level. However, 90% of patients with HNSCC tumors characterized by both genetic alterations (homozygous deletion of 9p21 and p53 mutation) showed reductions in Hb levels < 12 g/dl prior to BT. Our data revealed a close association of LOH 9p21 and the histopathological grading. The prognostic value of LOH 9p21 was of borderline significance but a trend indicating better prognosis for HNSCC patients with 9p21 wildtype was noted. Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis, that the loss of apoptotic potential in hypoxic cells might be important in their resistance to XRT. P467 RADIOTHERAPY DOES NOT IMPROVE PROGNOSIS OF PATIENTS WITH DIFFERENTIATED THYROID CARCINOMA D. Sandrock, D. Noack, K. Baba, D. Munz, Klinik ffJr Nuklearmedizin (Berlin) Aim: The impact of (percutaneous) radiotherapy on prognosis in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma is controversially discussed. The randomisation for currently beginning and Schober, Nuklear- medizin 1999; 38:328-332), however, is slowly ongoing due to the traditional therapy algorithms of different institutions and problems to obtain informed consent of suitable patients. It was, therefore, the aim of this study to analyse data from a very special ,,retrospective\" group of patients. Methods: In the years 1970 to 1991 the decision for radiotherapy (neck, supraclavicular groin; telecobalt, fast electrons 40/50 Gy) was - according to the (complete) records - not systematically made and not only given to pT4- tumors (late correct diagnosis from reference pathologist, availability of therapy facilities, different oppinions by different chiefs at different times...). Therefore, there is a group of 178 patients having follicular and 132 papillary carcinoma with radiotherapy (RT) and a comparable group (162 follicular, 143 papillary) without radiotherapy (No RT). All patients received otherwise a standard treatment (surgery, lymphadenectomy [if appropriate), radioiodine, suppressive thyroxine medication). The mean follow-up time was 9.8 years. Results: Both groups did not differ significantly in the parameters age, sex, TNM- stage, and survival (COX-regression). Survival rates are given in the table below (carcinoma related mortality). There is also no difference in survival for T4- patients (41 patients with vs. 34 without radiotherapy). Conclusion: Radiotherapy has - according to our analysis of comparable groups - no benefit for survival in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma - including the subgroup of T4-patients. Survival RT T1-4 No RT T1-4 RT T4 No RT T4 5 years 94 % 92 % 81% 85 % 10 years 89 % 87 % 67 % 70 % P468 RESULTS OF HDR-BRACHYTHERAPY IN RESIDUAL AND RECURRENT HEAD&NECK CANCER M. Glatzel, accepted kinds of radiotherapy which are commonly used in recurrent head and neck cancer. Most reports about brachytherapy in the successful treatment of head and neck tumors used low-dose-rate brachytherapy. There are only few reports about high- dose-rate brachytherapy (HDRBT) in head and neck cancer patients. Patients and methods: After 10 years of experience with HDRBT with Ir-192 we have analyzed the results regarding response rates, survival time and side effects. Between 1991 and 2000 90 consecutive patients (68 men, 22 women) were treated with interstitial (68 patients) or intracavitary (22 patients) HDRBT in the head and neck area. Primary tumor locations were: Oropharynx HDRBT was administered in 51 patients with recurrent disease and in 32 patients with residual tumor after primary radiochemotherapy. 7 patients got an exclusive HDRBT in a primary palliative situation. The single dose per fraction ranged from 1,5 to 7,5 Gy (median 5 Gy) and the to 42,0 Gy (median 17,5 Gy). Results: The overall remission rate was 81% with 46 % complete remissions. We observed no change or progression of tumor in 17 cases (19 %). The rate of complete remissions / median overall survival time was different in the 3 therapy groups: Recurrent disease 28% / 6 months; in case of residual tumor 84% / 25 months and in primary palliative brachytherapy 0% / 1 6/90 (6,7%) to be an effective treatment modality in Iocoregional recurrent head and neck cancer. In cases with persistent or residual tumor after primary radioehemotherapy a local boost with brachytherapy can improve the chance of cure from tumor disease. P469 INHIBITION OF SCC CELLS OF THE PHARYNX RETINOIC (Mainz) Introduction: Retinoids are Vitamin A analogues that have promising effects in chemotherapy of different malignant diseases. They influence proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of malignant cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti proliferative effect of the two retinoids all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 9-cis retinoic acid (9CRA) on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells (HNSCC) of the hypopharynx. Method: Two cell lines (HNSCC-La and HNSCC-Lo) were incubated with medium containing different concentrations of ATRA and 9CRA (10-13M - 10-5M). After different periods of incubation (13h to 24h) the proliferation of the cultured cells was quantified by Alamar Blue& staining. Results: ATRA and 9CRA provoked a dose and incubation time dependant inhibition of proliferation in the analysed cell lines. ATRA was in both cell lines a stronger inducer of proliferation inhibition (Pl) than 9CRA (PlmaxATRA= 78%, Plmax9CRA=66%). ATRA lead to a maximum PI in HNSCC-La concentrated 10- 12M or higher, in HNSCC-Lo concentrated 10-8M or higher. 9CRA lead to a maximum PI in HNSCC-La concentrated 10-11M or higher, in HNSCC-Lo concentrated 10-13M or higher. Die PI was most potent after a incubation period of 14h and decreased continuously within the following 10h. Conclusion: Our results confirm the anti proliferative effect of the retinoids ATRA and 9CBA on HNSCC of the pharynx. ATRA is shown to be the stronger inhibitor. The inhibitory effects were completely reversible in all experiments. These data suggest that use of retinoids in chemotherapy of HNSCC may be a reasonable option. P470 A PHASE II MULTICENTER STUDY WITH A BISPECIFIC MONCLONAL ANTIBODY FOR TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH RELAPSED SCC OF THE HEAD AND NECK K. Teichert, M. Wink, W. Gst6ttner, R. Knecht, M. Baghi, Uniklinik Frankfurt (Frankfurt) It is well known that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the head and neck also in recurrent tumors. Therefore we designed a phase II multicenter open label study to assess the effects of a bispeeific monoclonal EGFR-FcyRI antibody on tumor growth in patients with SCC of the head and neck who relapsed after first Fine therapy. The antibody was given intravenously on days 1,8,15 and 22 of a 28-day cycle with a dosis of 20 mg/m =. Courses were repeated on the above schedule until disease progression, intolerabel toxicity or patient refusal of further treatment. Patients with complete response after > 2 cycles of treatment received one more treatment cycle and were restaged to confirm response. Tumor responses were measured with MRT, CT every 8 weeks. The first results show stable disease and in some cases also tumor progressin under therapy. The most adverse event was hypotension. Patients received therefore concomitant hydration therapy. The used bispecific antibody is thought to mediate destruction of cancer cells expressing EGFR through binding the cells to the FcyBI receptor of cytotoxie effector cells. Because of the cytokine based side effects the antibody dose must be reduced. This may be the cause why the best effect that we observed werde stable disease. P471 LIP, ORAL pharynx cancer, is no longer a rare tumor site in Germany. With a number of a bit more than 10 800 estimated new cases per year (7 881 male and 2 965 female). Lip, oral and pharynx cancer is between 4 and 5 % of all cancer cases in the whole country. The occurrence in male is nearly 3-fold of women. Prognosis for men is worse than for women. In Saarland incidence and mortality of lip, oral and pharyngeal cancer increased over a period of 30 years. Age distribution with a high proportion of cases between 40 and 60 years is different to most cancer sites. Data base: Our illustrations of incidence and mortality data are based on the data from the Saarland. The analysis includes incidence and mortality data for the period 1970 to 1998 for the ICD-9 sites 140-149. Obsevered mortality and estimated incidence for the whole Federal Republic of Germany for the same period will be presented in comparison to the Saarland data. Results: S 93 Head and Neck Cancer The highest incidence rates for oral and pharynx cancer among males are reported in France with annual rates about 40 per 100.000. Saarland, located along the border of France, with similar life-style factors also has high incidence rates for males with a WSR of 17,1 per 100.000 in 1998. Total mortality for lip, oral and pharynx cancer for males in Germany was 9.3 per 100.000 in 1999, in Saarland we observed a crude mortality rate of 15,0 in 1999. Incidence rates for men inoreaesed over a period of 30 years. For women we also saw increasing rates but on a lower level, with a proportion of only 1% of all new cancer cases, this sites have a minor position for females. About 40% of all new cases in male of lip, oral and pharyngeal cancer in Saarland 1998 were less than 60 years old an only 0,01% were older than 80 years Looking for relative survival rates for period of diagnosis 1985 to 1988 in Saarland, we found rates of 43% for males over all and 56% for total females. This rates are nearly the same as we observed for the former GDR using the data of the Common Registry for the New States and Berlin for time of diagnosis in the years 1983 to 1984. The different prognosis for both sexes may be caused by the variation of sites and the high proportion of pharyngeal cancer in males. Publication only P'472 HSP70 MEMBRANE EXPRESSION ON HEAD AND NECK CANCER - A TARGET RECOGNITION STRUCTURE FOR A CELLULAR IMMUNOTHERAPY ? G. Multhoff, O. Arndt, (Hsp70), a molecu- lar chaperone, supports folding/unfolding of native proteins and transport mecha- nisms in the cytoplasm and high cytoplasmic amounts of Hsp70 have been found to protect cells from apoptotic cell death. On the other hand extracellular or membrane bound Hsp70 plays a key role in eliciting a potent cancer immune response. Either Hsp70 functions as a carrier for immunogenic tumor peptides (Srivastava 1998) or acts as a chaperokine (Asea et al 2001). in the present study the role of a tumor selective plasma membrane expression of Hsp70 is analysed on freshly isolated biopsy material of head and neck cancer patients. Materials and Methods: Plasma membrane localization of Hsp70 was determined on freshly isolated single cell suspensions of tumor biopsy material and normal tissues of head and neck cancer patients. A flow cytometric analysis was per- formed using an antibody directed against Hsp70 (C92 F3 B1) and isotype matched control antibodies. Results and Conclusion: A tumor selective Hsp70 membrane expression was found on 34 of 45 head and neck cancer biopsies (75%) but not on the correspond- ing normal tissues: 12 of 14 (85%) tongue and mouth; 4 of 7 (57%) oropharynx; 2 of 2 hypopharynx; 8 of 10 larynx (80%); 1 of 2 esophagus; 2 of 3 lymph node metastases. For statistical analysis a larger panel of tumor biopsy materials are tested. In vitro Hsp70 acts a target recognition structure for natural killer cells. Therefore, one might speculate about the immunological potential of membrane- bound Hsp70 on tumor biopsy material. P'473 CASE-CONTROL SETTING. ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, SMOKING HABITS, MOUTH HYGIENE AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT AMONG PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY ORAL CANCER (1999-2001). J. NL) Objectives: The main goal was to investigate the role the risk factors of smoking, alcohol consumption and mouth hygiene play contracting cancer especially the behavioring changes during the disease. In addition, socioeconomic status was considered. Study Design: Case Control Study. Cases were hospitalized oral cancer patients with a histological approved squamous cancer of the mouth hole. Only primaries were included. Controls were hospitalized orthopedic patients. These cases were matched individually. Methods: A special questionnaire was developed to collect information about the relevant lifestyle of these groups. Two pretests were undertaken with 8 and 21 students in Stuttgart who were members of thesis e.V.. 6 patients agreed personally to fill out the questionnaire as a pretest too. Anonymous personal interviews were made at the University Hospital of Graz, Austria, Department of Maxillofacial Surgery. 19 cases and 4 controls of this department were interviewed until January 2000. From February 2000 to the present, 25 cancer patients of the Clinic Newbrandenburg, Department of Maxillofacial Surgery, were interviewed. 22 controls were orthopedic patients from the neighboring department. Two controls to one case shall be achieved. The statistical analysis was done with SPSS 10.07 for windows. Results: There is a positive association between alcohol consumption, smoking and developing cancer. Squamous cancer of the mouth-floor is in particular associated with these risk factors. Cancer of the tongue is diagnosed in younger patients with often no risks. Lifestyle changes significantly during the disease.

The outcome for HNSCC patients is determined by metastatic spread and lethality. In contrast, metastatic spread and lethality are almost insignificant for BCC patients. Our goal was to investigate whether the course of the disease was reflected in the level of telomerase activity by demonstrating telomerase levels in PCR-ELISA in tumour specimens from HNSCC and BCC. Patients and Methods: We examined 40 turnout-adjacent resection margins and 20 tumour-distant margin tissues from 40 patients with HCSCC and 25 BCC resection margins from 25 patients. A histopatho]ogical control examination of the cyro-conserved tissue pieces after molecular-biological examination showed that all BCC margin biopsies and 33 of the 40 HNSCC marginal tissues were turnout- free. To establish the ELISA cut-off value, we examined 40 tissue samples in comparable Iocalizations from tumour-free patients. Results: In the seven tumour marginal tissue samples with residual SCC, the telomerase levels were 43% higher, which is comparable with the findings for turnout centre tissue (50% increased telomerase activity). In 27% of the carcinoma- free HNSCC marginal tissues and in 35% of the tumour-distant tissues, only a small portion showed increased telomerase levels. The telomerase-positive carcinoma-free tissues were comparable resection of the BCC-free resection margin tissues were telomerase-positive. In contrast, we demonstrated significantly higher telomerase activity in BCC tissues (83%). Conclusion: Our telomerase levels in turnout margin tissue permit the tentative conclusion that telomerase activation is not always associated with a poor outcome: The reduced relapse rate in HNSCC-patients in the clinical follow-up correlated with telomerase activation in the turnout margin tissue. The follow-up of our basaloma patients could not yet be evaluated. P'475 DOXORUBIClN IN THE PALLIATIVE THERAPY OF PRETREATED RECURRENT HEAD AND NECK CANCER J. are wel known in the palliative treatment of head and neck cancer. We need more valid informatiens about the special effects of lipsomal doxorubicin in order to introduce it into our daily practice. Material and method: Beetween 1997 and 2001 we included 63 patients with recurrent pretreated squamous cell carcinoma of the thead and neck region in a controlled phase II project. The median age of the patients (9 women, 54 men) was 60 years (range 34-81) Group A (32 patients) received 25 mg/m2 liposomal doxorubicin (Caeiyx \u00ae) every 3 weeks. Group B (32 patients) received 50 mg/m2 conventional doxorubicin every three weeks plus 50 mg trofosfamide each day. The doxorubicin was administered iv as infusion about 1 hour. Results: Patients of group A received in median 3 cycles (range 1-11), pts of group B had also got in median 3 cycles (range 1-9). We observed a median overall survival of 10 month (range 1-52) in group A and 6 month (range 1-25) in group B. The median time to progression was 8 month (range 1-18) in group A and 5 month (range 1-21) in group B. The total response rate was 43,7 % in group A compared to 28,1% in group B. Following toxocities were seen in group A: anemia \u00b01/2 in 7 pts, hand-food-syndrome in 2 pts., nausea in 2 pts, ECG-changes in 3 pts. Group B reported about anemia in 16 pts, leucopenia in 8 pts, alopecia in 21 pts, nausea in 3 pts, ECG-changes in 3 pts, and no hand-food-syndrome. 3 pts of group B decided to withdraw the therapy because of side effects. Conclusion. Regarding the effectivity and toxicity the liposomal formulation of doxorubicin seems to be the more acceptable palliative treatment approach for the patients with pretreated recurrent head and neck cancer. P'476 SOLITARY INFANTILE MYOFIBROMATOSIS OF LEFT ORBITAL BONE, NASAL CAVITY, AND MAXILLARY SINUS was found to have a large spherical lesion with destruction of S 94 Head and Neck Cancer / Central Nervous System Tumors the bony skeleton between left orbit, maxillary sinus, and nasal cavity. The mass was excised by transnasal surgery and histologically analyzed. The examination disclosed fascicular to slightly nodular pattern of predominantly spindelshaped cells. Special stains demonstrated fibroblastic and smooth muscle features in individual cells, and infantile myofibromatosis was diagnosed. 6 months postoperatively no evidence of recurrence was noted. Visus and motility of the left eye were completely unrestricted. Infantile myofibromatosis is a rare benign disorder of childhood consisting of well-demarcated nonencapsulated tumors. The overall prognosis depends on the number and location of tumors. The presented case demonstrates the solitary type of infantile myofibromatosis which was treated by combined microscopic and endoscopic endonasal surgery. This surgery may lead to very good functional results, even if tumors are large and infiltrate important adnexal structures. Moreover, defacing scars and negative effects on the growth of the bony structures in childhood can be avoided. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a total resection of an infantile myofibromatosis of the orbit using a transnasal approach. P'477 LOWER-LIP-CARCINOMA: V-EXCISION VERSUS RECTANGULAR-EXCISON AND A. Dunsche, Mund-, Kiefer-, Gesichtschirurgie (Kiel) The aim of this study was to compare the v-excision and primary closure by z- plastic and the rectangular excision and reconstruction by the modified Johansons step technique on patients with lower-lip-carcinoma. 37 Patients underwent the v-excision and promary closure by z-plastic, 28 patients underwent a rectangle excision and reconstruction of the lower lip by the modified Johansons step-technique.We analysed the esthetic aspect, the function of the mouth and the number of local recidivies. The rectangle excision and reconstruction of the lower lip by the modified Johansons step-technique is a exellent technique for patients with carcinomas of the lower lip, when a excision of less than 2/3 of the lip is necessary.The advantage of this technique to Abbe-plastic and its modifikations are the preserved vascular, motoric and neurosensory function and a good esthetic aspect. With the rectangle excision it is easier to realize a most radical surgery on tumors greater than 1 cm than the v-excision. Defects over the midline need the formation of the steps on both sides of the lower lip, so its not necessary to break the mentolabial foulder. It is possible to combine these technique with a vermillionectomy. The rectangle excision and reconstruction of the lower lip by the modified Johansons step-technique reaches the best results in the analysis of function and esthetic. P'478 AN OPTIMIZED MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TREATMENT SCHEDULE LEADS TO A CLEAR INCREASE OF LONG TERM SURVIVAL OF PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED HEAD AND NECK CANCER M. Schroeder, K. Sesterhenn, H. Knieriem, H.-Br- Makoski, C. Aul, Bethesda- Krankenhaus, St&dtische (Duisburg) Since the beginning of the eighties, combined modality therapy represents the mainstay of current treatment in advanced head and neck carcinoma (HNC). CisplatJn based chemotherapy regimens were estabilished by Kish et el. as gold standard. After variation of the 3 different treatment modalities (OF', RTX, CTX) between 1981 and 1985, as of 1986 we combined preoperative CTX and RTX followed by radical surgery, and applied postoperatively again RTX and CTX. Treatment schedule: pre- and d1-19 ad 70 Gy Patient characteristics (1991-2000): No of pts. 143, m 28, f 26, median age 56 years Histology: 141 x SCC, 2 x Schmincke-Regaud Exclusion from evaluation: CTX/RTX, 14 postop.

With supportive care (PEG, Erypo, twice weekly medical attention) toxicity is manageable. The rate of secondary neoplasems is higher than the rate of local relapses and constantly increasing during follow-up. P'479 HIGH VESSEL DENSITY AND VEGF-EXPRESSION ARE LINKED IN GLOMUS TUMORS. J. Brieger, A. Bedavanija, J. Maurer, W.J. Mann, University Hospital, School of Medicine, Siriraj University Hospital, School of Medicine (Mainz; Bangkok, T) The contribution of VEGF-expression (vascular endothelial growth factor) to ang- iogenesis and tumor aggressiveness has been shown in several tumor types. In a recent study the expression of VEGF in Paraganglioma has been demonstrated. Aim of our study was to quantify the vessel network of Glomus tumors end to analyze the possible relation of vascularisation and VEGF-expression. Therefore 14 consecutive samples were fixed with formalin and embedded in paraffin. The cuttings were hybridized with VEGF- and CD31-spezific antibodies and reactions were visualized by NBT/BClP-staining. Vessel density was counted as CD31- positive vessels per over-all cells. We found ten samples VEGF-positive (71%) and four (29%) negative. The positive group had about five times the vessel density of the negative group. We conclude that VEGF contributes to vessel in- grow and speculate that these tumors might be a target for anti-angiogenesis therapy. Central Nervous System Tumors Oral Presentation 0480 A CLINICAL PHASE 1/11 DOSE ESCALATION STUDY WITH TGF-BETA-2 ANTISENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDE AP 12009 ADMINISTERED INTRATUMORALLY IN PATIENTS WITH MALIGNANT GLIOMA: SAFETY AND FIRST EFFICACY DATA P. Hau, U. Bogdahn, E Schulmeyer, A. Brawanski, A. Steinbrecher, therapeutic approaches including surgery, radio- and chemotherapy, the prognosis of malignant glioma patients remains poor. As transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGF-62) has been recognized as an important tumor progression factor in malignant glioma, a novel treatment strategy using an antisense oligonucleotide (AP 12009) directed against TGF-82 has been developed. In preclinical studies, AP 12009 reduced giioma cell proliferation and reversed TGF-B2 induced T-cell immunosuppression. Toxicology studies in rodents and primates revealed excellent safety and tolerability after systemic and local application of AP 12009. To assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), a phase 1/11 dose escalation clinical trial has been initiated. AP 12009 has been administered intratumorally by high flow microperfusion in adult patients with malignant gliomas (WHO grade III and IV). All patients included had evidence of tumor progression on MRI despite previous therapies (surgery, radio- and chemotherapy). Initial dose was based on effective dose in vitro devoid of any toxicities in animals. Thus far, a 32fold increase of this dose has been well tolerated. Adverse events were evaluated by an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB). No drug related clinically relevant adverse events have been observed. Besides these good results in safety and tolerability, preliminary evaluation of MRI scans and survival data revealed first indications for efficacy of the antisense therapy. O481 IMAGE- AND FUNCTION-GUIDED REMOVAL OF CEREBRAL NEOPLASMS IN OR NEAR ELOQUENT CORTEX O. Suess, T. Kombos, S. Suess, R. Stendel, C. Da Silva, M. Brock, UKBF (Berlin) Objective: Modern techniques of diagnostic imaging such as functional MRI (fMRI) or intraoperative neurophysiological mapping & monitoring (IOM) enable the precise localization of cerebral neoplasms in relation to anatomical and functional landmarks. Also image guidance (neuronavigation) has become an important tool in the surgical treatment of lesions in or near eloquent brain areas as it helps to define tumor margins and their relation to the sensorimotor cortex in the operative field. Nonetheless, image guidance alone may not suffice, because of individual variations in the functional organization of the brain. Particularly in patients at high risk for postoperative neurological deterioration, image guidance should be combined with fMRI-data and IOM-techniques to reduce postoperative morbidity. Methods: For functional imaging, 3D anatomical data were fused with functional information. An image-guided, frameless and armless electromagnetic navigation system was used in all cases. IOM was performed using high-frequency anodal monopolar cortical stimulation. Motor potentials (CMAPs) were recorded from muscles of the contralateral extremities and are both qualitatively and quantitatively assessed. With help of the navigation system, the stimulation sites were anatomically correlated, registered and displayed on the system monitor. Results: Twenty lesions (gliomas and cerebral metastases) were located in or near S 95 Central Nervous SystemTumors eloquent motor cortex. In these cases neuronavigation was combined with fMRI- data and IOM. This allowed real-time display of surgical manoeuvres and the control of stimulation sites on preoperative MR images without a stereotactic frame or a robotic arm, No negative interference was ever observed between the electrically driven monitoring equipment and the function of the electromagnetic navigation system. Conclusions: The application of image- and function-guided navigation is directed by the complexity of the procedure and by the need to visualise unexposed intracranial structures. Its main field of application are deep-seated subcortical lesions in eloquent areas of the brain, or in the vicinity of functional pathways. In all cases of the present study, functional navigation improved the surgeon's anatomical orientation, thereby improving the precision, accuracy and effectiveness of the surgical procedure. It provides a powerful means for safer and less invasJve intracranial neurosurgery. 0482 TENASCIN-C EXPRESSION IN N. Hopf, D. Hoelzinger, USA; Bern, CH) Malignant gliomas invade normal brain tissue. Active cell movement is based on cell-cell interactions as well as interactions with extracellular matrix proteins (ECM). Inhibition of the invasive phenotype could limit tumor progression. Migratory selected subpopulations were cultivated from two human glioblastoma cell lines. Using time-lapse-individual cell migration assays (TIM-assay) migratory activity of the two subtypes were compared. Microarray analysis of complementary DNA (cDNA) gene expression of migratory selected and non selected tumor cell lines was performed. From 3 human glioblastoma specimen cells from the invasive edge and tumor rim were captured using laser-capture-microdissection (LCM). Quantitative RT-PCR for Tenascin-C was performed on LCM-samples and cell cultures. One of the genes overexpressed in migratory selected cells by cDNA microarray was Tenascin-C (up to 4 fold). ]n 2 LCM-samples from human glioblastomas TN-C expression was only found in the invasive edge. In one samples there was a 1.6 fold overexpression for the invasive edge. The results show, that TN-C plays an important role in human glioma invasion. It implicates, that the TN-C gene may be a target for antiinvasive strategies. 0483 IS PRETREATMENT HEMOGLOBIN A PROGNOSTIC FACTOR IN Informatik (Freiburg) Purpose: Investigation of the impact of several factors on overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma undergoing radiation therapy. Patients and methods: From January 1980 to December 2000, we treated 415 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed glioblastoma. Median age was 59 years (19-81), Karnofsky Performance Status >/= 70 in 280 patients. 72 patients had a biopsy, 343 underwent open neurosurgical resection. Primary radiotherapy was given in conventional fractionation (n = 112). Postoperative radiotherapy was given hypofractionated (n = 94) or hyperfractionated (n = 209). Survival probabilities were estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier, multivariate analysis was performed in the framework of a Cox-regression model. Variable selection was done by backward elimination. Results: 406 patients had died at the time of the analysis. Median overall survival was 8.1 months. 10 factors were considered in a proportional hazards model stratified for treatment (fractionation scheme and type of surgery). Significant variables were age (compared with patients <50 ys. increased risk for patients [RB 1.39, 95% C.I. 1.04-1.87]). in subgroups of 318 respectively 234 patients hemoglobin respectively LDH was measured. 84 patients were anemic (men <13 Hb g/dl, women Hb <12 g/dl), in 80 patients the LDH level was elevated beyond the upper limit of the normal range (>240 U/I). By including the three significant variables both parameters had an additional significant effect with an estimated relative risk of about 1.4 in their corresponding subgroups. Conclusion: Our analysis reveals that besides established prognostic factors, anemia may negatively influence outcome in glioblastoma patients. Our results from data-dependent modeling have to be confirmed by independent studies. A prognostic impact of hemoglobin has been identified for a variety of tumor sites, but not yet for primary brain neoplasms. 0484 TEMOZOLOMIDE DOES INFLUENCE PROLIFERATION BUT NOT MIGRATION IN HUMAN GLIOBLASTOMAS IN VITRO N.J. Hopf, J. Huber, D. Koch, Universit&t (Mainz) Objective: Temozolomide a well tolerated and effective chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of recurrent glioblastomas. It has been shown, that Temozolomide results in reduction of tumor cell proliferation. However, it's effect on tumor cell migration in human gliomas is still unkown. Methods: We analyzed different proliferation parameters (proliferation index, duration of mitosis) as well as migration parameters (migration velocity, migration index, migration path) in two established cell lines (Mz-18, G-168) and 5 primary cultures of human glioblastomas under the influence of Temozolomide using the ,,time- lapse individual cell migration-assay\" (TIM-assay). Temozolomide was used in concentrations of 4, 12.5 and 100 IJg/ml. Results: In 3 of 5 primary cultures and 1 of 2 cell lines, we found a dose- dependant reduction of cell proliferation with a mean proliferation index of 67% without treatment, 57% adding 4 IJg/ml, and 36,5% 100 IJg/ml Temozolomide. In the remaining cultures, an antiproliferative effect could only be seen with the maximal concentration of 100 pg/ml Temozolomide. None of the tumor cultures showed a significant influence of Temozolomide on the migration activity with a mean migration velocity of 11 IJm/ h and a migration index of 98,6 % without treatment compared to 12,4 pm/h and 100% adding 100 pg/ml Temozolomide. Conclusions: The TIM-assay provides a differentiated analysis of the influence of Temozolomide on proliferation and migration activity. Treatment with Temozolomide resulted in the majority of cultures in a dose-dependant reduction of tumor cell proliferation, whereas any kind of influence on cell migration could not be detected in vitro. Poster P485 LONG-TERM RESULTS AFTER FRACTIONATED STEREOTACTIC RADIATION THERAPY IN C. Plathow, J. Debus, DKFZ-Heidelberg, Heidelberg (Heidelberg) Purpose: To evaluate outcome after fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSR1O of patients with astrocytoma WHO II in terms of Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS), quality of life and prognostic factors. Materials and methods: Between 1984 and 2000, 143 patients with supratentorial astrocytoma WHO II have been treated with FSRT. 87 patients (61%) received FSRT immediately after stereotactically guided biopsy or surgery. 56 patients (39%) received RT secondarily at the time of relapse after primary surgery. Median age was 40.5 years. 61.6% were male and 38.4% female. All patients had 3D treatment planning. The median prescribed tumor dose was 57 Gy. PFS and OS rates were calculated using the Kaplan Meier method. The evaluation of quality of life was based on neurological examinations and Karnofsky Performence Score (KPS). Univariate and multivariate analysis have been on 12 potential prognosticators. Results: Median follow-up was 38,9 months. Median progression-free survival was 37 months. 61% (n=87) of the patients developped a relapse, in 90.6% located in the high-dose area. There were 2 peaks of relapse (after 1,5 years and 4 years). Overall survival was 50% after 8 years, respectively. 88% of the patients showed improvement of clinical symptoms after FSRT. There was no significant dose-response-relationship for tumor-control found in patients with doses of 54 Gy and those treated with doses exceeding 54 Gy. However toxicity was increased in patients treated with doses exceeding 54 Gy. Toxicity was mild with 97 % of patients developping <= WHO grade II toxicity. KM-enhancement before RT was identified as significant prognostic factor for PFS and OS in univariate and multivariate analysis (p<0,01). Clinical symptoms, sex, T-staging, tumor size, extent of resection, timing of RT and KPS did not influence outcome significantly. Conclusion: FSRT is an effective therapy option for grade II gliomas with a median PFS of 37 months and an OS of 50% after 8 years, respectively. Toxicity is mild, clinical improvement was observed in 88% of the patients. Despite the majority of patients recurred within the high-dose volume, Tumor doses exceeding 54 Gy did not improve outcome but enhanced toxicity considerably. KM-enhancement before RT was the only variable found to be an important prognosticator. Ongoing studies are aiming to identify prognostic factors to select patients who benefit from dose escalation. P486 MULTIMODAL THERAPY OF ELDERY PATIENTS WITH GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME Doerner-Fazeny, M Veitl, K. Ungersb6ck, T. Czech, K. R6ssler, M. Killer, D. C. evaluated our current treatment practice in older adult patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) regarding feasibility, toxicity and survival duration. Patients and Methods: 100 consecutive patients with primary GBM aged from 55 to 83 years (median 65 years) were treated in our institution since November 1994. All patients underwent surgical intervention (gross total resection: n= 31, subtotal resection: n= 39, were offered radiotherapy and concomitant nitrosourea-based chemotherapy. Results: 88 patients completed radiotherapy with 66 Gy. The patients received 3 cycles of first-line chemotherapy in median. 20 patients had second line chemotherapy after progression (1 - 9 cycles). The treatment was generally well tolerated. Chemotherapy associated toxicity was more pronounced in females than in males. The median overall survival was 10.6 months. Patients with a Kamovsky performance score (KI) between 90 - 100% had a median survival of 19,8 months (p<0.0001), between 70 - 80% 9,1 months and with a performance S 96 Central Nervous SystemTumors score of 60% 5,05 months (p<0.0018). In multivariate analysis including patients'age and KI, only patients'age remained an independent prognostic factor. Conclusion: A multimodal treatment concept including concomitant radio- and chemotherapy appears feasible even in older adult patients with GBM. P487 RESULTS OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL STEREOTACTICALLY-GUIDED RADIO- (Heidelberg) survival rates and side effects after stereotactically-guided radiotherapy in patients with recurrent medulloblastoma. Methods and Materials: Between 1992 and 2000, 20 patients (6 patients <=14 years) with 29 radiological manifestations of recurrent medulloblastoma of the brain were treated with stereotactically-guided radiotherapy. The median age was 16 years (5-44 years). Six patients had desmoplatic and fourteen undifferentiated medulloblastoma. All patients had prior cranio-spinal radiotherapy plus a boost to the posterior fossa with dose of 54 Gy. Time to recurrence was 33 months mean. Eighteen of twenty-nine lesions were located within the boost volume. Eight of the recurrent lesions were treated by radiosurgery and 21 lesions by fractionated stereotactically-guided radiotherapy (FSRT). Chemotherapy was given according to the protocol of the HIT89/91, HIT-SK92 or HIT2000 study in all patients. Mean total dose for re-irradiation was 24Gy for FSRT, and 15Gy was months. Follow-up included CT/ MRI and clinical examinations. Results: Overall local tumor control was 89.6% (26/29 lesions). Thirteen recurrences showed a partial or complete remission based on CT/MRI, while also 13 had no change. Three lesions (10.3%) showed tumor progression 5 months mean after radiotherapy. Five patients received another chemotherapy after radiotherapy. One patient had a partial response (50% tumor volume reduction in MRI), four no response to chemotherapy. A multilocally intracranial progression of disease was seen in nine patients (45%), five patients (25%) developed additional spinal metastases. Thirteen patients died with disseminated cranio-spinal progression of disease, after 72.6 months median (25.3-152 months). No chronic side effects >CTC II \u00b0 were seen after radiotherapy. None of the patients developed brain radienecrosis. Conclusion: Stereotactically-guided radiotherapy is effective and safe in the treatment of recurrent medulloblastoma to improve local control with no evident side effects. The main problem in the treatment of recurrent medulloblastoma remains the control of subclinical cranio-spinal dissemination. P488 THE SONIC HEDGEHOG/PATCHED SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAY IN HUMAN MEDULLOBLASTOMAS: STRONG EVIDENCE OF VARIANTS DERIVED FROM DISTINCT CEREBELLAR PRECURSOR CELLS R. Przkora, J. Buehren, U. Bolder, K. W. Jauch, F. Berthold, J. Term, N. S6rensen, O. D. W(Jrzburg) Medulloblastomas (MBs) represent the most frequent malignant brain tumor in childhood. MBs express markers of CNS progenitor cell lines indicating distinct stages of differentiation and origin. Genetic data provide evidence of MBs derived from distinct cerebellar progenitor cells. Allelie loss and / or inactivating mutations of the PTCH gene have been identified in desmoplastic MBs (dMBs). The Patched receptor is bound by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and controls the activity of an associated membran signalling protein, smoothened (Smoh). Activating mutations in both genes have been described in basal cell carcinomas. We therefore investigated the PTCH-associated genes for alterations in a large series of human MBs. SMOH and SHH were screened for mutations via SSCP-analysis in 91 tumors. Additionally, the mRNA expression of the SHH, SMOH and PTCH genes as well as GLI1 as target was analyzed with a competitive RT-PCR assay in 42 biopsies, including adult and fetal cerebellar tissues. Additionally, SHH was studied by immunhistochemistry. We detected a point mutation of the SHH gene in exon 1 (amino acid substitution) in a dMB and a SMOH germline mutation in exert 12 (amino acid deletion) in a classic MB (cMB). Most of the tumor samples including the cerebellar tissues showed a RT-PCR signal for PTCH, SMOH and GLI1, whereas SHH was only detectable in one dMB, 5 cMBs and none of the controls. PTCH significant histological subtype, we found a significant coexpression of the target GLI1 and the p=0.525, Spearman). GLI1 significantly higher in desmoplastic MBs with p=0.00002 (Kruskal-Wallis). Our results indicate that mutations of the SHH and SMOH genes do not significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of MBs. in contrast, the mRNA expression pattern in the desmoplastic variant indicate a functional activation of this signalling pathway by autocrine stimulation. The predominace of GLI1 expression and PTCH mutations in desmoplastic MB and studies in ptc+/- MB bearing mice supports the hypothesis that this type of MB is derived from external granule cell progenitors which use Shh as mitogen. Additional findings like the expression of external granule cell lineage markers such as HATH and p75NTR in desmoplastic MBs support our hypothesis. P489 13-CIS-RETINOID ACID AS A NEW TREATMENT STRATEGY IN PATIENTS WITH HIGH-GRADE GLIOMA WHO SHOW STABLE DISEASE AFTER FIRST- LINE TREATMENT C. Wismeth, P. Hau, K. high-dose 13-cis retinoic acid (RCA) as a maintainance therapy in patients with high-grade glioma (WHO grade III and IV) who have complete response after first-line therapy. Background: Despite combined treatment with neurosurgery, radio- and chemotherapy, most patients with malignant glioma have a unfavorable prognosis due to rapid tumor progression. Patients who have stable disease after first-line therapy without evidence of tumor in neuroimaging (MRI) usually do not receive any treatment until evidence of tumor recurrence. Furthermore, efficacy of 2nd line chemotherapy in recurrent glioma is still low. According to in vitro studies, RCA is able to induce cell differentiation in glioma. Moreover, in a recent phase-II trial of patients with progressive high-grade glioma, high-dose RCA stabilized tumor growth. Methods: We therefore designed a prospective single-arm phase-II study. Patients who are tumor-free after combined first-line therapy are treated with RCA 60 mg/m2 BS day 1 to 21 in 28 days with dose escalation up to 100 rag/m2 BS until progression of tumor. Clinical controls are performed every 4 weeks, MRI every 8 weeks. Results: Until now, 16 patients (8 with grade-IV, and 8 with grade-Ill tumors) have been included. Treatment has been well tolerated with moderate erythema and cheilosis in all patients and Sicca syndrome in some patients being the major side effects so far. Therapy was stopped in one patient due to intolerable erythema. No dose limiting side effects like intolerable increases in transaminases or lipids were observed. Some patients reported ache in the muscles and distal joints. 15 patients (2 GBM, 6 grade-Ill) sustained stable disease for at least 12 weeks and up to 37 weeks in a patient with glioblastoma and 105 weeks in a patient with anaplastic astrocytoma. Only one patient with glioblastoma progressed early within the first cycle of therapy. Discussion: Maintainance therapy with high-dose RCA is well tolerated and is feasable over long periods. To evaluate efficacy, a randomized study with a treatment arm with RCA and an observation arm without treatment has to be initiated. We think, that a multicenter study is warranted in order to proof efficacy of this approach using progression free survival and toxicity as endpoints. P490 DNA TOPOISOMERASE II-ALPHA EXPRESSION IN DIFFERENT HISTOLOGIC TYPES OF BRAIN TUMOR M. Bredel, M. Piribauer, I. Pollack, I. Pollack, B. Gatterbauer, I. Slavc, R Birner, C. Marosi, R. Hamilton, T. Czech, C. is a novel marker of cell cycle turnover and, besides, a known determinant of response to TII-targeting chemotherapy. Methods: Our present study examined immunohistochemically TII-a expression in a series of 327 pediatric and adult brain tumor specimens - consisting of 114 adult glioblastomas (aGBMs), 17 pediatric malignant non- brainstem gliomas pathway (aODGs), and 82 pediatric ependymomas (pEPs) - and correlated the expression with clinical variables, outcome, and MIB-1 proliferation index. Results: TII-a expression extended over a wide range in each of the histologic subgroups (0-87.2%). The median labeling indices (Lls) were determined to be 25.6, 19.1, 3.6, 6.1, and 19.8 for aGBM, pMNBG, pOPG, aODG, and pEP, respectively. In all types of brain tumor examined, TII-a expression correlated closely with MIB-1 LI (P <0.001, Spearman's coefficient of correlation). For aGBM, survival analysis disclosed a striking association between TII-a and patient outcome such that the lower the expression, the worse the outcome (cut-off Lh 26%, P = 0.040, log-rank test). In the pMNBG cohort, TII-a expression was found to be directly related to progression-free and overall survival with a cut-off LI of 12, defining two prognostic subgroups (P = 0.022 and P = 0.022, respectively, Cox regression). In pOPGs, TII-a expression (cut-off Lh 4.0%) was significantly linked to patient age (cut-off age: 3.0 years) with higher levels of TII-a being present in young children. Conclusion: Findings of note of the current study included Tll-a as an important prognosticator being directly related to patient outcome in aGBMs receiving adjuvant radiochemotherapy, implying that tumors with a high cell-cycle turnover may particularly benefit from intense adjuvant treatment. The observation of an inverse association between TII-a and progression-free and overall survival in pMNBGs suggests this marker may complement the information obtained by tumor morphology as a means for improving the accuracy of predicting patient prognosis. The widely varying expression levels of TII-a in brain tumors suggest this enzyme to be used for targeted selection of patients for TII-interfering chemotherapy. Considering the enhanced TII-a expression in pOPG patients <3.0 years of age such a chemotherapy may be of particular benefit to young children, allowing postponement of irradiation. S 97 Central Nervous System Tumors P491 LIPOSOMAL DOXORUBICIN WITH AND WITHOUT TAMOXIFEN IN THE SALVAGE TREATMENT OF HIGH GRADE GLIOMA - A PHASE-II STUDY P. Hau, J. Dietrich, K. Fabel, U. Baumgart, O. Grauer, T. Jauch, A. chemotherapeutic agents and poor blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration are major obstacles in the treatment of malignant glioma. Doxorubicin is known to be effective in high-grade glioma cell lines and was shown to cross BBB in a liposomal encapsulated formulation (Caelyx\u00ae, CAE). In two subsequent phase II-studies, CAE was administered as a single agent or in combination with Tamoxifen (TAM) as a chemosensitizer in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. Methods: Applying an intention-to-treat design, 40 patients with recurrent high-grade glioma (grade IV, n = 28; grade III, n = 12) were included in both studies and treated with intravenous CAE 20 mg/sqm BS every two weeks (20 patients) and, in the second study, with CAE plus oral TAM in a continuous daily dose of 480 mg (20 patients). Every 6 weeks, response was evaluated clinically and by use of MRI. Results: The single agent regimen and the combination therapy were equally well tolerated, with major side effects being palmaroplantar erythrodysesthesia in 17/40 patients and myelosuppression (WHO grade III) in 10/ 40 patients. Cardiac toxicity has not been observed so far. TAM was very well tolerated even in this high doses without significant liver toxicity and with deep venous thrombosis in a single patient. In both regimens together, 16/40 (40%) patients showed objective responses with partial response in 2/40 and disease stabilization in 14/40 patients. Response rates in the CAE regimen (45%) vs. the CAE/TAM regimen (35%) were significantly different, but in the latter regimen, 16 patients had grade IV tumors in comparison to 11 in the CAE regimen. Median overall survival after initiation of salvage therapy was 32 weeks for CAE and 24 weeks for CAE/TAM, or 28 weeks for grade-IV and 24 weeks for grade-Ill, respectively. Discussion: Single agent therapy with CAE and the combination of CAE and TAM appear to have similar moderate activity in heavily pretreated patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. Both regimens are save concerning myelotoxicity, skin toxicity and cardiac complications. Median overall survival after initiation of salvage chemotherapy was equal to the results of a metaanalysis of eight phase-II studies in relapsed high grade glioma published earlier, which were considered being successful approaches in this setting. P492 A NETWORK FOR GLIOMA PATIENTS AND THEIR RELATIVES- AN ANALYSIS OF 1643 E-MAILS FROM A BRAIN TUMOR MAILING LIST. K. Mursch, H. Schiefer, K61n) Objective: The internet has become an important source of information about diseases and their treatment. In addition, it enables patients and their relatives to communicate and exchange information in discussion groups. Aim of this study was to evaluate their requirements and interests. Methods: 1643 consecutive e-mails from a german internet discussion group focussing on gliomas (Hirntumorliste) were analysed and grouped into special topics. Every mail sent to this list is distributed to about 350 members, mostly patients and their relatives. Results: Most mails (18%) dealt with alternative treatments and additional therapies, such as boswellia, vitamins, vaccinations etc. Others dealt with the presentation of the own case and questions about unclear symptoms (10%). About ten percent were used for organisation of self-help and distribution of medical knowledge, about 8 % for personal contact and emotional support. Frequent topics were chemotherapy, dexamethasone, current studies, radiation therapies, and PET. Criticism concerning physicians was few, mostly about lack of empathy, little knowledge about alternative therapies and communication deficits. Conclusion: This analysis reveals an immense and sometimes underestimated need for various information in patients harbouring gliomas and their relatives. Discussion groups provide lots of help and may gain growing influence on the patients attitude towards therapies and physicians. P493 COMBINED TREATMENT WITH ORAL TEMOZOLOMIDE AND RADIOTHERAPY FOR PREVIOUSLY IRRADIATED, RECURRENT MALIGNANT BRAIN TUMORS of all patients with malignant brain tumors suffer from a recurrence inside the initial irradiation portals. Survival times are usually short with considerably lowered quality of life. in the context of a phase 1/11 study, we analyzed the effect of a re-irradiation treatment with sequential application of temozolemide. Material and methods: From 6/2000 to 6/2001, 10 patients received re-treatment for inoperable in-field recurrences of malignant gliomas. Treatment consisted of a sequential radiochemotherapy. Chemotherapy was carried out on five successive days (Monday-Friday) with 200 mg/m 2 temozolomide as an oral application. Cycles were repeated every 4 weeks (day 1, day 29, day 57, etc.). Between the first two chemotherapy cycles, radiotherapy with 30 Gy (5 x 2 Gy) over 3 weeks was interposed. Results: Median time between primary irradiation and re-irradiation was 8.6 months (6-38 months). All patients were able to finish radiotherapy without any relevant side effects. 7/10 patients have already died from their tumor after 1 to 5 months (median 3.2 months). 3/10 patients are still alive after 3.9, 6.0 and 10 months. Acute and late radiation side effects > grade II were not observed. Conclusion: Even if the number of patients is still quite low, the presented treatment regimen seems to be a feasible and well tolerated combination. P494 PRIMARY GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME - COMBINED TREATMENT MODAL- ITY Klinik the prognosis of patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme is very poor, the benefit of a postoperative radiotherapy is known. Therefore, we treated our patients with a fractionated 3D-conformal radiotherapy. As temozolomide (Temodal) showed already its effect on recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme, we wanted in addition to prove the safety and efficacy of a simultaneous radiochemotherapy for newly diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme. Methods and Materials: Since 1999 we treated 40 patients with the histological diagnosis Glioblastoma Multiforme. The median age was 61 years (30-70 years), the median Karnofsky Performance Scale Index 80 % (50-100 %). 17 patients received a biopsy, in 13 patients the resection was macroscopically incomplete and 10 patients had undergone complete resection. After treatment planning in individual mask-fixation, we delivered in a 5 days/week schedule a total dose of 60 Gy with daily doses of 2 Gy, using 6 MV photons. Simultaneously, the oral cytotoxic agent temozolomide was given in a dose of 50 mg/m 2 (median dose/day 100mg). Results: Median actuarial progression free survival is 10 months. The main toxicity during the combined therapy was a moderate nausea in 25 % of the patients. Under treatment myelosuppression grade I was found and - in one case - posttherapeutical leucopenia grade IV. Most of the patients (92 %) experienced a stable or improved neurological status. In almost 65 % of the patients hospitalisation could at least partially be avoided. At a median follow-up of 9 months (0 - 29 months) the actuarial 1-year-survival is 85 %. Conclusions: The combination of fractionated turnout conformal radiotherapy and simultaneously applicated chemotherapy with temozolomide is a feasible, well tolerated and safe treatment modality for patients with Glieblastoma Multiforme. No clinically relevant toxicity was observed and so a reduction of the applicated chemotherapy dose was not necessary. Further on, hospitalisation could be avoided in the majority of the cases. Long-term results remain to be seen. Nevertheless randomised studies should be aspired. P495 MODULATION OF EGF-RECEPTOR SIGNALING BY SETA M.H.H. Schmidt, S. Lipkowitz, O. Bogler, Henry Ford Hospital, (Detroit, Bethesda, USA) SETA (SH3-encoding, expressed in tumorigenic astrocytes; also known as CIN85 and Ruk) belongs to a new family of adaptor molecules, which includes CD2AP/ CMS. SETA expression is associated with malignant transformat~n of astrocytes in the adult brain, but is also found in other tissues including strong expression in lymphocytes. SETA shows a modular structure consisting of three N-terminal SH3 domains followed by a PxxP-rich region and a C-terminal coiled coil. Yeast two- hybrid screens revealed interactions with a novel regulator of apoptosis, ALP1. SETA was also shown to interact with the proto-oncegene c-cbl, and its family members cbl-b and cbl-3, via most N-terminal SH3-domain. through site receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Their function as E3 proteins in the ubiquitination of proteins is mediated by a RING-finger domain. In the case of the EGFR ubiquitination is followed by the internalization and very likely degradation of the receptor. Disruption of the RING-finger domain results in oncogenic transformation of cbl. C-cbl and cbl-b interact with including proto-oncogene src and p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase. In light of the importance of EGFR signaling in glioma, and the impli- cation of SETA in astrocytic transformation, we have been investigating the interaction between SETA, cbl proteins and EGFR. Ce-transfection studies of several SETA isoforms together with the three human proteins c-cbl, cbl-b and cbl-3 as well as wild-type and the constitutively active delta EGFR have been performed in 293 cells as well as in brain tumor cell lines. The effect of SETA on the ability of various cbl proteins to ubiquitinate the EGFR will be reported. Our data show that SETA has a strong influence on the function of cbl as a ubiquitin- ligase and therefore on the lifecycle of the EGF-receptor itself. Overexpression of SETA can reduce the level of EGFR-ubiquitination and so presumably prolong the signal. Additionally, the ability of SETA to modulate the activity of other signaling molecules downstream of the EGFR is being investigated, in order to determine whether it modifies the whole EGFR signal cascade. P496 GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME - CLINICAL FEATURES, OUTCOME AND PROGNOSTIC FACTORS IN 222 PATIENTS A.M. Stark, A. malignant and most frequent glial tumor in adults, it is characterized by diffuse infiltration of the brain. Multi- modal standard therapy including microneurosurgery including neuronavigation and radiotherapy is avialable, though, the prognosis remains dismal. Methods: From 1990 to 2000, 222 patients underwent craniotomy for newly- S 98 Central Nervous SystemTumors diagnosed GBM at our department. The male:female ration was 1,02:1, the median age was 58 years [range 1 to 85 years]. All patients of this unselected consecutive series were diagnosed to suffer from GBM (WHO grade IV). Charts and radiographic images Results: The majority of patients presented with tumors involving more than one cerebral lobe (45,9%). The second common location was the temporal lobe (22,1%) followed by (2,7%). infratentorially. Patients (11,7%) presented with multifocal GBM. 193 Patients (86,9%) received postoperative radiation therapy, chemotherapy was applied in 42 cases (18,9%). During the follow-up, cranial ,,metastases\" were detected in 4 cases (1,8%), spinal metastases in two cases (0,9%). The mean survival time was 46,4 weeks [range: 1 to 304 weeks]. The mean Ki67/MIB 1 estimated proliferation index was 25% [range: <5 to 80 %]. In 143 cases, immunohistochemical staining for P53, Mdm2 and EGFR was compared to the total survival time. Thus, P53 Protein expression and Mdrn2 negativity were significantly associated with prolonged survival (p=O,017; p=0,039). Conclusion: Glioblastoma multiforme remains the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with brain tumors. Despite the uniform histological appearance of GBM the clinical course of these patients differs significantly. However the P53 pathway seems to have impact on survival and serves as a predictive marker. P497 PREVENTION OF IRRADIATION-INDUCED GLIOMA CELL INVASION BY TEMOZOLOMIDE: INVOLVEMENT OF CASPASE 3 AND FOCAL ADHESION KINASE W. Schulz, M. Weller, T~bingen (T0bingen) Sublethal doses of irradiation enhance the invasiveness of human malignant glioma cells. This effect of irradiation can be inhibited by subtoxic concentrations temozolomide, a novel alkylating chemotherapeutic agent with clinical activity against glioma, nitrosourea, Iomustine (CCNU). Antagonising of motility metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and adhesion (FAK) activation by phosphorylation whereas temozo]omide promoted FAK cleavage irrespective of irradiation. Inhibition of caspases prevented temezolemide-induced FAK processing and restored the promigratory effect of irradiation, suggesting that the resistance of glioma cells to irradiation-induced caspase processing may determine the migratory and invasive responses of glioma cells to irradiation. To find out whether the activation of caspases by a toxic stimulus determines the effect on motility, DAOY medulloblastoma cells that undergo apoptosis in response to irradiation have been irradiated. Irradiation results in concentration dependent cell death with caspase 3 and FAK cleavage and reduction of MMP-2 expression without additio- nal effects on motility. Collectively, these data suggest that combined radiochemotherapy with temozolomide may represent a therapeutic approach that improves the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy for malignant glioma by reducing the irradiation-induced tumor cell dissemination and by the induction of apoptosis. P498 GLIOMATOSIS CEREBRh Felsberg, W. K0ker, The diagnosis of gliomatosis cerebri is commonly made by MRI demonstration of disseminated disease affecting more than 2 lobes of the brain and histological verification of neoplastic glial proliferation. The molecular genetic and clinical features of gliomatosis cerebri have so far not been clearly defined, and the relation of gliematosis cerebri to solid WHO grade II and III astrocytomas has remained obscure. Here, we report histological, molecular genetic and neuroradiological features as well as clinical course and response to therapy in a series of 13 patients with gliomatosis cerebri. The median age at diagnosis was 46 years (range: 19-75 years). The focal lesions available for histological work-up showed WHO grade II astrocytoma (n=2), WHO oligoaetrocytoma (n=l), WHO with vascular proliferation and necrosis (n=2). Molecular genetic alterations included p53 mutations (3/7), PTEN mutation EGFR overexpression (1/7), but neither CDK4 nor CDKN2A/p16 loss. of 13 patients received radiotherapy (whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) or involved field radiotherapy) as first- or second-line therapy. Three of 10 patients, all of them receiving WBRT, showed partial response (n=l) or stable disease (n=2) lasting at least for 1 year. Four of 6 patients responded to PCV chemotherapy (CCNU, procarbacine, vincristine) as first- or second-line therapy with partial remission (n=l), minor response (n=2) or stable disease (n=l). The patient with partial response after PCV chemotherapy had an eligoastrocytic histology. None of three patients responded to temozolomide chemotherapy. The median survival from MRI-based diagnosis was 14 months (range: 4-91+ months), Infratenterial involvement was associated with poor survival. This series includes one patient with non-progressive asymptomatic lesions on MRI for more than 7 years until a histological diagnosis was made. We conclude that: (i) the molecular genetic alterations in gliomatosis cerebri resemble those found in low-grade gliomas or high-grade gliomas which have developed from low-grade gliomas; (ii) the course of gliomatosis cerebri is highly variable, but for at least 50% is as poor as for patients with glioblastoma; and (iii) some patients with gliomatosis cerebri may respond to WBRT and PCV chemotherapy. P499 TGF-BETA IN GLIOBLASTOMA: in T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. TGF-beta is thought to be a key cytokine responsible for this immunosuppression induced by gliema cells. Neutralization of TGF-beta results in immune-mediated regression of experimental gliomas in various animal models. TGF-beta is synthesized as a pro-peptide and activation of TGF-beta depends on cleavage by proprotein cenvertases such as furin. We show here that human glioblastoma cells express furin, exhibit furin-like protein (FLP) enzyme activity and release active furin into the cell supernatant. Inhibition of furin by peptide inhibitor dec-RVKR-cmk of pro-TGF-beta of TGF-beta bioactivity in the supernatant of glioblastoma cells. Gene transfer of alphal-PDX, a synthetic antitrypsin analog which irreversibly complexes furin, in glioblastorna cells inhibits activity and activation of TGF-beta. Furin and furin-like convertases may thus represent a novel target for the immunotherapy of malignant glioma and other cancers. P500 ANALYSIS OF THE HUMAN LIVER/BONE/KIDNEY TYPE ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE GENE MENINGIOMAS Saarlandes (Homburg) The usually benign meningioma is the most frequent tumor of neuroectodermal origin in humans. Only a minority of cases show progression to an intermediate type or anaplastic tumor (WHO grade II and III). Cytogenetically WHO grade I tumors show either uniform monosomy 22 or a diploid karyotype. Structural aberrations are infrequent, except for the loss of the short arm of chromosome 1, which appears to be the decisive step for progression. Comparative histochemical and molecular cytogenetic studies point to the tissue-unspecific alkaline phosphatase gene (liver/bone/kidney type) located on 1p36.1-p34 as a candidate tumor suppressor gene. The inactivation of the enzyme (EC 3.1.3.1) encoded by this gene is correlated with the progression of meningiomas. However with loss of the short arm of one chromosome 1 there is still one chromosome 1 left. With immunological and histochemical methods, neither the enzyme itself nor enzyme activity is detectable. It would be possible that the remaining gene for alkaline phosphatase is mutated so that the translated enzyme is inactive. For the liver/ bone/kidney type alkaline phosphatase gene there are two promotors known. The translated proteins are the same but the RNAs differ in the first exon. This difference is due to an alternative splicing mechanism. These two axons 1 are called exon 1L (L for liver) or exon 1B (B for bone). In our study we determined which of these two first exons is expressed in meningioma cells. Furthermore we searched for mutations in the RNA transcript of the alkaline phosphatase gene in meningiomas. For our studies we used RNA of primary human cells from different meningiomas. After reverse transcription, PCR with exon-specific primers was performed in order to determine which exon 1 is transcribed. For the mutation analysis alkaline phosphatase primer were used in the PCR. All PCR products were cloned and sequenced. For the study we chose meningiomas who had no chromosome 1 lost and meningiomas with loss of the short arm of one chromosome 1. When RNA for alkaline phosphatase was found there was only the exon 1B transcribed. The meningiomas so far investigated did not show mutations. We found variations which are already described in human genome databases. The loss of the alkaline phosphataee activity in meningioma is not due to mutations in the RNA transcript. The regulation of the alkaline phosphatase seems to be more complex and has to be elucidated. P501 ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY WITH TEMOZOLOMIDE IN HIGH GRADE GLIOMAS L-A. Koennecke, M. Leimert, Th. Funk, Klinikum Frankfurt (Oder) (Frankfurt (Oder)) Objective: Evaluation of safety and efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy with temozelomide (TMZ) in patients with histologically confirmed high grade glioma in addition to standard therapy with tumor resection and radiotherapy. Methods: TMZ therapy was started three weeks after surgical resection and radiotherapy in patients with supratentorial high grade glioma (anaplastic astrozytoma and glioblastoma multiforme, WHO grade III and IV). Inclusion criteria were age > 18 and and < 75 years, a Kamofsky score i'Y' 70, platelets > 150K/',il and WBC > 3,6K/',[1. TMZ was given 200 mg/m2 over five days every 28 days. Recurrent tumors were resected if possible. Clinical evaluation and blood count (WBC and platelets) were performed every four weeks, MRI follow-up every three months. Results: 14 patients (age 40 to 73) were so far enrolled in the study. Histological diagnosis at first surgery was a grade III tumor in eight and a grade IV tumor in six S 99 Central Nervous System Tumors patients. The observation period is 2 to 30 months (median 15 months) at this time. Six patients have undergone surgery for recurrent tumor. 9 out of 14 patients are still alive after 12 to 30 months (median 17 months). Four patients died after 14 to18 months, one patient died two months after surgery. The Karnofsky score had improved in ten patients after 12 months of therapy and remained stable in three patients. A severe side effect was agranulocytosis and thromobozytopenia in one patient, who died two months after surgery, during the first cycle of chemotherapy. Other side effects were moderate nausea and vomiting in most patients, which were controllable by anti-emetics. Conclusion: Adjuvant chemotherapy with TMZ in patients with high grade glioma after tumor resection and radiotherapy may extend time of survival compared to conventional therapy, while Kamofsky score improves or remains stable after 12 months of therapy. WBC and platelets have to be monitored carefully, other side effects are controllable. P502 THE ROLE OF THE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR ETS-1 IN GLIOMA CELL INVASION S. A. Kuhn, I. Fichtner, H. Kettenmann, Max-DelbriJck-Center (Berlin) The oncogene and transcription factor ETS-1 is expressed in endothelial cells either during development or, in the adult, in pathologic tissues. It has become evident that ETS-1 expression correlates with the growth of blood vessels. We now report that ETS-1 is expressed in brain tumor tissue as revealed by immunocytoohemistry on samples from human brain tumor resection. In contrast, ETS-1 could not be detected in normal brain tissue from human, mouse or rat. ETS-1 immunoreactivity could also be detected in tumor cell lines. It was interesting to note that the expression was more prominent in isolated cells as compared to cells forming a confluent layer indicating that cell-cell contact or cell density down-regulated ETS-1 expression. Moreover, astrocytes in culture, but not in situ, also express ETS-I. To study how the brain environment influences the expression of ETS-1 in glioma cells we used an experimental animal model for tumorigenesis. The human glioblastoma cell line U373MG was labelled by transfection with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and inoculated into nude mice. The animals were sacrificed after 35 days; the tumor cells could be easily recognized by their EGFP-fluorescence. ETS-1 expression showed a striking pattern: while the central tumor mass did not express detectable amounts of the transcription factor, the antigen against ETS-1 could be recognized at the tumor border, I. e. at the location where tumor cells were in contact with the brain cells. Moreover, the intrinsic brain cells in the vicinity with the tumor cells also expressed ETS-1. In the search for candidate molecules to regulate ETS-1 expression, we studied the effect of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), an important modulator of cell growth and differentiation in the CNS under both physiological and pathological conditions. When applied to glioma cells or astrocytes in culture the presence of FGF-2 (20 ng/ml) triggered the upregulation of ETS-1 expression. Since ETS-1 regulates the expression of factors, which influence invasion of cells such as metalloproteinases, growth factors or integrins, the expression of ETS-1 in glioma growth could indicate an infiltrative state of the tumor cell and thus be a marker of invasive glioma cells. Supported by Sonderforschungsbereich 507 P503 RESULTS OF RADIOTHERAPY FOR GLIOBLASTOMA patients with glioblastoma after radiotherapy with various fractionation schedules. Patients and Methods: The records of 345 patients with glioblastoma having been treated in the time interval October 1983 to July 2001 were reviewed. All had a histologically confirmed glioblastoma. The mean age at the beginning of radiotherapy was 58 years, the mean Karnofsky performance index was 66%. 166 patients (48%) had been operated on before radiotherapy, 179 (52%) had not. Radiotherapy was performed using the following fractionation schedules: 1. Hyperfractionated radiotherapy. Two fractions of 1.0 Gy daily up to a total dose of 70 Gy (21 pats) 2. Hyperfracionated radiotherapy: Two fractions of 1.3 Gy daily up to a total dose of 78 Gy (32 pats) 3. Hyperfractionated radiotherapy: Two fractionts of 1.3 Gy daily up to a total dose of 45.5 Gy (35 pats) 4. Hyperfractionated-accelerated radiotherapy: Two fractionts of 1.5 Gy up to a total dose of 60 Gy (132 pats) 5. Conventionally fractionated radiotherapy: One fraction of 2.0 Gy daily up to a total dose of 60 Gy (37 pats). The target volume consisted ot the tumour and edema region including a safety margin with the exception of group 2 in which a total brain irradiation was performed up to a total dose of 46.8 Gy and then a boost to the turnout region up to 78 Gy. Results: We noticed an overall survival after 2 years of 4%, the local progression- free survival was identical. Univariately, there was a significant difference in favor of patients having been operated on compared to those having not ( 8% vs. 2%/ 2 years), a further significant advantage for younger patients (6% vs. 2%/2 years) and those with a high Karnofsky performance index (7% vs. 0%/2 years). Concerning the different fractionation schedules, the results were identical. Multivariately, age, Karnofsky performance index and surgery proved to be significant independent prognostic factors, but not the kind of fractionation. Conclusion: We did not see any measurable benefit of various hyperfractionated schedules compared to a conventional one except of the fact that the radiotherapy is shorter using hyperfractionatien which may be adequate having in mind the very limited life span ot those patients. Prognostically important were age, Karnofsky performance index and the resection of the turnout. P504 RADIOCHEMOTHERAPY FOR GLIOBLASTOMA improve the prognosis of patients with glioblastoma, several efforts have been made to combine postoperative radiotherapy with additional chemotherapy. In order to reduce treatment time, hyperfractionated-accelerated schedules have been introduced. Aim of our investigation is the evaluation of these treatment options. Method: 28 patients with Kamofsky performance status 90 or postoperative radiotherapy for histologically proven or hyperfractionated radiotherapy (C: 2 Gy 5 times per week to 60 Gy total dose; H: 1.6 Gy twice daily 5 times per week to 54.4 Gy). Additionally, a 21 day continuous infusion of topotecan (median dose 0.5 mg/ m2/d) was offered as chemotherapy (+ or -). Median prognostic score according to the RTOG-RPA prognosis groups was 3 for C+ (n=9), 4 for C- (n=9) and for H+ (n=10). Results: Median survival after surgery was 19.5 months for C+, 10.7 months for C- and 9.6 for H+ (p=O.034). Median survival after the end of radiotherapy was 16.8, 8.7 and 8.1 months, respectively (p=0.017). Median time to tumor recur- rence or progression was almost equal in the different groups with 7.3, 6.9 and 7.4 months. Conclusion: Survival was best in the patients receiving conventional fractionated radiotherapy plus chemotherapy, who showed, however, the best prognostic factors. Hyperfractionation did not significantly improve median survival, even if measured from the end of primary therapy. No difference was found concerning the time to tumor progression. As these results are still based on a small patient number, further evaluation should be performed. P505 COMBINED RADIO-CHEMOTHERAPY WITH TEMOZOLOMIDE (TMZ) IN PA- Wagner, K.G. Sch6nekaes, U. J. Bennts, B. Rama, F. Albert, Paracelsus-Strahlenklinik, Paracelsusklinik (OsnabrOck) 68 patients with recurrent high grade gliomas had been treated with Temodal (TMZ) + irradiation. 60 patients were eligible for retrospective evaluation. TMZ was given daily (d 1-5) and repeated every 28 days until time to progression. Following schedules: Group I: 36 patients got 200 mg/m ~ TMZ and irradiation with a dose of 30 Gy (2xl,2 Gy per day) because this group was irradiated at first line therapy with a median dose of 58 Gy. Group Ih 5 patients got 200 mg/m 2 TMZ and were irradiated with a full course of teletherapy (54-60 Gy) because this group got no prior radiation. Group II1:19 patients got only 200 mg/m 2 TMZ without irradiation. Thrombocytopenia (18 %) was the leading side effect followed by leucocytopenia (10 %) and nausea (all grade I or II CTC). There were no side effects grade Ill-IV. Quality of live was scored and was best within the group of responders (PR + MR). But even in patients with no change we found a remarkable improve in quality of live. Overall survival was best in group II (11 months) versus 8 months (group I) and 6,2 months (group III). Internal criticism:Outcome is very encouraging because only younger patients with a good Karnofsky status > 70 had been treated and most patients suffered from astrocytomas. Conclusion: Combined treatment is feasible and seems to be superior to TMZ alone in patients with status of a recurrence. P506 TEMOZOLAMIDE (TMZ) AS THERAPEUTIC OPTION IN HEAVILY PRETREATED PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC BRAIN DISEASE AND METASTASIZED SOFT TISSUE SARCOMAS M. Schroecler, M. Heinsch, C. Aul, Johannes Hospital (Duisburg) Temozolomide, an orally applicable imidazole tetrazinone, with moderate toxicity and proven CNS activity due to its ability to cross the blood brain barrier was given to 30 patients (pts) with metastatic disease to the brain by various solid tumors and pts with soft tissue sarcomas (STS) with progressive disease under conventional chemotherapy. Since 1999, we investigated the effectiveness and adverse effects of TMZ in these heavily pretreated pts with poor prognosis. Treatment schedule: TMZ was given at a dosage of 150 mg/m 2 dl-5 p. o. q 4 wk, combined with cranial irradiation in pts with inoperable or relapsed brain metastases. The number of applicated courses ranged from 1-26 (median 4). Patient characteristics: NSCLC n = 10 age 37-84 yrs Colon Cancer n = 1 age 65 yrs Breast Cancer n = 4 age 44-64 yrs Brain tumors n = 5 age 31-49 yrs S 100 Central Nervous System Tumors Melanoma n = 5 age 29-63 yrs Sarcoma n = 6 age 37-82 yrs Pretreatment: Pts with solid tumors (n = 20) and brain metastases received at least two different schedules including cisplatin (DDP), navelbine (NVB) and taxanes and in 10/20 pts radiotherapy. All pts with brain tumors were pretreated with surgery and radiotherapy. Patients with STS were pretraeted with different combinations of Adriamycin (ADM), Ifosfamide and DTIC including 1 patient with high dose chemotherapy with PBSC support. Results (CR - PR - MR/NC - PD): NSCLC: 1 - 2 - 5 - 2 Breast Cancer: 0 - 1 - 1 - 3 Melanoma: 0 - 0 - 2 - 3 Brain tumors: 1 - 0 - 2 - 2 STS: 1 - 4 - 1 - 0 Toxicity: Hematotoxicity: Hb III \u00b0 6/31, Leuco III \u00b0 8/31, PLT IV \u00b0 2/31; GIT mild, no grade II \u00b0 or more. Conclusions: TMZ was well tolerated and showed efficacy especially in pts with STS. Pts with underlying solid tumors and cerebral metastases often showed a clinical benefit and objective responses in 5/20 pts. The activity of TMZ in pts with secondary metastatic brain disease needs to be confirmed by further investigations. P507 STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY IN ESSEN - A DATABASE AS TOOL QUALITY CONTROL AND SCIENTIFIC WORKUP OF TREATMENT RESULTS M. K6rner, acceptance of stereotactic radiotherapy among referring doctors and patients, more institutions are performing stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (SRT) in Germany. of the RTOG define the dose homogeneity in stereotactic treatment planing volumes. However, no general accepted criteria exist regarding the indication and the recording of side effects, follow up and treatment outcome. We propose a common data pool open to collaborating clinics for better quality control and easier scientific work up especially in rare entities. PATIENTS & METHODS: A stereotactic treatment database was designed to collect anonymised patient data, sex and age, diagnosis, planning parameters preceding and concomitant therapy and follow up including quality of life. Special attention was set to recording op potential side effects and treatment outcome. Representative MRI scans were digitally registered. Results: A new stereotactic treatment facility was build up in in early 2000 in the AIfried-Krupp-Krankenhaus, Essen, Germany. Beginning in 5/2000 up to 11/2001 a total of 99 patients (43 F; 56 M) were treated. Of these patients 63 (63%) had SRS and 36 (36%) had SRT. Median ge was 58 (27-91) years. The diagnoses were mainly metastases and malignant brain tumors (77%) followed by benign diseases (23%), like menigeomas, arterio-venous-malformations and vestibular schwannomas. The ratio between the volume within prescribed isodoses and the target volumes were within the recommended range (RTOG-guidelines). Grade 3 and grade 4 acute and delayed side effects were seen in 4 cases (4,8% of SRS, 2,8 of SRT-treatments). Follow up is still short for most of the patients with ranges of 1 to 17 months. The presented data will be updated monthly. Conclusion: We present a new database as a tool for better quality control of stereotactic treatment according to RTOG guidelines. Regional clinics with SRS or SRT facilities are invited to contribute their own patients data. The future aim is muEi-centric quality control. Expected higher patient counts will result in earlier achieving statistical significance levels in rare entities. Common scientific work up of the participating centres is planned. P508 PHASE 1/11 TRIAL OF TOPOTECAN AND SIMULTANEOUS RADIATION IN PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME G. dose (MTD) of tepotecan continuous infusion (CIV) administered together with concomitant radiotherapy as well as the dose limiting toxicities and safety profile. Secondly, to perform a subsequent phase II trial using the recommended dose Patients and methods: A total of 20 patients was treated in this phase I trial. Twenty-one-day topotecan CIV was escalated from 0.3 mg/m2/d in increments of 0.1 mg/m2/d in cohorts of 3-6 patients until MTD was reached; simultaneous 3D- conformal radiotherapy was applied twice daily with fraction size of 1.75 Gy up to 57.75 Gy total dose. Three additional cycles of maintenance CIV topotecan chemotherapy were scheduled. A total of 16 pts were treated in the subsequent phase II trial. Results: Fifty-three courses were performed in 5 dose levels (0.3 mg/m2/d: 12 cycles, 0.4 mg/m2/d: 6 cycles, 0.5 mg/m2/d: 10 cycles, 0.6 mg/m2/d: 6 cycles, 0.7 mg/m2/d: 19 cycles). MTD was reached at dose-level 5 (0.7 mg/m2/d), because 3 of 7 patients suffered from DLT. These were febrile sinusitis, bacterial sepsis and grade 4 thrombocytopenia. No episode of grade 4 anemia occurred throughout the trial, grade 4 neutropenia was encountered in two cycles (dose levels 3 and 5). For pts in the phase II trial progression-free survival rate at six months was 58%. Conclusion: The recommended dose for phase II trials is 0.6 mg/m2/d topotecan in combination with accelerated hyperfractionated 3D-conformal radiation. TO IRRADIATION: SUCCESS- FUL TREATMENT WITH ACNU/TEMOZOLOMIDE 6 CYCLES FOLLOWED BY HYDROXYCARBAMID/IMATINIB AS A CONTINUOUS ORAL TREATMENT G. Dresemann, Franz-Hospital DOlmen (D~lmen) In 2000, May a 44 year old woman presented rapid progressive neurological symptoms at 40 gry of an ongoing irradiation therapy for a multifocal astroblastoma verified by stereotactic biopsy in 2000, March. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed rapid progression according to size and number of lesions within two weeks, ECOG performance status (PS) changed from 1 to 2. According to the dramatic progression a combination of ACNU and Temozolomide was considered to be most effective. ACNU was given in a dose of 70 mg/m2 as a 30 rain infusion on day 1 and Temozolomide as a total oral dose of 250 mg/day day 1 to 5, day 8 to 12 and day 15 to 19. This cycle was repeated on day 29 for 6 cycles. A clinical stabilisation was seen after 1 cycle, after 3 cycles criteria of partial remission were met in MRI, remaining unchanged to cycle 6, PS still was 2, main toxicity was neutropenia WHO grade 3, associated with a zoster dermatitis in cycle 3, during cycle 5 an abducens paresis occurred on the left eye. 6 months after chemotherapy an incomplete left sided hemiparesis was seen without changes in MRI. In multiple cerebral malignancies epithelial growth factor receptors (EGRF-R) were detected in the last few years. In this situation we decided to treat the patient with a combination of Hydroxicarbamid 1000 mg oral dose / day, a low toxicity single agent chemotherapy, with Imatinib 400 mg oral dose /day, e signal transduction inhibitor for EGRF-R, as a continuous treatment. The assumed mechanism of action was that Hydroxicarbamid may assist Imatinib to enter the metabolism of the brain and that Imatinib may block tumour proliferation which also is one reason for development of chemotherapy resistance. After 4 months of well tolerated treatment only abducens paresis left eye and mild motoric aphasia remained, PS was 1 and MRI could hardly detect any contrast enhancement in 2001, November. Combined treatment goes on. This therapeutic approach must be confirmed in a phase 1/11 trial. P510 ADJUVANT AND DEFINITIVE RADIOCHEMOTHERAPY WITH 60 GY LOCAL IRRADIATION AND ORAL APPLICATION OF TEMOZOLOMIDE IN PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED HIGH GRADE GLIOMA OF THE BRAIN A. N. Rahn, D. Trog, St. Mose, K. Franz, H. D. B6ttcher, J. W. Goethe-Universit~t, Universit~tsklinikum Bonn (Frankfurt am Main, Bonn) Pupose: Despite improvements of operation techniques and modern adjuvant therapy regimen high grade glioma are still a tumor entity with poor prognosis. New combined adjuvant therapy regimen may improve outcome but may also cause increased toxicity. In the presented study feasability and toxicity of adjuvant combined radiochemotherapy with Temozolomide (TMZ) and local radiotherapy in patients with high grade brain tumors was evaluated. Patients and Method: 60 Patients (19 female, 41 male) with newly diagnosed high grade brain tumors were included in the study so far. Average age was 53 years (range 27-77 years), median had total tumor exstirpations, in 36% partial resections were performed and in 32% only stereotactic biopsies were taken due to inoperable size or location of tumor. All Patients received local irradiation (60 Gy, 2 Gy daily dose) and concomitant oral chemotherapy with temozolomide (75 rag/ m 2) during the complete radiation period (including weekends). Supportive therapy included oral dexamethasone and ranitidine, additional medication according to clinical necessity. CAT and MRI were performed six weeks after therapy and every three month during follow up. Feasability, side effects of combined treatment and efficacy were evaluated. Results: 50% of patients did not show any acute toxicity (neurologic, gastrointestinal or haematologic) due to the therapy regimen. The toxcity analysis revealed one grade IV myelosuppression (CTC), without major complications and complete remission after immediate termination of oral TMZ application. In one patient TMZ was stopped because of an allergic rash possibly related to Temozolomide. Other documented side effects were grade I headache (25%), 30% grade i-II fatigue and 30% I-II grade nausea. Patients with postoperative tumor remnants according to postoperative MRI showed four partial responses in four cases and stable disease in two cases. Conclusion: Combined radiochemotherapy with temozolomide and 60 Gy local irradiation is a tolarable therapy regimen and does not show significantly increased acute CNS toxicity compared to radiotherapy alone. Nevertheless possible haematological toxicity has to be considered, blood cell count should be performed regularly to detect possible pancytopenia. P511 COMPARISON OF LUMBAR AND VENTRICULAR CEREBROSPINAL (Heidelberg) Leptomeningeal metastases (LMs) significantly affect the prognosis and treatment of patients with primary and secondary malignant CNS tumours. Cytologic examination of lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is routinely used for diagnosis of LMs. Therapy usually involves radiotherapy to symptomatic sites preceeded and/ or followed by intrathecal chemotherapy. Intrathecal chemotherapy is best delivered by an intraventricular reservoir system to achieve steady cytotoxic levels. After S 101 Central Nervous SystemTumors implantation of a Rickham or Ommaya reservoir assessment of treatment response is often only done by examination of ventricular CSF and not of lumbar CSF to avoid additional bothering of critically ill patients by lumbar puncture. We report on three patients with LMs of multiple myeloma, breast cancer, and pinealoblastoma respectively. Their symptoms consisted in headache, cranial nerve involvement and spinal symptoms. In all of them examination of lumbar CSF revealed malignant cells and an elevated protein due to disturbance of the blood-CSF-barrier. In contrast even repeated cytologic examinations of ventricular CSF could not detect any tumour cells whereas lumbar CSF remained containing malignant cells during therapy period. As CSF is regenerated by filtration of the primary CSF by ventricular plexus chorioideus and then distributed by a permanent flow through ventricle and subarachnoid space it is plausible that newly filtrated CSF which is obtained by puncture of the reservoirs is not representative for the whole CSE Malignant and inflammatory cells may be added hematogenously during circulation within the intrathecal space. In our experience analysis of ventricular CSF has high false- negative rates, and obviously is not suitable for diagnosis or therapy monitoring of LMs. Irrespectively of symptomatic sites cytologic examination of lumbar CSF is superior to cytologic examination of ventricular CSF and must be maintained as a matter of routine in diagnosis and assessment of therapy response of LMs. P512 SINGLE INSTITUTION EXPERIENCE IN THE TREATMENT OF PRIMARY CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM LYMPHOMA IN IMMUNOCOMPETENT Jena (Jena) There is controversy in the management of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCL). The poor results of radiotherapy with few long term survivors has led to the use of combining radiotherapy with chemotherapy as primary treatment modalities. Current approaches try to avoid irradiation at all. Patient selection bias may be the primary determinant of outcome in all the apparently favourable trials. We reviewed the outcome of all immunocompetent PCL patients referred to our institution in the last 8 years up to 2/2000. From 1/1994 to 2/2000 18 non immunocompromised patients were referred for radiation treatment to our institution. In 17/18 patients diagnosis was based on biopsy, in one patient on cytology from eerebmspinal fluid and on typical diagnostic imaging only. Multifocal tumor was the dominant growth pattern with only 5/18 patients showing unifocal tumor. The planned treatment dose to the whole brain was 36-45 Gy in 1.8-2 Gy fractions and the planned boost dose to the tumor site was another 10-18 Gy in 1.8-2 Gy fractions. The mean time interval between diagnosis and start of radiotherapy was 51 days. 10/18 patients had different chemotherapy regimes in addition to radiotherapy. In 6/10 patients chemotherapy was based on methotrexate (MTX). All patients had dexamethasone before or simultaneously to radiotherapy. Median age was 64 yrs and median Karnofsky status 50%. With a minimal follow up of 10 months median survival of all patients was 9.2 months and 2 yr overall survival was 17%. 7/18 patients did not complete the full course of radiation treatment because of clinical deterioration during treatment. Patients completing the planned treatment had a pre-radiation Karnofsky of 70% with a median survival of 17 months. Our single institution experience suggests that primary central nervous system lymphoma in immunocompetent patients is a clinically heterogeneous disease with a median survival of all patients not surpassing that of glioblastoma multi- forme. Pre-treatment Kamofsky state seems to be a powerful prognostic factor splitting patients widely into different prognostic groups. The discrepancy of survival times to most clinical studies can be explained by the fact that more than one third of the patients could not complete radiotherapy. Publication only P'513 TREATMENT OF GLIOBLASTOMAS AND OLIGOASTROCYTOMAS WHO III \u00b0 WITH TEMOZOLOMIDE; OUTCOME IN 12 PATIENTS M. Scheffler, M. Volz, M. M. the treatment of glioblastomas WHOIII \u00b0 is a new trial for prolongation of the survival rate and quality of life in patients suffering from these malignancies. The evaluation of an application study is intended by the documentation of the tolerabirity of the drug and the survival rate. However, these results have to abandon a claim on statistical significance, because of the sparse number of patients. Methods: During a 20-months-period (from December 1999 until October 2001) we treated 12 patients with temozolomide-10 men and 2 women. The median age was 62,45 yrs, range 41-80 yrs. Nine of the histopathological examinations pointed to glioblastoma and three showed an oligoastrocytoma WHOIII \u00b0, The patient firstly underwent a radical surgery by, as possible, preservation of the neurological function. The operation was followed by a 55 Gy-radiotherapy. The subsequent step was the temozolomide therapy, which was performed as a 28-day-cycle in accordance to producer defaults. Post-treatment evaluation of the patients were made in 3-month-sequels with support of magnetic resonance imaging (native/+ contrast media). Results: The average number of cycles was 8. In the meantime 6 of the 12 patients died. The medium rate of survivors amounted to 20,3 months. Recurrent tumors appeared averagely under temozolomide treatment after 9,7 months, in the same patient sample recurrences showed up in people not treated with temozolomide after a 6,8 - months period, One case of DVT (deep vein thrombosis) and one of wound infection were discussed as possible therapeutical complications whereas an association with temozolomide treatment is not proved. Hematological changes were not observed. Conclusion: Our therapy regimen reveals an above-average survival rate. Recurrent tumores appeared later as in patients without temozolomide treatment. The patients participating this study indicated their quaNty of life as good. We consider temozolomide as a useful supplement to existing regimens. P'514 NEOADJUVANT THERAPY WITH TEMOZOLOMIDE AND 13-CIS-RETINOIC ACID IN HIGH GRADE GLIOMA - A PHASE II-STUDY P. Hau, K. Fabel, T. of have evaluated the benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy after resection in high grade glioma (WHO grade Ill or IV). For example, Friedman et al. (1998) demonstrated a 54% progression free survival at 6 months under neoadjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide alone. Other studies have shown similar results. Nevertheless, a clear benefit concerning median time to progression or median overall survival could not be shown yet. Besides that, a phase II-study in recurrent high grade glioma published recently has shown significant benefit under combined treatment with temozolomide and 13-cis- retinoic acid (Jaeckle et aL, 2000). Patients and Methods: Therefore, we initiated a phase II-protocol with a neoadjuvant combined therapy consisting of temozolomide 200 rag/m2 BS day 1-5 in 28 days and 13-cis-retinoic acid 60 mg/m2 BS day 1- 21 in 28 days untir tumor progression. Patients were followed closely with clinical and imaging (MRI) follow up every 4 weeks. Primary end point was tumor progression. In the case of clinical or radiological relapse, a second surgery was performed, if possible, and radiotherapy was initiated. Results: Eleven patients this point. Six patients, arl with glioblastoma, are evaluable for tumor progression. They had progressive disease after 1, 1, 1, 3, 6, and 9 cycles of therapy. Of the patients with grade Ill- tumors, 2 are stable for 4 and 8 cycles of therapy now. The other patients are to early for evaluation. Conclusion: At this point, it is to early to draw any conclusions about efficacy in this phase II-trial with neoadjuvant combined chemotherapy in patients with high grade glioma. Of the patients with glioblastoma treated so far, the major part (4/6, 66%) progressed rapidly during the first 3 cycles of therapy. Nevertheless, patients with grade Ill-tumors may benefit significantly from this combined approach. P'515 TEMOZOLOMIDE MAY ACT SYNERGISTICALLY WITH IL-4 IMMUNTOXIN TREATMENT OF RECURRENT GMOMA F. Weber, F. Kloeth, B. DQsseldorf) patients which have been treated within a phase I/ll by local administration of a recombinant fusion protein which localizes a target antigen and carries a cellular toxin as Pseudomonas exotoxin A. and developed progressive disease received an additional treatment of temozolomide. Temozolomide is an oral cytotoxic agent of the imidazotetrazine class which is spontaneously converted to MTIC Methods: To assess safety, maximum tolerated dose and efficiacy of bulk flow applicated IL-4 toxin (IL-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL) treatment in patients with progres- sive local tumor relapse of supratentorial grade III or IV glioma with a maximum volume of 50 ccm after failure of tumor resection and adjuvant treatment were included in a dose escalating study. Therapeutical effects were evaluated by standard MR (Siemens Magnetom Vision 1,5 Tesla) with T1 native, T1-Gadolinium enhanced, and additionally 3 D-H MR-Spectroscopy using CSI-multivolume spectroscopy of a 20 mm axial slice with measurement of the tissue content for Lactate, N-AcetyI-Aspartate, Creatin, Cholin at 10 different selection points (tumor enhancement area, necrosis, ventricle, edema zone, white matter at different distances from the tumor, contralateral reference points) and IMT SPECT. Results: in 3 out of 5 patients who received addiditional temozolomide after further tumor progress had been verified MR-spectroscopy revealed a significant decrease of the cholin metabolism which correrated to the clinical stabilization over more than 6 month. Clinical and neuroradiological response by means of complete response was found in 6% (3/33), partial response 15% (5/33) and stable disease in 24 % (8/33). Tumor progress was detectable in 55% (18/33). Conclusion: Our data showed an overall response of 45% in our collective of 33 patients. This might indicate that temozolomide may be an option in recurrent glioblastoma after immuntoxin treatment. Stabilization of the clinical performance at a Karnofsky performance state of > 80 for more than 6 month correlated well with the findings of the MRI spectroscopy and IMT SPECT investigations. S 102 Central Nervous System Tumors / Urogenital Tract Cancer including Prostate Cancer P'516 TREATMENT OF RECURRENT GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME WITH INTRACAVITARY ADMINISTRATION OF TOPOTECAN: EXPERIENCES WITH FOUR PATIENTS T. Hundsberger, N. Hopf, S. Klimpe, T. Vogt, Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating malignant tumor of the CNS with a median survival of less than one year even in young patients. Standard therapy consists of surgery, radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy but frequently fails to prevent tumor recurrence at the initial site of origin. Topotecan is a semisynthetic topoisomerase-l-inhibitor with modest efficiency against high-grade gliomas given as an i.v. infusion in various schedules. The main serious side effect is bone-marrow toxicity, which limits further dose escalation. Prior studies in humans with refractory meningeal malignancies showed safety and feasability of intratheca] topotecan. In order to circumvent serious therapy- related side effects and to increase local tumor control, we treated 4 patients with recurrent progressive GBM's with Iocoregional application of topotecan via an ommaya-reservoir implanted in the tumor cavity after surgical debulking. All four patients were treated in an outpatient setting with increasing doses (0,05 mg every other week) of topotecan started with 0,2 mg until a maximum of 0,4 mg twice a week. Intracavitary topotecan was well tolerated and showed no bone marrow toxicity. MRI scans of the brain documented tumor progression in 3 patients after various periods of time, but one patient is still in stable disease after 39 weeks of therapy with a total cummulative dose of 19 mg intracavitary topotecan. From our four patients we can conclude that Iocoregional chemotherapy with topotecan in recurrent progressive GBM's is well tolerated and feasible, but was only effective in one patient. Due to low efficiency in the present study a combination of systemic chemotherapy in parallel with Iocoregional topotecan for recurrent GBM's might increase local tumor control. P'517 NEOPLASM OF ENDOLYMPHATIC SAC ORIGIN R. Stendel, O. Suess, G. Stoltenburg-Didinger, Freie Universit~t Berlin (Berlin) Neoplasms arising from the endolymphatic system are extremely rare. To our knowledge, only 25 cases have been published thus far. The term ,,endolymphatic sac neoplasm\" has replaced several other designations in literature, such as ,,cerebellopontine angle ceruminoma\" tumour\". This paper reports on a 55-year-old female who had undergone middle ear surgery 12 years previously and was admitted with a 6-months history of unilateral hearing loss and facial weakness. MRI and CT demonstrated a space-occupying lesion arising from the temporal bone and extending into the posterior fossa. Treatment consisted in complete tumour removal. Temporal and mastoid bone destruction associated with typical histological features led to the diagnosis of neoplasm of endolymphatic sac origin. Clinical, histological, radiologica] and intraoperative features of these rare tumours are described and discussed. P'518 BRAIN TUMOR FOLLOWING HEAD INJURY? R. Stendel, A. Theallier-Janko, Stoltenburg-Didinger, O. Suess, M. Brock, Freie Universit&t Berlin, Charite (Berlin) Is there a relationship between head injury and the development of a brain turnout?This question has been the object of controversial discussions since the origins of neurosurgery and neurology. Already in the past century reference was made to the possible relation between head injury and the subsequent development of a brain tumour. Since then, numerous cases have been reported in which the connection between head injury and brain tumour is recognized according to the criteria established by Z01ch. Despite a great variety of approaches, however, it has not been possible as yet to substantiate or refute conclusively such a connection. The cases of two patients fulfilling the criteria of Z01ch, prompts a revival of this discussion and the present case reports. We report on two cases of brain tumour and discuss the possible relationship to a previous brain trauma. The first patient, a 67-years-old male patient developed a glioblastoma at the same site of an open shell-splinter injury of the brain after a latency of 48 years. The second patient, a 55 years old male, had a malignant anaplastic astrocytoma in the right frontal lobe 10 years after clipping of an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery. Both cases fulfill the criteria of Z01ch for the correlation between trauma and tumour. We believe that the development of a brain tumour following a head injury is very rare, although possible. Probably the brain must display some form of predisposing genetic alteration for a tumour to develop following a head injury. P'519 HIGH GRADE MALIGNANT LYMPHOMA OF THE CNS IN TWO SIBLINGS K. WeiB, C.-P. Schneider, K. HSffken, S. Adam, Klinik for Innere Medizin II Jena (Jena) We report on two brothers, subsequently suffering from primary high grade malignant B-cell lymphoma of the central nerval system (CNS). The first one was at the age of 65, the younger one at the age of 64 when the disease occurred in 1996 and 1999, respectively. Both patients were HIV negative. Extended family history revealed no other hints on similar cases or deaths in relatives. Professio- nal history showed no special features of exposition against toxic substances or ionizing rays. In the first (the older) patient, lymphoma was located in the cerebellum and it's histological subtyping showed a pleomorphic Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Treatment was started with whole brain radiation therapy first, which had to be discontinued at a cumulative dose of 36 Gy, due to severe pneumonia which finally lead to death of the patient. Three years later, his brother was diagnosed with primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the CNS, situated in the fronto-parietal region on the right side. Treatment was initiated within a randomized study, including Carmustine to be repeated after 21 days (BMPD regimen). After two courses of treatment, the patient was in complete remission, assessed by MRI. The second course of chemotherapy was accomplished by a severe, life threatening pneumonia, occurring during neutropenia. After recovery, the patient was subjected to radiation therapy with a cumulative total dose of 50.4 Gy, given within six weeks. Without any further treatment, this patient is still in complete remission after two and a half years after diagnosis now. We assume, that there may be a connection between familiar occurence of malignant lymphatic diease and a genetic abormality. Unfortunately, we were not able to collect tissue or blood samples from the first patient, so an exact investigation of the underlying disorder couldn't be performed. On the other hand, it shows a completely different course of the same disease in these two patients, probably according to the different kind of treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case to be described according to the recent literature, mentioning occurrence of high grade CNS lymphoma in first degree relatives. Urogenital Tract Cancer including Prostate Cancer Oral Presentation 0520 ADJUVANT AUTOLOGOUS TUMOR CELL-LYSATE VACCINE VERSUS NO ADJUVANT TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH NON-METASTASIZED RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (M0) AFTER RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY: A 3-YEAR ANALYSIS OF A MULTICENTER PHASE-Ill TRIAL renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is associated with tumor progression in a significant proportion of patients. Nevertheless, no effective adjuvant treatment after radical nephrectomy has been established. We investigated the impact of an adjuvant autologous tumor cell-lysate vaccination on the progression-free survival of patients with non- metastasized RCC (M0) after radical nephrectomy. Patients and Methods: Between January 1997 and August 1998 a total of 558 patients with RCC stages pT2-3bpN0-3M0 (TNM-classification, UICC 1993) were enrolled at 55 different centers in Germany. Prior to radical nephrectomy all patients were centrally randomized to receive adjuvant autologous tumor cell- lysate vaccine (6 applications at 4-weeks intervals after radical nephrectomy) or no adjuvant treatment (control group) after radical nephrectomy. All patients were evaluated following standardized diagnostic investigations at 6-months intervals. Following the inclusion criteria 365 patients (131 women and 234 men, median age 59.3 years) were evaluable for the 3-year progression-free survival. There were 240 patients with stage pT2pNOMO and 89 patients with stage pT3pNOM0. The remaining 35 patients had positive lymph nodes. The trial was performed according to ]CH-GCP guidelines. Results: Demographic parameters (patient age and sex, tumor size) were comparable for both groups. The 3-year progression-free survival rate (according to Kaplan- Meier) for all tumor stages was 84.7% in the vaccine group and 80.9% in the control group. Patients with RCC stage pT3pN0-3M0 in the vaccine group demonstrated an advantage (74.4% in the vaccine group vs. 65.9% in the control group). For RCC stage pT2pNO-3MO the 3-year progression-free survival rate in the vaccine group was 89.7% compared to 85.7% in the control group. Follow-up of all patients enrolled in this trial is ongoing. Conclusions: This is the first randomized study indicating a benefit from an adjuvant vaccination in patients with non-metastasized RCC (MO) after radical nephrectomy. The advantage in terms of progression-free survival was more pronounced in patients with T3-tumors than in T2-tumors. O521 13CIS-RETINOIC ACID, IFN-ALPHA2A, IL-2 AND CHEMOTHERAPY IN ADVANCED RENAL CELL CARCINOMA: RESULTS OF A PROSPECTIVELY RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF THE GERMAN COOPERATIVE RENAL CARCINOMA CHEMOIMMUNOTHERAPY GROUP (DGCIN) J. Atzpodien, H. Kirchner, U. Jonas, Bonn, S 103 Urogenital Tract Cancer including Prostate Cancer St. Johannes Hospital, Universit~tsklinikum Leipzig, Klinikum (M(Jnster, Hannover, Frankfurt, Potsdam, Halle, Berlin, Bonn, Duisburg, Leipzig, Minden, Heidelberg, OIdenburg, Dessau, MLinchen) Background. We conducted a prospectively randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy of three outpatient therapy regimens in 341 patients with progressive (C) sc rlNF-alpha2a, iv vinblastine (n = 63). Methods. Patients were stratified according to known clinical predictors and were subsequently randomized. Treatment courses consisted of: (A) sc rlFN-alpha2a (5 x 106 IU/m 2, day 1, weeks 1 + 4; days 1, 3, 5, weeks 2 + 3; 10 x 106 IU/m 2, days 1, 3, 5, weeks 5 - 8), sc rlL-2 (10 x 106 IU/m 2, twice daily days 3 - 5, weeks 1 + 4; 5 x 106 IU/m~, days 1, 3, 5, weeks 2 + 3) and iv 5-FU (1000 mg/m 2 bolus, day 1, weeks 5 - 8); (B) treatment Arm A combined with pc 13cRA (20 mg 3 x daily over 8 weeks); (C) sc rlFN-alpha2a (5 x 106 IU/m 2, day 1, week 1; 10 x 106 IU/m 2, days 1, 3, 5, weeks 2 - 8) and iv vinblastine (6 mg/m 2, day 1, weeks 2, 5 and 8). Results and Conclusions. Treatment Arms A, B, and C yierded objective response rates of 31% (95% CI 22, 38), 26% (95% CI 19, 33) and 20% (95% CI 10, 31), respectively. Arm B, but not Arm A, showed a significantly improved progression- free survival when compared against Arm C (p < 0.0248). Both Arm A (median survival 25+ months, p < 0.0440) and Arm B (median survival 27+ months; p < 0.0227) led to a significantly improved overall survival when compared against Arm C therapy (median survival 16 months). 0522 DATA MINING TECHNIQUES CONFIRM PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FROM CONVENTIONAL QUALITY OF LIFE ANALYSES IN CLINICAL STAGE IIA/B NON-SEMINOMATOUS GERM CELL TUMOURS - RESULTS OF A PROSPECTIVE MULTICENTRE TRIAL H. Flechtner, S. Weinknecht, ABB, Oncology World (KSIn, Berlin, Mannheim, MQnchen) In order to reduce therapy related morbidity for patients with testicular germ cell turnouts in clinical stage IIA/B, we performed a prospective multicentre trial comparing the standard therapy ,,RPLNB + 2 cycles chemotherapy\" (arm A) with primary chemotherapy with 3-4 cycles (arm B). From 11/1991-VII/1995, 57 participating centre from Germany and Austria recruited 187 evaluable patients. 109 received primary RPLND and 78 primary chemotherapy. Quarity of life (QoL), therapy related morbidity, suspected predictive factors (histology, size and number of metastases), and outcome were assessed. In arm B, 67% achieved CR with chemotherapy alone, 33% required a secondary RPLND. Surgical complications were 13 % in arm A and 9 % in arm B (27 % of 26 postchemotherapy RPLNDs). Loss of ejaculation occurred in 32% in arm A, and 16 % in arm B. Acute toxicity of chemotherapy was higher in the group receiving primary chemotherapy. Conventional QoL analyses showed highest QoL and lowest symptom level in patients receiving primary chemotherapy followed by secondary RPLND. Particularly the group of patients that received primary chemotherapy alone showed the highest scores on fatigue and lowest scores on functional QoL scales compared to patients with primary RPLND. Due to the decreasing numbers of QoL assessments available from later points in time during follow-up, these findings remained statistically insignificant during the observation period (5 year follow- .up). Recent re-analyses of QoL data employing data mining techniques however where now able to confirm these preliminary findings. Further detailed analyses include effects on QoL from treatment and socio-demographic variables. The original conclusion from the trial that chemotherapy alone is not superior to primary or secondary RPLND regarding QoL outcome can now be modified to ther statement that chemotherapy alone has to be regarded as treatment option resulting in the lowest quality of life and highest fatigue levels during the first 5 years of follow-up. 0523 A NOVEL PROGNOSTIC MODEL FOR THE OUTCOME OF PATIENTS WITH MEDIASTINAL NONSEMINOMA J.T. Hartmann, C. Nichols, J.-P. Droz, Beyer, J. Kanz, H.-J. Schmoll, L. Einhorn, C. Bokemeyer, Eberhard-Karls-Universit&t, Or- egon Health Sciences University, Centre Leon Berard, Royal Marsden Hospital, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Universit~t Marburg, Kaiser USA) Background: To determine the overall outcome with currently available treatment strategies and to develop a prognostic model in order to optimize the therapeutic management of patients (pts) with extragonadal mediastinal nonseminoma. Pts and methods. An unselected population of consecutively treated pts with extragonadal germ cell tumors (GCT) at eleven cancer centers between 1975 through 1996 was retrospectively evaluated. Results: 341 pts with a primary mediastinal location were identified. 287 pts of whom had a nonseminomatous histology (84%) and have been included in the analysis. Disease limited to the mediastinum was found in 145 pts (51%), 97 pts (34%) had one and 45 pts (16%) had two or more additional lesions. Treatment consisted of chemotherapy (CT) in 278 pts (98%). Overall, 64% of pts (CI95%, 58 to 70) responded favorably to treatment [CR, n=54 (19%); PR m-, n=124 (45%)]. 143 pts (49%) secondary resections of residual masses after CT (thoracic surgery, n=121; retroperitoneal surgery, n=4; combined thoracic and abdominal operation _+ liver, n=18) yielding viable tumor in 49 (34%) and non-GCT elements in two pts (1.4%), mature teratoma in 37 (26%) and necrotic tissue calculated aS-rate was 45%. A multivariate CART analysis determined prognostic variables which lead to survival rates rang- ing from 34% to 84% at 2 years, such as extent of disease at diagnosis - presence of visceral metastases and lung metastases -, age </> 29 years and elevation of 6-HCG. Pts with mediastinal GCT and presence of visceral metastases achieved the worst 2-year aS rate of 34% (CI 95%, 17-52%). All other pts had a 2-year aS rate of 60% (CI95%, 54-67%)]. Further subgroups were determined based on the presence of lung metastases (42%, CI95% 29-56%). For the sub- group of pts aged up to 29 years with primary mediastinal tumor site having neither visceral nor lung metastases and elevated 8-HCG serum concentrations a favorable outcome of 84% was observed (CI 95%, 73-94%). Discussion. The prognosis of mediastinal nonseminoma is worse compared to metastatic GCT. However, this analysis demonstrated that pts within this group possess a heterogeneous prognosis depending on different characteristics. Pts with localized disease have a substantial chance of cure with the use of cisplatin based combination CT combined with aggressive secondary surgery in enced centers. 0524 RADIOTHERAPY OF STAGE IIA/B TESTICULAR SEMINOMA: RESULTS OF A PROSPECTIVE MULTICENTER CLINICAL TRIAL J. Classen, R. Souchon, M. Bamberg, Department of Radiation Oncology (Tuebingen, Hagen) Background: Prospective data on treatment results of radiotherapy in stage IIA/B seminoma is limited. We therefore conducted a multicenter clinical trial for radio- therapy of stage IIA/B disease with rimited treatment volume and total doses of irradiation. Methods: Between 4/1991 and 3/1994 94 patients were enrolled by 20 participat- ing departments. Treatment was delivered via \"hockey-stick\" portals comprising paraaortic and ipsilateral lilac rymph nodes. Total doses of treatment were 30 and 36 Gy for stage stage IIA and liB, respectively. Results: 87 patients are currently evaluable. Deviations from protocol require- ments potentially adversely influencing treatment outcome were categorized as \"major deviations\". There were 66 and 21 patients in stage IIA and lib disease, respectively. \"Major violations\" were observed in 30% (n=20) and 9,5% (n=2) in stage IIA and liB, respectively. Median time to follow-up is 70 months (range 0- 111). There were 2 failures in stage IIA and liB, respectively. Three of these were located above the diaphragm, there was 1 field-edge relapse. All relapsing pa- tients were successfully salvaged. In stage IIA there was no significant difference in tumour control between patients treated per protocol and those with \"major violations\". No such analysis was performed in stage lib due to the small number of patients with protocol violations. Disease-free survival at 70 months was 95,3% (CI 88,9-100%) for stage IIA and 88.9% (CI 74,3-100%) for stage liB. Grade 3 nausea and diarrhea were observed in 7,6% and 6,1% in stage IIA and 9,5% and 9,5 % in stage liB, respectively. No late toxicity >grade 1 has been reported. Conclusions: Radiotherapy yields excellent control rates in stage IIA as well as stage lib seminoma without major acute nor late toxicity. Radiotherapy remains standard treatment for seminoma stage IIA/B. Poster P525 EXPRESSION OF ANNEXINS I AND II IN CLEAR CELL RENAL CARCINOMAS U. Zimmermann, S. Pietschmann, K. Schultz, S. Balabanov, (ANXs) represent calcium and phospholipid binding proteins. They are involved in growth regulation and serve as substrates for serine and threonine kinases. Moreover they are required in endocytosis and exocytesis. In many tissues ANXs are ubiquitous and seem to be essential for normal physiological function. In tumors, however, expression of ANXs is very heterogenous. For instance in prostatic adenocarcinoma as well as oesophageal squamous cell cancer a dramatic reduction or complete loss of ANX I was found. In breast cancer however, ANX I levels were increased. In neuroblastoma tumors ANX II concentration decreased wheras pancreatic tumors showed increased levels of ANX II. In order to get more insight in the role of ANXs in renal tissues, we investigated the expression of ANX I and II in renal tumors as well as non-neoplastic tissue by immunochemistry, RT-PCR an Western-Blot. Material and Methods Malignant and benign tissue were obtained after radical nephrectomy immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen or subjected to 4% formalin. Immunohistochemistry using monoclenal antibodies against ANX I and II was performed on paraffin sections (71Jm). RNA was isolated from approximately 50mg of tissue with TRIzol reagent according to the manufactor's protocol, cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of lpg of total RNA. Using this cDNA and pairs of suitable primers ANX I and II S 104 Urogenital Tract Cancer including Prostate Cancer were amplified by 35 cycles of PCR using Taq polymerase. For western blot tissues were subjected to lysis buffer and homogenized. Proteinextracts were separated by PAGE using a gradient gel. Proteins were blotted on nitrocellulose- membranes. Bands were visualised using secondary and BClP- substrate. Results: In non-neoplastic tissue, staining for ANX I and II was very strong in Bowman's capsule, loop of Henle, distal convuluted tubule and collecting tubules and ducts, in foci of the tumor ANX I staining was intracellular. ANX II was seen at the membranes of some tumor cells or distributed in the cytoplasm. Within the tumor ANX II immunoreactivity was restricted to foci. PCR revealed that the mRNA of both ANXs were present in non neoplastic as well as in tumor tissue. Western blotting showed that both ANXs were present in tumor as well as in non-neoplastic tissue. Conclusion: Due to their focal distribution ANXs are supposed either to play a role in metastatic processes or to be involved in carcinogenesis. P526 EXTENDED ANATOMICAL PELVIC LYMPHADENECTOMY IN PROSTATE CANCER A. Heidenreich, R. yon (Marburg) Purpose: (LA) in prostate cancer (PCA) is limited to obturator and external iliacal nodes although the internal nodes represent the primary landing zone of lymphatic drainage. We performed anatomically adequate exten- ded pelvic lymphadenectomy (epLA) to assess the frequency of lymph node metastases in clinically localized PCA. Materials and Methods: 103 consecutive pts underwent epLA at time of RRP comprising 9 selective fields: external lilac nodes, internal iliac nodes, obturator nodes, and common lilac nodes bilaterally and presacral lymph nodes. Pathohistology was compared to serum and postoperative prostatectomy Gleason score. EpLA was compared to 100 consecutive patients undergoing RRP and standard LA in terms of complications, number of lymph nodes dissected, duration of surgery. Results: There were no significant differences in age, preoperative PSA, and mean biopsy Gleason score between patients of the epLA group and the standard LA group. Metastases were diagnosed in 27/103 (26.2%) pts undergoing epLA; mean number of dissected lymph nodes was 28 (21-42). Metastases were located in the internal iliac and presacral regions despite negative obturator nodes; 15/27 pts demonstrated 1 metastatic lymph node, 9 pts had 2 and 1 pt had 3 lymph nodes involved. 26/27 (95.8%) pts with lymph node metastases demonstrated PSA levels > 10.5 ng/ml and a preoperative biopsy Gleason sum 3 7. Low risk of 2% for lymph node disease was defined for patients with PSA serum levels < 10.5ng/ml and a biopsy Gleason sum < 7. There were no significant differences with regard to intra- and postoperative complications, lymphocele formation, blood loss between both groups. Conclusions: EpLA demonstrates a high frequency of lymph node metastases outside the fields of standard LA in clinically localized PCA. LA including the internal lilac nodes should be performed in all patients with PCA being at high risk for lymph node involvement (PSA > 10.5 ng/ml, biopsy Gleason sum 3 7); in the low risk group pLA can be omitted. P527 HIGH-DOSE IBANDRONAT IN THE TREATMENT OF PAINFUL SKELETAL METASTASES DUE TO HORMONE-REFRACTORY PROSTATE CANCER (HRPCA) - Universit~t (Marburg) INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: Bone pain, reduced mobility and decreased quality of life due to osseous metastases of HRPCA still represent a therapeutic dilemma and are difficult to treat. Recently, we demonstrated high therapeutic efficacy of clodronate in the treatment of painful osseous metastases with a response rate of 75% (J Urol 165: 136, 01). CIodronate, however, is hampered by gastrointestinal side effects. Ibandronate is a 3rd generation bisphosphonate with a analgesic potency 100times higher than clodronate. We undertook a prospective pilot study to evaluate the analgetic potency and toxicity of high dose ibandronate. PATIENTS & METHODS: 25 patients with painful osseous metastases due to HRPCA were included in the prospective study. Ibandronate 6mg in 500ml glucose 5% was applied intravenously over 1 hour every 4 weeks; patients received 6 cycles of therapy. Tumor specific parameters, Karnofsky.index, ECOG performance status, and pain score using a 1g-point visual analogue scale were assessed prior to therapy; the same parameters were documented at each visit. RESULTS: Mean pretherapeutic Karnofsky index and pain score were 65% (50- 75%) and 6.2 (5-8), respectively. A significant pain reliefing effect was observed in 22/25 pts (88%) within the first two days following iv ibandronate. Mean pain score decreased from 6.2 to 2.5 (1-4, p<0.001). Besides slight decrease of serum calcium concentrations in 3 pts (12%) no laboratory alterations were detected. 4 pts (15%) developed fever and flu-like symptoms as the only therapy-associated side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Application of high dose ibandronate results in a significant pain relJefing effect in 90% of pts with painful osseous metastases due to HRPCA. We did not encounter significant therapy associated side effects. Based on the positive results of this pilot study we have initiated a prospective randomized clinical phase-Ill trial of ibandronate NONSEMINOMATOUS Albers, Berlin) INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: Nerve sparing retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy (nsRPLND) has been the standard diagnostic and therapeutic approach in clinical stage I nonseminomas (NSGCT). However, the application of prognostic risk factors and the introduction of laparoscopy have questioned the clinical utility of nsRPLND recently. The purpose of our study was to assess therapeutic efficacy and associated complications of nsRPLND in CS I NSGCT to evaluate its role in the modern management of low stage testis cancer. PATIENTS & METHODS: Between 1/95 and 9/2000 229 patients with CS I NSGCT have undergone nsRPLND in standardized fields of dissection. For retrospective analysis patient charts were reviewed; a minor complication did not prolong the hospital stay, a major complication prolonged hospitalization for at least 2 days. Early complications developed within the first 30 days following RPLND, late complications occurred from postop, day 31. RESULTS: nsRPLND was performed unilaterally in 200 pts (87%) and bilaterally in 29 pts (13%); median surgical time was 214 (90-395) minutes, mean hospital stay was 8 (4-19) days. Mean blood loss was less than 50ml. A mean of 18.5 (9-57) lymph nodes were dissected with metastases being detected in 64 pts (28%). On average 2.9 (1-14) lymph nodes with a mean diameter of 2.6 cm (0.3-6.0) exhibited metastases. 42 pts (65.6%) had \u00a3 3 metastatic lymph nodes, 15 pts (23.4%) had 4-6 positive nodes and 7 Lots (10.9%) had > 5 posit[ve nodes. Minor complications occurred in 13.5% of the pts, major complications were observed in 3.5%. Antegrade ejaculation was preserved in 92.6% of the developed in 11 pts (4.8%), a retroperitoneal reccurence was only observed in 1 pt (0.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Primary diagnostic and therapeutic nsRPLND still has its role in the primary management of clinical stage I NSGCT; surgery is associated with low morbidity, follow-up of the pts becomes easy and cost effective due to concentration on the extraretropefitoneal locations. Primary nsRPLND will be curative in about 70% of CS I NSGCT with a maximum of 3 positive lymph nodes. P529 SENTINEL LYMPH NODE SCINTIGRAPHY (SLNS) FOR DIAGNOSTIC IMPROVE- MENT OF PELVIC LYMPHADENECTOMY IN LOCALIZED PROSTATE CANCER WITH UNFAVOURABLE PROGNOSTICATORS A, Heidenreich, Z. Varga, R. yon PhilJpps - Universit~t (Marburg) INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: The rationale for radical prostatectomy in lymph node positive prostate cancer (PCA) is discussed controversially, Detection of occult pelvic lymph node metastases can only be achieved by extended pelvic lymphadenectomy which, however, is rarely performed. Recently, intraoperative SLNS has been proposed as a new armentarium improving lymphonodular staging. The purpose of the current study was to prospectively assess the clinical utility of SLNS compared to epLA. PATIENTS & METHODS: 26 consecutive patients with histologically proven PCA were recruited in the prospective study after having given informed consent. Prior to RRP and epLA 2ml 99mTechnetium colloid were injected into the prostate under transrectal uitrasonographic guidance. 20 min and 2 hours later dynamic LNS was carried out; intraoperatively, a gamma probe optimized for technetium was used for detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). All SLN were dissected followed by standard epLA; all (S)LN were pathohistologically analysed to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values. RESULTS: Altogether, 543 LN were dissected and pathohistologically analysed with a mean demonstrated was > 10 ng/ml in all cases. Intraeperative use of the gamma probe identified 56/543 (10.4%) LNs as SLN, however, only 11 SLNs (19.6%) revealed metastases on pathohistologic evaluation; all radioactive nodes were identified on images of dynamic LNS. 9 patients (36%) had 12 additional metastatic LN's not accumulating radioactivity. 1 patient revealed no SLN's but 1 metastatic LN. Sensitivity and specificity of SLNS are 55% and 91.3%, resp. whereas positive 20.4% and 97.6%, resp. CONCLUSIONS: SLNS has been performed in high risk PCA patients with preoperative PSA serum levels > 10.5 ng/ml for diagnosis of occult LN metastases. Diagnostic accuracy of epLA for detection of metastatic LN's was not improved by SLNS; however, based on its high specificity and negative predictive value, preop dynamic LNS and intraop. SLNS might be useful to exclude occult lymphonodular metastates in high risk patients thereby omitting the need for epLA. P530 DNA-ALTERATIONS IN TESTICULAR GERM CELL TUMORS DETECTED BY MICROSATELLITE ANALYSIS (MSI) A. HeJdenreich, D. Rappenberg, germ cell tumors (TGCT) still S 105 Urogenital Tract Cancer including Prostate Cancer remains unclear and no clear abnormalities in known ocogenes and tumor suppressor genes have been linked to the development of TGCT. However, recent cytogenetic studies of testis cancer have identified nonrandom abnormalites affecting chromsomes 1, 11 and 12. In the present study a panel of microsatellites located on 9 chromosomal arms was assessed with regard to their potential role in pathogenesis and progression of human TGCT. Material & Methods: Matched pairs of tumor/normal samples of 44 TGCT and 10 samples of normal testes were collected at time of surgery, snap frozen and stored at -8O\u00b0C. After H&E staining, tumor and normal areas were microdissected, DNA was extracted by phenol-choloroform method after poteinase K digestion. For MSl, 21 polymoprhic markers located on 9 chromosomal arms having demonstrated a LOH of at least 40% in previous studies were analysed. Following PCR amplification and flourescence marking, detection of allelic imbalance (AI), LOH, deletion (D) and amplification was carried out using an automated laser sequencer. MSI data were compared with tumor histology and clinical stage. Results: No DNA alterations were detected in normal tissue samples and the matched normal testis samples. At least 1 molecular event was detected in 41/ 44 (92%) tumor samples. Most frequently, tumor associated resp. Frequency AI/LOH (p<0.001) as compared to metastatic TGCT (15% and 50%). AMP was most frequently observed for D17S799 (14%). Conclusions: Human TGCT demonstrate high frequency of DNA alterations especially for chromosomal regions lpter-qter, 3pter-3p24.2, and 11p12-14. Since these regions encode for various tumor suppressor genes and growth factors, MSI points towards a significant contribution of these regions in the pathogenesis of TGCT. Furthermore, high frequency of DNA alterations at DllS1385 and DllS1978 encoding for WT1, ST3, EMS1 and TEM1 reduced the likelihood of metastases. These data warrant further investigation to elucidate the role of those markers in pathogenesis and progression of TGCT. P531 A PROSPECTIVE RANDOMISED CLINICAL PHASE-II-TRIAL OF PEGYLATED DOXORUBICINE IN HORMONE REFRACTORY PROSTATE CANCER A. Heidenreich, F. (Caelyx) has been shown to reduce nonspecific drug delivery to normal tissues and to improve the specific delivery of cytostatic drugs to malignant cells. Caelyx may also reduce the peak plasma levels of doxorubicine that may be responsible for drug associated toxicity. Since doxorubicine shows response rates of 30% in hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPCA), we conducted a prospective randomized clinical phase II trial to evaluate the feasibility, toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of Caelyx in HRPCA. Patients & Methods: 40 patients with HRPCA progressive following hormonal therapy and antiandrogen withdrawal were randomized to receive Caelyx at 25 mg/sqm every 2 weeks for 12 cycles (group 1), 50 mg/sqm every 4 weeks for 6 cycles (group 2), and 50 mg/sqm every 4 weeks for 3 cycles followed by 40 mg/ sqm every 3 weeks for another 3 cycles (group 3). All patients received dexamethasone 8mg bid on days -1 to 5 and vitamin-B6 30Omg/day. 15/48 patients (31%) presented with severe bone pain due to osseous metastases equivalent to a pain score of 7.5 on a VAS of O to 10. Therapeutic efficacy was recorded by serial PSA serum and VAS measurements, toxicity was recorded according to NCIC/CALBG and EORTC QLQ 30. Results: Mean age of the patients was 68.9 (58-79) years; mean follow-up is 16 (4-24) serum level was 660.4 (8-6340) ng/ml. We did observe an objective PSA response of > 50% decrease in 10/24 patients (41.6%) of group 2 with 2 patients exhibiting a complete normalisation of PSA. There were no objective responses in patients of groups 1 and 3. All 15 patients with significant bone pain became pain-free on day2 following the first infusion and remained pain-free throughout the treatment period. Toxicity was severe with stomatitis and hematotoxicity > WHO II developing in 25% and 30% of patients in groups 2 and 3, resp.; in group 1 plantar and palmar erythrodysaesthesia was the most common and severe toxicity with 50% of the patients developing WHO IV toxicities resulting in a preliminary discontinuation of arm 1. Conclusions: Caelyx results in a significant PSA decrease of short duration following iv-application of 50 mg/sqm every 4 weeks for 6 cycles; this dosage should be used for further clinical phase-Ill trials. However, severe mucocutaneous toxicities have to be considered although the regime with 50mg/sqm was well tolerated as an outpatient protocol. P532 NEW POLYMORPHISMS OF THE PSA PROMOTER IN PATIENTS WITH PROS- TATE CARCINOMA M. Schostak, H. Krause, K. Miller, Freie Universit~it Berlin (Berlin) Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is an essential parameter in the diagnosis and follow-up of prostate carcinoma. Androgen-responsive elements (AREs) located in the promoter region of the PSA gene are targets for the nuclear transcription factor AR (androgen receptor), whose expression determines sensitivity to antiandrogen therapy in PCa patients. We searched for polymorphisms using PCR-based combined SSCP and sequence analysis in four different parts of the PSA promoter, which harbour binding sites for major transcriptional regulators. Lymphocyte DNA samples from 90 prostate cancer patients were subjected to SSCP analysis after PCR amplification of four approximately 200bp fragments selected to contain the known AREs I-III or the transcriptional start site, respectively. Conspicuous PCR fragments with variant SSCP patterns were subsequently cloned into pCR2.1 and sequenced on an AB[ 377 automatic sequencer. Computer-driven comparison to published sequences of the promoter region (U 37672, AF243527, AF394907, AC011523) was performed to reveal polymorphic sites. Eighty-nine percent of the patient DNAs displayed polymorphisrns in the ARE I-, 19% in the ARE II-containing PCR fragments, whereas the other two fragments (ARE III and transcriptional start site) showed no detectable sequence variations. We could confirm the presence of polymorphisms in our patient samples at nt - 252 (A/G) and nt -202 (A/AA) described so far only for the Japanese population as well as a G/A variation at nt -158 that is located within the ARE I recognition sequence and is highly polymorphic also in breast cancer patients, in addition we found novel sequence polymorphisms with lower frequency at positions -233 (CC/ C), -230 ~/C), and -120 (A/G) of the PSA promoter. Sequence variation was found to a lesser degree in the region harbouring ARE II where we were able to uncover a C/T polymorphisms at nt -358. In contrast to well-documented androgen receptor gene polymorphisms and despite the fact that AREs are well-characterized regulators of PSA gene expression, promoter region variation of the PSA gene in PCa patients has rarely been described so far. One might speculate that PSA promoter variation might influence PCa patient susceptibility to antiandrogen therapy. P533 OPTIMIZING LOCAL ANESTHESIA DURING TEN-CORE BIOPSY OF THE PROSTATE M. Schostak, F. Christoph, M. Staehler, K. Miller, Freie Universit~.t Berlin (Berlin) Introduction: Reports thus far have shown high variability in assessing the pain intensity of prostate biopsies and the effectiveness of anesthesia. Up to now, however, no investigations have been performed to compare the various anesthetic techniques. This prospective, randomized study examines the effect of different anesthetic techniques vs. no anesthesia in a ten-core prostate biopsy. Materials and methods: Ultrasound-guided ten-core prostate biopsy is performed at the University Hospital Benjamin Franklin of the Freie Universit&t Berlin. After informed consent, patients were prospectively randomized into 4 groups: no local anesthesia (group I); of plexus (group II); local anesthesia of the apex (group Ill) and a combination of I[ and III (group IV). The degree of pain was recorded after every injection or biopsy using the VAS/NAS score. Results: Between September 1999 and October 2000, 187 patients with a planned ten-core prostate biopsy were included in the study. Results could be assessed in 170 cases: 44 patients received no anesthesia (group I), 44 anesthetic block of the plexus (group II), 40 local anesthesia of the apex (group III) and 42 a combination of the two (group IV). In group I (no anesthesia), only 2/44 patients (4.6%) had no pain during biopsy and 39/44 patients (88.6%) felt moderate pain with a score between 1 and 4. Three of 44 patient (6.8%) reported strong pain (score over 4). The mean pain scores were as follows: 2.32 in group I; 1.78 in group II; 1.16 in group Ill and 1.36 in group IV. Pain caused by local anesthesia itself was: 0 in group I; 1.52 in group II; 1.05 in group III and 1.79 in group IV. All differences between groups were statistically significant. Conclusion: Local anesthesia reduces significantly pain. Apex infiltration proved to be the most effective. In contrast to anesthetic block of the prostatic plexus, it is very easy to perform technically and can be recommended. P534 CLINICAL VALUE OF TEN-CORE PROSTATE BIOPSIES M. Schostak, F. Christoph, M. Staehler, K. Miller, Freie Universit~t Berlin (Berlin) Introduction: The prostate sextant biopsy is considered to be the gold standard of invasive prostate cancer diagnostics. However, numerous studies have shown that higher detection rates are achieved by increasing the number of biopsies. Chen et al. found ten ,,ideal\" biopsy sites with the aid of a computer model. This study examines the clinical value of thus varying the number and localization of biopsies. Material and Method: Ultrasound-guided ten-core prostate biopsies are being performed in our department. Following the model of Chen, three prostate biopsies are taken from the middle plane instead of one. The two additional specimens are retrieved in the paraurethral and ventral regions. Results: Between September 1999 and October 2000, 187 patients scheduled for a 10-core prostate biopsy were included in the study. Assessable results were obtained in 177 cases. A carcinoma was detected in 62/177 (35.0%) of the patients. The carcinoma was found only in the standard sextant Iocalizations (27.4%) in 17/62 patients and additionally in the paraurethral or ventral region in 35/62 (56.5%). The carcinoma was located only in 1/62 (1.6%) and only ventrally in 6/62 (9.7%). Altogether, the prostate carcinoma was detected only by the additional biopsies in 7 patients (11.3%). A clinically relevant disease was seen in 6/7 (71.4%). A carcinoma was detected most frequently in biopsy 1, 2 and 3 (16.9%, 17.5% and 16.4%) and most rarely in biopsy 7 and 8 (11.9% and 10.7%). Statistically significant differences were found only between these groups. Conclusion: The modification and increase of biopsies from six to ten according to the model suggested by Chen et al. detected 11.3% more carcinomas in our patients. S 106 Urogenital Tract Cancer including Prostate Cancer P535 ANALASIS OF THE INFLAMMATORY NETWORK IN BENIGN PROSTATE HYPERPLASIA AND PROSTATE CANCER J. K6nig, T. Senge, Objectives: The complexity of acute and chronic inflammatory processes may either lead to benign prostate hyperplasia and/or prostate cancer. Obviously, various tissue cells are activated by chemokines via different chemotaxin receptors which then trigger subsequent processes in angiogenesis, cellular growth and extravasation as well as neoplasia. Methods: Using the surgically obtained tissue of patients (n=36) with BPH or prostate carcinoma we studied among others the chemokine (Rantes, IL-8), chemotaxin of matrixmetalloproteinases (MMP2,9), the Toll receptors 4 and 9 expression and the inducible Cyclooxygenase-2 by RT-PCR. Further support for the different properties with tissue from PCA was obtained using two different PCA cell lines (PC3 = androgen resistant cell) or LNCAP cells (androgen sensitive). By FACS analasis the expression for CXCR1,2,4 and CCR5 was studied after stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). In addition quantification of mRNA by lightcycler for COX2 and CXCR2 was performed on prostate carcinoma cell lines. Results: Remarkable differences in expression were obtained by RT-PCR when BPH tissue versus PCA was analysed. For BPH marked expression was obtained for TLR-4, TLR-9, 5-LO, CCR3.For PCA tissue marked expression was obtained for TLR-2, MMP2, Rantes, CXCR-4. The prostate carcinoma cell lines showed differences in the expression for CXCR-1 - 5,CCR-1 - 8, TLR-1 - 9 and COX 2. By FACS analysis differences in the regulation for CXCR-1 and 2 was obtained after TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma stimulation. Differences were also obtained with regard to the IL-8 release after stimulation with SEB, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma time dependently. The inducible COX 2 expression for LNCAP and PC-3 cell lines differed over various times when stimulated with SEB and TNF-alpha. Conclusions: Our data clearly demonstrate that various inflammatory and cell biological cascades are involved which either lead to BPH or can be linked to the development of PCA. The exact cell biological mechanisms may provide novel therapeutic options in the treatment of both diseases.

Ansorge, E. AIIhoff, Otto-von-Guericke- Universit~it (Magdeburg) The immune system of patients with renal cell carcinoma undergoing surgery is altered postoperatively. Here, we address, whether this alteration can be modulated by preoperative administration of interleukin-2. Of 60 patients who underwent turnout nephrectomy, 23 patients received 4 doses of 10 Mio IE per m 2 interleukin-2 (IL-2) q12h s.c. a week before operation, 37 did not. Parameters of cellular and humeral immunity (differential blood count, T-cell markers were measured in peripheral venous blood of patients who underwent renal operations. Blood was drawn before IL-2, one day before and immediately after the operation, and on the 1., 3., 5., and 10. postope- rative day.All patients who received IL-2 suffered from side effects WHO grade I- II, one patient from WHO grade III. Operation was postponed once because of elevated liver enzymes. All patients showed postoperatively elevated leukocyte- and granulocyte counts, and elevated serum levels of immunosuppressive cytokines. T-cell and activation markers were decreased. However, all alterations were less accentuated in patients who had been pretreated with IL-2. Monocyte counts and serum IL-2 levels were decreased in pretreated patients.T-cell-mediated immunity is impaired and levels of immunosuppressive cytokines are elevated in patients undergoing tumour nephrectomy in the postoperative period. Pretreatment with IL-2 can modulate this alteration. However, IL-2 application scheme used here is followed by a distinct counter regulation including serum IL-2 levels. P537 STAGE INDEPENDENT DIAGNOSIS OF BLADDER CANCER IN SERUM AND URINE BY DETECTION OF DNA ALTERATIONS IN MICROSATELLITE ANALY- SIS R. yon Knobloch, H. (TCC) of the urinary bladder no reliable serological markers and no sufficient non-invasive tools for urine diagnosis are available. We applied the fluorescent microsatellite analysis (MSA) to detect serum-DNA and urine-sediment-DNA alterations in patients suffering from bladder cancer. Materials & Methods: Since 1999 we prospectively collected fresh turnout-, peripheral blood-, serum- and spontaneous urine specimens from 60 consecutive patients treated for TCC of the bladder at our institution. DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform method from tumours and blood lymphocytes. Serum- and urine-DNA was isolated by a commercial kit (Mini-Kit, Qiagen). We performed MSA with a total of 14 polymorphic markers from sediment-DNA alterations. After PCR-amplification detection of allelic imbalance and loss of heterozygosity was carried out on an automated laser sequencer (ALFexpress II, Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech). 20 healthy controls were investigated with the same markers. Results: We identified serum-DNA alterations in 76,7% (46/60) of cases. By applying the same 14 microsatellite markers we observed turnout specific urine- DNA alterations allowing cancer diagnosis in 71.7% (43/60) of cases. The highest frequency of serum-DNA alterations was detected for chromosomal well as 9q, 5q, 9p and 20q 30%, 25%, 25%, 23% and 22%, respectively. The identification of serum-DNA and urine-sediment alterations was not associated with tumour-grade or -stage (p > 0.05). Unspecific serum-DNA allelic imbalance was observed in 15 % (3/20). Conclusions: In patients with TCC of the urinary bladder microsatellite analysis has a high sensitivity of 76.7% in the detection of serum-DNA alterations, thus allowing tumour diagnosis. For urine-sediment specimens the detection rate was 71.7% independent of turnout stage or grade. The study was supported by grant No. 9/2000 from the Kempkes-Stiftung, Marburg. P538 COMPARISON OF THE ANGIOGENIC ACTIVITY IN THE SERA OF PATIENTS WITH TRANSITIONAL CELL CARCINOMA OF THE BLADDER (TCC), RENAL CELL CARCINOMA OF THE KIDNEY AND HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. W.-D. Beecken, W. Bentas, J. Linneweber, Universit~itsMinikum Frankfurt/Main (Frankfurt/Main) Introduction: TCC and renal cell carcinoma lack the expression of a known tumor marker. For the determination of the prognosis of these cancers new prognostic markers are needed. Angiogenesis, the induction of capillary sprouting, is essen- tial for tumor growth and progression. Therefore, the investigation of angiogenesis parameters is a promising new concept for the determination of the prognosis in cancer patients. In this pilot study we investigate the angiogenic activity expressed in sera of patients with TCC, renal cell carcinoma and healthy volunteers. Methods: Sera of 10 patients with TCC, 28 patients with renal cell carcinoma and 28 healthy volunteers were investigated in a 72 hrs. in vitro endothelial cell proliferation assay. Results: The sera of the patients with TCC stimulated endothelial cell proliferation significantly more than sera of healthy controls 138.5 + 18.9% vs. 98.1 + 3.3%, P = 0.02). However, the sera of patients with renal cell carcinoma did not show an increase in endothelial cell stimulation over the healthy volunteers (91.6 + 24.9%, P > 0.05). Discussion: These results demonstrate that determination of serum endothelial cell activity can differentiate patients with bladder cancer from healthy volunteers. However, in renal cell carcinoma this assay might not give valuable information. We assume that in renal cell carcinoma the stimulation of capillary growth is induced by a local mechanism, while in TCC the induction of angiogenesis seems to be a systemic process. Currently we prospectively investigate all our patients with TCC using this assay and correlate the results to their tumor parameters and clinical courses P539 STAGE INDEPENDENT SERUM DIAGNOSIS OF RENAL CELL CARCINOMA BY DETECTION OF DNA ALTERATIONS IN MICROSATELLITE ANALYSIS R. von Knobloch, H. Brandt, To date there are no reliable serological markers available for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We applied the fluorescent microsatellite analysis (MSA) to detect serum-DNA alterations in patients suffering from RCC. Materials & Methods: From 1998 to 2000 we prospectively collected fresh tumor- , peripheral blood- and serum-specimens from 60 consecutive patients treated for malignant renal tumors at our institution. DNA was extracted by phenol- chloroform method from tumors and blood lymphocytes. Serum-DNA was isolated by a commercial kit (Mini-Kit, Qiagen, Hilden). In Group I (53 RCC, 6 urothelial pelvis tumors, 1 malignant renal lymphoma) we performed MSA with a total of 9 pelymorphic markers from tumor specific serum-DNA alterations. 11 additional markers were used in the first 23 RCCs (Group II) in order to increase sensitivity of the method. Besides the histomorphological diagnosis the RCCs were genetically stratified according to the ,,Heidelberg Classification\" of renal tumors. After PCR- amplification detection of allelic imbalance and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was carried out on an automated laser sequencer (ALFexpress II, Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech). 20 healthy controls were investigated with 9 markers. Results: In Group I we identified serum-DNA alterations in 70% (37/53) of oases. When applying 20 markers, the sensitivity was elevated to 87% (20/23) in Group I1. In the (5/7). Unspecific allelic imbalance was observed in 15 % (3/20). The highest frequency of aberations was detected for chromosomal regions 3p and 5q in 36% each. The identification of serum-DNA alteration was not associated with tumor-grade but showed a trend towards high stages (p = 0,044). Conclusions: In RCC patients the microsatellite analysis has a high sensitivity of S 107 Urogenital Tract Cancer including Prostate Cancer up to 87% in the detection of serum-DNA alterations, when a sufficient number of markers from various chromosomal regions are used. Advanced tumors tend to express serum-DNA alterations more frequently. P540 FISH ANALYSIS OF THE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR GENE IN PRIMARY PROS- TATE CANCER A. R6pke, K. John, the majority of patients with prostate cancers (PC), the growth of the tumor is androgen-dependent. In advanced PC, where radical treatment of prostate cancer is not curative, androgen deprivation therapy has proved to be an effective palliative therapy. However, most cases become refractory to androgen deprivation therapy within a few years. Several hypotheses on treatment failure have been suggested, involving androgen-dependent mechanisms, such as hypersensitivity to residual non-testicular androgens, increased androgen biosynthesis or mutations of the androgen receptor (AR) gene, as well as androgen-independent mechanisms, such as activation of epidermal, fibroblast or other growth factor pathways. In previous publications AR gene amplifications were found in PC after anti-androgen treatment. In this study we analysed isolated nuclei from paraffin-embedded tumor tissue from 31 patients with untreated primary PC of different stages for amplification of the AR gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Therefore, an AR gene probe (Vysis) was used in combination with an X centromere control probe In 2 out of 31 analysed PC additional X chromosomes (disomy to tetrasomy) with the corresponding AR gene copies could be detected. In these two patients more than 40% of all analysed nuclei of the analysed tissue show two or more fluorescence signals of the AR gene as well as of the X centromere. Both patients have high stage prostate cancer (pT4,pN1 and pT3b,pN0). FISH analysis on normal prostate tissue shows that in both patients not more than 10% of the nuclei have additional X chromosomes. Control analyses with centromere probes of chromosomes X, Y and 18 confirmed these results. In the other 29 cases of primary prostate cancers lower numbers of aberrant nuclei were detected. Although the obtained values achieved no statistical significance we conclude that high stage primary prostate cancer may be correlated with increasing frequencies of aneuploidies of the X-chromosome resulting in amplification of the AR gene. This study was founded by Dr. Mildred Scheel Stiftung. P541 THREE-WEEKLY PACLITAXEL(P) AND ESTRAMUSTIN(E)- AN WELL TOLERATED REGIMEN FOR THE TREATMENT OF HORMON-REFRAC- TORY PROSTATE CANCER E(280mg PO TID, days 1-7)and P(175mg/m2,1V, day 2) due to progress in hormon- refractory prostate cancer. The next cycle was started at day 21. Pt Characteristics: Median age: 69(50-86); Median ECOG Performance prior to treatment: 83ng/dl(3-2600); bone metastases were observed in 19 out of 20 pts. A mean number of 6 cycles were administered(range 1-12), a reduction in dosage was in none of our pts. necessary. Toxicities: There was no Grade 4 Toxicity. In 2/20 pts. therapy was interrupted because of a DVT. We observed a Grade 3 neutropenia in 3/20 pts., a Grade 3 thrombocytepenia in 2/20 pts., and a Grade 3 anaemia in 5/20 pts.. Response: We achived a PSA-Level in 8 Confidence Interval(CI)= 19%-64%) and a PSA-Level >75% in 4 pts.(20%,95% Confidence Interval(CI)= 55%-44%), respectively. In one pt. the PSA dropped down to <0.2ng/dl. In the chemotherapeutically pretreated group(10 pts.), a decrease in PSA-Levels >50% was observed in 4 pts. In 1/20 pt. of this group the PSA-Level was reduced >75%. Conclusions: The combiation of three-weekly administered P+E is an effective therapeutic option in the treatment of hormon-refractory prostate cancer. We observed acceptable side effects. Future studies have to clarify, if weekly administration of P is more effective when compared to three-weekly administration. P542 FHIT EXPRESSION IN CLEAR CELL CARCINOMAS: VERSATILITY DURING TUMOR PROGRESSION AND CORRELATION WITH SURVIVAL U. H. Ramp, E. Caliskan, R. Willers, H. E. Gabbert, C.D. (DLisseldorf) Objective: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) of the clear cell type is the most frequent malignant tumor of the kidney in adults and its clinical course cannot be predicted by currently available histepathological classification systems. Clear cell RCCs are characterized by a deletion of chromosome 3p, which might result in the inactivation of the FHIT (fragile histidine triad) gene, a putative tumor suppressor gene. To explore the relevance of FHtT aberrations for tumor progression in clear cell RCCs, we analyzed FHIT protein expression in formalin-fixed tissue from 149 clear cell RCCs by immunohistochemistry. Results: 1. FHIT expression was found in 89 % of clear cell RCCs with marked intratumoral heterogeneity of protein levels. 2. FHIT protein expression was markedly reduced in all RCCs, when compared with adjacent non-neoplastic tubule epithelia 3. A significant increase of FHIT expression (p=0.0001) became evident from well (G1) to poorly (G3) differentiated tumors. 4. FHIT expression significantly (p=0.001) increased from low (pT1) to advanced (pT3) tumor stages. 5. Log-rank test revealed a significant inverse correlation (p=0.0074) between FHIT expression and survival time. 6. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that FHIT expression is an independent prognostic parameter (p=0.0139). Conclusions: Clear cell RCCs show a marked reduction of FHIT protein expression, which, however, is less pronounced in poorly differentiated RCCs or advanced tumor stages. This variation of FHIT expression suggests that reversible epigenetic mechanisms of FHIT inactivation, rather than a deletion of the FHIT gene, are involved in tumor initiation and progression. P543 TREATMENT-INDUCED ANEMIA AND ITS POTENTIAL CLINICAL IMPACT IN PATIENTS RECEIVING SEQUENTIAL HIGH DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY FOR METASTATIC TESTICULAR CANCER dose chemotherapy (HD-Ctx) is under investi- gation in patients (pts) with ,,poor prognosis\" metastatic germ cell tumors (GCT) in order to improve survival. Despite the use of autologous PBSC transplantation and G-CSF chemotherapy dose intensification is associated with severe hematotexicity in-cluding anemia, which may significantly effect quality of life and tolerability of chemo-therapy. This study investigates the degree of anemia in pts receiving HD-Ctx for metastatic GCT and the impact of anemia on therapy outcome. Methods: 101 consecutive pts with ,,poor prognosis\" metastatic nonseminomatous GCT were treated with one cycle of standard plus three cycles of HD-VlP- chemotherapy (etoposide, ifosfamide, cisplatin) in a phase I/ll study. Blood cell counts were taken prior, during and after every cycle of chemotherapy and the num-bers of red blood cell (RBC) and platelet (PLq-) transfusions were recorded. A correlation of pretreatment and posttreatment Hb-values to response and overall survival was performed. Results: 48 % of the were anemic (Hb<12 g/dl) prior to the start of chemotherapy. The application of sequential HD-VlP resulted in median Hb nadirs between 7.8 g/ g/dl, 1st cycle) and 7.6 g/dl (6.0 -11.4 g/dl, 3rd cycle) despite the use of transfusions. During HD-Ctx 99% of the pts had Hb levels < 10 g/dl during HD- Ctx. The 97 pts received a median of 10 units (2-25) of RBCs during all four cycles of therapy. Time to first transfusion was shortest in pts with lowest initial Hb values. There was no prediction of outcome according to pretreatment Hb-levels. A significant survival difference in favour of pts with a Hb > 10.5 g/dl after therapy compared to those with Hb values < 10.5 g/dl was found with 3-year overall survival rates of 82 % versus 64 %, respectively (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Severe anemia is a very frequent side effect of sequential dose inten-sive therapy in pts with GCT with almost all pts becoming transfusion dependent. Despite the frequent use of RBC transfusions median Hb nadirs remained about 7.5-8 g/dl during therapy. In this homogenous group of pts with ,,poor prognosis\" metastatic disease Hb-values after therapy were associated with a worse treatment outcome. The explanations for this findings remain speculative and it should be reconined in subsequent trials. P544 AN EMPIRICAL METAANALYSIS EXPLORING QUALITY OF LIFE AFTER PROSTATE CANCER - FIRST RESULTS J.-U. Siebmann, B. debate on the impact of different treatment modalities for patients with prostate cancer on different aspects of quality of life has increased among urologists. Between 1996 and 2000 5 different groups (Ester, KlAn, Galalae, Biermann, Tunn/Kurek) conducted retrospective studies using the EORTC QLQ C30 and the prostate specific module developed by Biermann & KQchler since 1996. The Reference Center Quality of Life put together these studies for an empirical metaanalysis. The main objectives of this metaanalysis were re-analysing the module's psychometric properties, but also comparing quality of life following different treatment regimes, i.e. prostatectomy (PT) versus radio therapy (RT). The total sample consists of 1185 cases, of which 950 completed the quality of life questionnaires. First step in the psychometric analysis of the prostate specific module was a validation using principal component analysis as a standard procedure. The extracted factor's were ,,urinary strain\". Their reliabilities indicated overall good to sufficient psychometric properties with a Cronbach's a ranging from .70to .89 (except for 2 scales). Although RT patients showed comparatively worse values on many scales (physical, role and social functioning, diarrhoea, incontinence and pain) than PT patients, these differences cannot just be attributed to treatment modality, for age (RT patients are in average 6 years older, p<.001) and contraindication for PT may influence the result as well. Looking at the whole sample the patients rate their overall quality of life (,,global health\") comparatively low (m = 65.2, sd = 21,1), although they report only minor limitations on the functional and symptom scales (exceptions: fatigue for the whole sample and pain for RT patients). Referring to the prostate-specific module, ,,incontinence\", ,,erectile dysfunctions\", ,,sexual problems\" and ,,psychic strain\" seem to be major symptoms. Given the restrictions of a retrospective study, the subjective evaluation of ,,global health\" was shown to be mainly influenced by ,,psychic strain\", ,,fatigue\", ,,social S 108 Urogenital Tract Cancer including Prostate Cancer functioning\" and ,,pain\" (regression analysis, r square=.577). Conclusion: This metaanalysis generated a set of hypotheses concerning QoL of PCA patients which will be tested in a prospective study. P545 MARKER OF CHEMORESISTANCE AND PROGNOSIS More than 80 % of patients with Wilms' tumors can be cured today. Some patients, however, fail to respond to chemotherapy and those patients have a poor prognosis. In a search for molecular markers of chemoresistance and prognosis, we analyzed glutathione S-transferase-p (GST-p), DNA topoisomerase lla (TOP2a), multidrug resistance related protein 1 (MRP1), lung resistance related protein (LRP), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and the tumor suppressor p53. Immunohistochemistry was applied to 32 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens. The results were validated by real time RT-PCR, SSCP, and DNA sequencing. Expression of all proteins was found in the blastemal and epithelial compartments but to a significantly lesser extent in the stromal compartment. These results contribute to the discussion, whether the different histological components of Wilms' tumors arise from a common tumorigenic stem cell or not. Our results speak against an ancestry from a common malign clone in this tumor entity. Relationships between GST-p, TOP2a, LRP, or HSP70 expression and chemotherapeutic pretreatment of tumors were found. We conclude that preoperative chemotherapy altered the expression of drug resistance markers indicating a contribution to treatment outcome. Expression of p53, HSP70, or MRP1 correlated significantly with survival of children. The relationship to survival is a clue for the prognostic relevance of these markers. P53 was significantly associated with anaplasia. Furthermore, there was a significant relationship of MRP1 expression to p53, HSP70, and LRP pointing to a common regulation of these proteins. P546 CANCER OF THE PROSTATE: EFFECTS OF A SPECIFIC IN-CARE REHABILI- TATION PROGRAM AFTER RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY AND PREDICTION OF NEEDED TIME. RESULTS AFTER ONE YEAR FOLLOW-UP, U. Otto, O. Dombo, D. Berger, F. Petermann, W. Hoffmann, Klinik f. (Bad Wildungen- Reinhardshausen, Bochum, Bremen) Radical prostatectomy has established as gold standard for curative therapy of prostate cancer, decreasing mortality successfully. Nevertheless there is an impact on Life-Quality especially with the risks of post-prostatectomy incontinence and erectile dysfunction in spite of improved operative techniques. For treatment of functional deficits we developed a special in-patient rehabilitation program for three up to four weeks. Now definite results of a prospective study as part of a multi-center study on effectiveness and possible predictors of necessary time of stay can be presented. 153 patients after radical prostatectomy for clinically localized carcinoma of the prostate underwent the special new developed multimodal hospital rehabilitation program. They have been evalutated by self-assessment- and expert-assessment- scales for specific urological and oncological criteria, for physical performance, for psychosocial parameters and for disease-related Life-Quality measured by EORTC-QLQ-C30 and SF-36 at beginning and end of in-hospital rehabilitation program and 6 and 12 months later. Our data suggest that this specific new rehabilitation program with high-level mulitmodal status-diagnosis and flexible adaptation of intervention to patient's needs is highly effective in all intentions. The during the in-hospital stay achieved high-significant improvements for all therapy-intentions mostly show little further improvement during the next 6 months and all important parameters show stability after one year. Significant predictors for the necessary duration of in-hospital stay could be identified. The ultimate predictor is the degree of incontinence at the beginning of the in-care rehabilitation program. With our concept of in-patient rehabilitation the achievement of curative radical- prostatectomy can be combined with good Life-Quality without relevant functional impairment. P547 IS LOCAL CONTROL IMPROVED BY RADIOTHERAPY FOLLOWING ORGAN PRESERVING SURGERY FOR THE TREATMENT OF CONTRALATERAL TES- TICULAR SEMINOMA? D. Bottke, UK Benjamin Franklin, Klinikum Am Urban (Berlin) Objective: Five percent of patients (pts.) with a germ cell tumor of the testis present or develop a second primary tumor in the contralateral testis. Ablation of the remaining testis is the gold standard, resulting not only in infertility but also in a lifelong dependence on androgen substitution. An alternative to the standard practice is the testis preserving surgery followed by a postoperative radiotherapy (RT), which is need because of remaining testicular intraepithelial neoplasia (TIN) and possibly of interstitial seminoma cells. Methods: Between 1989 and 2000, 13 pts. with a seminoma of a solitary testis were treated by organ preserving enucleation resection. In all patients interstitial seminoma cells were found in at least one biopsy of margins. All patients had previously undergone contralateral orchiectomy. Intervals between manifestation of the primary and secondary tumors ranged from 28 to 173 months. 10 pts. underwent postoperative irradiation (median total dose: 20,0 Gy), 3 pts. refused radiotherapy. Results: The median follow-up was 33 months. 9 / 10 pts. (90%) with postopera- tive RT had no local recurrences. Their follow-up biopsies showed a uniform Sertoli cell-only pattern without the presence of TIN or other germ cells. One patient developed a local recurrence 6 months after surgery (histology: teratoma). Another patient developed a retropedtoneal progression 7 months after surgery. In contrast, 2 / 3 pts. (67%) without postoperative RT developed local recurrences, 4 and 64 months after surgery. Conclusions: Our data indicate that radiotherapy with 20 Gy following organ preserving surgery with interstitial seminoma cells found in at least one biopsy of margins for the treatment of germ cell carcinoma in the remaining testicle improves local control. P548 GENE EXPRESSION PROFILING FOR PROGNOSTIC EVALUATION OF TRANSITIONAL CELL CARCINOMA OF THE BLADDER M.-O. Grimm, O. significant effort to identify predictors of tumor progression in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder, no accepted histological, molecular or immunohistochemical marker exists to date. In this study the expression of 1188 genes was examined using a cDNA-microarray in order to characterize patients at risk for bladder cancer progression. 40 TCC specimen including 19 superficial (13 patients, group A) and 19 muscle invasive tumors as well as 2 lymph node metastases were analysed. 11 patients with muscle invasive disease suffered tumor recurrence despite cystectomy (group B) while 8 are alive after 52 months (group C). Total RNA was isolated, 32P- labelled cDNA-probes were generated and hybridised to the Atlas Human Cancer Array (CIontech) as recommended. Comparing progressive tumors (group B) and specimen of long-term survivors after cystectomy (group C) significant differences were observed for genes known to be involved in progression (e. g. matrix-metalloproteinases/-inhibitors) and so far unrelated genes (e.g. SOCS-3). For this analysis superficial tumors served as a control. Patients were grouped according to their gene expression profile using a hierarchical cluster analysis (Stanford Software). The ,,biological\" groups predicted by the gene expression pattern matched favourably with tumor stage and clinical outcome. Microarray based expression analysis seems to identify new markers for tumor progression. Furthermore, cluster analysis provides a tumor profile based on several hundreds of characteristics and might be able to predict the clinical behaviour of a tumor. P549 PROSTATE TUMOR CELL SPECIFIC UPREGULATION OF STROMELYSIN-3 (MMP-11) D. Mennerich, E. are a family of zinc-dependent proteinases. The MMPs have been implicated in the processes of tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. In several studies specific matrix metalloproteinases are shown to be overexpressed in malignant tumors and have been associated with an aggressive malignant phenotype in cancer patients, who have an adverse prognosis. Among the 20 family members of MMPs, stromelysin-3 (MMP-11) was first described in stromal fibroblastic cells from invasive breast carcinomas. Stromelysin- 3 is found to be secreted in an active form, whereas most of the other MMPs are activated extracellularly. The mature stromelysin-3 appears unable to degrade any major component of the extracellular matrix. In our recent study we analysed the expression pattern of stromelysin-3 on the RNA and protein level in 54 prostate tumor patients. After microdissection of matched normal and tumor prostate epithelium the prepared RNAs wer~ hybrid- ised on a custom made DNA-chip using Affymetrix technology. The observed expression profile for stromelysin-3 was confirmed by Taqman analysis using the prepared RNAs and by in situ hybridisations in tissue sections. In comparison to normal prostate stroma and epithilium we found no obvious differential transcrip- tion of the stromelysin-3 gene in prostate tumor and connective tissue cells, how it was shown in breast cancer patients. However, using the monoclonal mouse ST- 3 antibody specific for stromelysin-3 in immunohistochemical stainings revealed a slightly stromal cell specific upregulation of stromelysin-3 in 50 prostate carcinoma patients. Furthermore, the Iocalisation was not restricted to stromal cells like in normal prostate tissues, but it was also detected in high levels within prostate carcinoma cells. The recently described results of stromelysin-3 expression in breast cancer patients and our findings show that stromelysin-3 expression seems to be regu- lated not only at transcriptional, but is also controlled at translational levels. It can be hypothesized that stromelysin-3 has a unique role in tissue remodelling proc- esses, including those associated with prostate tumor progression, and repre- sents a particular target for the development of MMP inhibitors. S 109 Urogenital Tract Cancer including Prostate Cancer P550 ANTIGEN PROCESSING PATHWAY IN RENAL CELL CARCINOM IMPLICA- TIONS FOR AN IMMUNE ESCAPE MECHANISM - D. S. Ferrone, S. St~Srkel, Buffalo,NY, USA) Background: To determine the expression of components of HLA class I antigen processing machinery in renal cell carcinomas (RCC). Design: 133 RCC of different histological subtypes and grades as well as 32 matched metastasis and matched normal kidney tissue were immunohistochemically analyzed with the mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 148.3, recognizing the trans-porter associated with antigen subunit TAP1, the mouse mAb HC-10 recognizing a determinant expressed on the heavy chains of some HLA-A antigens and of all HLA-B antigens, and the mouse anti- b2-microglobulin (b2-m) mAb as well as the rabbit antibodies, recognizing the protea-some subunits, the low molecular weight proteins (LMP) LMP2 and Results: Normal LMP2, LMP7, TAPl,whereas b2-m and HLA class I heavy chains were detected on the cell membrane. Downregulation of HLA class I molecules and b2-m was de-tectable in 10% of RCCs. In contrast, 25%, 20% and of displayed a total lack of TAP1, LMP2 and LMP7. In addition, a downregulation of these components was found in 24%, 38% and 22% of RCCs, respectively. 18% of the primary tumors analyzed displayed a total loss of TAP1 and LMP2 protein, whereas a coordinated downregulation of both components was detectable in 20% of RCC. Furthermore, 19%,25% and in 22% of metastatic RCCs. TAP1 defects as well as those of LMP subunits and of HLA class I antigens were not associated with tumor grading and staging. Conclusion: Downregulation of various components of the HLA class I antigen processing machinery is a frequent event and may constitute a mechanism by which RCC cells evade immune recognition. P551 EXPRESSION OF HEPARANASE MRNA IN NORMAL RENAL TISSUE AND RENAL CELL CARCINOMAS S. Balabanov, U. Zimmermann, D. Poliklinik fQr Urologie (Greifswald) Introduction A critical process in tumor biology is the invasion, with its accompanied angiogenesis and followed metastasis. For this purpose compounds of extr~cellular matrix such as laminin, fibronectin, collagen and heparansulphate proteoglycan have to be destructed. The latter the enzyme heparanase, an endoglycosidase, is involved. Several studies have shown a relation between the level of heparanase expression and the metastatic potential of the tumour. For the renal cell carcinoma such details haven't been described yet. We have therefore analysed the level of expression of heparanase by mRNA-quantification by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Material and Methods Tumour samples and normal renal tissue from 10 patients were obtained immediatley after surgery and shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen. One part of each sample was examined histologically. The isolation of mRNA was performed with TRIzol reagent according to the manufactures protocol, cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of lpg of total RNA. In the same cDNA preparation and after selection of suitable primer pairs a PCR was performed. As a cell-activity independent standard we used 13-actin. The fragments were subsequently separated by gel electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel, visualized by ethidiumbromide and evaluated by the software programme ,,Imagequant\". Results: Expression of heparanase mRNA was proven in normal renal tissue and all renal cell carcinomas. Compared to normal tissue the expression is increased in tumours. All tissue samples showed histologically intact tumour tissue. Conclusion: We have shown that heparanase mRNA is increased in clear-cell renal carcinoma. Like in other malignant tumours the heparanase seems to play an important role in invasion, angiogeneeis and metastasis of renal cell carcinomas. P552 ACUTE TOXICITY IN 260 PATIENTS WITH LOCALISED PROSTATE CANCER TREATED WITHIN A PROSPECTIVE MULTICENTER PHASE-II TRIAL WITH COMBINED 3-D CONFORMAL RADIOTHERAPY (CRT) UP 74 GY WITH HORMONAL THERAPY (HT), F. Zimmermann, and acute toxicity (RTOG/EORTC) in prostate cancer patients treated with combined 3-D CRT\u00b1HT and internal immobilisation by a rectal balloon catheter. Material and Methods: 260 patients (pts.) have been enrolled since 3/1999 in an ongoing Phase II study. They were divided into three risk groups according to tumour differentiation, pretreatment PSA-values and T-stage. Low risk 74 Gy CRT (8 Gy boost with a reduced rectal margin ) and neoadjuvant HT. Risk adapted target definition was based on CT and MRI. A rectal balloon catheter was placed before each treatment for internal immobilisation of the rectum and the prostate and to reduce the dose to the dorsal rectal wall. Results: Of 260 pts. intended to treatment according to the protocol 7 pts. (3%) refused the rectal balloon. 15 pts (6%) did not tolerate the balloon after a dose of 20-68 Gy due to rectal discomfort. In 238 pts (91%) the balloon was applied until the end of treatment (181 pts. 70 Gy, 57 pts. 74 Gy); 36/238 pts. (15%) complained about painful application at the end of treatment. Acute rectal (GI) and genitourinary (UG) toxicity was mostly low to moderate (tab.). No significant difference between 70 Gy and 74 Gy has been observed. Conclusion: CRT 4- HT and internal immobilisation with a rectal balloon catheter up to a dose of 74 Gy was feasible. Acute toxicity is low and resolves in most of the patients within 6 weeks post-CRT.

Block, U. Introduction: This study evaluates the short term (<3 months) and long term (>3 months) toxicity after TPSI of patients with Iocalised prostate cancer. Patients/ Method: 100 were treated with TPSI (125-I-Rapid Strands\u00ae). low risk prostate cancer (cT1-2 Gleason Score <7 iPSA < 10 ng/m[). No patient had undergone a prior TUR-R The peripheral loading of the prostate was performed with a prescription dose of 145 Gy (NIST 1999). The mean 3,7 implantation needles. Preoperatively, every patient got an alpha blockade and antibiotic treatment. The transurethral catheter was removed 1 h after TPSI. Toxicity was monitored with the modified RTOG genitourinary toxicity scale. Results: The follow up ranged between 0,3 to 32,1 months, 81 patients had a follow up >3 months. Because of consequent coverage of the 0-retraction plane seed dislocation into the bladder occurred in 7%. These seeds were removed endoscopically and were reinserted immediately. Short term toxicity occurred in 100% of patients: grade 1: 92%, grade 2: 6% (urinary 2-7 days) and grade 3: 1% (interstitial laser coagulation because of obstruct!on). The extent of lower urinary tract symptoms correlated with the number of seeds implanted and the prostate volume. 3 months after TPBI no patients suffered from incontinence. Erectile disorders occurred in 24% patients treated, 83,3% of these patients responded to treatment with sildenafil and apomorphine respectively. Conclusions: All patients had lower urinary tract symptoms after TPSL However, Grade 2 and 3 toxicity occurred only in <10% of patients implanted. Toxicity can be influenced by medication of alpha blocker, anticholinergics and antibiotics sufficiently. No incontinence were observed as long term complication. The rate of erectile disorders was within the range literature reported. P554 THE PUTATIVE CALCIUM CHANNEL PROTEIN TRP-P8 IS OVEREXPRESSED made high density microarrays based on Affymetrix GeneChip technology we identified Trp-p8 as one of the most differentially expressed genes in prostate cancer patients. Our chip contains 4000 genes of which 1000 are known tumor associated genes. The remaining 3000 gene sequences were iden- tified from public and proprietary EST databases (e.g. dbEST) and shown to be differentially expressed using bioinformatic methods. We hybridized amplified RNA samples of 54 microdissected matched human prostate cancer and benign tissues.Trp-p8 was overexpressed in 50% (27 out of 54) of prostate cancer patients. These cancer chip experiments were confirmed by Realtime RT-PCR. Northern Blot hybridization showed that Trp-p8 is specifically expressed in normal prostatic tissue. It is not expressed in the other 14 normal tissues. The RNA expression results were supported by cancer profiling array hybridization expedments.Trp-p8 codes for a 1104 aa protein with several possible transmem- brahe domains. Both termini are probably located in the cytoplasm. Based on the high homology with the transient receptor potential calcium channel protein family Trp-p8 is assumed to be involved in the regulation of calcium influx. Our data suggest that the overexpression of Trp-p8 might play a key role in the altered regulation of calcium during the progression of prostate tumors. S 110 Urogenital Tract Cancer including Prostate Cancer P555 LAPAROSCOPIC NEPHROURETERECTOMY TO EXCLUDE UPPER URINARY TRACT MALIGNANCY ASSOCIATED WITH ANALGESIC NEPHROPATHY C. Doehn, is a potential cause of end-stage renal disease. Such patients have an elevated risk of developing upper urinary tract malignancies, predominantly transitional cell carcinoma. We present our experience with laparoscopic nephroureterectomy carried out in patients with analgesic nephropathy to exclude upper urinary tract malignancy.Patients and Methods: Since 1996, 11 patients (9 women and 2 men) with a long-term history of analgesic abuse underwent laparoscopic nephroureterectomy at our hospital. The median age was 63 years (range 51 to 70 years). All patients had developed end-stage renal failure due to heavy analgesic abuse with a median duration of 14 years (range 7 to 40 years). The median interval from the begin of hemodialysis to laparoscopic nephroureterectomy was 36 months (range 6 to 76 months). Results: The median operative time was 99 minutes (range 55 to 170 minutes). There were no conversions. Two complications occurred and 3 patients required blood transfusions. The median hospital stay lasted 5 days (range 2 to 12 days) and median reconvalescence was 20 days (range 6 to 44 days). In 7 patients the histopathological examination of the kidney revealed changes due to analgesic abuse. None of the patients had a transitional cell carcinoma. ]n 2 patients, however, a renal cell carcinoma was detected.Conclusions: Patients with analgesic nephropathy bear an elevated risk for the development of transitional cell carcinoma or renal cell carcinoma. In these patients laparoscopic nephroureterectomy combines minimally operative invasiveness with a maximum of diagnostic safety. P556 ANALYSIS OF INTRAVESICAL CHEMOTHERAPY OF SUPERFICIAL BLADDER CANCER WITH KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY PROCESSES: THE SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR Oncology-World GmbH (ML~nchen/Planegg) Introduction: Despite an obvious reduction in recurrence rate, a reduction in progression rate or improvement in disease-specific survival with intravesical chemotherapy is discussed controversly. Consequently, in the U.S. most of the available intravesical chemical agents are not approved by the FDA for adjuvant treatment in superficial bladder. Is there a rational for the more common usage in Europe? Methods: A systematic review of the relevant literature has been performed by knowledge discovery processes to evaluate the value of intravesical instillation-therapy with chemotherapeutic agents in superficial bladder cancer and the rational of its use as chemoprophylaxis.Results: Poor endpoints, insufficient length of the follow-up, underpowered sample size, poorly controlled studies, and the grouping of primary tumor stages Ta, T1 and Tis as well as grades I-III together are common problems of most studies. Dose and concentrations are mostly empirically derived and rarely tested systematically resulting in doubtful comparisons of study results. Additionally, it still remains unclear, which of the available agents for chemo-instillation is the most effective. In the United States, the only agents approved by the FDA for use in patients with superficial bladder cancer are thiotepa (only for the treatment of low-grade, low-stage papillary transitional cell carcinoma), and, recently, valrubicin (only for the treatment of refractory Tis). In Europe, the are more approved agents for intravesical chemo-instillation therapy, however, there is [aek of convincing data for its long term efficacy as prophylaxis. Conclusions: With respect to efficacy, instillation therapy reduces the recurrence rate in the short term , however longer follow up shows a limited effect. There are data which support the use of chemo-instillation as \"immediate\" perioperative chemotherapy, what is widely used in Europe and is being adopted more slowly in the United States. With respect to an effective adjuvant treatment a more stand- ardised scientific evaluation of intravesical agents with the aim of preventing recurrence is warranted. Publication only P'557 EXACT PREOPERATIVE STAGING OF PROSTATE CARCINOMA IS POSSIBLE BY prior to radical prostatectomy (RPE)is mandatory, but with current diagnostic procedures mostly insufficient. This prospective study should find a solution. Study design and results: During the last 3 years all patients with supposed localized prostate carcinoma were examined with 7,5 MHz-3-D-trans-rectal ultrasound (Combison 530, Kretztechnik)after cancer was histologically verified with biopsy. Staging decision was done by the third dimension (coronary level) to stage T1, T2 or T3. Patients than underwent RPE allowing correct staging thereafter. Tab. 1 shows the results of pre- and postoperative staging: Group preop.(TRUS) postop. (RPE) n T2 T3 E T3 T3 6 In 3 other patients sonography showed tumor staging > T3 (group F). in these patients RPE was avoided and bone metastases were found later. There was no overestimation of staging. Discussion: In 32 of the 44 patients in whom postope- rative staging by RPE was available correct prediction of localized tumor </= T2 was possible(B + C). In 9 other men (E + F) advanced tumors were predicted correctly. In 3 cases there was understaging (D, 2 pts.: pT3a; 1 pt. pT3b). Thus 3- D-transrectal ultrasound is a sensitive examination technique for correct staging of prostate cancer patients in over 90%. This is the first prospective study to show 3-D-TRUS to be su-perior over conventional 2-D-TRUS thus enabeling better decision making for therapy strategies. P'558 RENAL CELL CARCINOMA IN A KIDNEY TRANSPLANT: ALLOGENEIC GENOME IN THE TUMOR JUSTIFIES ORGAN-PRESERVING SURGERY M. Schostak, C. Goessl, H. Krause, K. Miller, Freie Universit~t Berlin (Berlin) INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES De novo renal cell carcinomas develop in 4.06 % after kidney transplantation, 0.5 % in the transplant. This is the first description of microsatellite analysis after organpreserving tumor resection. MATERIAL & METHODS A 29-year-old female patient underwent successful kidney transplantation in 1993. Good transplant function was achieved primarily and maintained. The ultrasound follow-up in July 1998 gave the first indication of a tumor at the upper pole of the transplant. A partial graft resection was performed under in situ perfusion. Microsatellite analysis of tumor versus endogenous tissue was done. RESULTS A renal cell carcinoma (pT1 GII RO) was found. After successful partial resection, renal function resumed immediately. Microsatellite analysis of tumor versus endogenous tissue identified the neoplasm as a renal cell carcinoma originating from the donor organ. The postoperative follow-up shows a symptom-free status (37th month). CONCLUSIONS Comparative microsatellite analysis first demonstrated that renal cell carcinomas in transplants also have an a]logeneic genome. The quality of life gained by avoiding hemodialysis justifies organ-preserving resection of smaller tumors in a transplant. P'559 A 65 YEAR OLD PATIENT WITH A FOLLICULAR DENDRITIC RETICULUM CELL TUMOR (FDC showing follicular cell differentiation are uncommon. 70% are located in lymph nodes of the neck, mediastinum and axilla, only 30% of these tumors are located in extranodal sites such as liver, tonsils and intraabdominal soft tissue. It is a rare tumor, first described in 1986 by Monda et al. FDC tumors are low grade malignant neoplasms with a pale cytoplasm, round nuclei and clear chromatin. Their biological behavior is more like a soft tissue tumor than a malignant lymphoma. The treatment of choice is surgical resection, the role of adjuvant therapy is not clear. Case: A woman presented with a tumor in the right pelvis measuring 4 x 4,5 cm, and two tumor manifestations in the right groin were seen in the computertomography of the pelvis. The 65 year old patient was in good condition and had no constitutional symptoms. The tumor was resected with the iliac vein and the vein was reconstructed. Histologically the picture was a follicular dendritic reticulum cell tumor. The post- operative course was uneventful. Treatment: The treatment of choice of FDC tumors is surgical resection. The value of chemotherapy or radiotherapy is uncertain. Because of the proximity of the tumor to the iliac vein we chose to administer six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of adriamycin (5Omg/m 2) and ifosfamid (1500mO/m ~ for 5 days). The therapy was well tolerated, the leucocyte nadir was 70O/pl. Furthermore we performed a consecutive radiotherapy of the tumor. Three months after chemotherapy, the patient is well and shows no tumor relapse. Conclusions: FDC-tumors have been estabished as a distinctive clinicopathologic entity with characteristic histopathological features. The minimum treatment is complete surgical resection, the role of radiotherapy and chemotherapy has not been established. $111 Gynecologic Cancer Gynecologic cancer Oral CARBOPLATIN-PACLITAXEL (CARBO-T) IN THE TREATMENT OF ADVANCED OVARIAN CANCER. A STUDY OF THE AGO OVARIAN STUDY GROUP, H-J. LL~ck, A. du Bois, B. Weber, J. Pfisterer, A. Goupil, W. Kuhn, Jc Barats, J. BIohmer, M. Mousseau, W. SchrSder, W. V. B. Hannover, Abstract: Since the publication of the GOG protocol 111 in 1996, and the results of the AGO trial Ovar-3 and the GOG protocol 158, the combination of platinum and paclitaxel adopted to the standart therapy in advanced ovarian cancer. But at all long-term survival data are still pending. One option for archiving further progress in the first-line treatment of advanced ovarian cancer might be the addition of non-cross-resistant drugs to the two drug regimen. Meta-analysie showed a survival benefit for platinum-anthracycline based combinations as compared to platinum-based combinations without anthracyclines. A AGO phase 1/11 trial encompassing epirubicin in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in untreated patients with gynaecologic malignancies. Based on the results of this study a randomised phase III trial together with the French GINECO group was conducted. The trial started 11/1997 and was closed 11/1999. At all 1281 patients were randomised. Currently, 1132 end-of-therapy reports have been issued. 989 (87%) patients completed 6 cycles of treatment. Of these patients, treatment and toxicity data are available. 335 patients had a measurable residual tumor after initial debulking surgery. Response data of 228 patients (111 ET-Carbo, 117 Carbo-T) are available. O561 CHARACTERIZATION OF A NEW TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR GENE AS A TARGET FOR GENE THERAPY IN OVARIAN CANCER S. Kr&mer, Y. Yu, C. Brumm, R. Bast Jr., M. Beckmann, Universit~.ts-Frauenklinik Erlangen, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center (Erlangen, Houston) Objective: The biological heterogeneity of epithelial ovarian cancers relates to multiple genetic and epigenetic changes acquired during oncogenesis. Using differential display PCR ARHI (Aplysia Ras Homology Member t) was identified that is expressed consistently in normal ovarian epithelial cells but not in ovarian cancer. This gene was cloned, sequenced and localized on chromosome lp31. The tumor-suppressor function of ARHI was evaluated analyzing differential gene expression, mechanisms of ARHI gene silencing and the impact of ARHI transfection and adenoviral ARHI transduction. Materials and Methods: Differential expression of ARHI and P26ARHI was analyzed with Northern and Western blots. For examination of imprinted gene expression, constructed mouse A9 hybrid cells were used, that contained a single human chromosome 1 whose parental origin was determined. PCR-LOH analysis was performed with 6 flanking microsatellite markers. Clonogenic assays were performed to evaluate the impact of ARHI lipofectamine transfection of ovarian .cancer cells via pcDNA3-neo expression vectors. Luciferase activity was measured to determine the influences of ARHI transfection on cyclin D1 promoter activity. The effects of Ad5CMV-ARHI transduction were evaluated by cell-counting, fluorescent staining. Results: ARHI and P26ARHI are expressed in consitent]y in normal ovarian epithelial cells but not in ovarian cancers. ARHI is downregulated by three different mechanisms. In 41% of ovarian cancers, LOH was found, the retained allele was silenced by methylation during gametegenesis (genomic imprinting) and in 31% expression appears to be lost by transcriptional regulation based on hypermethylation of the ARHI promoter region (CpG island 1). More than 90 % growth inhibition occured in seven of eight cell lines after infection with Ad5CMV- ARHI if a viral dose leading to at least 50 % of cells infected was used. ARHI transduction leads to apoptosis but no G1 arrest was determined. Conclusion: ARHI appears to be a putative tumor-suppressor gene whose function in abrogated in ovarian cancer. Fine mapping of chromosome lp31 suggests that additional sites of LOH are found contromeric to ARHI, consistent with the possibility that other imprinted tumor-suppressor genes could be clustered in this region. Further evaluation of ARHI should elucidate its potential prognostic significance and its possible value for gene therapy in human ovarian cancer. 0562 ASSOCIATION OF GLUT-1 EXPRESSION WITH THE MALIGNANT TRANSFOR- MATION OF CERVICAL NEOPLASMS emission tomography studies on cervical cancer have shown that tumor growth and elevated glucose uptake are associated. On a molecular level, glucose uptake is mediated by the specific glucose transport protein Glut-l, which exhibits an altered expression in different malignant nee- plasms. The objective of this study was to determine wether Glut-1 is present in malignant cervical tissue and wether that presence is of biologic significance. Material and methods: Tissue samples from 48 patients with CIN III lesions, 42 patients with CIN I and II lesions and 94 patients with invasive carcinomas respectively 22 patients with cervical lymphnode metastasis were investigated. Biopsies of the cervix uteri from 38 patients with benign changes served as controls. Immunohistochemistry was performed using polyclonal antibodies and by means of ABC-immunoperoxidase technique and was evaluated semiquantitatively. In situ Hybridisation was performed using 33P-labeled sense and antisense cRNA riboprobes for rat Glut-l. Results: We observed weak expression of Glut-1 protein and mRNA in normal epithelium, a marked expression of Glut-1 throughout preneoplastic lesions, which correlated well with the degree of dysplasia (p< 0,01). In carcinoma in situ, cervical cancer and metastasis, Glut-1 was expressed strongly. There was a high concordance between Glut-1 protein expression and mRNA concentration. Conclusion: This is the first study that demonstrates the association of Glut-1 with the malignant transformation of cervical tissue. These results pointed toward the potential relevance of Glut-1 as diagnostic tool and of glucose metabolism as a therapeutic target in cervical cancer. This is of special interest as Glut-1 seems to be the most important glucose transporter in malignant tumor cells. 0563 COMPARISON OF PROTEIN-AND PEPTIDE-BASED VACCINES AND OPTIMAL INTERLEUKIN COMBINATIONS IN VITRO FOR CYTOTOXIC IMMUNE CELL ACTIVATION AGAINST HPV16/18-RELATED CERVICAL CANCER A. Ferrara, A. Kather, A. Schneider, M. DLirst, A. M. Kaufmann, FSU Jena, Frauenklinik (Jena)Cervical cancer is associated with infection by ,,high risk\" human papillomaviruses. The viral oncogenes E6 and E7 are constantly expressed by the tumor cells. Immune reactions, especially T cell responses, towards these tumor associated antigens have been demonstrated. Effective therapeutic vaccines against cervical cancer include HPV 16/18 synthetic peptides. We compared i) the loading of dendritic cells with recombinant protein or long 20-met peptides as antigen and ii) the enhancing effect of certain cytokines. Here we show that the immune system is capable of excising the exact MHC class 1/11 binding epitopes from both recombinant proteins and long 20-met peptides with comparable efficiency. These epitopes are presented to antigen specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Therefore, long peptide-based vaccines may be advantageous because of their higher purity and GMP quality. They permit a simplified loading procedure of dendritic cells and circumvent HLA-restriction due to processing of all possible epitopes. However, cervical cancer tumor cells have a tendency during tumor progression and metastatic dissemination to down-regulate or suppress MHC class I antigens. Thereby tumor cells, and metastatic cells in particular, evade the host immune response. The aim of our study is to compare different interleukin combinations in order to optimally activate the cytetoxic cell population, including NK cells for lysis of HLA-negative tumor cells. 0564 EXPRESSION OF INTEGRATED HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS ONCOGENS E6/E7 IS ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIFOCAL PROGRESSION OF CARCINOMA IN SITU OF THE VULVA (BOWENS DISEASE) P. Melsheimer, S. Carcionoma in situ of the vulva (VIN3) is considered to be a precursor lesion of invasive epithelial cancer of the vulva. VIN3 and invasive cancer of the vulva are associated with HPV high risk type infection. Integration of HPV oncogens (E6/E7) is required to induce and maintain the neoplastic phenotype of epithelial cervical cancer cells. Aim of this study was to find out wheather there is an association between expression of integrated HPV16 E6/E7 encogens and development of multifocal VIN3 after Iokal destructive therapy. Methods: For this prospective cohort trial data was recruited from consecutive patients of the colposcopy unit of a university hospital. 22 women with HPV16 positiv VIN3 were tested before and after standardised lekal destructive therapy (laser) for expression of integrated HPV16 oncogens (E6/E7) and followed up for multifocal recurrances. HPV types were analysed in tissues from fresh frozen punch biopsies by HPV L1 consensus primer PCR (RFLP). Expression of integrated HPV16 E6/E7 oncogens was detected by a previously described protocol for the amplification of integrated papillomavirus oncogene fusion-transcripts (APOT). Integration sites of oncogenes were determined by sequence analysis of fusion- transcripts.Results: The probability for VIN3 to develop multifocal recurrances after lekal destructive therapy was significantly higher in women expressing integrated HPV16 E6/E7 oncogens (p=0.018, log-rank test). The interval in women expression of integrated HPV oncogens to develop multifocal recurrances after therapy was 22.1 months (median) compared to 41.2 months on those with solely detection of episemal HPV16 DNA without HPV integration. Wemens'age (mean 38.7 years) was without influence for the outcome. In all APOT+ cases HPV oncogenes had identical integration sites in primary and multifocal recurring lesions. Therefore multifocal recurrances of VIN3 might be assumed to be of clonal origin. Conclusions: Expression of integrated HPV16 E6/E7 oncogens in VIN3 was demonstrated to be associated with the increased risk of devopment of multifocal progression after Iokal destructive therapy (laser) and therefore might be considered to signal an increased risk for devolpment of invasive epithelial cancer of the vulva. S 112 Gynecologic Cancer Poster P565 EXTRAPERITONEAL LYMPH NODE DISSECTION FOR EVALUATION OF PATIENTS WITH CERVICAL CANCER A. Hasenburg, J.K. USA) Objective: of nodal metastases is the most important prognostic factor in cervical cancer. Although cervical cancer is still clinically staged and the benefit of surgical staging or debulking of involved lymph nodes remains contro- versial, histological examination of abdominopelvic lymph nodes is an important component in the management of cervical cancer. To adjust our therapy based on the true extent of the patient's disease, we perform an extraperitoneal lymph node dissection (EPLND) in all patients with cervical cancer prior to radiotherapy (RT) or radical hysterectomy. Methods: 33 patients with carcinoma of the cervix underwent EPLND. The value of this procedure as a diagnostic tool for monitoring the extension of the disease was determined. Additionally, EPLND/RT associated treatment complications were monitored. Results: The combined treatment approach of EPLND with RT or chemotherapy/ RT was without major complications. 19 patients showed a temperature eleva- tion, but only one patient had a fever of greater than 39.0oC.14 of 29 patients (48.3%) experienced some degree of proctitis or diarrhea and 3 (10.3%) cystitis during the course of RT. No grade 3 or 4 acute or late genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicities were noted. EPLND changed the clinical management for 6 patients with stage I and Ila disease and positive lymph nodes from a radical hysterectomy to RT and for 7 patients with involvement of common lilac or paraaortic lymph nodes from standard field RT to extended field RT (EFRT). Without EPLND these 7 patients would have received RT with standard pelvic fields that would not have treated involved lymph node areas at high risk for subsequent failure. Conclusion: 13 of 29 (44.8%) patients received a different treatment than would otherwise have been administered with standard treatment planning. Therefore, we suggest to perforn an EPLND in patients with cervical cancer prior to radical surgery or RT. P566 A PROTEIN CONTAINING THE DHHC DOMAIN IS UPREGULATED IN OVARIAN CARCINOMAS. A. Marm~, Ovarian Cancer is still the gynecological tumor with the highest mortality. Early diagnosis and biological characterization of the tumors will be crucial to improve prognosis and individualize therapy of the disease. The aim of this study was to identify genes which are differentially expressed in ovarian carcinoma and encode proteins which could serve as marker proteins or targets for novel biological therapies. Amongst others found by differential display analysis, a cDNA encoding a protein with a conspicuous cysteine-rich motif was found to be overexpressed in ovarian tumors. Methods: Cells were obtained by taking swabs from ovarian carcinomas as well as from normal epithelium of the distal inner part of the fallopian tube from the same patients, or from ovarian surface epithelium. Samples contained > 95% epithelial cells as judged by quantitative PCR with primers for cDNAs specific for hematopoietic and stroma cells. CDNA of cells microdissected from frozen tissue sections was used for quantitative PCR. Differential display was performed using a modification of Liang's and Pardee's method and a different set of primers. Differential gene expression was confirmed by PCR using gene-specific primers and quantitation in the Agilent Bioanalyser system. Results: By differential display analysis, a 379 bp cDNA fragment was found to be 4-30 fold overexpressed in 4 out of 5 ovarian tumors analyzed (one borderline tumor and 4 serous carcinomas). Databank searches showed it to encode a member of the DHHC-family of proteins featuring a strictly conserved cysteine- rich domain. The overexpression was confirmed by quantitative PCR using cDNA from tumor as well as microdissected ovarian surface epithelium. Data bank searches revealed a protein from the DHHC family containing a strictly conserved cysteine rich domaine. These proteins are highly expressed in developing tissues in the later stages of organogenesis whereas expression in adult tissues is much more limited. Conclusions: A cDNA found to be upregulated in ovarian tumors encodes a member of the highly conserved DHHC protein family. The degree of conservation indicates its important role in cellular functions. Its involvement in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer and its possible use as a prognostic marker have to be further investigated. P567 P53 TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVITY IS MODIFIED BY STEROID RECEPTOR COACTIVATORS TIF2 SRC1 coactivators on p53 transcriptional activity was tested. Methods: Cervical cancer cells HeLm, breast cancer cells MCF-7, and ovarian cancer cells SK-OV-3 as well as OVCAR-3 were cotransfected with expression vectors for p53, nuclear receptor coactivators and a ]uciferase expressing p53 reporter piasmid. Expression of coactivators and nuclear receptors was analyzed by RT-PCR analysis including additional 17 ovarian cancer cell lines. Results: Nuclear receptor coactivators p30O and p/CAF and steroid AIB1, SRC1 TIF2 all enhanced p53 transcriptional activity but were differentially active, depending on the cell line tested. AIB1 was the most effective steroid receptor coactivator on p53 activity in all cell lines tested. Expression analysis for coactivators revealed significant differences for AIB1 and TIF2 expression levels among 19 ovarian cancer cell lines tested. No relation to p53 mutation status or glucocorticoid receptor expression status was observed. All estrogen receptor-positive ovarian cancer cell lines overexpressed AIB1. Overexpression of TIF2 was found independent of estrogen receptor expression. Conclusion: p53 activity relied on the steroid receptor coactivators AIB1, SRC1 and TIF2 and the p3O0 and p/CAE P568 MULTIFOCAL AND MULTICENTRIC PROGRESSION OF VAGINAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (VAIN 3) IS ASSOCIATED WITH EXPRESSION OF INTEGRATED HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS ONCOGENS P. Melsheimer, S. Vinocourova, G. Bastert, Universit&t Heidelberg (Heidelberg) Background: Independent risk factors for development of invasive vaginal carcinoma are diagnosis of multifocal or multicentric VAIN3. Integration of HPV oncogens (E6/E7) is required to induce and maintain the neoplastic phenotype of cervical cancer cells. The expression of these integrated oncogens is associated with progression of CIN. Aim of this study was to find out wheather there is an association between expression of integrated HPV16 E6/E7 oncogens and development of multifocal and/or multicentric VAIN3. Methods: For this study data was gained from consecutive patients of the colposcopy unit of a university hospital. To study the influence of expression of integrated HPV16 E6/E7 oncogens on the development of muitifocal progression 9 women with VAIN3 (HPV16+) were tested before and after Iokal destuctive therapy for expression of integrated HPV oncogens (E6/E7) and followed up for multifocal recurrances. To study the influence of expression of integrated HPV16 oncogens on development of multicentric lower genital tract neoplasia 16 women with multicentric VAIN3 (all having developed VaiN3 after hysterectomie because of CIN3) and 90 women with monocentric CIN3 were tested for fusion-transcripts of integrated HPV oncogenes in the frame of a case control study. HPV types were analysed in tissues from fresh frozen punch biopsies by HPV L1 consensus primer PCR (RFLP). Expression of integrated HPV16 E6/E7 oncogens was detected by a previously described protocol for the amplification of integrated papil]omavirus oncogene fusion-transcripts (APOT). Integration sites of oncogenes were determined by sequence analysis of fusion-transcripts. Results: The probability for VAIN3 to develop multifocal recurrance after Iokal destructive therapy was significantly higher in women expressing integrated HPV oncogens (p=0.01, log-rank test). In all APOT+ cases HPV oncogenes had identical integration sites in primary and multifocal recurring lesions. In multicentric ValN3/CIN3 multivariate analysis (logistic regression models) reveald a significantly higher prevalence of fusion-transcripts from integrated HPV16 oncogenes than in monofocal CIN3 with an Odds Ratio of 16.3 (p=0.0023), independant womens' age. Conclusions: Expression of integrated HPV16 E6/E7 oncogens in VAIN3 was demonstrated to be associated with multifocal and multicentric progression and therefore might be considered to signal a risk for devolpment of invasive vaginal cancer. P569 LACK OF CORRELATION BETWEEN EX VIVO CHEMOSENSITIVITY AND P53 MUTATIONS IN OVARIAN CARCINOMAS C. M. KSIn, University of Portsmouth (K6ln; Portsmouth, GB) While loss of p53 function has been associated with worse prognosis in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) its predictive value towards increased chemoresistance still remains debatable (Kurbacher et. al., Proc. AACR 1998). In breast cancer, point mutations in the functional domains of the p53 gene (exons 5-9) rather than occurrence of mutated p53 protein per se has been demonstrated to confer to increased doxorubicin resistance (Aas et al, Nature Med. 1996). We have analyzed 54 clinical tumor samples derived from patients with advanced primary (n=31) or recurrent EOC (n=23) for both mutated p53 by routine immunohistochemistry (IHC) and for p53 point mutations in exons 5-9 by PCR and sequencing of the genomic DNA. Ex vivo chemosensitivity testing was performed in the same tumors using the ATP-based tumor chemosensitivity assay (ATP-TCA; Andreotti et al., Cancer Res. 1995) using a panel of 9 single agents such as cisplatin (DDP), samples were found to be p53+ by IHC (33%). A total of 11 p53 point mutations (9 missense, 1 nonsense, 1 silent) were found in either 4 primary and recurrent EOC (15%), three of them regarded to be wild type (p53WT) by IHC. Only one recurrent tumor carried more than one point mutation. Ex vivo chemosensitivity against all regimens tested did not differ significantly between p53WT and p53+ tumors classified by IHC. Moreover, the group of tumors with p53 point mutations generally did not exhibit higher overall S 113 Gynecologic Cancer drug resistance. Controversially, higher ex vivo sensitivity could be detected for MX, MX+PCT, and DDP+dFdC. However, broad pleiotropie chemoresistance could be demonstrated in one particular EOC carrying 4 different point mutations located in exon 5 of the p53 gene. We therefore conclude that neither mutated p53 status identified by ICH nor single point mutations in exons 5-9 of the p53 gene which are relatively rare are reliable predictors of chemoresistance in EOC. P570 INTERLEUKIN 1 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST (IL-1RA) POLYMORPHISM AS A GENETIC DETERMINANT IN PATIENTS WITH CERVICAL CANCER A. Mustea, J. Sehouli, D. K6nsgen, (IL-1Ra) anti-inflammatory cytokine that binds specifically to the IL-1 receptor without triggering signal transduction. Different studies reported increased levels in patients with gynaeco]ogica[ malig- nancies. Polymorphism is present in intron 2 of the human ]L-1RA gene and were described in patients with benign diseases and in gastric cancer. There is lack of data in patients with cervical cancer. Methods In a prospective case control study we investigated the relation between polymorphism in the gene encoding for the IL-1RA and the clinical data of patients with cervical cancer. Blood samples were analysed and DNA was extracted. The genomic DNA fragments were amplified by PCR. Results: One hundred three women with cervical cancer and one hundred seven control women (with benign disorders) were enrolled. The median (range) age of the patients with cervical was 46 (25-80) years. 58.4% were in stage T1 or T2 and 41.6% in T3/4, respectively. The distribution of genotype frequencies was signifi- cantly different between the study and control group with respect to allele 2 heterozygotes (IL-1 RA 1/2; 24.8% vs. 13.1%; p=0.04). No statistically significant differences were observed in patients with cervical cancer in comparison to the control group in the frequencies of allele 1/3 (4.4% vs. 3.7%) and homozygous allele 2. Only one women with cervical cancer was identified as a homozygote for allele 3, additional nine patients for allele 2. In the control group three women were heterozygous for allele 2/3. No statistically significant differences were observed in the correlation between IL-1 RA 1/2 polymorphism and tumour stage (p=0.5), grade of tumour differentiation (p=0,4), recurrence status (p=0.5) and age at treatment (p=0.5). Conclusion:These data support the role for allele 2 of the gen encoding for ILl-hA as genetic determinant of cervical cancer. P571 WEEKLY CARBOPLATIN (C) AND DOCETAXEL (D) AS NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT FOLLOWED BY RADICAL SURGERY (RS) IN PATIENTS (PTS) WITH PRIMARY LOCALLY ADVANCED CERVICAL CANCER (LACC): A PHASE II STUDY D.T. Rein, P. of this phase II trial was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of weekly administration of C and D as preoperative chemotherapy in LACC. The study is based on the results of a previously performed dose-finding study of dose-dense weekly administration of C and D (ASCO 2000, # 1606). Eligibility criteria: Chemotherapy-nafve patients, histologically cervical cancer stage IIB-IVA), age 18-65 years; WHO performance status 0-2; no previous systemic anticancer treatment, normal organ function, written informed consent. C (AUC 2) and D (35 mg/m2) were administered weekly for up to 9 courses. To date, 23 pts (median age 40.2 yrs, WHO performance status 0-2) received a total of 163 cycles, with a median of 8 cycles (range 6-9) per patient. Dose reduction was not required in any case. None of the patients developed grade Ill/IV leucepenia, anemia or thrombocytopenia. The non-hematological toxicity was generally mild. All 23 pts were evaluable for response (pts): CR 4 , PR 14 , SD 3, PD 2. The overall response rate was 78.2%. All responding patients underwent RS according to Wertheim-Meigs and postoperative radiotherapy. We conclude that dose-dense weekly application of C and D is a feasible, efficacious and well- tolerated regimen in patients with LACC. P572 EXACT QUANTIFICATION OF TETRASPANIN GENE EXPRESSION BY MAM- MARY CARCINOMA CELL LINES: DEFINED THRESHOLD VALUES BETWEEN INVASIVE AND NON-INVASIVE CELLS G. Sauer, R. Grundmann, J. proteins involved in a number of basic cellular functions including proliferation, adhesion, migration, and tumor cell invasion. For several members of the tetraspanin family, expression has been demonstrated to be inversely correlated with tumor growth and metastasic potential of certain cancer cell types. Purpose of our investigations was to measure the expression of four tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, CD82 and CD151) expressed by mammary tumor cell lines exactly to define threshold values for the transition to highly invasive phenotypes. Methods: The expression of CD9, 0D63, 0D82 21 mammary carcinoma-derived cell was detemined by absolute quantification of mRNA by ,,Taqman\" real time RT-PCR . These cell lines had been classified by Tong et al. (Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 56:91-97, 1999) according to their ability to penetrate collagen-fibroblast gels in vitro. Results: We demonstrate that expression of tetraspanins below a defined threshold value by breast carcinoma-derived cells is significantly associated with in vitro invasiveness. On basis of a tetraspanin expression profile, in vitro invasiveness is clearly predictable. For this purpose most informative tetraspanin expression ratios are calculated. Conclusion: Our investigations suggest that the downregulation of tetraspanins in breast cancer cells is closely associated with tumor progression to more invasive and metastasizing cells. This underlines their substantial impact on regulation of cell adhesion and migration as adaptor molecules of multimolecular membrane protein complexes. However, the prognostic value of exact quantificaton of tetraspanin expression remains to be shown for primary breast tumors. Further functional characterization of tetraspanin complexes may reveal new targets for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the management of breast cancer. P573 QUALITY ASSURANCE IN GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY; IMPACT OF PARTICI- PATING IN TRIALS ON THE QUALITY OF TREATMENT OF ADVANCED OVARIAN CANCER IN GERMANY. A SURVEY BY THE AGO ORGANKOMMISSION OVAR, THE AGO STUDIENGRUPPE OVARIALKARZlNOM, AND to evaluate the impact of participation in clinical trials on the pattern of care of patients (pts) with advanced ovarian cancer in Germany. Methods: We performed a retrospective survey and selected 87 institutions representative of all hospitals treating ovarian cancer in Germany. Selection of hospitals was based on an earlier survey. Records from all ovarian cancer patients treated between July and September 2000 were evaluated, and after in-house documentation cross-checked with blinded surgery and pathology reports. The impact of participation in prospective clinical trials on pattern and results of surgical and chemotherapeutic treatments were analyzed. Results: 501 pts were included, of whom the 411 pts with FIGO stage lIB-IV were selected. The study population represented about 30% of all pts with advanced ovarian cancer treated in Germany during this period. Only about two thirds of pts received a treatment according to actual standard recommendations. There was a considerable heterogenity with respect to type of institution (participating in clinical trial or not), although age and FIGO stage did not differ among both types of institutions. Pts treated in hospitals participating in clinical trials had a significant higher chance of getting a standard-type operation (TAH + BSO +omentectomy), and ending operation with a postoperative tumor residual with a diameter of less than 2 cm. The latter was observed both in pts enrolled in trials and pts being treated outside a trial (in a hospital participating in trials). Again, pts treated in hospitals participating in trials had a significant higher chance to receive a chemotherapy regimen according to standard recommendations: 92% in hospitals participating in trials vs 58% in hospitals not participating in clinical trials. The latter treated about three quarters of all pts in the observation period. Conclusion: Pts. treated in hospitals participating in clinical trials have a significant higher chance of being treated according to standard recommendations and to achieve better treatment results. Participation in clinical trials could be one of the selection criteria for pts and physicians when choosing the institution for primary treatment of ovarian cancer. Based on this results indicating a significant room for improvement, the AGO ORGANKOMMISSlON OVAR has started an AKTIONS- PROGRAMM aiming at an optimization of care for pts with ovarian cancer in Germany. P574 TESTING FOR CHEMOSENTIVITY IN ASCITES OF PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED OVARIAN CANCER N. Benzian, J. Sehouli, D. Objective: Epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) is the leading cause of death from gynaecologic malignancies in Western countries. More than 75% of all patients have advanced disease (FIGO-Stage Ill/IV) at time of diagnosis. Despite high primary clinical response to chemotherapy more than 65% of all patients with advanced OC will experience only stable disease, progression or recurrence. To identify the collective who has benefit from the chemotherapy is one of the biggest challenge in the clinical day. Previous studies have shown that the High- Density-Culture (HDC) allows gynecological tumours derived from various origins to grow three-dimensionally, to reorganize and to redifferentiate histiotypically. In the present study we extended these investigations to human ascitic fluid in order to find out whether it can be cultivated successfully, to study the growth characteristics of tumor cells in ascitic fluid under the conditions of the HDC and finally to find out if testing for chemosensibility with HDCs of ascitic fluid is possible. Materials and methods: 10 samples of ascitic fluid from patients with OC were centrifuged, dissociated into single-cell suspensions, dropped in HCD on a membrane filter of cellulose nitrate at gas-medium interface and grown in vitro. Chemosensitivity was tested according to clinical administration by adding cytostatic substances into the growth medium underneath the culture nodules. Results: Cultivation of nine samples of ascitic fluid was feasible in the HDC. First morphologic studies showed that tumor cells of ascitic fluid are able reorganize to three-dimensional plaques. Chemosensitivity-testing was performed five times without difficulties. Drug response patterns varied among the different individual samples. $114 Gynecologic Cancer Conclusion and outlook: The present investigations suggest that the HDC is a suitable method for cultivating tumor cells derived from malignant ascites. Pilot studies showed that chemosensitivity-testing with three-dimensional cultures from ascitic fluid is feasible. Ascitic fluid is routinely observed in most patients with OC and can be obtained without difficulties. The possibility of pre-clinical chemosensitivity-testing with HDC from ascites would be of great convenience for patients and clinicians. Further research will be performed to consolidate our recent findings, to compare the experimental findings with clinical results and to fortify the methodology of this innovative pre-clinical testing. P575 INFLUENCE OF ANEMIA ON TUMOR GROWTH AND TUMOR CONTROL- AN INVESTIGATION ON ADVANCED CERVICAL CANCERS G. Haensgen, U. Krause, F.W. Rath, J. Dunst, Martin-Luther-Universit~t (Halle) Background: relationship between pre-treatment hemoglobin level and outcome is well-known in tumor patients. We investigated the correlation between pre- treatment hemoglobin, microvessel density (MVD) and the proliferation index on local response in advanced cervical cancer. Material and Methods: The prospective study between 1995 - 1999 comprises of 87 patients with advanced cervical cancer with FIGO stage liB (19), IIIB (59) and IVA (9), who were treated by definitive radiotherapy (external beam and HDR-Afferloading) in curative intention. The tumorspecific 3-year-survival was analyzed dependend on tumorstage and pre-treatment hemoglobin as well as the hemoglobin level at 20 Gy. Prior to therapy biopsies were taken in 46 pts. and stained by immunohistochemistry with anti-CD31 for microvessel density. From the same biopsy investigations by flowcytometry were performed for S-phase-determination as an marker for proliferation. For data analysis SPSS 9.0 was used. Results: Stage IVA (FIGO) in comparison to stages liB and llIB (p=0.0012) and pre-treatment hemoglobin at a cut-off level of 11g/dl (p=0.0018) were revealed as independent significant prognostic factors. Concerning the microvessel density we found a worse 3-year-survival for patients with tumors with high microvessel density (median 128/10 HPF) 41+ 24% (n=24) in a low density 69 + 11% (n=22). The correlation for MVD was not significant p = 0.12. For hemoglobin level and microvessel density we could confirm a trend with p=0.08.1n an multifactorial analysis a survival benefit (p<0.05) for non-anemic patients neither pre-treatment nor at 20 Gy (Hb>l lg/dl) compared to patients with decreasing hemoglobin level over radiotherapy was found. Local tumor progression was seen frequently in patients with stage IVA (relative frequency 0.67) and in anemic patients (0.38 Hb< 11g/dl vs. 0.20 Hb> 11g/dl). Anemic patients showed a higher prolifaration rate with 25 + 16% versus 17 + 10% of cells in S-phase (p=0.059). Conclusion: Tumor anemia worsens prognosis on local response in patients with advanced cervical cancer. Tumors with high proliferation rate are more common in anemic patients. The treatment of anemia may improve local response but does not promote aggressiveness of tumors. P576 TUMOR INFILTRATING LYMPHOCYTES OF HPV16- OR HPV18- POSITIVE CERVICAL CARCINOMA PATIENTS ARE DIRECTLY ACTIVATED IN VITRO BY AUTOLOGOUS HPV-E7 ANTIGEN LOADED DENDRITIC CELLS M. Norm, M. Schinz, A. Schneider, M. D0rst, A. M. Kaufmann, FSU Jena, Frauenklinik (Jena) Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and persistence is highly associated with the development of cervical cancer. HPV type 16 and HPV type 18 are the most prevalent HPV genotypes in cervical cancers. The enceproteins E6 and E7 of these two viruses are constitutively expressed and are considered as tumor- specific antigens. The most potent antigen presenting cells are dendritic cells (DC), which express abundant MHC I, MHC I1 and costimulatory molecules and are used as natural adjuvants for immunotherapy. DC loaded with HPV16/18-E7 protein are capable to induce a specific T cell response in vitro in healthy individuals, in order to demonstrate that E7 protein pulsed DC are possible vaccines for cervical carcinoma patients we have analysed their potency to activate isolated tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in vitro. TILs of 12 patients were isolated and cultured with either interleukin-2 and -7 alone (control) or in addition expanded with anti CD3/28 magnetic beads. To assess the presence and activation of E7 specific T cells and to compare the TIL populations their IFN-gamma release was measured by stimulation with autologous E7 protein pulsed DC in ELISpot assays. In the control (Interleukins alone) TIL populations 2/ 12 patients showed a specific IFN-gamma secretion during stimulation with autologous E7 pulsed DC. After activation with anti CD3/28 magnetic beads an additional patient became positive. Interestingly, in these cultures the frequency of E7 specific TILs increased by a factor >2,3 leading to a overrepresentation in comparison to control cultures. We demonstrate here that autologous E7 protein pulsed DC can activate E7 specific TILs ex vivo in cervical cancer patients. Unresponsiveness may be due to lack of E7 specific T cells in the tumor. P577 THE PROGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE OF TOPOISOMERASE II IN OVARIAN CANCER U. Hahn, S. Schreiber, G. Wittmann, G. Bastert, Universit~.ts-Frauenklinik (Heidelberg) ]-opoisomerase Ilalpha a cell-cycle dependent protein involved in separating double-stranded DNA during replication. Its role in development, growth and progression of malignant tumors is not fully understood. Topoll also plays a role in chemeresistance which is encountered frequently in ovarian epithelial neoplasms. ]-hough a number of antineoplastic drugs which target Topoll are used in the therapy of epithelial ovarian cancer the prognostic significance of Topoll in predicting respnse to chemotherapy and survival is not yet clear. in this study the expression of Topoll was examined immunohistochemically in tissue samples obtained from 101 patients with serous ovarian cancers using a monoclonal antibody and a semiquantJtative scoring system. Further information including stage, follow-up and treatment data was collected from patients records. Statistical analysis was performed comparing residual tumor, p53-score, Topoll- score, FIGO-stage, age and tumor grade. Multivariate analysis using a cox- regression modell showed that residual tumor (p<0.0001), Topoll-sccre (p<0,0024) and p53-score (p<0.0038) were significant independent prognostic variables in overall survival of patients with serous ovarian cancer. FIGO-stage, age and tumor grade did not reach significance in our analysis. According to the results of our study Topoll-expressien as measured by immunohistochemistry is a strong independent predictor of overall survival in patients with serous ovarian cancer. Due to this promising results further studies should be initiated to evaluate the role of Topoll-expression as a prognostic factor in epithelial ovarian cancer. P578 CERVICAL CARCINOMA CELLS TRANSDUCED TO SECRETE GM-CSF AND IL-4 INDUCE MONOCYTE DIFFERENTIATION TO STIMULATORY DENDRITIC CELLS Y. Wollmann, S. Koc, Schneider, A. M. Kaufmann, FSU Jena, Frauenklinik (Jena) Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen-presenting cells which can initiate cellular immune responses, e. g. against tumors. In vitro they can be generated from peripheral blood monocytes and DC progenitor cells by treatment with interleukin-4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM- CSF). To improve their immuncgenicity we transduced cervical carcinoma cell lines with genes for GM-CSF and IL-4. The amount of secreted cytokines in culture supernatants of cell lines and clones was evaluated by ELISA. Secretion of GM-CSF (0.3 to ng/ml/106 found while parental cells were negative. Cytokine bioactivity was shown by TF-1 reporter cell proliferation assay. Transfectants with highest cytokine production of IL-4, GM-CSF or both cytokines were used for cocultures with adhesion selected peripheral blood monocytes of healthy donors. We assessed morphology and expression of surface markers by flow cytometry. DC function was evaluated by MLR assays and stimulation of antigen specific T cell lines. We found that DC-progenitors in cecultures with cytekine-seereting tumor cells differentiated to DC-like cells with full allestimulatory capacity and the ability to present the HLA-A2-restricted EBV-peptide BMLF-1 to EBV-specific T cell lines. However, terminal differentiation to CD83-positive DC was decreased in tumor cell cocultures as compared to exogenously added recombinant cytokines. We identified ]L-6 and TGF-beta in culture supernatants of the cervical cancer cells. These factors are known to alter DC differentiation. In conclusion, GM-CSF and IL-4 secreting cervical cancer cell vaccines may support in situ activation and differentiation of DC-like cells for induction of a cellular immune response. P579 TUMOR M2 PYRUVATE KINASE (TUM2PK) IN The key regulator of metabolic alterations found in tumor cells is the glycolytic isoenzyme pyruvate kinase type M2. M2-PK is a target of different oncoproteins that lead to a dimedsation of the tetrameric M2-PK. This dimeric form (Tumor M2- PK) can be quantified by ELISA in EDTA-plasma of patients with a variety of different tumor types. This study was designed in order to investigate the valuability of Tumor M2-PK determination as a monitoring marker for the outcome of ovarian cancer patients. Plasma samples of 20 ovarian cancer patients were collected immediately after standard hematological investigation. The Tumor M2-PK level was quantified by an ELISA (ScheBo\u00ae Biotech) and CA 125 was measured automatically using the Immuno 1 immunoanalyzer (Bayer Vital) and the corresponding assay. Each assay was performed in duplicate. The values were analyzed in terms of the clinical course of each patient. The observation time comprised two consecutive stagings and ranged from 4 to 9 months (median, 6 months). 10/20 (50%) ovarian cancer patients were sensitive for Tumor Me-PK determination as a marker for their clinical course. In the Tumor M2-PK sensitive group, the variation of Tumor M2-PK level paralleled 80% of the clinical events. The data suggest that Tumor M2-PK determination in the plasma of patients with ovarian cancer could be a helpful tool for screening the success of the therapy. Prospective studies are in progress in order to demonstrate the prognostic / predictive value of Tumor M2-PK determination. P580 TOPOTECAN PLUS GEMCITABINE IN THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH RELAPSED OVARIAN CANCER : A PHASE II STUDY J. Sehouli, G. Oskay, D. Koensgen, I. Katsares, (Berlin) Topotecan (T) is a topeisomerase I-inhibitor and is approved for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer, and Gemcitabine (dFdC) has demonstrable in ovarian cancer. Both drugs affect DNA synthesis, and in addition, Topotecan, inhibits DNA Sl15 Gynecologic Cancer repair. Combination of both drugs appears as a promising new therapeutic approach. We performed a dose-finding study with T administered on dl-d5 and dFdC on d1+8/q22d as 30 min infusion without growth factors (ASCO 1999, \"1482). After this monocentric phase-l-study we conducted a multicentric phase II-trial. Eligibility criteria: recurrent ovarian cancer, prior treatment with platinum- containing chemotherapy, ECOG status 0-2, organ function within normal range, written informed consent. T was given at a initial dose of 0.5mg/m2/d and dFdC of 800mg/m2 on day 1 and 60Omg/m 2 on day 8. From 3/1999 to 1/2000 21 patients were recruited. Ninety-four (median:6/ range:l- 8) courses are evaluable. The median age was 57 (36-70). The topotecan dosage could be escalated to 0.75 mg/m 2 after the first course among nine patients. Dose reduction was not necessary in any case. All patients were assessable for toxicity. There were no episodes of neutropenic fever, sepsis or chemotherapy- related fatalities. Myelotoxicity, specifically thrombocytopenia and leucopenia, were the major toxicities encountered. Side effects were not associated with severe complications. 5 patients, respectively 5% of all cycles, experienced thrombocytopenia CTC-grade 4. Substitution with thrombocytes was not necessary. Only one patient suffered from leucopenia grade 4. The incidence of non- hematological toxicities was very low. Grade 2 alopecia occurred only in four cases. Eleven patients were evaluated for clinical turnout response by standard radiographic methods : 3x CR, 4x PR, 2x SD, 2x PD. No evidence of disease was observed in four more patients. T in combination with dFdC has favourable toxicity profile and showed encouraging activity. These results suggest that this new combination seems to be an efficacious and well tolerated regimen. The results of our study prompted us to initiate a randomized phase-Ill trial in February 2000 comparing the combination of T plus dFdC with T (1.25mg/m2/d1-5) with the sequential regimen T (1.0mg/m2/dl-5) plus etoposid (50rag/die d6-12). The primary objective is overall survival. Supported by GlaxoSmithKline Germany P581 PATTERNS OF RELAPSE INFLUENCED BY HEMATOGENEOUS TUMOR CELL DISSEMINATION IN PATIENTS WITH CERVICAL CARCINOMA OF THE UTERUS B. Rack, W. Janni, F. Hepp, B. Strobl, D. Rjosk, C. Kentenich, C. evidence that the detection of Cytokeratin- positive (CK+) cells in the bone marrow at the time of primary diagnosis of solid tumors indicates hematogenous tumor cell dissemination and predicts the subse- quent course of the disease. We assessed the influence of CK+ cells on distant disease free and overall survival of patients with cervical carcinoma of the uterus. Methods: Between June 1994 and January 2001, we analyzed bone marrow aspirates of 130 patients at the time of primary diagnosis with cervical carcinoma of the uterus. The specimen were obtained from both upper iliac crests and stained with the monoclonal anti-CK antibody A45-B/B3, which binds to an antigen on cytokeratins. Patients were observed prospectively for a median of 43 (range 1-86) months. Results: CK+ cells were detected in the bone marrow specimens of 38 patients (29 %). During the observation time, 15 patients suffered a Iocoregional recurrence (12 %), while 11 patients (9 %) presented with distant metastases as the first manifestation of recurrence. Distant metastases occurred in 5 % of the patients (n = 5) with negative bone marrow status and in 16 % of the patients with positive bone marrow status (p = .054). The distant disease free survival was 78 months (95 % Confidence Interval [Cl] 73 - 82) and 72 months (95 % CI 61-82), respectively (p = .051). Overall survival was not significantly influenced by the bone marrow status (p = .23). Conclusions: Evidence for hematogeneous tumor cell dissemination at the time of primary diagnosis of cervical carcinoma of the uterus contributes to identify patients with an increased risk for distant relapse. This information may, in future, influence therapeutic strategies and support systemic treatment options in patients with positive bone marrow status. P582 GLYCODELIN A AS AN IMMUNO-SUPRESSOR IN OVARIAN CANCER M. U. Jeschke, glycoprotein with contraceptive, morphogenic and immunosuppressive properties. It is found in both men and women, but is differently glycosylated. In men, Glycodelin-S (GdS) is found in the seminal plasma, secreted by seminal vesicle glandular epithelium. In women, the major sources for the glycodelin-A (GdA) isoform are the secretory and decidualized endometrium. There, it is produced in cycle dependent and pregnancy related fashion. In the ovary Gd A synthesis could be shown in the follicular as well as in the luteal phase. Glycodelin A is overexpressed in ovarian carcinoma. Here, we show that recombinant glycodelin is capable of inhibiting not only T cell proliferation but also influences maturation of Dendritic cells in a concentration dependent manner. After incubation of Dendritic Cells (DC) with various concentrations of glycodelin A the cells were analyzed by FACS-staining. We could demonstrate that 1) viability of DCs decreased with rising concentrations of Gd A, 2) expression of CD83, MHC- and costimulatory molecules was decreased by GdA, and 3) the number of lymphocytes contained within the culture was decreased with increasing concentrations of GdA. Functional activity of GdA treated DCs was determined by an allogenic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Here we could demonstrate inhibition inhibition of stimulatory capacity of DCs, corroborating the parameters determined by FACS-analysis. Therefore, the immune-inhibtory effect of GdA seems to be not only a consequence of suppression of T cell proliferation but could also be mediated by inhibition DC maturation. Overexpression of GdA by ovarian carcinomas might be a new mechanism of tumor cells to inhibit anti-tumor immune reactions. P583 ANTITUMOR EFFECT OF MAB EMD55900 EGF-R EXPRESSION HISTOPATHOLOGY C. Solbach, StegmL~ller, R. M. Kaufmann, Uniklinik FrankfurL (Frankfurt am Main) The proliferative stimulus of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) in human epithelial cells is mediated by its binding to the external domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether growth arrest of tumors treated with anti EGF-R MAb (EMD 55900) was dependent on EGF-R expression and distinct histopathological criteria of those neoplasms. Nine different adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas and two neoplastic epithial cell lines (A431 and Detroit 562) which were characterized by high EGF-R expression were xenotransplanted onto NMRI-nu/nu mice and treated with an anti EGF-R antibody (EMD 55900). Results revealed that EGF-R expression and distinct histopathological growth patterns play an important role for the therapeutic effect of the EGF-R antibody treatment. Tumors with high cellularity and little connective tissue responded to EMD 55900 treatment to a greater degree of growth reduction than tumors with lower cellularity. These results will be helpful for evaluation of patients who would benefit from tumor therapy with anti-EGF-R antibody. P584 EXPRESSION OF DNA TOPOISOMERASE II ALPHA IN HUMAN OVARIAN CANCER R. Chekerov, J. Sehouli, D. K6nsgen, A. Dietrich, I. Klaman, B. Petschke, U. Hoffmann, W. Lichtenegger, A. Rosenthal, E. Dahl, AG Frauenklinik - MetaGen (Berlin) Objective: DNA topoisomerases (topo) are new targets of different active therapeutic drugs in the management of advanced ovarian cancer. While topotecan is an inhibitor of topo I, tope II is inhibited by etoposide and doxorubicine. There are lacking data about the expression patterns of topoisomerases in ovarian tumors and their influence on response to chemotherapy and overall survival. This prospective study aims to analyse expression of topo II alpha (RNA and protein level) in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Data obtained will be correlated with histopathological and clinical parameters of the disease to elucidate whether topoisomerases can be used as molecular markers for tumor biology and prognosis. Methods: Specimens of 50 primary and recurrent ovarian tumors were obtained from surgery (34 serous, 8 endometrioid, 1 mucinous and 5 cystadenomas, mostly FIGO stage Ill and IV). Applying laser supported microdissection we gained pure populations of tumor cells and tumor-associated stromal cells from each sample. Total RNA was extracted from 30 mm 2 microdissected tissue. Expression level of topo II alpha was determined by real time PCR (TaqMan system). Abundance of topo II RNA in microdissected tumor and stromal cells was compared to expression in several normal human tissues. In addition protein levels of topo II alpha were correlated with expression of c-erbB2 by immunohistochemistry in 26 paraffin embedded tumor specimens. Results and conclusions: In ovarian cancer expression of topo II alpha was detectable in all specimens. Topo II alpha was abundantly expressed in all recurrent ovarian tumors, whereas in primary tumors high expression was detectable in about only 30% of samples. Immunohistochemistry revealed c-erbB2 expression in 17 of 26 samples and topo II alpha expression in 18 of 26 cases analysed. Coexpression of both proteins was detected in 14 of 26 cases. Future analysis will clarify the role of the topoisomerases in the biology and prognosis of ovarian cancer. P585 PROGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE OF P53 AND THE APOPTOSIS- INHIBITOR BCL-2 CORRELATED WITH PROLIFERATIVE ACTIVITY IN DIFFERENT SUBTYPES OF ADVANCED EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CANCER M. Mitze, M. and apoptosis-inhibitor bcl-2 seem to have important influence on carcinogenesis and clinical behaviour of ovarian carcinoma. We investigated immunhistochemically the accumulation of p53 as well as the detection of bcl-2 and correlated the findings with proliferative activity, detected by the protein Ki-67, in various subtypes of advanced ovarian cancer. Pathological specimen of 94 patients with histologically verified epithelial ovarian carcinoma of stages FIGO Ill (n = 90) and IV ( n = 4) have been examined for p53, bcl-2 and Ki-67 by immunhistochemistry using commercially available monoclonal antibodies. Serous-papillary ovarian cancer ( n= 62) have been positive for p53 in 66% and for bcl-2 in 19% of the cases. Endometroid carcinomas ( n= 24) have shown more than 10% p53 positive cells in 54% . bcl-2 has been detected in 13 % of cases. Of the mucinous carcinoma ( n = 6) only one tumor exhibited p 53, whereas bcl- S116 Gynecologic Cancer 2 was negative in all cases. Strong proliferative activity detected by the Ki-67- antibody mib-1 was found in 32% of serous and 37% of endometroid tumors. All mucinous carcinoma showed only moderate proliferative activity. Regarding overall survival, p53 -positive and negative tumors showed no significant difference, however, patients with bcl-2 positive tumors had a significantly worse overall outcome. Poor prognosis was also found for patients with moderate proliferative activity. Histological subgroups of ovarian carcinoma FIGO Ill and IV showed major differences with respect to expression of the proteins p53, bcl-2 and proliferative activity. These findings might account for the differences in clinical behaviour and response to therapy in the different histological subgroups. P586 IMMUNHISTOCHEMICAL DETECTION OF HER2/NEU (ERB-2} AND MIB-1 IN DIFFERENT SUBTYPES OF ADVANCED EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CANCER AND ITS IMPLICATION ON THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES S. Ackermann, M. is important for cellular tranaductioe and has an important role in cell proliferation, seems to influence the response to chemotherapy and offers the chance of new treatment strategies with monoclonal antibodies [i.e. Trastuzumab ]. We investigated the presence of erb-2 in different subtypes of ovarian cancer and its correlation with proliferativ activity, detected by staining with the Ki-67 antibody mib-1. Methods:Pathological specimen of 137 patients (pts.) with histological verified epithelial ovarian carcinoma of stages FIGO I-IV have been examined for cerb-2 and Ki-67 by immunhistochemistry using commercially available monoclonal antibodies. We correlated the findings with overall and disease free survival in respect to different histological subtypes Results: 38/137 pts. had positive staining [ cells for cerb-2 (27%). Strong proliferative activity [> 40%] detected by the Ki-67- antibody mib-1 was found in 27% of pts., moderate stainig [20-40%] in 34% of pts. and faint stainig in 38 % of pts. Serous papillary tumors (n=77) had positive cerb-2 staining in 28% of specimen, mucinous tumors were positive in 18% of pts, endometroid showed positive staining in 26 %. No borderline tumor was positive for cerb-2. Median overall survival in cerb-2 positive tumors was 36 months, in cerb-2 negative tumors 40 months. This difference was not statistical significant (p= 0,3). Patients with strong proliferative activity showed better results than those with faint mib- 1 staining. Pts. with moderate proliferative activity had the worst results, although this does not reach statistic significance. Conclusion: Our findings can not support a negative outcome in patients with cerb-2 positive tumors and questions the use of Trastuzumab in ovarian cancer. P587 SEQUENTIAL ADJUVANT CHEMO-RADIOTHERAPY WITH VS. WITHOUT ERYTHROPOEITIN FOR PATIENTS WITH HIGH-RISK CERVICAL CANCER-AN UPDATE J.-U. Blohmer, Paepke, MUnchen, Ludwigsfelde, Gera) Introduction The update of our study describes the results of a multi-center randomized sequential chemo-radiotherapy with vs. without Erythropoeitin (EPO). Patients and Methods From January 1999 to the first amendment in June 1999 263 patients (p) from 63 clinics were randomized between radiation therapy alone (arm A, 7 p) and a sequential chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (Arm B, 256 p). In the second randomization the patients of arm B were randomized between a therapy with Erythropoeitin (EPO, arm B1, 128 p) or without Erythropoeitin (arm B2, 128 p). All patients of arm B received 4 cycles (q21d) of chemotherapy of ifosphamide (1.6 rag/m2, up to 50-50.5 Gy). Patients in the EPO arm B1 additionally received EPO 10,000 IU/3 x/week + oral iron supplements up to a Hb target value of 13 g/dl. The other patients (arm B2) did not receive EPO - transfusions were permitted. Arm A was closed after the first amendment. The first endpoint of the study was the comparison of the DFS between the study arms B1 and B2. The second endpoints were the evaluation and comparison of therapy-related toxicity, quality of life, OS. Stratification was done between pN0 and pN1, IA-IB and liB, R0- and Rl-resection. Inclusion criteria were: written informed consent, at least one of the age < 35 years. The study had the approval of the local ethics committees. Results By November 2001 data were available for this analysis from 202 patients and 667 chemotherapy cycles. The median surgery related loss of blood was 900 ml. The hemoglobin level at the beginning of chemotherapy was 11.0 g/dl. The median dose of carboplatinum in both arms was AUC 4 and of ifosphamide was 1.6 g/m2. 84% of all patients received the planned 4 chemotherapy cycles. The median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy in all arms. In the EPO-arm were 49 of the 53 (91%) analyzed p disease-free and in the other arm 48 of the 60 (80%) p. There was a significant reduction in the number of blood (erythrocytes/thromboeytes) tranfusions (P=0.0046/P=0.0025, Fisher's exact test). First results were presented at ASCO meeting 2001. Conclusions Sequential adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy was shown to be a therapy of low toxicity during which few treatment interruptions occurred and in tendency with a lower rate of recurrences in the EPO-arm. P588 EFFICACY OF DIFFERENT CYTOKINES AND CYTOTOXICS ON ANGIOGENESIS AND TUMOR GROWTH OF OVARIAN CARCINOMAS TRANSPLANTED INTRAPERITONEALLY IN NUDE MICE T. FriepSrtner, C. St JUrgenstraBe Frauenklinik, Universit~.tsfrauenklinik (Bremen, Aachen) Objective: In a previous study we demonstrated the efficacy of different cytokines and cytotoxics on three human ovarien carcinomas transplanted intraperitoneally in nude mice. The aim of this study was to proof, if the inhibition of tumor growth observed by anti-angiogenic effects. Methods: Three human ovarian carcinomas (WIM,CER,DEM) implanted in (cisplatin, taxol), altogether in 14 therapeutic groups and control groups (without therapy) for each tumor, lntratumoral microvesse]s were identified by immunostaining in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded FRG) monoclonal antibodies. Microvessel density (MDV) was counted in the area of most intensive neovascularization (hot spot-technique) on a 200 x field. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon- test. Results: Tumor growth was inhibited in two carcinomas (CER,WIM), whereas the tumor *LDEMoLcould not be influenced by any drug. In the group of the cytokines showed 11-2, IFN-fz, and IFN-fA alone as well as in combination strongly developed effects regarding the reduction of tumor angiogenesis. These results correlated only moderatly with the objective observed statistical significant inhibition of tumor growth. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that both cytotoxics show no effect on the angiogenesis measured by MVD. Though cytokines seem to have an influence on tumor reduction by an anti-angiogenic pathway, this did not lead to an inhibition of tumor growth in all cases. P589 CHEMOTHERAPY WITH CARBOPLATIN/DOCETAXEL FOR PRIMARY AND RE- CURRENT EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CANCER F. Beldermann, I. Lauschner, M. Geberth, A. Schneeweiss, J. Huober, (Heidelberg, TLibingen) Objectives: Peripheral neurotoxicity associated with platinum/paclitaxel-containing chemotherapy is very often a limiting toxicity especially in the long-term treatment of ovarian carcinoma. A retrospective study was conducted to determine whether the incidence of eeurologic toxicities could be decreased without compromising efficacy by substitution of docetaxel for paclitaxel. Patients and methods: Sixty- one patients (pts) with epithelial ovarian cancer (FIGO stage II-lV) were treated with the combination of carboplatin AUC 5 and docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 given intravenously every 3 weeks. Twenty-nine pts received carboplatin/docetaxel as first-line treatment and 32 pts as second-line therapy for relapse after more than 12 months. A minimum of 3 courses were given in each case (maximum 6 courses). Results: A total of 300 courses were administered. The predominant WHO grade 3/4 toxicity was leucopenia (21 of 61 pts). Grade 3 thrombocytopenia occurred in 5% of pts. No grade 3 neuropathy was observed. Neuropathy grade 2 developed in only 2 pts (3%) and grade 1 in 16 pts (26%). In the second-line cohort, neurotoxicity was not increased. 12 of 61 pts had mild to moderate fluid retention, and WHO grade 2/3 nausea and vomiting occurred in 24 pts. No ototoxicity was observed. Response rate was 79% among 26 evaluable first-line patients, and 75% among 30 evaluable second-line pts. Estimated median time to progression was 10 months for first-line patients (23/29) and 9.4 months for second-line patients (23/32). Conclusions: The efficacy of carboplatin/docetaxel combination chemotherapy for ovarian carcinoma as demonstrated in our study appears comparable to that reported for platinum/paclitaxel combinations while toxicities, and particularly neuropathy, are less common and less severe with carboplatin/ docetaxel, t P590 FAMILIAL LEIOMYOMATOSIS - CLINICAL of the female genital tract represent one of the most common diseases in women often leading to intensive operative therapy. For LM of the skin and the the upper gastrointestinal tract a familial association has been described. Recently a genetic aetiology for uterine LM and kidneycellcancer was identified. Leiomyomatosis of both esophagus and vulva in combination with nephropathy and hearing loss can be caused by genetic alterations. We report the clinical course of recurrent leiomyomatosis in two first degree relatives and the genetic analysis in this rare case. Over the last years mother (R-D, 21.06.51) and daughter (K-D, 29.06.76) are presenting with multiple recurrences of clinical significant LM. Primarily a vaginal hysterectomy with morcellement in 03/87 because of multiple LM was performed $117 Gynecologic Cancer in R-D. In 11/91 a highly differentiated leiomyosarcoma (Coindre I) at the lower esophagus was diagnosed and excised. Since 92 a tumor is known in the rectovaginal spatium; in 03/01 in the left labia majora of the vulva a LM has been excised. Neither an elevated mitosis rate nor other signs of malignancy were found. Primarily in 12/98 the daughter K-D presented with a vulvar tumor (lxlcm), that was excised subsequently. In 10/99 a uterine LM (5x4cm) was enucleated. In 03/01 a of 5cm excised from the left labia majora. Again a LM was diagnosed. The estrogen receptor was found positive in 90-100% of all cells; the progesterone receptor was found to be positive in 50-60% of all cells. MIB1 was 1% and therefore a low tendency to proliferation was determined of the benign tumor.Both patients are suffering from recurrent clinical significant LM. The first degree relationship as well as the rare manifestation in the vulva in general makes a genetical aetiology probable. Once R-D was diagnosed with a Iowmalignant sarcomatous component. The performed histological and molecular analysis have not been decisive so far. A possible genetic cause could be the deletion in two contigous genes (COL4A5 and COL4A6) located on Xq22.3 and inherites as a X-chromosomal dominant trait. As contiguous gene syndromes show a vide variability the mild clinical symptoms might fit to this entity. A possible autosomal dominant combination of LM might be possible but unprobable, because all affected persons are female. The results of the ongoing FISH and DNA analysis will be presented. P591 WHOLE BODY HYPERTHERMIA COMBINED WITH CHEMOTHERAPY (CARBOPLATIN/ IFOSFAMIDE) IN PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT OVARIAN CANCER - INTERIM ANALYSIS OF A PHASE II/111 STUDY (DOLPHIN-I-STUDY) B. Strobl, W. Janni, B, Rack, D. L. Kornya, A. Bakhshandeh-Bath, S. Hegewisch-Becker, B. Hildebrandt, G.J. Wiedemann, H. der Patients with recurrent ovarian cancer still encounter an unfavourable prognosis, despite improvements in cytostatic treatment modalities. There is evidence that the combination of whole body hyperthermia (WBH) with certain cytostatic agents (e.g. carboplatin, ifosfamide) leads to a higher efficacy through increased cellular metabolism, chemosensitisation and immunostimulation. This study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of carboplatin and ifosfamide with whole body hyperthermia. Methods: Since 6/2000 we performed a prospective multicenter phase II study in 14 patients (61 treatment courses) with recurrence of ovarian cancer. All patients (<=65 years) were required to have sufficient cardiac, pulmonal and renal function. Treatment consisted of whole body hyperthermia with a target temperature of 41.8\u00b0C (x 1 hour, infrared-A radiation) and the simultaneous application of carboplatin AUC5 and ifosfamide 3g/m2, repeated every 28 days, for 6 courses or until progression. Results: On average, 4.4 treatment courses per patient have been performed. Toxicity lead to dose reduction in 14 coarses (22.9 %). The following toxicities (NCI) were seen: myelotoxic side effects as grade 3 leucocytopenia in 22 cases (36.1 %) and grade 4 leucocytopenia in 8 cases (13.1%). However, neutropenic fever has only been reported in 1 patient (1.6 %). Thrombocytopenia grade 3 occurred in 10 courses (16.4 %), grade 4 in 7 courses (11.5 %). In 2 courses renal toxicity grade 2 appeared (3.3 %). In 14 cases (22.9 %) skin burnings grade 2 and in 5 cases (8.2 %) skin burnings grade 3 were reported. No other severe treatment related adverse events were noted. Data on efficacy include 7 patients with partial remission (50.0 %), 6 patients with stable disease (42.9 %) and 1 patient with progression (7.1%). Conclusion: Whole body hyperthermia combined with carboplatin and ifosfamide chemotherapy appears to be well tolerated, feasible and safe. After the success- ful completion of the phase II sequence (15 patients), the study will continue as a randomised multicenter phase Ill study, comparing above treatment with normo- thermic cytostatic application, in order to further investigate this promising thera- peutical approach. Publication only P'592 IS HER-2 PROTEIN OVEREXPRESSION AN ACCURATE PREDICTIVE FACTOR FOR RESPONSE TO NEOADJUVANT RADIOCHEMOTHERAPY IN ADVANCED SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA OF THE UTERINE CERVIX? G. K~hler, (Greifswald) Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between responsibility to primary radiochemotherapy and HER-2 protein overexpression in patients with inoperable squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Methods: 51 patients with stage lIB (4) and IlIB (47)cervical cancer received prospectively a neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 3 courses carboplatin 300 mg/m ~ day 1 plus ifosfamide 2 g/m2 for 3 days (q 4 weeks) in combination with 5 intracavitary brachytherapy courses with altogether 40 Gy/A. In case of operability after primary therapy patients underwent radical hysterectomy, in all other cases followed an external-beam irradiation consisting of 50.5 Gy in the ICRU-50 reference point. Archival specimens from all patients were retrieved and submitted to immunohistochemical staining for HER-2 overexpression by a DAKO- Hercep-Test. Results: After radiochemotherapy clinical CR and PR was achieved in 9 (18 %) and 35 (68 %) patients, respectively (total 86 %), 7 (14 %) women experienced a NC or a PD. Operation was possible in 18 (35 %) cases. Histological CR was observed in 12 (67 %) of the operated patients. The 5-year-overall-survival by Kaplan and Meier is 52 % in all cases but 80 and 37 % in the operated and the irradiated group, respectively. Strong (+3) and moderate (+2) expression of HER-2 was observed in only 2 cases each (total 8 %). All 4 patients with HER-2 protein overexpression experienced a clinical and 3 of them also a pathological CR. The one woman with histological remnants (Hercep-test +2) later got a relapse in the true pelvis. Discussion: In contrast to the literature the results of this study suggest that HER- 2 oncoprotein overexpression probably is not inevitable associated with a reduced response to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer. Further studies on HER-2 among a larger number of patients may prove if Her-2 is an accurate predictive factor for response of cervical cancer to chemotherapy. P'593 ADJUVANT SIMULTANEOUS RADIOCHEMOTHERAPY FOLLOWING RADICAL HYSTERECTOMY FOR PATIENTS WITH CERVICAL CANCERS IN HIGH-RISK- SITUATION- RESULTS OF A PILOT STUDY G. Haensgen, 3-. Kuhnt, H. Straul3, J. Dunst, Martin-Luther-Universit~.t (Halle) Background: The most important factors for prognosis of cervical cancers are age and histological criteria as the tumor size, the involvement of lymph nodes, lympho-vascular space involvement as well as microvessel involvement and poor tumor differentiation (grading 3). Here we present the results of concomitant chemoirradiation at high-risk situation of patients with cervical cancer after surgery. Patients and Methods: The study comprises of 34 patients with median age of 40 years (26-63) after WERTHEIM surgical technique for cervical cancer at the FIGO- stages IB (n=19) and liB (n=15). All patients were treated between November 1995 and June 1999 by a schedule of concomitant chemoirradiation. The indication for this treatment were given by the positive histological proof of lymph node metastasis, microvessel or lympho-vascular space involvement as well as a G3- grading. The chemotherapy was given in week 1 and 5 (day 1-5 and day 29-33). The dosage of cisplatin was 20mg/m2/d on every day and 5-FU was given as a 120h-infusion with 600mg/m2/d. The external beam radiotherapy was applied to the pelvis with 1.8 Gy per fraction up to 50.4-54 Gy. In two patients the paraaortal region was irradiated too because of the involvement of these lymph nodes. Results: The median observation time contains of 48 months (3 - 68). 30 patients are alive (88%) in complete response. Four patients died. The mean survival was 61 _+ 3 months.We have seen only slight acute toxicities of grade I and II. Three patients suffered from a grade III diarrhea and three patients developed a grade Ill leukopenia. In seven patients we found a secondary lymphedema as a late toxicity. Conclusion: The concomitant chemoirradiation containing cisplatin in high-risk situation for cervical cancer after surgery improves the outcome and survival in these patients. P'594 INDUCTION OF HPV SPECIFIC T CELLS BY IN VITRO VACCINATION WITH ALLOGENEIC TUMOR CELL VACCINES FOR CERVICAL CANCER, A. Koscielny, A. Kather, A. Schneider, M. D(Jrst, A. M. Kaufmann, FSU Jena, Frauenklinik (Jena) Cervical cancer is associated with infection by ,,high risk\" human papillomaviruses. The viral oncogenes E6 and E7 are constantly expressed by the tumor cells. Immune reactions, especially T cell responses, towards these tumor associated antigens have been demonstrated in patients and in vaccinees. Previously, we have shown improvement of immunogenicity of cervical cancer cells HeLa and CaSki, in which the costimulatory molecule CD80 is expressed ectopically. Interleukins -2, -7, and -12 have been shown to further augment T cell responses. Here we have investigated the induction of HPV antigen specific T cells by in vitro vaccination with the allogeneic CD80-positive cervical cancer cell lines. In addition we have supplemented the HLA-matched T cells cultures with interleukins IL-2, - 7, -12, -15, and Interferon-gamma and with their combinations. All interleukins tested enhanced T cell proliferation and expansion. We found dramatically augmented expansion of T cells by costimulation with interleukins 2 plus 7 or 2 plus 15, >20 times and >30 times over controls, respectively. Most importantly, in HLA-matched donors, HPV antigen-specific T cells were activated that reacted with HLA-restricted HPV E7 epitopes as detected in proliferation and ELISpot assays. Our data suggest a rationale for an allogeneic tumor cell vaccine transduced to express CD80 and interleukin-2 and -15 for treatment of cervical cancer. P'595 USE OF UNCONVENTIONAL CANCER TREATMENTS (UCT) AMONG PATIENTS WITH GYNECOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES IN ANGOLA J. Sehouli, D. Stengel, M. David, G. Oskay, D. K~nsgen, I. Katsares, W. Lichtenegger, Charit6/ HU Berlin (Berlin) Despite the continues development of new active cancer drugs based on pharmacological principles, there is an increasing demand of patients for unconventional cancer treatments throughout the world. The data about the frequency of using UCT among cancer patients are based on studies in western countries. There is lack of information on the use UCT among cancer patients in $118 Gynecologic Cancer / Radiotherapy developing countries. Therefore, we conducted a prospective study in Angola with the primary objectives to determine the frequency and the spectrum of UCT among patients with gynaecologic malignancies. Furthermore a characterisation of the user's and non-users was performed. The cross sectional survey study enrolled patients of two provincial hospitals in Angola. Semistructured interviews were performed. 202 women with gynaecological malignancies were recruited. Overall 70.2% of all patients used UCT. The most common methods were traditional medicine (56.4%), prayer (30.2%) and exorcism (30.2%). UCT-user's (median age:58 years) were not older than NOT-User's (median age: 57 years/p=0.14). Workers (79.4%) used more frequent UCT than farmer-wives (65.7%, p=0,O5). In comparison, patients with cervical cancer used more frequent UCT than patients with other gynaecologic tumors (86,6% vs.13.3% /p= 0,02). Religious patients consumed UCT more frequent than patients, who said they were not a member of any religion (74,4% vs. 25,8% / p=0,04). Christians used seldom UCT in contrast to patients of traditional religion (p<0,00001). Furthermore, patients without any school education used more frequent UCT than patients with an school education (65.4 % vs. 34.4%). But this difference was not significant (p=0.28). The duration of disease had no influence on the use of UCT (p=l.0). The majority of the patients began their use of UCT before they received any conventional treatment (81%). Oft those who recommended or motivated patients to use UCT, family members (72.5%) and friends and neighbours (62%) were the most important. In Angola, the use of unconventional cancer treatments by patients with gynaecologic malignancies is widespread. The inaccessibility (long distance, high costs) of standard medical care may have therefore the biggest influence in developing countries. Radiotherapy 0596 UPDATED EBM-BASED GUIDELINES FOR RADIATION THERAPY OF TESTICULAR SEMINOMA CS I: NEW STANDARD 20 GY? R. for diagnosis and treatment of testicular cancer were developed by the German Testicular Cancer Study Group (GTCSG) and The Royal College of Radiologist's Clinical Oncology Information Network (COIN) Testicular Cancer Specialty Working Group (SWG) in partnership with Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) using identical methodology and same evaluation criteria (US Agency for Health Care Policy and Research). Nevertheless some differences exist in recommendations for medical treatment as well as for radiooncologic treatment (RT). Methods: Comparison of German (G) end British (GB) guideline recommendations Onkol 2000;176:388-405; Eur treatment of seminoma cS I as an exemplary selection of parameters of practice with special regards to updated data of MRC TE 18-trial (Eur J Cancer 2001;37:Suppl 6:S157,abstract #572). Results: dose of adjuvant RT to the Iocoregional paraaortic/-caval lymphatics of 30 Gy (GB) vs. 26 Gy (G), extension of target volume depending on risk factors (e.g. history of scrotal or inguinal surgery) (GB) vs. no extension (G) and surveillance on equal level with adjuvant RT (G) vs. surveillance not routinely (GB) were recommended. Actual data of MRC TE18-trial (10/2001) show evidence that total dose of 20 Gy is a sufficient and safe treatment reducing radiation therapy- associated side effects without compromising recurrence or survival rates. These data are considered in 2002 updated German guidelines (http:// www.krebsgesellschaft.de/ISTO/Standards/index.html). Conclusions: Recent evidence indicated that a total RT dose of 20 Gy is sufficient to control testicular seminoma CS I disease in the infradiaphragmal paraaortic/- caval lymphatics. This has been acknowledged in the most recent German update, but not yet in the British update from 2000 nor in the German update of 2001. This points to the importance of regular updating of guidelines to provide optimal patient care. Even in a condition with high cure rates, like testicular seminoma, further optimization of treatment might be possible. Prospective randomized trials performed and recruited in an international cooperation are appropriate tools to achieve a required high level of evidence as prerequisite for increase the validity of the recommendations. This might broaden their acceptance and implementation in clinical practice. 0597 PSA-MEASUREMENTS AT 30 GY AND 60 GY ARE IMPORTANT FOR DOSE LIMITATION IN PATIENTS WITH RADIOTHERAPY FOR PSA-INCREASE AFTER RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY D. Bottke, T. Wiegel, S. H~bcht, Steiner, W. Hinkelbein, UK Benjamin Franklin (Berlin) Objective: Radiotherapy (RT) with doses from 64 Gy to 66 Gy is recommended for patients with increasing PSA following radical prostatectomy (RP). 40-60% of these patients do not profit from RT. If identifiable, the total doses could be restricted in these patients to decrease the risk of severe late side effects. The aim of our study was to define the value of PSA-measurements at 30 Gy and 60 Gy. Methods: Between 10/96 and 04/00, 41 patients with PSA-increase following RP received RT to the prostatic bed. The median total dose was 66,6 Gy. We evaluated serum-PSA levels at 30 Gy and 60 Gy and compared them to the pre-RT PSA- level and the outcome of RT. Results: The median follow-up was 8 months (range 1 - 30 months). After RT, 31 patients (76%) had either undetectable (n=15), or decreasing but still detectable PSA-levels (n=16). 10 patients (24%) had rising PSA-levels and did not respond. PSA-evaluation at 30 Gy showed that 26% (8/31) of the patients who would response to RT still had a rising PSA compared to pretreatment-PSA. At 60 Gy 93% (27/29) of these patients had decresing PSA-levels. In contrast, 88% (7/8) of those patients in whom RT was not effective had rising PSA-levels at 60 Gy (p<0,001). Conclusions: Our data indicate, that an increasing PSA at 30 Gy and 60 Gy for RT of PSA-increase following RP is a significant predictor of tumor progression, as nearby all of these patients do not stand to profit from RT. In these patients dose limitation could significantly decrease the risk of late side effects, especially for the bladder and the rectum. 0598 F-18 FDG POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY IN RADIATION TREATMENT PLANNING OF HEAD AND NECK TUMORS A. N. Rahn, R.P. Baum, I. A. Adamietz, S. Adams, St. Mose, G. HSr, H. D. B6ttcher, J. W. Goethe-Universit&t, Zentralklinikum, Marienhospital (Frankfurt am Main, Bad Berka, Herne) Purpose: Individualized radiation treatment planning in patients with head and neck tumors requires exact detection and Iocalisation of tumor spread. Despite of high morphological resolution of methods like computed tomography, sonography or magnetic resonance imaging used in daily routine, the correct diagnosis of lymphonodal tumor involvement is often not possible. In a prospective trial, we examined the additional value of whole-body F-18 FDG PET for radiation treatment planning. Patients and methods: We studied 52 patients (44 male, 8 female, median age 55 years) with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region who were scheduled for radiotreatment (6 patients received adjuvant treatment, 46 had definitive radiotreatment). 33 Patients had primary carcinoma, 19 patients had recurrent tumors (6 lymphnode-recurrencies, 7 local recurrencies, 6 Patients with local and lymphnode recurrencies). All patientes had a PET study prior to treatment planning additionally to conventional staging procedures (CAT, MR]-, ultrasound). The changes of treatment strategy or target volume determination due to additional PET findings were analysed. Results: In 48% of patients with primary tumors and in 58% of patients with recurrent disease, FDG-PET detected additional tumor manifestations, in all of these cases, changes of treatment strategy or target volume were necessary. Regarding patients with primary tumors, the percentage of treatment modifications was highest in patients with large tumors (T3/T4, 61%) and in patients with advanced lymph node involvement (N2/N3, 42%), in 70 % of patients with large tumors and positive lymphnodes (T3/4 N1-3) additional tumor manifestation in was detected by FDG-PET. Conclusions: Especially in patients with recurrent disease and in patients with advanced tumor stages, whole-body FDG PET adds clinically relevant information compared to conventional staging procedures. In this group of patients a FDG PET study prior to radiotherapy planning should be considered. 0599 RECTAL DISLOCATION DURING CONFORMAL RADIOTHERAPY OF PROS- TATE CANCER F. Zimmermann, H. M. Molls, Klinik for Strahlentherapie definitive, conformal 3-D radiotherapy (CRT) of prostate cancer. Materiel and methods: 96 CT studies of 32 patients who underwent CRT of prostate cancer were analyzed: 21 patients had received a rectal balloon catheter before each radiation fraction for internal immobilization of the prostate, 11 patients were treated without a catheter. CT-scans of the pelvis were carried out for all patients before therapy (tO), at 30 Gy (tl) and at 50 Gy (t2). After 3-D image fusion a standardized procedure defined parts of the rectum in each of the 3 CT scans, that were used to measure the position of the anterior, posterior and the lateral rectal walls in relation to bony landmarks of the first CT study. The dislocation of the rectum at tl and t2 was calculated in relation to the rectum position at tO. Results: At 30 Gy the mean anterior rectal wall dislocation in the ventro-dorsal direction was in between 2.2 mm (1 standard deviation 2.0) and 4.1 mm (1 SD 3.4) depending on the cranio-caudal position of the rectal cross-section. At 50 Gy the mean dislocation measured in between 3.3 mm (1SD 2.4) and 5.4 mm (1SD 6.0). The maximum dislocation of the anterior rectal wall was 23.0 mm. Dislocation was smaller for patients with a rectal balloon catheter than for those without a catheter (range of SD with catheter: 1.3 - 3.5 mm; without catheter: 1.6 - 8.2 mm; p=0.026). It was larger in the cranial sections than in the isocenter (p=0.034). Mean dislocation of the dorsal rectal wall measured in between 3.6 mm (1SD 3.1) and 5.6 mm (1 SD 4.0) at 30 Gy and in between 3.6 mm (1 SD 3.0) and 5.7 mm (1 SD 4.6) at 50 Gy. Maximum dislocation: 20.4 mm. Mean medio-lateral dislocation of the lateral rectal walls was in between 1.7 mm (1 SD 2.1) and 4.2 mm (1 SD 4.2) $119 Radiotherapy at 30 Gy and in between 2.1 mm (1 SD 1.9) and 4.6 mm (1 SD 4.0) at 50 Gy. Maximum dislocation: 25.0 mm. 21% of all dislocations were larger than 5 ram. Conclusion: Rectal dislocation during prostate CRT is substantial and has to be taken into account when interpretating rectal dose-volume histogramms. An internal immobilization with a rectal balloon catheter leads to a reduced dislocation of the anterior rectal wall. 0600 BIOLOGICAL PREVENTION OF RADIATION-INDUCED LATE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INJURY BY TREATMENT WITH GROWTH FACTORS C. Nieder, N. Andratschke, N. test whether VEGF, bFGF, PDGF, and IGF-1 can modulate radiation myelopathy (RM) of the cervical spinal cord. Methods: The dose-response relationship of RM was established by irradiating adult F-344 rats (control groups) with 2 radiation fractions, i.e. 16 Gy plus 14-20 Gy (interval 24 h to 2 weeks, \u00b1 intrathecal saline). The ED50 was 32 Gy, regardless of interfraction interval and intrathecal manipulation. Intrathecal infusion was performed via subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps connected to a canula inserted into the cisterna magna. Then, dose-finding studies were performed where the rats received 36 Gy along with continuous intrathecal infusion of VEGF, bFGF, and PDGF from 24 h before to 24 h after irradiation (XRT) or over 2 weeks between the 2 radiation fractions. Comparable studies were performed with subcutaneous injection of IGF-1. Afterwards, systematic experiments were undertaken where several groups of rats received 33 Gy and 36 Gy along with the most effective dose of each growth factor both during XRT and at various intervals thereafter. Histopathologic evaluation was performed to confirm the presence of RM. Results: Both effective as well as dangerous dose levels were identified. E.g., dramatic shortening of the latent period was found after the highest dose of VEGF and PDGF. Growth factor treatment at the most effective dose level (low dose in general) for 2 weeks starting several weeks after XRT was able to delay the onset of RM significantly, but failed to decrease its incidence. The best results were seen with VEGF or IGF- 1 treatment from 24 hours before to 24 hours after XRT. IGF-1 was the single most potent factor, the only one to both significantly increase the median latency while also decreasing the incidence of RM. First results indicate that combination of IGF-1 with bFGF might further decrease the incidence of RM in a manner that appears to be more than additive. There was no appreciable difference in histology of RM nor was there any other obvious abnormality in the CNS of growth factor- treated rats. Conclusions: The results of our dose-finding experiments suggest that the protective effect critically depends on dose. However, the dose-response relationship appears to be inverted, as high doses might even cause a detrimental shortening of latency. Brief therapeutic intervention in the earliest phase, i.e. presence of growth factors during XRT, might inhibit progression of the pathologic cascade leading to RM. Poster P601 THREE-DIMENSIONAL RADIOTHERAPY PLANNING OF THE CRANIOSPINAL AXIS IN CHILDREN T. Ph. Nguyen, L. Wisser, J. Fleckenstein, M. Niewald, G. of the craniospinal axis in children. Method: Simulate first the upper spinal field using an individual total-body cast, then the lower one, if necessary (depending on the length of the spine). The borders of the spinal fields cross in the spinal channel. Now Simulate the lateral opposed cranial fields, whose central axis are placed on the lateral canthus canthi minimizing beam divergence into the eyes. The collimator is turned until the caudal margin is parrallel to the diverging cephalad margin of the upper spinal field. Asymmetrical jaws are to be used such that a gap of 2-3 mm is left between the caudal edge of this field and the cranial one of the upper spinal field. After performing CT-scan a treatment plan is created using three-dimensonal planning. The reference points for the dosage are chosen and the field seizes are modified in such a way that the whole brain and the spinal channel are encompassed by the 95-100 % isodose and the distance between the 90 %-isodose lines in the field- junction areas is about 8 mm. To avoid an underdosage in those areas the locations of the field junctions are moved daily: day 1 as simulated, day 2 all field junctions moved 1 cm cranial, day 3 field junctions moved 1 cm caudal, day 4 equal to day 1. In this manner you do not have an overlap of the fields and the dose inhomogeneities are blurred out. Conclusion: With the three-dimensional treatment planning you can achieve a relatively homogenous dose distribution in the craniospinal axis, reliably avoid over- and underdosage. We have also found that it is not necessary to rotate the table to match the divergence of the lateral brain fields with the upper spinal fields. P602 INFLUENCE OF IRRADIATION ON NEUTROPHILIC GRANULOCYTE FUNCTION O. Micke, A. De a treatment modality for stage II and III rectal cancer, but following surgery is often complicated by local infections. In order to define a possible influence of radiotherapy on neutrophilic granulocytes in the neighborhood of tumor cells we investigated their function in vitro. Methods: Density gradient purified granulocytes of voluntary, healthy donors were used for all tests. These cells were co-cultured with colon carcinoma cell line HRT 18 and irradiated. Their function was assessed by measuring of luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence and migration against the chemo-attractant fMLP. Results: While irradiation decreased, the addition of tumor cells increased reactive- oxygen species release in granulocytes, which was further enhanced by PMA, even after several hours. All contacts with tumor cells, however, caused immediate radical release, namely inversely proportional to the radiation dose. Naive and irradiated cells were further stimulated by PMA. Migration of granulocytes was clearly inhibited by tumor cells and irradiation, whereas the depth of invasion was enhanced by higher dosages of radiation. Conclusion: Our data clearly show that the influence of radiotherapy on local defense against cole-rectal carcinoma is limited and cannot explain by itself the increased rate of infectious complications. P603 A NEW, COMPUTER-ASSISTED REAL-TIME 3 D NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR INTERSTITIAL BRACHYTHERAPY R. Krempien, C.D. Haag, W. Harms, C. Kozak, Hofele, S. D~.uber, M. Treiber, J. interstitial brachytherapy depends primarily on the precise placement of the needles. A navigation system enables not only the accurate needle implantation but also allows to take into account critical structures in the surgical approach. The purpose of this work was to develop and test a computer assisted real time 3D navigation system for interstitial brachytherapy procedures. Methods and Material: The commercially available 3-D navigation system SPOCS (Aesculap, Germany) was used. A dedicated instrument for 3D navigation based needle implantation integrated into hard- and software environment was developped. Instrument and system accuracy were correlated. Custom made phantoms containing targets and fiducal markers were CT scanned. A pathway for implantation was determined using the SPOCS system. Needle implantation was performed using the dedicated instrument according to the planning. After implantation a second CT scan was registered with the planning- CT in order to account the needle position and the deviation from the designed pathway. Results: In the first test a phantom with a single target was used to study the accuracy of the navigation system. Ten different phantoms were used. Each phantom was used 5 times with different pathways in order to ensure a correct needle-positioning from different angles. The analysis of 50 different targets showed a mean 3D-accuracy below one mm, with a standard deviation around 0.5 mm (max. deviation 2.3 mm). In a second test a custom made phantom with seven geometrical targets (isosceles triangles at a distance of 1.2 cm in all 3 dimensions) was made. This experiment was designed to study the accuracy of volume implants. After definition of the pathways each needle was inserted individually based on the navigation system only. The mean accuracy of all 7 needles in 10 different experiments was approx. 1.5 mm in the x- and y-axis, and 0.4 mm in the z-axis. The standard deviation was around 0.5 mm (max.deviation 2.1 ram). Conclusions: The development of a dedicated brachytherapy needle implantation device integrated in a 3D-surgical navigation system enables the exact, reproducible and reliable implantation of brachytherapy needles. This development should provide a significant improvement in nowadays interstitial brachytherapy applications with regard to needle distribution and surgical risk of needle implantation and may enable to use brachytherapy in new indications. P604 THE \"WHITE-LUNG-SYNDROME\" IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE LEUKEMIA - EFFICACY OF RADIOTHERAPY J. FLiller, E. (Jena) Objective: The ,White-Lung-Syndrome\" is a very rare complication in patients with acute leukemia. The obstruction of pulmonary capillaries by leukemic cells can result in a pulmonary insufficiency. Can radiotherapy help in this acute problem ? Methods: This is a case report of 3 patients with acute myeloic leucemia (63/ male/AML-M1, 55/male/AML-M1, patients have received radiotherapy of both lungs with a daily dose of 1 Gy and a total dose between 2 and 4 Gy additionally to the chemotherapy during the acute pulmonary insufficiency. Results: Within 3 to 5 days after the beginning of the irradiation the pulmonary function improved, confirmed by an increase of the pC2 in all patients (4,9-8,1 kPa; 6,2-8,8 kPa; 5,3-9,3 kPa). In the same interval the leukemic cells in the peripheral blood showed a decrease from 303.000/194.000 (AML-M1) and 72.000 (AML-M5) per microliter to values below 5.000 per microliter in all 3 cases. All patients are in remission; the actual follow-up is at 25, 20 and 7 months after finishing radiotherapy. Conclusions: The radiotherapy of the lungs with a daily dose of 1 Gy and total doses between 2 and 4 Gy is an effective additional treatment without toxicity in acute leukemia-patients with ,,White-Lung-Syndrome\" and pulmonary insufficiency. S 120 Radiotherapy / Cancer Surgery P605 ENERGY DOSE CALCULATIONS OF THE SALIVARY GLANDS AT THE RADIOIODINE THERAPY - HOW IMPORTANT IS THE MICRODOSIMETRY W. Jentzen, E. Schneider, R. G6rges, S.P. M~Jller, W. Brandau, A. Bokisch, Nuklearmedizin Uni Essen (Essen) Energy dose calculations of the salivary glands at the radioiodine therapy - How important is the microdosimetry? Aim. After ingestion of 131-Iodine as for example at the radioiodine therapy (RIT) of the differentiated thyroid carcinoma, it can be occasionally observed that the salivary glands are seriously damaged. The cause is that the 131-Iodine is accumulated not only in the normal or tumorous thyroid gland, but also, however, in lesser extent GII. parotes (GII.p.) and GII. submandibulares (GII.sm). The aim of this work is to calculate the individual energy dose at the radioiodine therapy of thyroidectomized patients using a reliable analysis model. From this data, dose-effect relationship can be established. Methods. A total number of 55 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma are investigated (cumulated activity 5 - 30 GBq; single activity 4 - 6 GBq). The time activity curves are measured with a gamma camera up to 48 h after ingestion of the radiodine capsule. A critical parameter is the background activity. For this purpose, three models are used for measuring the region of interest (ROl): background ROI (a) positioned lateral from the glands, (b) localized at the cerebrum und (c) fitted with a Gaussian/Lorentzian model for the background and the glands. The setup was calibrated with a neck phantom. Finally, the gland volumes are mainly determined by sonography and verified with magnetic resonance tomography. Results. On the basis of the individual volumes of the salivary glands, the average energy dose of each single GII. p. and GII.sm. are about 0.15 and 0.50 Gy/GBq, respectively. The maximum error of the individual energy dose was approximately 50 %. Furthermore, a comparison of the three analysis models shows that the background ROI over the cerebrum is favorable. Conclusions. Under the common assumption of a homogeneous activity distribution, the normalized energy doses are significantly to small of about one magnitude; therefore, the observed radiation damages cannot be explained within the framework of the MIRD concept. This fact indicates an inhomogeneous activity distribution in the glands. A dose model that solves this contradiction and even takes into account the physiologically known properties of the salivary glands is proposed. P606 PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF A NEW QUESTIONNAIRE MEASURING S. Sehlen, FahmQIler, P. (MQnchen) Purpose: The aim of this study is to develop and validate a brief self-report questionnaire designed to measure psychosocial distress in cancer patients attending radiotherapy. Methods and Results: Items were primarily derived from the analysis of empirical data gained from the Questionnaire on Stress in Cancer Patients (QSC, Herschbach 1987), the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS, Zung 1976), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-General (FACT-G, Celia et al. 1993) during a quality-of-life study involving more than 1400 Patients, and from semi-structured clinical interviews conducted with cancer patients receiving radiation treatmenL Besides general distress items the questionnaire contains specific radiotherapy- induced stress items such as being afraid of the radiation machine and possible side effects, feeling helpless on the radiation table, and not being sufficiently informed of the effect of radiation. A sample of 102 patients with different cancer diagnosis undergoing radiation therapy participated in this study. Factor analysis supports a 4-scale structure of the 21-item questionnaire with the following subscales and reliability coefficients (Cronbach's Alpha): 1) emotional distress/ physical performance (alpha = .89), 2) radiotherapy (alpha = .77), 3) partnership (alpha = .71), 4) information/psychosocial support (alpha = .77), and the total score: (alpha = .89). Construct validity has been checked by the correlation coefficient between the new questionnaire and established instruments. First, there is a high degree of correlation between subscale 1 and a) the depression scale of the HADS (r = .68), b) the anxiety scale of the HADS (r = .58), and c) the emotional scale of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (r = .42). Second, there is a lower but still significant negative correlation between the total score of the new questionnaire and the global quality of life scale of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (r = - .36). Conclusions: The new questionnaire meets the requirements including brevity, reliability, validity and acceptance for use in oncology patients receiving radiation therapy. The questionnaire enables screening of distressed cancer patients receiving radiotherapy treatment and hence fulfils the purpose of identifying patients in need for psychosocial support. P607 MALE GONADAL DOSE IN ADJUVANT PELVIC IRRADIATION FOLLOWING ANTERIOR RESECTION OF RECTAL CANCER - INFLUENCE TO FERTILITY M.D. Piroth, D. Zierhut, F. Universit#.tsklinikum (Heidelberg) Introduction: Rectal cancer is a common malignant disease and occurs not infrequently in younger men. From 400 men treated in our institution during the last five years, 37 (9,3%) were 50 years, 16 men (4%) were 45 years and five men were 35 years old or younger. We verified the dose to the testes from scattered radiation in adjuvant pelvic irradiation following anterior resection of rectal cancer. Material/Method: We measured the gonadal dose of ten patients in vivo with thermoluminescence detectors, which were fixed on four defined points on the scrotum during radiation on three consecutive days. All patients were treated three-dimensional planned using a three-field box lying in prone position in a bellyboard. The caudal field size was in projection of the ischiadic bone 4-/- 1 cm cranio-caudal. A total dose of 50,4 Gy was given in 28 fractions of 1,8 Gy, using 23 MV photon energy. From 45 up to 50,4 Gy the radiation fields were modified for a complete shielding of the small bowel. Results: The measured mean gonadal dose per fraction was 0,058 Gy (0,03-0,195 Gy, Gy) with a standard deviation from 0,037 Gy. The calculated cumulative mean dose after 28 fractions was 1,62 Gy (0,84-5,46). Discussion: Germinal epithelium is fractionated irradiation, like a negative fractionation effect. It is known that gonadal total doses of 1 Gy with single doses of 0,03-0,05 Gy can result in a temporary azoospermia. When gonadal total doses exceed 1,5 Gy a substantial increase in long-term azoospermia must be expected. A substantial decrease in their quality of life, especially in patients with desire to have children, and psychological problems can result. So the posttherapeutic fertility must be an important factor in therapeutic considerations. With respect to the data reported in the literature our measured mean gonadal total dose (1,62 Gy) will lead with high probability to a long-term azoospermia respective infertility. Because of the small number of patients treated, the data must be interpreted with caution and further valid data must be assured, however, the tendency seems clear. Conclusion: It is very important in patient conversations to draw attention to the risk of infertility. The possibility of sperm cryoconservation must be discussed. Cancer SurQery Oral Presentation 0608 SENTINEL LYMPH NODE DISSECTION IN CUTANEOUS MALIGNANT MELANOMA; RESULTS IN 381 CONSECUTIVE CASES A. Arens, J. Osinga, A. Lippold, V. Schwipper, H. Tilkorn, In the sentinel lymph node (SLN) reflects the histological features of the lymphatic basin with high accuracy. However, prognostic relevance of the method remains questionable. We describe our experience in 381 consecutive clinical cases of UICC stage la - Ill primary melanoma. Patients and methods: 200 women and 181 men, age from 14 to 86, mean 54 years, mean follow-up 10 (1-36) months, lymphoscintigraphy was followed by gamma probe guided SLN biopsy 24 hours later. Results: SLNs were successfully found 93% of truncal melanoma and in 97% of melanoma of the extremities, according to the preoperatively marked regions. In 86% of head and neck patients, one or more SLN could be harvested. 84% of truncal midline melanoma showed two or more regional basins, in contrast to 18% of non-midline melanoma. Histopathological analysis revealed occult nodal 25% of all patients. 12% of the SLN in low risk melanoma (pT1 and pT2) had micrometastases, indicating early risk melanoma (pT3 lymphadenectomy revealed residual nodal disease in 2 cases of low risk melanoma and in 8 cases of high risk melanoma. Tumor relapse was noted in 5% of negative SLN patients versus 14% of positive SLN patients. The results of SLN biopsy were false negative in 2%, accurate in 98%. The method shows a sensitivity of 95%. Conclusions: SLN dissection is a simple and reliable method of staging regional lymph nodes. Furthermore, it can localize occult metastases in unexpected lymphatic basins that would not be found in elective lymph node dissection (ELND). It presents an essential method to establish strati- fication criteria for future adjuvant trials. Further long term follow-up is needed to investigate prognostic relevance on recurrence and overall survival. 0609 THE EFFECT OF HYPERTHERMIA IN ISOLATED LIMB PERFUSION (ILP) ON TUMOR RESPONSE AND ANGIONEOGENESIS OF MALIGNANT MELANOMA IN A RAT MODEL J. Pelz, M. Mollwitz, C. Stremmel, T. for multiple, Iocoregional intransit metastases of malignant melanoma on the extremities. Because hyperthermia exerts an impact on tumor growth the aim of this experimental study was to determine the effect of ILP on tumor response and angioneogenesis under hyperthermic and normothermic conditions. Methods: A human melanoma xenograft (SK-MEL-3) was implanted into the hindlimbs of 30 nude rats (Rowett mu/rnu). The animals were randomized into five study groups of six animals each: group I: control (no therapy), group I1: sham S 121 Cancer Surgery group (skin incision without ILP), group Ill: external hyperthermia with a tissue temperature of 41,5 \u00b0C 30 minutes without ILP, group IV: (Ringer's solution as perfusate, minutes, group V: hyperthermic ILP (tissue temperature 41,5 \u00b0C for 30 minutes). Tumor reponse was documented with excision of the tumor for immunhistochemical analysis 6 weeks postoperatively. Tumor tissue was examined for expression of 0D34, factor VIII (v WP), integrin-b5 and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Results: Average tumor volumes of the controls (I) increased from 105 mm3 to 1388 ram3 during six weeks. In the sham operated group (11) tumor volumes were significantly larger than in group I (2950 mm3, p=0,021, Kruskal-Wallis). Tumor volumes in group IV were significantly smaller than in group I and lowest in group V (p= 0,036 and p= 0,005, resp.). There were no significant differences in size between group I and group III after six weeks. In group I, II and III tumor progression was observed in all animals clinically and histologically. In group IV and V each, 5 animals showed tumor progression and one had a partial tumor response. Immunhistochemical analysis of the histological sections demonstrated that angioneogenesis was more pronounced in group II than in group I and less pronounced in group IV and V compared with group I. There were no apparent differences in the expression of angiogenetic markers between group I and group IlL Conclusion: Our results suggest that even a surgical manipulation such as a skin incision promotes tumor growth, probably by induction of growth factors. External hyperthermia of 41.5 \u00b0C tissue temperature for 30 minutes only has no impact on tumor growth and angioneogenesis in vivo. Hyperthermie isolated limb perfusion effectively suppresses tumor angioneogenesis respectively tumor growth. O610 RESULTS OF LIVER SURGERY FOR LOCALLY ADVANCED CHOLANGIO CELLULAR CARCINOMA (CCC) M. Kaun, H. Lang, M. Malag6, K. Oldhafer, A. Frilling, C.E. Broelsch, Universit~ttsklinikum Essen (Essen) Patients with locally advanced CCC carry a poor prognosis. Thus far extended liver surgery did not provide benefit because of significant perioperative mortality. We report our results of extended surgical treatment in patients with locally advanced CCC. Between 4/1998 and 8/2001 478 liver resections were performed in our department. CCC in UICC-stage IV was the indication in 16 patients (3,34%; m:f=6:10; mean age 60 years). One patient underwent a re-resection for intrahepatic recurrence of CCC. The operative procedures were: extended right R0 and R1 n=7 respectively, R2 n=2. All patients after R0-resection are alive, median survival is 10 month (1-27 month). All patients after Rl-resection developed a recurrence within 5 months. After R1/R2-resection median survival was 5 month (3-16 month); two patients are alive after 5/7.5 month with intrahepatic recurrence. Extended surgical treatment should be attempted if a R-0-resection seems possible. There is no survival benefit following R1/R2-resection, although palliative exten- ded surgery seems to be justified in symptomatic patients improving quality of life.. O611 MALIGNANT FIBROUS HISTOCYTOMA OF THE EXTREMITIES AND School (Hamburg; Boston, USA) Malignant fibrous histiocytoma is the most common subtype of soft tissue sar- coma. Detailed understanding of this turnout type may lead to improved thera- peutical strategies. Therefore, an institutional review was performed about all MFH patients operated on between 1988 and 1998. Eighty-six- patients with histologically confirmed MFH were analyzed. Overall survival was 65% at 5 years and 52% at 10 years. Tumour size significantly influenced prognosis (P < 0.01, risk ratio [RR] 5.5), as did tumour depth (eubfascial turnouts, P = < 0.01, RR 3.3), and presence of lymph nodes (P = 0.02, RR 6.5). Positive microscopic margins and subfaseial tumours were associated with an increased local recurrence rate (RR 5.7, P < 0.0001 and RR 3.5, P = 0.02, respectively). The only multivariate risk factors of distant metastases were tumour depth, in which patients with subfascial tumours fared worse (RR 3.5, P < 0.01) and tumour grade (RR 4.0, P = 0.03). We conclude that aggressive but limb preserving resection of MFH should be per- formed at initial operation to minimize risk of local recurrence; a strict follow-up especially of subfaecial tumours should be performed. Poster P612 INSUFFICIENCY OF ANASTOMOSIS AS A RISK FACTOR FOR LOCAL RECUR- RENCE IN RECTAL CANCER M. Siassi, Clinical practice suggests a negative influence of septic complications such as insufficiency of anastomosis on the local recurrence rate after curative surgery for rectal cancer. However, data on this issue are scarce and conflicting. We analyzed the records of 1229 patients operated on for carcinoma of the rectum. The data were collected prospectively in the Erlangen tumor-registry. The univariate analysis was done using Kaplan-Meier curves compared with the Logrank-Test. Multivariate Analysis was performed using Cox-Regression models. Of the 1229 patients, 89 (7,2%) had an insufficiency of anastomosis of any degree. Gf these patiens, 20 (22%) developed a subsequent local recurrence while 96 of the 1040 (8,4%) with no signs of anastomotic leakage developed local failure (p=0,0695). The multivariate analysis, controlled for TNM-Stage, location of the tumor in the rectum, intraoperative tear of the tumor, age and sex, showed, that patients who had an anastomotic leak had a relative risk of 1,95 (p=0,008) to develop local recurrence.Our data show that insufficiency of anastomosis is a strong, indepen- dent risk actor for local recurrence after curative resection for rectal cancer. Whether these patients should undergo adjuvant therapy to prevent local recurrence should be adressed in controlled studies. P613 TECHNIQUES AND RESULTS OF ESOPHAGEAL CANCER SURGERY IN GER- MANY T.P. HQttl, T.K. study aimed to evaluate the techniques and outcome of surgical treatment for esophageal cancer in Germany by a nation-wide representative survey. Methods: A questionnaire including 55 structured items concerning indication, technique, number of procedures, complications and mortality was sent to 20% randomly selected German general, visceral and thoracic surgeons in 2000 (n=308). Results: The response rate was 71.4% (n=220). In 1999 these hospitals performed approximately 340000 procedures including 1677 operations for esophageal diseases in 56 hospitals, 891 of them were esophagectomies. A total of 706 operations for esophageal cancer and 285 for cancer of the cardia were reported. Gastric interposition was the most common technique to restore alimentary tract continuity (86%). Interposition of the colon (ascending colon 64%) is a common procedure in 22 centers only, indicating, that the experience with this kind of esophageal reconstruction is small. No significant differences in complication and mortality rates between gastric transposition or colon interposition were observed. The overall complication rate was 60.6% with 35.8% and 42.4% surgical 3.0% mortality was 7.9% for gastric transposition and 10.5% for colon interposition. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 24.2 days. Conclusions: This study indicates that gastric transposition is frequently used for reconstruction after esophageal resection for malignant disease. It appears that the colon is not as accepted as the stomach for reconstruction, although the reported complication rates compare very well with these reported after gastric transposition. Furthermore, these study allows an realistic valuation of the overall risk of these techniques. P614 SURGICAL AND ADJUVANT THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES IN THE TREATMENT OF EXTRAABDOMINAL DESMOID TUMORS ag- gressive growth pattern. Due to their strong tendency for extensive microinfiltration of surrounding tissues, amputations or other mutilating procedures with resulting functional deficits are often required for R0-resection. Nowadays additional therapeutic approaches such as radiation, hormonal therapy or chemotherapy have gained some popularity in the adjuvant treatment of these tumors. Because treatment recommendations remain still controversial, we wish to discuss this matter based on a population of patients who have been treated in our department in the past six years. Material and Methods: Since 1995 we have treated eight patients (six female, two male, mean age 32 y) with histological evidence of an extraabdominal desmoid tumor. The postoperative follow-up period lasted from two months up to six years. The following data have been collected by recherche of the archiv as well as by interview of the patients. Results: At the time of first contact with our service, four patients were primarily diagnosted. The other four patients presented with the first or even later recurrence of the tumor, which had been previously treated. In three cases the tumor was located in the rectus abdominis muscle, in one patient the tumor infiltrated the chest wall and in three cases the extremities were involved. In one patient with a Gardner-Syndrom, multiple desmoid tumors were reseeted from head, shoulder, back, abdominal wall and pelvis. A wide tumor excision with > 5 cm resection margins was the goal; at the extremities a compartment resection was preformed. Four of the patients received adjuvant radiation therapy, in one case treatment was continued with tamoxifen and alpha-interferon. Three of the eight patients - one of them with Gardner's Syndrome - had a further recurrence of the tumor or treatment was palliative. Conclusions: Despite of advances in adjuvant therapeutic modalities, the radical surgical approach is still the most important option in the treatment of desmoid tumors. Modern plastic surgical approaches allow extremity preservation with motor reconstruction. Radiation, hormonal and chemotherapy are additional tools in the adjuvant therapy of desmoid tumors. S 122 Cancer Surgery Publication only P'615 IMPROVED PATIENTS SURVIVAL BY A DIFFERENTIATED SURGICAL AP- PROACH IN METASTATIC DISEASE OF THE SKELETON H.R. Autoptic examinations show metastatic lesions of the bone in 70 % of all carcinoma patients, in approx. 15 % they cause clinical symptoms. Due to advanced multi- modal therapeutic concepts in recent years the prognosis of carcinoma patients could be significantly improved. Caused by prolonged overall survival metastatic disease to the bone becomes more and more significant. Being traditionally treated in a palliative approach, now in some cases, curative resection is considered. Methods:Between 10/1980 to 07/1993 228 consecutive patients with metastatic bone lesions surgically treated were retrospectively studied. In addition detailed examinations were done on patients with breast and kidney cancer metastasis to the bone from 1980 to 1999. Results: The 1-year survival rate was the same in the extremity and spinal metastases group. There was no difference by age or extent of bone involvement in those patients surviving less than 2 years. Most predictive were further organs involved (42% vv. 18%), duration of symptoms (= 6 months 23%, > 6 months 43%) and the tumor entity. Three prognostically different subgroups of patients with skeletal metastasis could be defined in correlation to 4 proven positiv prognostical factors: (1) patients with no extraosseous lesions; (2) patients with breast or thyroid cancer; (3) patients with no lung cancer; (4) patients with Clinical symptoms longer than 3 months. Patients with 0-1 of these factors deceased in 83 % in the first year, patients with 2-3 factors deceased in 48 % after one year and patients with 4 positiv factors survived in 93 % the first year after surgery (Fig.).ConclusionA palliative approach in surgical treatment of metastatic lesions to the bone is no longer justified in many cases. Results of radical resections especially in respect to prognosis and overall survival are optimistic and should draw more attention. Also local recurrencies caused by an inadequate palliative surgical approach may cause a siginficant morbidity to the patients. But there are defined situations or entities, as for example in patients with skeletal lesions due to breast cancer, in which a surgical improvement of the patients prognosis is not achievable and non-surgical forms of therapy may show advantages. In conclusion an advanced differentiated analysis of patients with metastatic disease to the bone respecting the shown prognostica] parameters does not only improve the patients survival but also his quality of life. 08 06 P 04 02 OO ~L t2 24 36 48 60 Monate p=O 0001 P'616 INDICATIONS FOR LOCAL SURGERY OF RECTAL CARCINOMA REGARDING THE APPEARANCE OF LYMPHATIC METASTASIS A. Dietrich, M. Wuttke, F. Walter, M. Sch6nfelder, Universit~.t Leipzig (Leipzig) Patients and methods: Aim of the study was to determinate the risks of local surgery of rectal carcinoma regarding lymphatic metastasis. We investigated the appearance of lymphatic metastasis in 290 patients suffering from a carcinoma of the rectum retrospectively. Results: 112 of 290 patients (38,6 %) had secondarys at the time of operation. 66 cases (22,8 % of 290; 59 % of 112) showed single lymphatic lesions (pNl: 35, pN2: 31), 17 cases (5,9 % of 290) with single haematogenious lesions and 29 patients (10 % of 290; 8,9 % of 112) with booth lymphatic and haematogenious metastasis (pNl: 11, pN2: 18). Proximal involved lymph nodes were preferably nodes at the A. rect. sup. (n=17) and at the A. mesent, inf. (n=4); furthermore, a small number of lateral-iliacal lymph nodes were positive (n=3). In 4 cases ( 1,4% of all 290 patients ) we found lymphatic metastasis along the A. rect. sup., whereas the local lymph nodes at the tumor were free of any lesions. Conclusions: Low-risk-Tumors ( with little risk of lymphatic metastasis and possible local surgery ) have to have the following features: 1: T-Stadium: (p)Tis; (p) T1; in case (G1), ( G2 questionable); 3: No vessel infiltration; 4: M and N negative (no enlargement of lymph nodes); 5: Tumor size: Length < 2 cm, width < 1 cm, deep < 0,5 cm, diameter < 2 cm, volume < 1 cm3; 6: Normal preoperative CEA and CA 19-9; 7: Recommended safety distance of 5-10 mm in cases of local resection. Further discussed factors, however insignificant, for a low risk of lymphatic metastasis are: histological type of tumor: adenocarcinoma, preferably not mucineous; mainly polypeous growth and signs of a strong inflammatory stroma reaction. P'617 PATHO-HISTOLOGICAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT OF A MULTICENTER Erlangen, Heidelberg, Bayreuth) A prerequisite for assessing prognosis following surgery of colon cancer is pathologic analysis of the resection specimen. Within the Interdisciplinary Trial for Adjuvant Colon Cancer Treatment (INTACT), the quality of pathohistolegical assessment of the resection specimen was evaluated after reviewing the documentation sheets for pathologists (according to ADT). After randomieation of 120 patients, an interim analysis was performed. The documentation sheets of all these patients were complete and comprehensive. The R classification and the distribution of the patients within the pT and pN categories were entirely and consistently documented. Nevertheless, in 15 patients, information of the involvement of the lateral resection margins was not provided. In general, an average of 26 (+/- 16) lymph nodes were examined for each patient. Three out of these had metastases (range: 1- 19 involved lymph nodes). The prevalence of high-grade carcinomas was 24% and therefore comparable to the data published in the literature. Lymphatic invasion was diagnosed in 43% of the cases, which was also equal to published data. In nine cases, data concerning the status of the lymphatic vessels were missing. Venous invasion occurred in 4% of the cases; a value that is toe low in contrast to previously published data of 30%. In summary, our data indicate for the first time, that the pathohistological assessment of colon cancer resection specimen meet the quality criteria set up for interdisciplinary trials. However, in future studies, the prognostic impacts of the lateral resection margin and also of lymphatic invasion and venous involvement should be further emphasized. P'618 WIRE MARKING FOR MELANOMA METASTASES C. Volt, M. Proebstle, ultrasound (US) was done during follow-up of melanoma patients to detect and localize the position of metastases in lymph node basins and along in-transit distances. Due to increased sensitivity of diagnostic procedures, soft tissue metastases in melanoma patients are frequently detected very early. However, small sizes, deep location or position close to vulnerable structures could render subsequent surgery quite difficult. Objective: To test the feasibility and effectiveness of presurgical ultrasound guided anchor-wire marking of melanoma metastases. Methods: We selected melanoma patients with cytologically proven metastases in clinical stage II1 which were either unfavorably located or which have failed removal by previous surgery. Anchor-wire marking was performed ultrasound guided and free-hand style without the use of local anesthesia. Results: 12 procedures in 9 patients were well tolerated without any complications. In 11 cases the wire tip proved to be located within the tumor lesion, in one case the wire tip missed the target by less than 5 mm and thus was close enough to support appropriate surgery. In 3 of the 15 cases the surgical removal was performed as a second intervention following an ineffective previous surgical intervention. The median diameter of the removed metastases was 18.5 mm (range 7 - 30 ram) Conclusion: US is highly effective in discriminating lymph node metastases and subcutaneous nodes from non-specific innocent nodes thus enabling early detection of tumor recurrences. Combined with the here presented technique of marking metastases with a tumor wire removal of nodal disease can be established in a nearly non-invasive way. Ultrasound guided anchor-wire marking of unfavorably located melanoma metastases is feasible and might facilitate subsequent surgery. P'619 INTRAOPERATIVE AUTOTRANSFUSION IN CANCER SURGERY IMMUNOENZYMATIC DETECTION OF TUMOR CELLS AND POSSIBILITIES OF ELIMINATION T.K. transfusion has been avoided in cancer surgery because of the danger of tumor cell dissemination. This study evaluated the efficacy of a leucocyte removal filter in removing tumor cells from the salvaged blood. Methods: Blood shed from the surgical field of gastric cancer surgery (n=14) was collected in a cell-saver-reservoir and analyzed for tumor cells. Thei were identefied in cytospin speciments by their content of cytokeratins (CK18). We tested the elimination of these tumor cells by using a leucocyte filter (PALL@ RC 400). In a second experiment we prepared red blood cell concentrates first after passing the blood through a leucocyte depletion filter and second we prepared deep frozen red blood cell concentrates without previous filtration (n=7). Results: in all cases, lots of tumor cells were detected in the blood shed during oncologic surgery (15,4+/-10,8 CK18-positive cells/10 ml salvaged blood). The leucocyte depletion filter was able to remove about more than 99 per cent of these tumor cells (0,14+/-0,10 CK18-positive cells/10 ml salvaged blood after filtration, p < 0,001). In the deep frozen red blood cell concentrates there were even more tumor cells left than in the specimens with previous filtration (5,0+/-4,95 CK18- S 123 Cancer Surgery / Cancer Metastasis positive cells/10 ml deep frozen red blood cell concentrate versus 0,16+/-0,32 CK18-positive cells/red blood cells after filtration, p < 0,01). Conclusions: Tumor cells are easily removed with a leucocyte removal filter. Although our experimental results do not prove that intraoperative autotransfusion using RC 4go-filtration is absolutely save, they demonstrate a marked reduction in the risk of retransfusing tumor cells in patients undergoing oncologic surgery for gastric cancer at relatively little additional cost. P'620 RADICAL HYSTERECTOMY FOR CERVICAL CANCER USING A COMPUTER- CONTROLLED computer-controlled bipolar diathermy system (LigaSure) for radical hysterectomy in cervical cancer was tested. Methods: Patients with cervical cancer staged FIGO IB were subjected to abdo- minal radical hysterectomy LigaSure (Tyco-Autosuture) device. LigaSure was designed to optimally seal vessels < or = 7 mm in diameter as an electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer. We tested LigaSure not only on uterine and ovarian vessels for hemostasis but also on structures to be dissected otherwise by standard surgical methods - as recorded by digital video. Operating time as well as intra- and post-operative blood loss were monitored. The margins of the removed tissue was examined histopathologically. Results: Using LigaSure as a vessel sealing system the following structures were safely sealed: Uterine artery/vein, ovarian artery/vein, cardinal ligament, round ligament, retroperitoneal vessels, round ligament, uterosacral ligament, vesicouterine ligament, and ureter tunnel (unroofing). Parametrial tissue and adjacent paracolpos close to the pelvic wall was safely sealed and removed. Thermal damage was found to be limited to about 2 mm from the surgical site. No increased blood loss was observed. The operating time was not extended by the procedure. The amount of foreign material (sutures, surgical clips) was reduced. Conclusion: The use of LigaSure in radical hysterectomy was safe. We found reduction in suture and clip usage while providing a quick and effective vascular control - even close to the pelvic wall - with reliable sealing of major vessels. The electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer device can also be used for structures other than blood vessels leaving acceptable margins for histopathology. Routine usage of LigaSure in radical hysterectomy may lead to reduced operation time and reduced blood loss. Cancer Metastasis Oral Presentation O621 OCCULT METASTATIC CELLS IN BONE MARROW - DETECTION, PROGNOSIS AND CLINICAL DECISION MAKING S. Braun, W. Janni, S. Christ, C. Ernst, E. Steyert, K. Pantel, M. Recent clinical studies with large patient numbers and meaningful periods of clinical follow-up (e.g. Braun et al NEJM 2000, Gerber et al JCO 2001) strongly support the clinical value of the presence of occult metastatic cells in bone marrow (BM). Here we report the potential value of such extended tumour staging for prognostic evaluation and clinical decision making utilising a two-centre (Munich, Augsburg) patient cohort of 1.552 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients with stage I-Ill disease which comprises a sub-cohort of node-negative patients without adjuvant systemic therapy. Median length of follow-up was 47 (range, 18-78) months. Risk of turnout relapse was categorised according to presence of occult metastatic cells in BM and 2001 St. Gallen Consensus Recommendations. Categorisation of age at 35 years, grading at G1, and tumour size at 2 cm resulted in 102 low-risk node-negative (group 1), 717 high-risk node-negative (group 2), and 733 node-positive patients (group 3). Of these, 27%, 33% and 36% had cytokeratin-positive BM samples, respectively. In the presence of occult metastatic cells in BM, the risk of tumor-related death was significantly increased in group 1 (p=0.023), group 2 (p<0.O001), and group 3 (p<O.0001), as compared to patients without cytokeratin-positive cells in BM. In the absence of cytokeratin-positive cells, cancer-specific mortality was 0% and 1% for group 1 and group 2 patients. Forward multivariate regression analysis, allowing for age, turnout size, lymph node metastasis, grade and oestrogen receptor, revealed that the presence of occult metastatic cells in BM is an independent prognostic indicator of the risk of death from breast cancer (RR 4.1, 95% CI 2.5-6.8, p<0.O001). We conclude that with respect to therapeutic strategies whose aim is to prevent metastatic disease, the detection of occult metastatic cells in BM may become a useful means of stratifying risk among the heterogeneous group of potentially curable breast cancer patients. The extremely low cancer-specific mortality in patients without occult metastatic cells in BM (irrespective of group affiliation) justifies the use of this marker for clinical decision making (e.g. for systemic adjuvant treatment under study conditions). 0622 TUMOR CELL ADHESION UNDER HYDRODYNAMIC CONDITIONS OF FLUID FLOW J. Haler, N. Senninger, G. L. Nicolson, Univerit~.tsklinikum M0nster, Institute for Molecular Medicine (MOnster, Huntington Beach, CA) Purpose: The interactions of blood-borne colorectal carcinoma cells with the vessel walls of host organs are important during hematogenous formation of distant metastases. To adhere to the vessel wall, circulating tumor cells that come into contact with the microvasculature must resist the tractive forces of the flow of plasma and other circulating cells that tend to detach them from the wall. Furthermore, hydrodynamic shear forces appear to modulate cellular signaling and adhesive properties. We investigated the regulation of tumor cell adhesion to extracellular matrix components under the influence of hydrodynamic shear forces. Methods: Using a parallel plate laminar flow chamber metastatic tumor cell adhesion under flow conditions was investigated. The regulation of colorectal cancer cell adhesion by integrins, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and pp6Osrc was using or antisense oligonucleotides, respec- tively. Wall shear adhesion threshold, dynamic and adhesion stabilization rate were used to quantify dynamic cell adhesion. Furthermore, effects of shear forces on phosophorylation status of focal adhesion proteins in colon carcinoma cells was examined. Results: Shear forces alone were able to induce signal transduction events in HT-29 colon carcinoma cells, such as hyperphosphorylation of FAK and paxillin, which was modified by inhibition of pp60src. Under flow conditions inhibition of betal-integrins resulted in complete loss of dynamic cell adhesion to extracellular matrix components. In addition, reduced expression of FAK and pp60src mediated by antisense oligonucleotides inhibited adhesive interactions in the presence of shear forces. Conclusions: Shear forces have been found to interfere with adhesion-mediated signaling in colorectal carcinoma cells. FAK and pp60src may be part of mechano-sensory complexes that can be involved in the regulation of integrin-mediated cell adhe- sion. Consideration of fluid dynamics of circulating colorectal cancer cell move- ment within the microcirculation appears to be required for understanding of processes that are involved in tumor cell adhesion during formation of distant metastases. 0623 IDENTIFICATION OF GENES REGULATED BY THE TUMOR INVASION AND METASTASIS REGULATOR TIAM1 V. Kehren, E. Springer, H. E. Gabbert, R. Engers, Heinrich-Heine-Universit&t (DQsseldorf) Aims: In previous studies we have shown that Tiara1 inhibits invasion and cell migration of human carcinoma cells in vitro. In order to identify genes, regulated by Tiara1 we examined the expression profiles of two different human renal cell carcinoma cell lines using cDNA-microarrays (CIontech). Methods: 32P-labelled cDNAs, synthezised from human RCC transfected with either empty vector or constitutively active Tiaml, were hybridized on a nylon membrane that was spotted with cDNAs of 1200 different genes. Significant differences in gene expression obtained this way were verified by independent methods e.g. Northern blot analysis and/or quantitative ,,Real-Time PCR\". Results: The cDNA-microarray analysis revealed 16 genes that were differentially expressed between mock- and Tiaml- transfected cells. Of these, TIMP1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinasel) proved to be upregulated by Tiaml also on the protein level and mediated its anti-invasive effect (Engers et al., JBC, 2001). MIC1 was about 10-fold upregulated in the Tiaml-transfected cell line. This was confirmed by Northern blot and ,,Real-Time PCR\". In addition, the RET proto-oncogene, ciliary neuronotrophic fibroblast growth factor 5 precursor (FGF5) and TRAP1, a tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein, were upregulated about 2-3-fold by Tiaml in the cDNA microarray. ,,Real- Time PCR\" confirmed that FGF5 was weakly upregulated in the Tiaml-transfected cell line. In contrast, neither upregulation of TRAP1 nor upregulation of RET could be confirmed by Northern blot and/or ,,Real-Time PCR\". Differential expression of CNTF and B-Myb has to be further investigated. Conclusions: TIMP1 upregulated Tiaml and mediates its anti-invasive MIC1 and FGF5 are potential target genes of Tiara1. Further studies on the protein level and concerning the functional relevance are required to establish their role as mediators of Tiaml-dependent cell biological properties. 0624 THROMBIN RECEPTOR PAR-1 PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PANCREATIC CANCER CELL INVASIVENESS IN VITRO C. Rudroff, C. of coagulation are frequently observed in cancer patients. This phenomenon is reflected in the excess production of thrombin. Meanwhile thrombin is thought to play an important role the progression of different solid tumors. Thrombin stimulation of pancreatic cancer cells leads to increased proliferation and enhanced adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. The cellular effects of thrombin are mediated by the thrombin receptor PAR-l, a member of the G protein coupled receptor family. The expression of PAR-1 correlates with the grade of differentiation on pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Aim of this study was to investigate the effect of PAR-1 down regulation on pancreatic S 124 Cancer Metastasis cancer cell invasion. Material and Methods: The human pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa-2, which is known to express high levels of PAR-l, was transfected with an antisense construct for PAR-1. The expression level of PAR-1 in the respective transfected and untransfected cells was determined by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. For invasion assays the respective transfected, control transfected (sense and mock) and untransfected cells were stimulated with thrombin (1.0 U/ml) and subjected to a standardized matrigel invasion assay. After 48 hours the number of invasive cells were counted. ANOVA was used for statistical analysis, significance was assumed at p<0.05. Results: Antisense transfection resulted in 80% reduction compared to untransfected MIA PaCa-2. The number of invasive cells in the Martigel invasion assay was reduced by 60% for the antisense transfected cells. The effect of thrombin treatment was also reduced significantly. The control transfected cells showed no change of invasiveness nor a reduced reactivity to thrombin stimulation compared to untransfected MIA PaCa-2. Conclusion: Down regulation of the thrombin receptor PAR-1 in pancreatic cancer cells by antisense transfection leads to significantly reduced invasiveness in vitro. These results emphasize the pathobiological role of PAR-1 in pancreatic cancer progression, in vivo assays to confirm the impact of PAR-1 expression on pancreatic cancer cell invasiveness are prospected. This could open future therapeutic options. 0625 SPLICING AND BINDING OF FACTORS TO CD44 VARIABLE EXON V4 IS MODULATED BY HUMAN TRA2 E. Stickeler, A. HcSnig, S. Fraser, S. Fraser, T. W. Mattox, I. Bunnebaum, S. Berget, Universit~t Freiburg, Baylor College of Medicine (Freiburg; Houston, USA) The human CD44 gene undergoes extensive alternative splicing of at least 10 alternative exons positioned as an internal block in the middle of the gene. Alternative exons v4-v6 have increased inclusion levels in numerous tumors including breast cancer and CD44 protein isoforms containing these exons are thought to be involved in tumor metastasis. Recently, we demonstrated that alternative exon v4 inclusion is increased upon over-expression of the DNA and RNA binding protein YB-1, a member of the y-box protein family and the RNA helicase p72. Exon v4 contains multiple copies of a CA-rich exon enhancer sequence required for optimal inclusion of this alternative exon and binding of YB-1. In this study we show that a prominent splicing factor in the serine-arginine-rich (SR) family of exon enhancer binding proteins, human Tra2, affected both the in vivo inclusion of exon v4 and the in vitro binding of YB-1 to the exon. The inclusion of exon v4 increased stepwise in a mouse model of mammary carcino- genesis with maximum levels in invasive tumors and their consecutive visceral metastasis. In parallel Tra2 levels also increased in these tissues, suggesting that the involvement of Tra2 in CD44 exon recognition may be important to the over-expression of CD44 alternative protein isoforms in breast cancer leading to tumor progression and metastasis. Poster P626 GENOMIC CHARACTERISATION OF LYMPHATIC major prognostic factors in colorectal cancer. Therefore the determination of genomic changes underlying lymphatic metastases is of high diagnostic and prognostic relevance and might influence therapeutical decisions. Methods: Colorectal cancers (n=50) were screened for chromosomal and subchromosomal alterations. We used the molecular cytogenetic technique, called CGH, to detect 1) the overall degree of chromosomal instability (ANCA) and 2) group-specific alterations such as gains and losses of chromosomal material. Group 1 consisted of T2N0 tumors (n=15), group 2 of T3-4N0 tumors (n=15) and group 3 of T3-4N1-2 tumors (n=20). Results: The chromosomal instability increases with greater T-stage (ANCA of group 1 tumors increases from 5.7 to 7.7 in group 2). An even greater differences was found between lympnode negative tumors compared to lymphnode positive tumors with the same T-stage (ANCA of group 2 with 5.7 increases to 9.9 in group 3). A more detailed analysis of specific chromosomal alterations revealed that the frequency of gains of chromosome 8q was about 70% in lymphnode positive tumors (T3-4N1-2) and rather rare in lymphnode negative tumors in only 13% of the cases even with the same T-stage (T3-4N0). Discussion: The presented data indicate that the potency of colorectal cancers to spread into surrounding lymphnodes correlates directly with the degree of chro- mosomal instability. As demonstrated from various groups gains and losses of chromosomal material directly influence the expression of corresponding oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes located at these chromosomal regions. Furthermore, our experiments show that genes on chromosome 8q might be especially required for lymphatic metasases formation. Additionally, the detection of 8q gains in clinically specimens preoperatively might be indicative for lymphnode involvement which is an important parameter for neoadjuvant therapeutical regimens. P627 POSTOPERATIVE MORTALITY, MORBIDITY AND M EDIAN HOSPITAL STAY AFTER EMERGENCY SURGERY FOR OBSTRUCTIVE ADVANCED ABDOMINAL OR RETROPERITONEAL TUMOR MASSES M. Wenzke, S. Leinung, M. Universit~.t Leipzig, Universit~.t Ulm (Leipzig, UIm) Background: Emergency surgery for abdominal cancer has become more aggres- sive over the last period. Since the on-table colonic lavage was described by Dudley the staged procedure was replaced by an immediate resection of the tumour with primary anastomosis for neoplastic obstruction of the colon. The purpose of this study was to analyse the outcome in patients with acute colonic obstruction from advanced abdominal or retroperitoneal tumour spreading. Methods: We analysed retrospectively the data of 29 patients who underwent emergency surgery to treat acute obstruction of the colon. Primary resection was performed in 11 patients, 18 patients were treated by caecostomy and/or by-pass anastomosis. The patients were followed up clinically for the hospital stay respectively until discharge. Results The postoperative mortality (18% vs. 3-9%) and morbidit&t (24-30% vs. 7-20%) is higher in patients with advanced tumour growing than in patients without severe abdominal or retroperitoneal turnout spreading. Slight differences were found in morbidit&t between radical or palliative surgical intervention (30 vs. 24%). The overalr median hospital stay was 16 _+ one day with no difference evident between patients didn't suffering from advanced turnout masses. Conclusion The data support further efforts towards improving the outcome of emergency surgery with primary resection and anastomosis in obstructive abdominal or retroperitoneal tumour masses not only in patients with moderate tumour manifestations but also in patients with an advanced spreading tumour. P628 DETECTION OF VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR (VEGF) AND PROLIFERATION-ASSOCIATED KI-67-ANTIGEN IN DISSEMINATED TUMOR CELLS OF THE BONE MARROW FROM PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CARCINOMA U. Windh~vel, N. B0cker, (LLibeck) Objective: The detection of epithelial carcinoma cells in bone marrow is often correlated to a poor prognosis of a tumor patient. The biological significance of these disseminated tumor cells is unknown. An important prerequisite for metastasation is the ability of cells to proliferate and to induce angiogenesis. The aim of our study was to gain information about the metastatic potential of disseminated tumor cells in the bone marrow of patients with a colorectal carcinoma. To this end, their proliferative activiy and the expression of angiogenic vascular endothelial growth (VEGF) was analysed immunocytochemically using the proliferation marker Ki-67 and an anti-VEGF antibody in combination with corresponding fiuorochromized secondary antibodies. Methods: 27 patients included in our study. Tumor cells from 20 ml bone marrow taken at the beginning of the operation under narcosis were enriched by the magnetic activated cell sorting technology (Fa. Miltenyi, Bergisch Galdbach) using the anti- HEAl25 antibody bound ,,microbeads\" and subsequently transferred to cytospins (50,000-200,000 cells/slide). To identify tumor cells and to detect Ki-67-antigen and VEGF, cells were triply labelled with antibodies Ber- EP4, Ki-67 and anti-VEGE Following incubation with the corresponding secondary antibodies, which were coupled to the fluorochromes Cy-2, AMCA and Cy-3, respectively, green, blue, or red fluorescing cells were visualized under a fluorescence microscope, photographed and counted. Results: After analysing 80,000-200,000 cells per patient, in 78% (21/27) of patients 59 tumor cells were identified by labelling with Ber-EP4/Cy-2. No tumor cell was found in the bone marrow of patients with pTl-tumors and in 4/16 (25%) of patients with pT3 tumors. In 59/59 (100%) of tumor cells VEGF-expression was detected and 2/59 (3%) were simultaneously positive for Ki-67-antigen. Conclusion: Most of the tumor cells found in bone marrow samples (57/59) did not show any proliferative activity. But for the first time VEGF expression as an important trait for an angiogenic phenotype was shown in all disseminated tumor cells. While the non-proliferating dormant cells are most probably resistant against chemotherapy depending on cell cycle, they could possibly be attacked by inhibition of VEGF expression (e.g. by antisense oligonucleotides). P629 SECRETION OF MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES: EARLY STEP FOR TUMOR CELL INVASION T. Ludwig, E.M. Schn~ker, R. Ossig, S. Gr~ssel, Chemie und Pathobioche (M~Jnster) Invasion is the most distinctive feature of malignant tumors characterized by active movement of tumor cells into surrounding tissue. However, no sensitive method is available to measure cancer cell invasion in a functional cell-based assay. We applied the recently developed resistance breakdown assay measuring changes in transepithelial resistance of a tight epithelial MDCK-C7-monolayer in response to tumor cells. This electrophysiological approach provides a continuous assay system for cancer invasion that demonstrates changes prior to visible morphometric changes. By means of this assay system we addressed the S 125 Cancer Metastasis question whether physical contact between tumor cell and epithelial monolayer is a prerequisite of tumor cell invasion. When human melanoma cells were seeded directly (i.e. physical contact) on top of an electrically tight epithelial cell layer (5800 _+ 106 Wcm2) electrical monolayer leakage occurred fast and efficient (18 \u00b1 3 % reduction in 24 h). When melanoma cells were seeded close to the basolateral surface of the epithelial cell monolayer but separated by a filter membrane (i.e. no physical contact) electrical leakage occurred even more effective (42 _+ 3 % reduction in 24 h). Atomic force microscopy detected discrete structural changes between cells. Electrical leakage could be effectively blocked by inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Zymography and secreted by the melanoma cells. conclude that exocytosis of soluble proteases causes electrical monolayer leakage that is the first step for tumor cell invasion. Physical contact between tumor cells and monolayer is not sufficient to attack the intact epithelium. P630 PATTERNS OF METASTASIS IN CUTANEOUS AND NON-CUTANEOUS MELANOMA primary mucosal melanoma is the rarest type of melanoma with the worst prognosis. The biological behaviour of mucosal melanoma was analyzed in comparison to other types of melanoma with regard to formation of metastasis. Patients and Methods: A total number of 41 patients suffering from mucosal melanoma of the head and neck from two different tertiary referral centers could be evaluated for the study. Clinical data were obtained from the patient's charts and were evaluated with the statistical software packages SPSS PC 6.0 and CSS:Statistica. The data were then compared to data of cutaneous melanoma, ocular melanoma as well as melanoma of unknown primary, which were obtained from publications with similar intention. Results: Initial lymph node metastases of mucosal melanoma were found in 12 of 41 patients, and distant metastases were found in 6 patients at initial presentation, one patient showed rnucosal in-transit metastases. Local recurrence was accompanied by lymph node metastases in 6 patients. Overall the metastases were found most often in the lymph nodes with a total of 26 of 41 patients. Second most common site, but with significantly fewer numbers were the lungs with 3 of 41 patients and the bones with 2 of 41 patients. Liver metastases were found in only one patient. The literature survey revealed that in cutaneous melanoma the most common metastatic site was the lung, followed by the lymph nodes, the skin and the liver. In ocular melanoma the most commonly affected organ was found to be the liver, followed by the lungs and bones. Lymph node metastases were rather uncommon in ocular melanoma. MUPs most often occured in lymph nodes, subcutaneous skin and viscera. Discussion: The comparison of the above mentioned data show that cutaneous, ocular and mucosal melanoma as well as MUPs show distinct patterns of metastases. It can be assumed that the different melanoma types show certain differences in biological behaviour. P631 REDUCTION OF METASTASES IN BREAST CANCER - PATIENTS TREATED WITH PREOPERATIVE HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY (HRT): A RETRO- SPECTIVE ANALYSIS IN WOMEN F. Sch~tz, I.J. Diel, M. P~schel, G. Bastert, .von Hoist, E. Solomayer, U. Haus, Universit~.tsfrauenklinik Heidelberg, IMEREM (Heidelberg, Nernberg) Substitution of estrogenes and progestins is the most common therapy and prophylaxis for postmenopausal discomforts like hot flushes, osteoporosis, etc. However in the majority of studies long term HRT has been associated with an slightly increased risk of breast cancer. On the other hand patients with preoperative HRT have a lower mortality and a longer overall-survival. For further investigation we examined 972 patients between 45 and 70 years at the time of the first diagnosis of breast cancer with and without HRT with regard to the incidence of bone metastases. 241 patients were premenopausal (mean 48.O&#61617;3.0y), 731 were postmenopausal (55.5&#61617;4.4y), 303 of them received HRT (group HRT+) and 428 patients not (group HRT-). Patients of group HRT+ received estrogenes over a minimum of 1 year (mean 5.5&#61617;4.0y). Although the tumor size of group HRT- was significantly higher than in group HRT+ (5.5&#61617;1.8 vs. 2.1&#61617;1.4), nodal status, S-phase fraction, grading and hormone-receptor status showed no differences. Adjuvant treatment in the postmenopausal groups were also not significantly different. In regard to the incidence of metastases patients without HRT have significantly (p<0.OOl) more bone metastases (49 patients of group HRT- versus 5 patients of group HRT+). Also pulmonal (18:2) and liver (28:6) metastases were significantly more frequent in patients without an preoperative HRT. It was shown in vivo and in clinical bisphosphonate trials that a normalization of bone metabolism is able to reduce subsequent bone metastases efficiently. We may assume that the incidence of bone metastases can be reduced by normalizing bone metabolism (soil) and lowering conditions of tumor cell seeding by HRT. P632 ROLE OF SELECTINS IN for the growth and metastasis of malignant tumors. Molecular mechanisms are not completely understood. The Selectins and their ligands are thought to play an impodant role in tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. In our studies, the role of the P-Selectin/CD24 receptor-ligand-system in the metastatic process was examined in orthotopic and metastasizing animal models. Material and Methods: For in vivo experiments we established the murine RENCA (renal cell carcinoma) model in Balb/c mice and the B16F10 mouse melanoma model in wild-type and P- Selectin-knock-out C57BL/6 mice. FACS and immunhistochemical analysis were performed to analyze Selectin expression and vessel density. Results: P-Selectin as well as E-Selectin overexpression was shown on tumor cells of the RENCA model. In vivo experiments were performed in wild-type and P-Selectin- knock-out mice. A deficiency of either CD24 or P-Selectin expression lead to a significant reduction of experimental pulmonary metastases as shown in B16F10 melanoma mice. Thus CD24 expression on tumor cells results in an enhanced metastatic process, whereas a lack of P-Selectin expression on platelets and endothelial cells decreases the number of metastases. Conclusion: P- and E-Selectin are overexpressed in metastatic tumor cells from animal models. P-Selectin is relevant for tumor metastasis. Therefore, Selectins might play a key role in tumor angiogenesis, that will be further evaluated. P633 TAXOL INDUCED Universit~t M0nster (M~Jnster) Cell invasion is a prerequisite for tumor cell spreading. In previous experiments we have shown that secretion of MMPs is important for invasion of human melanoma cells into a MDCK-C7 cell monolayer. By using a highly sensitive gelatinase- based detection assay (detection limit: 3 ng) we could quantify the activity of secreted MMPs. Immunofluorescence technique was used to investigate the mechanisms of MMP exocytosis. Vesicular structures were identified in the cytoplasm of melanoma cells by staining with MMP2-specific anti-serum. Co- localization studies of MMP2 and the microtubule system (stained by a-tubulin specific anti-serum) showed MMP2 containing vesicles attached to microtubules. In fact, after destruction of the microtubule function by taxol we found an impaired secretion of in melanoma cells ( reduction: 18 \u00b1 3.2 %; n = 6). To investigate whether taxol-induced reduction of exocytosis is related to a decreased invasiveness of the melanoma cells into the MDCK-C7 monolayer we used our recently developed transepithelial electrical resistance (TEEn) breakdown assay. The addition of cancer cells to the apical surface of a high-resistant C7-monolayer led within 24 h to a significant TEER breakdown from 8.7 \u00b1 0.25 kOhm to 3.6 \u00b1 kOhm, cells (12h; 5.9 nM) to the C7-monolayer we found that TEEn breakdown was delayed within 24 h of co-culture (from 7.9 \u00b1 0.28 kOhm to 5.1 + 0.50 kOhm). We conclude that intracellular transport of MMP-containing vesicles depends on the microtubule system. Disruption or inhibition of this process diminishes MMP and attenuates invasion. P634 AND GUANYLYLCYCLASE C IN LYMPH NODE-, LIVER-, AND BONE MARROW SAMPLES OF COLORECTAL CANCER PATIENTS. N0rnberg) Recently, detection of epithelial cell markers has been used to estimate the occurrence of isolated tumor cells in patients with various types of cancer. This seems to be promising since isolated tumor cells are early indicators of an increased risk of overt metastasis and accordingly, patients tested positive could constitute a subgroup with an increased risk over those tested negative. Our approach was to detect two epithelial cell markers (cytokeratin 20 [CK20] and guanylylcyclase C [GCC]) in lymph node-, liver-, and bone marrow samples of colorectal cancer patients. Two of these tissues had been selected for their function as primary filters (lymph nodes and liver) and were compared with a frequently investigated organ (bone marrow) indicating a more general spread of the disease. Detection was performed by reverse transcription of total RNA extracted from the samples and subsequent nested PCR (60 cycles in total). The detection limit of both assays was one colon cancer cell (HDC8) spiked into 106 leukemia cells (An230) that had been found negative for both markers. The samples had been obtained from 247 (140 male and 107 female) patients undergoing elective surgery for colorectal cancer and did not show any sign of metastasis. The average age of patients was 66.8 years (SD: 10.7 years), and the distribution according to UICC was I (18.2%), II (37.7%), III (25.5%), and IV (18.6%). From a total of 262 lymph nodes investigated, 77.5% and 64.9% were positive for CK20 and GCC, respectively, with 85.9% positive in at least one marker. Also, from a total of 410 liver biopsies investigated, 34.6% and 63.4% were found positive for CK20 and GCC, with 69.5% positive in at least one marker. Finally, out of 109 bone marrow samples, positive results were obtained in 11.0% (CK20) and 6.4% (GCC), and 16.5% of all samples were positive for at least one marker. These results show that the highest percentage of tests positive for at least one epithelial marker was found in lymph nodes, followed by liver and bone marrow. Comparing the two markers, CK20 prevailed in lymph nodes and bone marrow, whereas GCC was detected more often in liver tissue. On a whole, the data is consistent with lymph nodes and liver acting as primary filters which show high incidences of possible tumor cells whereas bone marrow was affected significantly less often. S 126 Cancer Metastasis P635 HEPATIC DOPPLER PERFUSION INDEX (DPI) FOR DETECTION (LM) IN CANCER PATIENTS (CP) M. Karthaus, C. of liver metastasis (LM) remains a challenge. Ultrasound (US) is known to be a sensitive imaging tool, but small lesions (<5 ram) may remain undetectable for US. Previous studies have shown that subtle changes in liver perfueion may precede US detection of LM in colo-rectal cancer (CRC), but this has not been shown in other tumors. An increase in A. hepatica (AH) blood flow (BF) and thus a change in liver perfusion can be measured directly using DCDU. This prospective trial evaluated the sensitivity of DCDU for the detection of liver metastasis in CP with CRC and other cancer types. BF profiles were obtained from the main portal vein (VP) and AH. DPI, defined as ratio of AH to total liver blood flow, was calculated. Clinical records, biopsy results, CT- or MRI-scans were reviewed to confirm diagnosis of LM. From Feb 2001 to Nov 2001, a total of 107 consecutive CP (65 m/42 f) entered this prospective trial. Pts had CRC (n=34) and other solid tumors (n=73), with overt LM in 30 pts (12 CRC/18 other tumors). Results: In LM, a 3-fold increase in AH blood flow was observed (0.42 I/min LM vs 0.23 I/min CP DPI was 0.27 in LM(SD 0.17) vs 0.16 CP(SD 0.1) vs 0.1 HC(SD 0.06). In pts with LM, we observed in only 1 out of 28 a DPI of <0.1 and AH BF of < 0.2 I/min (3.6%), suggesting this perfusion change in hepatic BF sensitive for LM. There was no difference in DPI between CRC and other tumor pts with LM (0.27 vs 0.27). Furthermore, DPI did not differ between CRC and other cancer lots without LM (0.17 vs 0.16). Conclusion: Our results suggest that DODU measurement of the DPI and AH may give helpful further information for detection of LM in CP that may be useful for CRC as other tumor pts. P636 INTRAMEDULLARY STABILIZING OF PATHOLOGICAL FRACTURES IN PATIENTS WITH METASTASES OF THE LONG BONES J. Bischoff, S. Piatek, pathological fractures has to provide immediate stability, which allows full weight- bearing conditions and early mobilisation of the patient. The aim of our surgical treatment is to improve the individual patients quality of life with a minimum of complications, delay and morbidity. Patients and methods: From january 1st, 1995 to august 31st, 2001 we treated 38 patients (mean age 63 years) with 37 apparent and 4 imminent pathological fractures of hypernephroma (n= 13), bronchial carcinoma (n= 7) and breast carcinoma (n= 6). The intervall between the diagnosis of the primary tumor and the first pathological fracture varied from 1- 105 month. One patient with a solitary metastasis of the humerus was treated curatively by extralesional resection. 37 patients showed disseminated metastatic disease. In the palliative management following surgical methods were performed: hip- endoprosthesis (n= of (n= 1). Two patients were not operable. Results: Therewere no intraoperative complications. Postoperative complications were observed in 5 cases: wound infection (n= 1), loosening of locking screw (n= 1), progressive osteolysis (n= 1), radial palsy (n= 1) and migration of the locking nail (n= 2). 63% of the patients with metastases of the lower limb reached walking ability until discharge. 28 patients already died, median survival time was 53 days (5- 525 days). Conclusion: Interlocking intramedullary nailing of pathological fractures provides immediate stability and can be accomplished with a close technique, minimum morbidity an early return of function and Ioadability of the extremity involved. P637 IMPROVEMENT OF THE RAT LIVER METASTASIS MODEL USING CC531-LACZ CELLS: GENERATION OF A Leible, Seelig, carcinomas form metastasis in the liver; their occurrence is correlated with a low survival rate due to a lack of effective treatment strategies. In order to contribute to a solution of this problem, we have been using a transplantable isogenic rat model based on a cell line (CC531) that grows in the liver after injection of 4x10E6 cells into the superior mesenteric vein of male WAG/ Rij rats. Since a B-galactosidase gene has been introduced as marker into these cells, their detection and quantification has become possible even in diffusely infiltrated livers (A.Wittmer et al, Clin Exp Met 17: 369, 1999). In the course of working with this model we noticed that the tumor take rate was not sufficient and that the tumor cell number did not correlate with the metabolic conversion of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) in vitro. It was the aim of this study, therefore, to generate a subclone with improved growth properties in vitro as well as in vivo. To that purpose a solid metastasis was excised from a CC531-1acZ-induced liver and was established in medium containing antibiotics. This subclone showed nuclear expression of the lacZ- gene, as verified by using X-Gal for staining. Differences in the proliferation rate of both cell-lines were analysed in vitro using the M'i-r-assay as well as cell counts in a Neubauer-chamber. Additionally, in vivo examinations were conducted and differences in take rate and macroscopic tumor morphology were documented. In the MTT-assay, CC531-1acZ cells did not show a linear correlation with cell counts since a growing percentage of cells did not metabolise the M'IT dye after a period of more than 48h. In contrast, the subclone, although growing more slowly, showed uniform MTT dye metabolism and a linear correlation with cell counts. In vivo, the subclone grew more diffusely infiltrating than in the form of solitary metastases. Additionally, the take rate of the new clone was higher (>92%) and the affected rats showed a reduced survival time. In summary, the new cell line is more advantageous using the MTT dye reduction assay for cell growth determination in vitro and more effective in causing diffuse liver infiltration. P638 CYTOKERATIN-20 RT-PCR AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY IN PN0 LYMPH NODES OF RESECTED COLORECTAL CARCINOMA R. Rosenberg, Nekarda, M0nchen disease can be detected in histopathological tumor- free (pN0) lymph nodes by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or by the more sensitive RT-PCR. The correlation of IHC with RT-PCR might solve the problem of ,false- positive\" RT-PCR results that do not correlate with prognosis and lead to overinterpretation. Methods: The study group consisted of 85 patients with a colorectal carcinoma UICC stage 1/11, which were curatively resected (R0) at our department between 1988 and 1995, with a median follow-up time of 86 months. From each patient, 2 fresh frozen peritumoral lymph nodes, which were located nearest to the tumor site, were evaluated by CK-20 RT-PCR and IHC using a CK-20 monoclonal antibody. The detection of CK-20 correlated with histopathological parameters and prognosis. Results: CK-20 mRNA was expressed in the lymph nodes of 44 patients (52 %). Fifteen of the 18 patients, which developed tumor recurrence, expressed CK-20. Sensitivity of the RT-PCR was 83% with a specificity of 57%. IHC detected 0K- 20 positive cells in the lymph nodes of 24 patients (28%). Tumor cell contaminated lymph nodes were found in 23 patients (34%), which had extranodally located positive CK-20 IHC with no prognostic impact. The combined evaluation of RT- PCR and IHC revealed that the RT-PCR expression of 13 patients were caused by isolated extranodal positive IHC. These patients were defined as RT-PCR negative and the findings improved the specificity of the RT-PCR to 75%. The 5-year overall survival of 31 patients with positive lHC-controlled CK-20 RT-PCR (36 %) was 73 % compared to 96 % in the 54 Patienten with negative IHC-controlled CK- 20 RT-PCR (64 %) Conclusions: The combination of iHC and RT-PCR is a sensitive method for the detection of cytokeratin-positive cells and was proven to be of prognostic relevance. Confirmation of the presented data in further studies may lead to a subgroup identification of patients with colorectal carcinoma UICC stage 1/11, which may profit from adjuvant therapy. P639 THE PATTERN OF EXPRESSION OF THE MICROTUBULE-BINDING PROTEIN RHAMM IN ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA: RELEVANCE WITH TUMOR its binding protein RHAMM (receptor for HA-mediated motility) have been proposed to be important in promoting tumor progression and dissemination. However, a comparative study of their expression patterns in endometrial carcinoma is not available. Methods: We examined a series of 89 endometrial carcinomas by immunohistochemistry, using a RHAMM-specific polyclonal antibody. Expression of RHAMM was assessed according to the pattern and intensity within (overall cytoplasm, tumor mass edge, single tumor cells in the stroma) and between the tumors. The staining results were compared to clinical data, histological grading and lymph node status. Results: Low differentiated tumors (n=13) showed significantly increased expression of RHAMM at the tumor mass edge (p< 0,01), but no increased expression in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, lymph node metastasis was significantly correlated to increased expression at the tumor mass edge (p< 0,01) and of single tumor cells present in the stroma. Conclusion: Our results suggest that RHAMM expression may enhance and improve the invasion and metastasis of endometrial carcinomas. P640 DIAGNOSTIC CT OF THE BRAIN IS INDICATED IN PATIENTS WITH RT OF CHOROIDAL METASTASIS TO TREAT SUBCLINICAL BRAIN METASTASES AND CHOROIDAL METASTASES IN ONE TARGET VOLUME - RESULTS OF A PRO- SPECTIVE STUDY OF THE GERMAN CANCER SOCIETY K.M. Benjamin Franklin (Berlin) Objective: There is no evidence in the literature about the incidence of synchronous brain metastases in patients with choroidal metastases. This is of major importance, because the RT-fields of the treatment of choroidal metastases and, S 127 Cancer Metastasis / New Diagnosis and Modalities in Cancer Therapy later on, treated brain metastases are partly overlapping, thus increasing the rate of late side effects as brain necrosis. The goal of our study was to determine the frequency of synchronous brain metastases in relation to the costs of a CCT. Methods: Between 1995 and 1998, 50 patients with choroidal metastases were enrolled into a study with standardized 40 Gy radiotherapy with 2 Gy single dose. All patients were staged before treatment with a computed tomography of the brain (CCT). No patients had clinical signs of brain metastases. Results: 13 out of 50 patients (26%) had brain metastases in the CCT leading to radiotherapy of the brain and the choroidal metastases in one target volume. In detail, 7/31 (23%) patients with breast cancer, 4/13 (31%) patients with lung cancer and 2/6 (33%) patients with other tumors had evidence of brain metastases in the CCT. Conclusions: A cranial computed tomography is indicated at the diagnosis of choroidal metastases for screening of synchronous brain metastases. The incidence is about 25% and the diagnosis of brain metastases results in a different target volume: the whole brain including the posterior parts of the eyes compared to the posterior parts of the eyes alone. Therefore the risk of late side effects can be reduced compared with an additional later RT of the whole brain. P641 HEPATIC RESECTION FOR METASTATIC SOFT (Heidelberg) Background: Liver resection provides a chance for long-term survival in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. The role of hepatic resection in the treatment of metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is unclear. Patients and Methods: All patients admitted between 05/1986-11/2001 for surgical treatment of STS were prospectively documented. Postoperatively patients were followed up at regular intervals. Survival was determined by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Results: A total of 30 patients with hepatic metastases originating from STS were documented. Primary sarcoma was originated intraabdominally (n=16), in the retroperitoneum (n=5) and in the extremities (n=3). Eight of 30 tumors were of myogenic origin. Thirteen patients underwent complete resection (R0). One patients had infiltrated margins (R1) and in 16 patients only biopsy was performed (R2). Postoperative morbidity was 10 percent. No patient died postoperatively. Median survival was 23 (7-158) months following R0 resection and 6 months after R2 resection. Overall 5 year survival was 33% for curatively treated patients (R0). Only one of the palliatively treated patients survived for more than one year. Conclusion: Since effective systemic treatment is not available hepatic resection should be considered in all patients with soft tissue sarcoma r'netastatic to the liver. If curative resection is possible 5 year survival of 33% can be expected. P642 PROOF OF MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE IN MURINE TUMOR MODELS B. Illert, M Koospal, A. Thiede, W. Universit~tsklinik (W~rzburg) Objective: Proof of minimal residual disease (MRD) in malignant disease is discussed as a reason for relapse of cancer even after curative resection. The detection of disseminated tumor cells in blood and bone marrow is an indicator for MRD and seems to have prognostic relevance. For study of different cancer therapies and their effectiveness an animal model for MRD would be suitable. Methods: Human gastric tumor specimen -originated from a tumor cell line- were xenotransplanted in Balb-c nu/nu mice. Two groups with five animal each were transplanted. In group 1 tumor specimen were implanted subcutaneously in both posterior axillary lines, in group 2 tumor specimen were implanted in surgical orthotopic position on the anterior stomach wall. Animals were sacrificed after tumor growth of >lcm diameter or reduction of general state of condition or cachexia. A nested reverse- transcriptase PCR for human cytokeratin 20 of blood and bone marrow of mice was performed for detection of disseminated tumor cells. Results: The take rate of tumor specimen was 100% in both groups after at least 12 weeks. Animals in group 1 had no sign of reduction of general state of condition whereas animals from group 2 developed severe cachexia in consequence of infiltrating and metastatic tumor growth. In both groups signals for human cytokeratin where detected as well in blood as in bone marrow. Conclusions: With both types of xenotransplantation (subcutaneously or orthotopic) dissemination of tumor ceils in blood and bone marrow was provable. These models will further be used for study of tumor growth, anti-cancer therapies and the effectiveness of those therapies on MRD. P643 PROGNOSTIC FACTORS FOR IDENTIFICATION OF AXILLARY LYMPH NODE METASTASES IN WOMEN WITH T1 BREAST CANCER J. Tic, A. A. Bader, M. B(~hner, H. Volkholz, A. Introduction: The lymph node status is still the most important prognostic factor for recurrence and survival in women with invasive breast cancer (IBC), but recently almost 60% of the patients fit IBC have negative axillary lymph nodes. The primary aim of this study was to identify a subgroup of patients with a low risk of positive axillary nodes by predictive modeling of primary tumor characteristics. The secondary aim was to find a subgroup in which the axillary lymph node dissection can be omitted. Patients and Methods: A retrospective analyses of 429 patients with primary IBC who underwent complete axillary lymph node dissection between April 1994 and October 2001 was performed. The involvement of lymph nodes were correlated with clinical and pathological factors including age of the patient, tumor size, tumor localization, grading, histology, lymph vascular invasion, estrogen- and progesterone receptor status, DNA Index, S phase fraction, Ki-67, EGFR, p53, HER-2/neu, uPA, PAl-l, invasion and Ki-67 be identified as independent prognostic indicators of axillary lymph node metastases. T1 IBC patients with the combination of all unfavorable factors (high-risk-group) had a positive axillary lymph node status in 78,3%. In women with favorable predictive factors (low-risk- group) only 5,3% axillary lymph node metastases were found. Patients with 1-3 unfavorable factors (intermediate-risk-group) had an axillary lymph node metastases rate of 20,2% to 42,0%. Conclusion: tumor size, grading, lymph vascular invasion, Ki-67 as prognostic factors, it is possible to predict axillary lymph node involvement. Patients with all 4 favorable factors show a very low risk of positive axillary lymph node status. An axillary lymph node dissection could be omitted in this subgroup. In patients of the intermediate risk group a sentinel lymph node biopsy appears adequate. Women with all unfavorable factors should undergo a conventional axillary lymph node dissection. A multicenter prospective study in Germany is now prepared to evaluate this concept using core biopsy of the IBC to identify the risk factors. Publication only P'644 INITIAL METASTASIS OF THE CAPITATE DERIVED FROM A CLEAR CELL SAR- COMA B. rare tumor, closely related to tendons or aponeuroses. Phenotypically it shares features of the cutaneous malignant melanoma, which has led to the term ,,melanoma of the soft parts\". Women are affected more frequent than men, patients usually are between 20 and 40 years of age. Typical Iocalizatione are the extremities, especially feet and ankle. Because of its high malignancy amputation can be justified. Among all tumor metastases only 0,1 per cent are found in the hand skeleton, primaries being pulmonary, breast or renal tumors. We present the case of a 29-year-old man who had developed a clear-cell- sarcoma in his right foot. Under curative intention a below-knee-amputation was performed, because there was no evidence of distant metastases. Three months later the patient, being mobilized on a prosthesis, fell on his right hand and sustained a fracture of the capitate. Biopsy revealed a metastasis of the clear cell sarcoma within the capitate bone. The tumor was widely resected and the wrist reconstructed using a corticocancellous bone graft. This is the first report of an initial carpal metastasis derived from a soft tissue sarcoma. New Dia~lnosis and Modalities in Cancer Therapy Oral Presentation 0645 A TISSUE ENGINEERING APPROACH TO RADIATION THERAPY INDUCED XEROSTOMIA IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER M. B~cheler, F. Bootz, Universit~t Leipzig (Leipzig) Most head and neck cancer patients are treated with combined therapy of surgery and radiotherapy. Although modern techniques using multiple radiation ports and fractionation have increased the safety of radiotherapy, complications occur however. Xerostomia is one of the most devasting side effeccts due to exposure of the salivary glands to the radiation field. Presently there is no satisfactory treatment for this condition. New treatment options based on the principles of tissue engineering are currently developed by our group. Human parotid cells were cultured with 2 different types of microcarriers up to 3 weeks in vitro to obtain injectable organoids. In a second experiment parotid gland tissue specimen were incubated between two slices of collagen type I foil. Cultures were controlled daily by inverted microscopy. Medium samples were tested for alpha-amylase, tissue polypeptide (-FPA) and $100 to control parotid cell function in vitro. All cultured cells or tissue construct were investigated by immunohistochemistry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Parotid gland cells could be cultured in a differentiated and vital state on both types of microcarriers for up to three weeks. Almost all of the cultured cells exhibited immunoreactivity for cytokeratin. High concentrations of TPA as a specific marker for salivary duct epithelium indicated persistent differentiation of this cell type in vitro. Positivity for amylase was detectable in 20 to 45 % of the cells growing on the microcarriers. Decreasing amylase levels in the culture medium indicated functional deficiencies of the remaining acinar cells. In the tissue cultures formations of outgrowing cells between the collagen foil layers were visible after 10 days. SEM analysis showed round-shaped cells firmly attached to the collagen. Expression of cytokeratin was found in the parotid explant and the outgrowing cells. Staining for MIB-1 was positive and amylase expression could be detected in the parotid explant. Human parotid tissue cultured on collagen foil maintains its epithelial differentiation for up to six weeks. Although S 128 New Diagnosis and Modalities in Cancer Therapy functional acinar cells could be detected in the in the tissue explant and outgrowing cells showed epithelial phenotype the described methods are not sufficient to obtain enough saliva producing tissue in vitro. Further studies are needed to identify other strategies for cell based therapy of radiation induced xerostomia in head and neck cancer patients. 0646 VIDEO CAPSULE ENDOSCOPY (M2A) VERSUS PUSH-ENTEROSCOPY FOR THE DETECTION OF SMALL BOWEL POLYPS IN PATIENTS WITH PEUTZ- JEGHERS-SYNDROME syndromes (FAP, PJS) require surve[llance of small bowel polyps that consists of repeated invasive examination procedures such as push-enteroscopy, x-ray exposure (enteroclysis), or intraoperative endoscopy. We hypothesized that miniature video capsule enteroscopy (M2A) may replace more invasive methods for small bowel surveillance in polyposis syndromes. Methods: From July to November 2001, we prospectively examined 16 patients with hereditary polyposis syndromes (14 FAP, 2 PJS) by video capsule endoscopy (M2A) of the small bowel. Results were compared with upper GI (push) enteroscopy (n=13) and the combination of push-enteroscopy and small bowel X-ray (n=l). 2 Patients had no conventional endoscopy. 13 patients (81%) had had prior abdominal surgery (ileopouch anal anastomosis n=9, others n=4). Severity of polyposis was assessed using the Spigelman classification regarding size and number of polyps. Results: No relevant complications were observed. In one symptomatic patient with PJS capsule endoscopy detected a 2 cm measuring hamartomatous polyp which was not seen during push enteroscopy. This lesion was confirmed and removed surgically. Another asymptomatic patient with PJS developed 2 new polyps in the duodenum and stomach (0.7 and 3.5 cm in size) one year after extensive operative removal of numerous small bowel polyps. These new polyps could be confirmed endoscopically and were removed within the same session. In 10 patients with FAP, several small bowel adenomas were detected by capsule endoscopy. In 2 FAP patients, isolated adenomatous polyps of the stomach were seen. All lesions were confirmed by push-enteroscopy with biopsy or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). The small bowel polyps of 6 patients could not be reached by conventional gastroscopy. The Spigelman- Scores measured by capsule and push enteroscopy correlated well. Conclusion: Polyps detected by small bowel capsule endoscopy correlate well with conventional enteroscopy and biopsy, suggesting that this method allows a reliable screening of the small bowel in FAP and PJS. Capsule endoscopy is a safe and non-invasive method for surveillance and follow-up of small bowel polyps in patients with hereditary polyposis syndromes. 0647 \"MAGNETIC DRUG TARGETING\" - A - BIOKINETIC STUDY OF FERROFLUID BOUND MITOXANTRONE Alexiou, P. Hulin, Schmid, W. Arnold, Klinikum rechts der Isar (M0nchen) In previous studies we have shown that ,,Magnetic Drug Targeting\" is an effective treatment modality of VX2 squamous cell carcinoma in rabbits with reduced chemotherapeutic doses and without negative side effects [1]. Biocompatible ferrofiuids (if) are magnetic nanoparticles, that can be used as a delivery systemfor anticancer agents in Iocoregional tumor therapy, called ,,Magnetic Drug Targeting\" by using an external magnetic field (1,7 Tesla) focused on the area of the tumor. The enrichment of ferrofluids in tumor tissue focused by the external magnetic field was documented in vivo by histological analysis and MRI investigations. Biodistribution was studied by the use of Jod123 labeled nanoparticles and quantitative analyses were done using radioactive Fe59-ferrofluid for detection of the nanoparticles. With HPLC-analyses we studied the amount of mitoxantrone delivered in the tumor. Histological cross sections of the tumor and MRI investigations showed a high concentration of ff in the tumor tissue. The scintigraphically detected Jod123- signal has been shown to be significantly higher in the magnetically focused region compared to the application without magnetic field (figure 1). Figure 1: Enrichment of 1123-labeled nannoparticles in the area of interest (VX2- tumor) after ,,Magnetic Drug Targeting\". This image was taken 10 minutes after application, still showing stable concentration of ferrofluids in the tumor region. Fe59-ferrofluids could be concentrated in the tumor area 235 times more with external magnetic field compared to the ones without magnetic forces. HPLC investigations showed 120 times more chemotherapeutic agent mitoxantrone in the tumor with external magnetic field compared to the tumor bearing rabbits without magnetic field. Figure 2: Radioaktive Fe59-distribution 60 minutes after intraarteria] Fe59-ferrofluid- application ,,Magnetic Drug Targeting\" offers a unique opportunity to concentrate the respective antitumor agent in the tumor area. No negative side effects were seen in the respective animals. [1]Cancer Research 60, 6641-6648, 2000 (Alexiou et al. 2000) Supported by the Margarete Ammon Foundation, Munich / hlmer Dendritic cells (DC) are antigen-presenting cells playing a crucial role in the induction of specific T-cell immunity. The capacity of DC to generate protective immune responses and regression of established turnouts has been demon- strated in animal models and human malignancies including B cell lymphoma, melanoma, prostate and renal cell carcinoma. Based on these findings, we have initiated a phase I trial of patients with advanced gynaecological malignancies using with GM-CSF, IL-4, and TNFa and for delivery of TH- and CTL-epitopes pulsed with endotoxin-free KLH and tumour antigens. DC assess immunocompetence to recall antigens, as well as vaccine- mediated, antigen-specific immunity. Priming of T-cell immunity to KLH or turnout antigens was analysed in vitro by measuring the proliferative capacity of PBMC upon antigen stimulation. Type and clonal size of vaccination-induced effector response was determined by analyzing secretion of IFN-g at single-cell level in ELISPOT. 2 patients with advanced uterine sarcoma and 6 with ovarian carcinoma received 3 to 23 intracutaneous injections of antigen-pulsed DC at 10-day or 4- week intervals. 3 patients showed stable disease lasting 25 to 68 weeks, 5 had tumour progression within the first 14 weeks. KLH- and tumour antigens-specific DTH reactions were observed in 6 and 1 patient, respectively. Lymphoproliferative responses to KLH stimulation were recorded in 6 patients and to turnout lysate in 2. Tumour antigen-directed IFN-g secretion by PBMC of 1 patient with ovarian carcinoma showing disease stabilization for 16 months was consistent with a TH type 1 cytokine bias. Treatment was safe, well tolerated, immunologically and clinically active and except for local cutaneous hypersensitivity devoid of adverse effects. Our results show that patients with advanced gynaecologic malignancies can be effectively vaccinated with DC pulsed with KLH and tumour-derived antigens. The lack of adverse side-effects renders vaccination advisable at earlier disease stages when tumour burden is lower and patients have received less potentially immunosuppressive treatment. 0649 FIRST CLINICAL RESULTS FROM AN INTERDICIPLINARY, DALLY TUMOR BOARD ORGANIZED BY INTRANET TECHNIQUES interdisciplinary approach to cancer therapy is usually organized by weekly tumor board (TB) meetings within a hospital. The number of patients involved, the flexibility of the tumor board and the quality of the meetings is limited by conventional organisation (written invitations) and the lack of documentation and standardization of treatment regimes. The aim of this study was to create a truly interdisciplinary TB to be held on a daily basis, i.e. every morning, with maximum know how provided by the directors of the departments involved and improved documentation of treatment decisions. Materials and Methods: An intranet web site (Oncofile) was developed and established within an university hospital setting. Patients can be interactively S 129 New Diagnosis and Modalities in Cancer TherapY scheduled for a TB session. Written invitations have been eliminated. During the session all patient data are accumulated in digital form. The decisions of the TB are documented online and available for subsequent treatment immediately after the conference for future reference. Results: From 10/1999 until 11/2001, a total of 2218 patients were discussed and documented in daily TB sessions. Of these, 415 suffered from esophageal cancer (18.7%), 134 from cancers of the esophagogastric junction (6 % ), 297 from gastric cancer (13.4 %), 165 from pancreatic cancer (7 %), 28 from hepatocellular carcinoma ( 1,3 %) , 28 from bile duct cancer ( 2 %) 270 from colon cancer (12.2 %), 233 from rectal cancer (10.5 %) and 153 from lung cancer (6.9%). Overall treatment concept was curative in 73 % and paliative in 27 %. In 24 % of the cases neoadjuvant treatment concepts were initiated, and 52% of the cases were assigned to primary resection. 14 disease management teams defined our local treatment guidelines, which are also available over the internet (www.cancercenter.de). The study protocol database contains a total of 71 protocols. Daily practice has shown that within the 30 minute TB session time not mor than 6-7 patients can be sufficiantly discussed. Conclusion: The organisation of a daily tumorboard open to all departments is feasable. To achieve this, the online registration of patients as well as documentation of tumor board decisions is mandatory. Although the number of cases with primary resections is still high, a relevant proportion of patients can be scheduled for neoadjuvant treatment regimes. (This study is supported by Deutsche Krebshilfe) Poster P650 HIGH RATE OF COMPLETE REMISSIONS OF SKIN AND SOFT TISSUE MELANOMA METASTASES FOLLOWING INTRA-/PERILESIONAL INJECTION OF INTERLEUKIN-2: A PILOT-STUDY IN STAGE Ill- MELANOMA Radny, Universit&t, Universit~tsklinikum Essen (T~Jbingen, Essen) Purpose A pilot study to validate the use of intra-/perilesional injection of interleukin-2 (IL- 2) in patients with skin and soft tissue melanoma metastases. Patients and Methods 24 patients (13 females and 11 males, aged 20-83 years) with AJCC stage III or IV melanoma and single or multiple skin and soft tissue metastases were included in this study. All patients had received previous therapy for melanoma metastases, including surgery, limb-perfusion, systemic chemo-/immunotherapy, and radiotherapy. were given intra-/perilesionally, 2-3 times weekly, over 1-12 weeks. Single doses varied from approximately 0.6-9 x 106 IU, depending on lesion size. The clinical response was monitored by sonography and confirmed by histopathology. Results Complete response of all treated metastases was achieved in 14 patients, the longest remission lasting 31 months to date. In 2 patients was partial response, in 2 patients stable disease and in 2 patients progressive disease achieved. 4 patients were not entirely assessable in all treated metastases. A total of 183 metastases were treated. In 151 of which complete response was attained (83 %), 19 showed partial response (10 %). Stable disease was seen in 3 metastases (2 %), 6 metastases showed progressive disease (3 %) and 4 metastases were not assessable (2 %). The therapy was generally well tolerated, observed adverse events were mainly of grade 1-2 severity. -Conclusions The complete response rate of 83 % and the limited toxicity suggest that treatment of skin and soft tissue melanoma metastases with intra - / perilesional injection of IL-2 may be a safe and effective alternative to established treatments. The optimal dosage and duration of this therapy still remain to be defined in larger prospective multicenter trials. P651 LIPOSOMAL (Mannheim) melanoma has a poor prognosis. Response rates to cytotoxic therapies are low, ranging around 15% using first-line therapy. The median survival time of non-responders is approximately 6 months. Currently, there is no established second-line treatment for advanced melanoma. In one of the largest second-line trials in advanced melanoma we evaluated the efficacy of liposomal doxorubicin (CaelyxR) in a clinical phase II trial in 30 patients (17m, 13f) with progressing metastatic melanoma for whom a previous chemotherapy had failed. Caelyx was given in an outpatient setting at 50mg/m2 at dl, d22, d43, and d64, subsequently at 40rag/m2 at d85 before first staging and in 4-week intervals thereafter with a total of 100 cycles given. The most severe toxicity reported was erythrodysesthesia in 6% at CRC grade 3. Liposomal doxorubicin was of limited clinical efficacy with 21 patients progressing in the first 12 weeks. However, 7 patients were treated 3 to 9 months and 9 patients were stable for > 90d achieving a SD and 1 CR. Median survival time was 214 days (95% CI: 151-304 d) with 7 patients surviving 300+ and 5 patients 400+ days. In conclusion, liposomal doxorubicin is a well tolerated regimen with a low toxicity profile but limited clinical efficacy which, however, is easily administered as outpatient therapy. Whether the survival benefits for a significant proportion of patients (20%) hold true and whether the efficacy of treatment with Caelyx can be improved by combination with other anticancer drugs without compromising the low toxicity profile can only be determined by further studies. P652 CHOLECYSTOKININ(CCK)-B/GASTRIN-RECEPTOR BINDING PEPTIDES FOR DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY OF (MTC), elevated calcitonin levels may indicate metastatic disease although all diagnostic modalities fail in its localization (occult disease). On the other hand, patients with advanced metastatic disease are left with few therapeutic options. We have developed radiopeptides with high affinity to the CCK-B receptor expressed on more than 95% of MTCs. The aim of this study was to investigate their role in the staging and therapy of MTC. Forty-five patients with metastatic MTC were investigated. All had undergone ultrasonography, whole-body CT and MRI, bone scanning and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. As a result, 23 suffered of known, 22 of occult disease. CCK-B receptor scintigraphy was performed with 5-7 mCi of In-ll I-labeled DTPA-D- Glul-minigastrin. Eight of these patients with advanced metastatic disease were injected with potentially therapeutic doses of a Y-90-1abeled derivative at 4-6- weekly intervals (30-50 mCi/sqm per injection for a maximum of 6 injections). The normal organ uptake was confined to the stomach as a result of CCK-B specific binding, and to the kidneys as excretory organs. All tumor manifestations known from conventional imaging were visualized as early as 1 h p.i., with increasing tumor-to-background ratios over time; at least one lesion was detected in 20/22 patients with occult disease (patient-based sensitivity 91%; 9 of them surgically confirmed, 11 remaining unconfirmed positive). Among them were local recurrences, lymph node, pulmonary, hepatic, splenic and bone metastases. Three patients treated with the Y-90 derivative at 30 mCi/sqm per injection did not show any signs of toxicity, whereas all 3 patients treated at 40 mCi/sqm developed transient hematologic toxicity. One of 2 patients treated at the 50 mCi/sqm level developed transient grade-4 thrombocytopenia and grade-1 nephrotoxicity. This patient experienced a partial remission, a second patient a good minor response, 4 stabilization of their previously rapidly progressing disease. These data suggest that CCK-B receptor ligands are a promising new class of receptor binding peptides for the staging and therapy of MTC. P653 ANTITUMORAL EFFECTS OF A VACCINATION WITH MODIFIED TUMOR CELLS INTO THE SPLEEN A. Dietrich, C. Stockmar, A. MLiller, M. Sch6nfelder, Universit~t Leipzig (Leipzig) Introduction: The prognosis of advanced malignant disease remains to be poor. There is a certain need for new therapies. Various tumor cell vaccinations are established by the time. Aim of the study was to investigate the effects of a vaccination into the spleen. Material and methods: Experiments were performed in C57/BL6 mice. B16 melanoma cells where injected intradermaly on the left abdominal wall. Tumors were removed after 7 days ( R1 or R2 resection ) and all animals except of the control group received a vaccination into the spleen or subcutaneous. Three different vaccines were used ( all based on the B16 melanoma): 1. miLl2 transfected tumor cells and sublethal irradiation of the cells 2. tumor cells transfected with the empty plasmid and sublethal irradiation 3. ( three times at -80\u00b0C ) frozen tumor ceils All surviving animals with no tumor recurrence underwent a second tumor implantation. Additional mice receiving intraspleenic vaccination were killed on day 2, 7 or 14 for immunological investigation of the spleen. Results: 1: Immunological changes of the spleen: Only animals receiving the IL12 modified vaccine showed significant differences on day 7 and 14. There was a higher rate of activated ( CD25 positive ) T-cells in the spleen and there was a better restimulation of the spleen cells with tumor cells. Only this mice developed an detectable antibody level against the melanoma. 2: The rate of tumor recurrence after the removal was lower in all groups receiving a vaccination compared to the control group. However, there was a wide variety in the primary tumor size and R-status of the resection. Differences between the various therapy groups remain questionable. Tumor-free survivors ( in all groups) underwent a second tumor implantation. There was a benefit for mice having received intraspleenic injection, 3 out of 9 stayed tumor free. Only 2 out of 14 survived following the usual subcutaneous injection. There was a longer survival for mice with intraspleenic vaccination in case of tumor recurrence. Also there was an antimetastatic effect with a lower rate of pulmonary and / or liver metastasis. Discussion: IL12 modified vaccinations into the spleen show promising data. However, further experiments in bigger groups and more standardised conditions ( R status of the tumor resection ) are necessary. S 130 New Diagnosis and Modalities in Cancer Therapy P654 THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY AND TOXICITY OF 1111N-DTPA-D-PHE- OCTREOTIDE IN PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS: PRELIMINARY RESULTS A DOSE-ESCALATION-STUDY M. L. M. Gotthardt, M. B~h~, J. Diedrich, M. U. Wied, SandmQIler, Schmidt, H. H~bffken, A. Schlieck, A. present, no systematic evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of 1111n-DTPA-D-Phe-Octreotide in neuroendocrine tumors exists. Our purpose was to assess the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of this compound in a dose-escalation-study. Methods: Cohorts of three Patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors were treated with equal doses of 1111n-DTPA-D-Phe-Octreotide every six weeks for six cycles. Doses increased by 20% between groups, starting at 3.7 GBq/m2. Routine labs were obtained weekly, whereas creatinine clearance was determined every six weeks. Nephrotoxicity > grade 1 or myelotoxicity > grade 3 according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria were considered dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Therapeutic efficacy was assessed by CT or MRI scanning. Results: To date, 10 Patients have been administered doses ranging from 3.7 to 6.4 GBq/m2 per cycle. One patient discontinued treatment after the first cycle due to rapid progression. No DLT has so far been observed. Grade 1-2 leukopenia occurred in 5 patients, and reversed spontaneously in 2. No patient developed nephrotoxicity. However, in 2 out of 4 patients with preexisting grade 1 creatinine elevation, values returned to normal limits. Preexisting grade 1 or 2 transaminase elevation returned to normal limits in 3 out of 5 cases. In this ongoing study, 12,5% of the patients who have so far been assessed for tumor response have shown partial remission (PR), whereas stable disease (SD) was found in 62,5% and progressive disease (PD) in 25%. Conclusion: We present the first systematic evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of 1111n-DTPA-D-Phe-Octreotide in a dose-escalation-study. To the present, no DLT has occurred and the maximum tolerated dose is not yet reached. At this early time in an ongoing study, 1111n-DTPA-D-Phe-Octreotide appears to be a very well tolerated treatment with a promising response rate in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. P655 TARGETING OF TUMOR STROMA BY A TNF BASED IMMUNOCYTOKINE C. Rennet, S. Bauer, B. Williamson, N. Fadle, L. Old, M. Pfreundschuh, Med. Klinik I, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Reserach (Homburg/Saar; New YOrk, New York, USA) Targeting the stromal tissue surrounding tumor cells is an attractive concept as it is not restricted to a single type of cancer. Many epithelial cancers induce the expression of the fibroblast activation protein (FAP) in the stroma. The FAP antigen itself can serve as target antigen for the specific detection of tumor tissue as demonstrated by biodistribution trials in patients with colon cancer. We aimed at designing a fusion protein consisting of a humanised anti-FAP antibody and human TNF replacing the conventional CH2/CH3 Fc-domain. This immunocytokine should target the tumor stroma and exert its TNF activity in proximity to the malignant cells by inducing apoptosis, inflammation and hemorrhagic necrosis. The immunocytokine was generated by recombinant DNA technology and ex- pressed in CHO cells in serum-free media under GMP conditions. Production was optimized to achieve antibody levels up to 15 rag/I. Immunoreactivity of the final construct was analyzed by cell binding and BIAcore analysis. Recognition of the FAP antigen was identical when compared to the parental anti-FAP antibody. TNF activity was determined using a variety of either TNF resistant or sensitive cell lines. Our immunocytokine revealed a 10-15 times lower activity than recombinant human TNE However, TNF dependent killing was observed down to the low pg/ml level with a LD50 activity between 1-10 ng/ml. Human granulocytes were acti- vated specifically by the immunocytokine to release super-peroxide in a dose and time dependent manner. The fully human immunocytokine should enable us to target tumor stroma and deliver TNF activity in a restricted manner. Clinical trials are warranted to evaluate its potential in cancer patients. P657 CHEMOSELECTIN PRIMARY CARCINOMA OF THE LUNG AND THE GASTRO- INTESTINAL TRACT - A CLINICAL STUDY (INTERIM ANALYSIS) F. Kischkel, C. Lersch, CelIControl AG, Klinikum Rechts der Isar (Martinsried, MiJnchen) The objective of this clinical study is to proof an innovative appraoch to chemosensitivity testing with respect to its predictive value in the selection of clinically effective cytostatic drugs to optimize the treatment of cancer. The chemosensitivity assay, which is used in this study, has its roots in pharmaceutical drug screening: ChemoSelect is a sensor-chip based diagnostic test, which permits the functional and continuous real-time measurement of induced tumor cell cytotoxicity following the administration of chemotherapeutic drugs. Chemosensitivity in tumor cells is measured through the reduction of the excretion of lactic and carbonic acids-by-products of the metabolic processes of glycolysis and respiration and a parameter for cell vitality. The applicability in the clinical setting was investigated in this clinical study which will finally recruit 200 patients. Included were patients with small cell lung cancer, non-small cell hung cancer, relapsed lung cancer, gastric carcinoma, colon carcinoma, and relapses of gastric and colon carcinoma. Patients were scheduled for chemotherapy and did not receive any chemotherapy within the previous four weeks and no therapeutic radiation within the previous six months. The Karnofsky Index was higher than 50% and tumor material had to be available for biobsy. Cytotoxic therapy was initiated independently of test results. Up to seven agents and/or combinations were tested and results were available within 24 hours. All available cytostatic substances can be tested. After follow-up period test results were compared with therapeutic efficacy. The analysis of interim results will be presented. P658 STEREOTACTIC IRRADIATION OF TUMORS IN THE LUNG AND LIVER: A NON-INVASIVE APPROACH WITH HIGH LOCAL CONTROL RATES J. Wulf, U. H~idinger, U. targets offers a non-invasive treatment modality for patients with localized tumors, which are not amenable for surgery or other invasive approaches because of age or impaired medical condi- tion. The purpose of the study was the evaluation of the method to achieve local control of irradiated targets in relation to treatment toxicity. Materials and Methods: Irradiation was performed as hypofractionated treatment in 3 factions of 10Gy, normalized to the PTV-enclosing 65%-isodose with patient fixation in a stereotactic body frame. The isocenter was localized by stereotactic coordinates. Targets were tumors in the lung (n=27) and liver (n=24) not amenable for other treatment modalities: primary lung cancer (n=12), local recurrences of lung cancer lung metastases metastases (n=23) and one cholangiocellular carcinoma. Median CTV/PTV for targets in the lung was 57/ 113cm 3 (min/max 5-277cm3/17-343cm 3) and for targets in the liver 50/102cm 3 (min/max 9-516cm3/42-772cm3). Median follow-up for targets in the lung was 8 month (2-33) and 9 month (2-28) for liver targets. Local control was defined as complete or partial remission and stable disease, measured by repeated CT- scans after 6 weeks and in 3 month intervals. Treatment could be performed on an outpatient base. Toxicity was evaluated according to the WHO-score. Results: Crude local control was 85% for pulmonary targets and 83% for hepatic targets. Actuarial local control after 1 and 2 years was 76% and 76% for lung tumors and 76% and 61% for liver tumors. Actuarial overall patient survival was 48% after 1 year and 21% after 2 years for targets in the lung and 71% and 43% for targets in the liver. No acute grade 3 -5 side effects were observed. Serious late toxicity occurred in 2 patients: a chronic ulceration of the esophagus at a target close to the mediastinum after 3 month (grade 3) and fatal bleeding from the pulmonary artery after 9 month (grade 5) in a previously irradiated patient. It remained unclear, whether the bleeding was a side effect of irradiation or due to tumor infiltration. Conclusion: Hypofractionated stereotactic irradiation of targets in the lung and liver is a locally effective treatment with actuarial local control rates of 76% after 1 year and 61-76% after 2 years without relevant acute toxicity. Severe late toxicity did not occur, if targets close to the mediastinum were avoided. P659 HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE FACTOR-I-ALPHA (HIF-1-ALPHA): A POTENTIAL QUANTITATIVE MOLECULAR MARKER OF TUMOR HYPOXlA D. Vordermark, M. Flenfje, J. M, Brown, J. M. Brown, Klinik f. Strahlentherapie, Uni Wuerzburg, Div. of Radiation Biology, Stanford Background: The transcription factor subunit hypoxiaqnducible factor-l-alpha (HIF-l-alpha) is a central regulator of the hypoxic response and has recently been shown to be an adverse prognostic factor in cervix, oropharynx, lung and brain tumors. HIF-l-alpha has been discussed as a potential intrinsic marker of tumor hypoxia. However, its detection on routine histopathological slides may be insuf- ficient for this purpose since HIF-l-alpha already accumulates at 02 concentra- tions irrelevant e. g. for radiation resistance. Materials and methods: U-87 MG human glioblastoma cells were exposed to 20%, 2%, 0.2% and <0.02% 02 in vitro for 1 h, 6 h or 18 h. Nuclear extracts were analyzed by HIF-l-alpha Western blot. In parallel, cell suspensions were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and prepared for flow cytometry using an monoclonal antibody and a rat-anti-mouse R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) conju- gated secondary, according to a new protocol. Thirdly, cells treated with hypoxia as above in the presence of the hypoxic marker pimonidazole (100 mM) were processed for pimonidazole detection by flow cytometry. Results: Western blots of U-87 MG nuclear extracts showed a constant increase in HIF-l-alpha protein expression with decreasing oxygen concentrations, regard- less of duration of hypoxic treatment. HIF-l-alpha flow cytometry results were closely correlated with these Western blots (r= 0.89) and the mean increase of fluorescence between aerobic and the most hypoxic cells was 18 -fold after 6 h of hypoxia. The respective mean dynamic range for pimonidazole flow cytometry was 16 -fold. Conclusion: Contrary to published data on other cell lines, HIF-l-alpha protein levels in U-87 MG glioblastoma cells are not maximum at intermediate oxygen concentrations but rather increase constantly with decreasing oxygen concentra- tions, an important prerequisite for a quantitative marker of hypoxia. Therefore, flow-cytometric analysis of HIF-l-alpha may provide a surrogate marker of oxy- genation in single tumor cells, which is supported by early in-vivo data from xenograft tumors. Establishment of a versatile, non-invasive molecular marker of hypoxia may aid in the selection of patients with hypoxic tumors for treatments such as hypoxic cytotoxins, hypoxia-mediated gene therapy or modification of tumor oxygenation. S 131 New Diagnosis and Modalities in Cancer Therapy P660 ELEVATED URIN LEVELS OF THE ANGIOGENIC GROWTH FACTOR BFGF IN PATIENTS WITH SOFT TISSUE SARCOMAS Growth Factor (bFGF) has been suggested to be important mediator for tumor induced angiogenesis. Elevated serum levels are detectable in patients with various types of solid tumors including soft tissue sarcomas. We measured urin levels of bFGF in patients and post surgery and tumorgrading. Methods: 10cc of urine and serum were collected from 24 patients undergoing radical resection of soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities preoperative, 24 hours and 1 week postoperative. Normal subjects served as controls (n=20). Samples were centifuged and stored at -700 Celsius. Levels of cytokines were measured with a monoclonal sandwich ELISA (R&D Systems@ USA). All samples were analyzed on a Dynatech@ plate reader. Results: Preoperative (17,8_+6,3pg/ml, p<0,05) urine levels were significantly elevated compared to postoperative levels (24 hours:6,1-+5,7pg/ml, p<0,05; 1 week:3,9_+2,4pg/ml,p<O,05). Concentrations of in serum were significantly lower (preoperative: 6,17_+5.7pg/ml, p<0,05) compared to in urine but significantly higher than in normal subjects (3,7_+2,Opg/ml, p<0,05). However there is no correlation to grading of tumors. Conclusions: There is a marked angiogenic potential in urine and serum of patients with soft tissue sarcomas.This study reveals that significant elevated levels of bFGF are detectable not only in serum but although in preoperative urine. The data suggest that monitoring of bFGF in urine might be a valuable marker for tumor follow-up. P661 CHEMOSELECT\u00ae: A NEW FUNCTIONAL DIAGNOSTIC PRIORCHEMOTHERAPY EC. Becker, CellOontrol Biomedical Laboratories AG, Thoraxklinik (Martinsried, Heidelberg-Rohrbach) The systematic treatment of tumors has been based on physicians empirical judgement, relying on data obtained from clinical trials. However the effective- ness of the current therapeutic approaches has reached their limitation. In view of this situation any method allowing the prediction of the therapeutic response of specific tumors on specific agents could mean a breakthrough for cancer treat- ment. ChemoSelect\u00ae is a diagnostic procedure to determine the chemosensitivity of vital tumor cells. The test uses innovative biosensor chip technology to achieve highly accurate results: A cell suspension is prepared from a freshly excised tumor specimen, and subject to a set of tests. Under the influence of cytostatic agents there will be changes in cellular metabolism, apparent in the cellular proton efflux rate, which are continuously measured over time and recorded by a microphysiometer. Cytostatics can be tested alone or in combination and results are available within 24 hours. ChemoSelect@ provides specific information on the effectiveness of chemotherapy for a given patient's tumor. It has a 24-hour turnaround, is applicable to all solid tumors, covers all cytostatic agents available, requires a minimum of 105 tumor cells only (no cell cultivation) and permits dynamic monitoring of cellular responses. Test results promise a breakthrough in cancer treatment: Optimal therapies can be developed and ineffective ones avoided, thus improving patients' quality of life. P662 RESPONSE RATE OF A NOVEL CHEMOTHERAPY(TPF) IN SCC OF THE UPPER AERODIGESTIVE TRACT R. Knecht, M. Baghi, Universit~tsklinik (Frankfurt) Standard induction chemotherapy of advanced head and neck cancer usually is carried out with Cisplatin (1O0mg/qm)and 5-Fluorouracil (5O00mg/qm), 2-3 cycles. Remission rates up to 80% were reported. We evaluated the response rate of a novel protocol which adds Docetaxel to the standard regimen. 35 patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (UICC stage Ill/IV) were submitted to chemotherapy with Docetaxel (75mg/qm/d1), Cisplatin (100mg/qm/dl) and 5 Fluorouracil (10O0mg/qm/dl-5), 3 cycles. Response rate was assessed by NMR and surgical biopsies after treatment based on the WHO guidelines. We observed a complete response (CR) in 26 of 35 patients. A partial response (PR) was seen in 6 patients. According to that the overall response rate is about 90%. Reversible neutropenia up to grade 4(WHO)was the most common toxicity. Based on this results the triple protocol (TPF) seems to be more effective as the standard protocol for induction chemotherapy of head and neck cancer. P663 STEREOTAXIC GUIDED EXCISIONAL BIOPSY (ABBI) - A METHOD FOR PLAN- NING THE FINAL THERAPY OF DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS). C.W. is the therapy of choice in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The objective of this study was (1) to evaluate efficacy and results with the stereotaxic guided excisional biopsy (ABBI) and (2) to compare this diagnostic procedure with the standard open excisional biopsy after wire Iocalisation and the Mammotome core biopsy. Materials and methods: 75 cases of grouped mammary microcalcifications (maximum diameter: 15 mm) detected by screening mammography and rated as suspicious for malignancy (BI-RADS scores IV and V) were selected for this pilot study. Stereotaxic guided excisional biopsy (ABBI) was performed under local anaesthesia in 52 patients. 18 patients underwent the standard open biopsy after preoperative wire Iocalisation. 5 patients underwent Mammotome core biopsies (vacuum-assisted devise). Results: In all 75 patients the grouped mammary microcalcifications were entirely removed regardless to the performed procedure. In 53 of 75 (71%) cases pathological examination showed a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Standardized histopathological evaluation of all resected specimens showed tumor free (< lcm) or close margins in all 53 patients with DCIS. As all specimens were marked adequately it was feasible to plan the margins of resection for breast-conserving therapy. The extent of the following resection was reduced leading to a good cosmetic and adequate operative result. Using the Mammotome core system we were not able to gain information about the margins, thus resulting in a more extensive resection in DCIS. Conclusions: Compared with the standard open biopsy stereotaxic guided excisional biopsy is an alternative to clarify mammographically detected suspicious microcalcifications. It can be performed a out-patient and only requires local anaesthesia. Under these conditions the ABBI system is a diagnostic modality, but not a therapeutic intervention. Cosmetic appearance was very acceptable to patients and no procedural complications have been noted yet. Standard histopathological examination of the resected specimen allows a more precise and tissue sparing approach (breast-conserving therapy) if DCIS is found.To compare the transversal en bloc resection with the ABBI system and the segmental oriented, but fragmented Mammotome core biopsy in the diagnosis of DCIS, a prospective randomized study has to be performed in the near future especially under operative - therapeutic aspects. P664 PROCALCITONIN IN THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ELEVATED CRP LEVELS IN TUMOR PATIENTS S. Schuettrumpf, L. Binder, T. Hagen]ann, L. Truemper, C. Binder, Universitaetsklinikum Goettingen (Goettingen) Increased plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) represent a common diagnostic problem in patients with hemato-oncological diseases. CRP is a sen- sitive marker for microbial infections, however, its discriminative power between inflammatory conditions of different origin is rather weak. In contrast, increased levels of procalcitonin (PCT), have been described predominantly in bacterial and fungal infections, but not in viral or localized infections. To investigate the value of PCT for the differential diagnosis of CRP-elevations, PCT was prospectively measured in 104 pts with increased CRP levels (>8mg/I) suffering from leukemias, lymphomas and various 43/104 (41.3%) or microbiologically documented infections, 38/104 (36.5%) had fever of unknown origin (FUO). In 17/104 pts with high tumor load and lacking signs of infection, CRP-elevations were suggestive of being tumor-related (TU group), in 9/104 with fever in temporal coincidence with drug administration of being drug-induced (DR group). Median CRP-levels in pts with infections and FUO (INF group) were 139,2mg/I (8,0-587,2), in TU pts 147,2 and in (0,0-0,5). no significant difference between CRP- concentrations in INF pts and TU pts. CRP-levels were significantly higher in INF pts than in DR pts (p<O.001). However, as CRP-levels were above the normal range in all three groups, the diagnostic power of individual CRP-values was limited. In contrast, PCT-concentrations were within the normal range (<=O.51Jg/I) in all cases, except one, of TU and DR pts, and were significantly lower than in INF pts (p<0.0Ol). There was no difference between neutropenic and non-neutropenic pts.ln conclusion, PCT may represent a promising parameter for the differential diagnosis of elevated CRP-levels. It may facilitate the decision on when to initiate antimicrobial or cytotoxic therapy. Further studies are needed to confirm these data and to show whether PCT might help to avoid unnecessary and potentially toxic antibiotic treatment. P665 EXAMINATION OF TUMOUR CELLS IN EXSUDATE SAMPLES FROM PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER AND OVARIAN CANCER. COMPARISON OF HER2/ NEU STATUS AND PROTEIN EXPRESSION BY SIMULTANEOUSLY PERFORMED IF AND FISH, B. Schl0ter, R.E. HER2/ neu oncogene. This amplification is associated with poor prognosis and a shortened overall survival. Recent studies have confirmed the efficacy of Herceptin as adjuvant therapy for those patients. The objective of our investigation is the comparison of erb B2 protein expression and HER2/neu amplification and ploidy status of chromosome 17 in pleura and ascites exsudates from patients with known mamma or ovarian carcinomas. Methods: We established a method for simultaneous detection of erb B2 protein S 132 New Diagnosis and Modalities in Cancer Therapy by immunofluorescence (IF) and HER2/neu gene amplification and ploidy by FISH. We used different cell lines that had been characterized by IHC methods (APAAP) previously. Cytospin preparations of cells were stained with an erb B2 antibody followed by FISH. Erb B2 positive cells (score 2+ and 3+) were selected for enumerating HER2/neu FISH signals. At the same time the rate of ploidy of chromosome 17 was determined. Tumour cells that did not overexpress erb B2 protein were stained with an anti CK18 antibody. CK positive cells were then selected for FISH detection.The same method was transferred to exsudate specimen. Results: Different mamma carcinoma cell lines scoring from 1+ to 3+ in erb B2 expression in IHC were stained by IF and examined by FISH. These cell lines show a good correlation between protein expression and HER2/neu gene amplification. This means high score protein expression correlates to a high level of amplification. In some cases we found cells without erb B2 protein staining showing HER2/neu gene amplification. 50 exsudate samples were tested as described above. Most of them include cells with aneuploidy of chromosome 17, but only a few contain cells with HER2/neu gene amplification. Tumour cells from a single preparation often show heterogeneous characteristics with respect to protein expression, gene amplification and the degree of ploidy. Conclusion: We established a method for simultaneous detection of erb B2 protein expression and HER2/neu gene amplification on defined cell lines and exsudate samples. First data indicate that only a small percentage of tumour cells reveal Her2/neu gene amplification. In most samples we could not detect any correlation between gene amplification and protein expression. P666 DOES PREOPERATIVE RADIOCHEMOTHERAPY INFLUENCE NUMBER OF LYMPH NODES IN CANCER? J. Markwardt, A. Bembenek, T. CharitG Campus Berlin Buch (Berlin) Introduction Randomised trials in rectal cancer comparing surgery with or without preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT) have shown that the number of lymph node metastases are influenced by preoperative RCT. The total number of lymph nodes seem to have been reduced, but this could also be due to different sampling techniques. Aim of this study was to evaluate the feasabilRy of radiocolloid lympahtic mapping pre- and posttherapeutical after preoperative RCT. Method A total of 28 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer endosonographically staged as uT3/uT4 underwent preoperative RCT. Lymph node involvement was endosonographically diagnosed in 20 patients (71%). Before and after RCT (before surgery) lml Tc99m-colloidal albumine (Nanocoll\u00a9) with a total activity of 100 MBq was injected endoscopically into the submucosal space adjacent to the tumor. The residual activity in the regional lymph nodes was recorded with a radiocolloid- scintigraphy after 1 hour and 17 hours. Additionally the abdominal cavity was scanned with a movable probe intraoperatively after removal of the specimen. The identification of nuclide enriched lymph node(s) (HENs) was counted before and after RCT and the results were compared. Results Before RCT the mean number of detected lymphe nodes was 4,4 + 3,2 HENs, none in 6 patients. Posttherapeutically the mean number of HENs was 5,3 + 3,2 HENs without detection of HENs in 3 patients. Pre- and posttherapeutic comparison demonstrated an increase in total number of HENs in 16 patients (57%) and a decrease in 12 patients (43%); this is a mean increase of 2,9 + 2,5 HENs and a mean decrease of 2,0 + 1,9 HENs. Patients with increased total number of HENs responded signifficantly more frequent to preoperative RCT then patients with extraregional HENs in the interaorto-caval space were detected during the surgical intervention in two patients and revealed a metastatic turnout deposit upstaging these patients to pM1. Conclusion Radlocolloid lymphatic mapping in locally advanced rectal cancer revealed nuclide enriched lymph nodes pre- and posttherapeutical after preoperative RCT. Responders to preoperative RCT showed an increase in total number of HENs. This could be a sign of an active cancer defense system. PADRE ex vivo present a target-specific approach. Recently, we characterized a new MAGE-l-epitope by combining epitope prediction with HPLC mass spectrometry. By using it together with a cocktail of synthetic HLA-A*0201- restricted epitopes related to CEA, SSX-2, NY-ESO-1, MUC-1 and Her2/neu it should be possible to induce polyclonal T-cell response and to prevent antigen- loss variants.We plan to correlate the vaccine-induced immune response with the clinical response evaluating peptide-specific T-cells with a combination of molecular and cellular immunodiagnostic tests (ELISpot, qRT-PCR, Tetramer) of which we recommend at least two for monitoring, qRT-PCR (sensitivity ca. 1/100.000 cells) and ELISpot-assay (sensitivity ca. 1/250.000) were used to define the function of T-cells by their cytokine-profile. Although qRT-PCR is more sensitive and a good screening-test which needs only small blood samples it considers only the transcriptional regulation. Tetramer-staining (sensitivity ca. 1/1000) is independend of T-cell function and measures also anergic cells. In a pilot study Her2/neu-specific T-cells could be detected in the blood of non- vaccinated breast cancer patients (Her2/neu+ Dako-score) by monitoring antigen- dependend IFNg-mRNA increase, protein release and tetramer-staining after one week of in vitro peptide pre-sensitization. Moreover, several patients tested showed reactivity against MUC-I-, SSX-2- and Her2/neu- epitopes. Our data indicate that cellular vaccination can be based on the stimulation of tumorantigen-specific T cells precursors in cancer patients. Moreover, qRT-PCR can be used to perform an ,,immunological staging\" of cancer patients. P668 IDENTIFICATION AND VALIDATION OF PROGNOSTIC FACTORS IN NON- SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER (NSCLC) THROUGH A KNOWLEDGE BASE ASSESSMENT. B.W. Faderl, F.G.E. Oncology World prognostic factors in NSCLC patients are stage, nodal status, tumor size, and performance status. However, new molecular factors are emerging and their relevance for the tumor biology might have a high significance on the fate of the patients. We therefore reviewed the relevance and impact of this factors in context to clinical significance. Methods: New knowledge discovery processes allow to transform masses of data into useful knowledge. The combination of experts and modern information technology (Data Warehouse) enables to evaluate these data by standardized evidence based principles. We selected molecular markers investigated in studies with at least 100 patients, that have been published in peer-reviewed journals, and show no major conflicting results. Results: A total of 59 publications have been chosen and reviewed. Six major groups of molecular prognostic factors were identified. The table shows the most promising and best evaluated factors detected through the process described above. Conclusion: New prognostic factors replace increasingly traditional prognostic factors. The most promising molecular factors relevant for the prognosis of patients with NSCLC are angiogenetic, growth and cell cycle regulation proteins, gene alterations, and adhesion proteins. However, their role in decision making in the treatment of NSCLC patients still has to be validated. Fumor cell CELLULAR IMMUNOTHERAPY AND IMMUNODIAGNOSTIC OF BREAST CANCER B. G~ckel, S. Stumm, Marme, S. Kayser, M. Lindner, Univ.-Frauenkllnik Univ.-Frauenklinik Heidelberg (T0bingen, Heidelberg) The development of cancer immunotherapy depends on the identification of tumor-rejection antigens which will be targeted by cellular effectors of the immunsystem. In addition, standardized methods to monitor the patient's immune status, before and during vaccination are needed to improve clinical protocols. We started two clinical trials using cellular vaccines for metastatic breast cancer patients - either tumor-cell based or immune-cell based. The advantage using an allogeneic, HLA-matched tumor cell vaccine is that it represents an antigen reservoir which activates polyclonal immune response. The introduction of genes encoding CD80 and Her2/neu improves their immunogenicity and antigenicity. Loading of dendritic cells with tumor epltopes and TH-ep[tope MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE GENES MVP, MDR1 AND MRP1 DETERMINED SEQUENTIALLY PRIOR TO, DURING AND POST HYPERTHER- MIC ISOLATED LIMB PERFUSION OF SOFT TISSUE SARCOMA AND MELANOMA PATIENTS U. (TNF) and melphalan is a highly effective treatment for advanced soft tissue sarcoma and Iocoreglonal metastases of malignant melanoma of the limb. Since multidrug resistance (MDR)- associated genes are known to be inducible by cancer therapy-related factors such as heat and cytostatics, expression levels of the major vault protein (MVP), multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1), and multidrug resistance-related protein (MRP1) were determined sequentially prior to, during, and post ILP. 21 soft tissue sarcoma or malignant melanoma patients were treated by ILP. S 133 New Diagnosis and Modalities in Cancer Therapy Tumor tissue temperatures were recorded continuously and ranged from 33.4\u00b0C initially to peak values of about 40\u00b0C during ILP. Serial true-cut biopsies from tumor tissues of patients were taken at the following time points: prior to ILP, at the end of heating (prior to TNF-drug application), during TNF-drug application, after wash-out, at the end of operation, and at day 1-3 as well as 6-7 post- operatively. Tissue section were routineously microdissected. Expression analyses for MDR genes were performed by real time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. In 83% of the patients, MVP expression was induced during ILP. MVP-mRNA inductions often paralleled the increase in temperature during ILR Elevated MVP protein expressions were observed either simultaneously with the MVP-mRNA induction, or timely delayed, following the induction at the transcriptional level. Inductions of MDR1 and MRP1 were only observed in 13% and 27% of the specimens analyzed. Temperatures and drugs applied led preferably to an induction of MVP, and were not sufficient to induce MDR1 and MRP1 in the majority of tumors. Thus, It might be hypothesized, that a definite temperature (higher than 40\u00b0C) is needed to induce signal transduction cascades which might result in induction of ABC transporters such as MDR1 and MRPI. This study is the first to analyze the expression of MDR-associated genes sequentially during ILP of patients and demonstrates, that treatment might lead to elevated levels of MVP, whereas enhanced levels of MDR1 and MRP1 remain rare events. P670 TARGETING OF IMMUNOTHERAPY BY LYMPH NODE HOMING PEPTIDES M. Trepel, W. Arap, R. Pasqualini, MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA) Lymph nodes and other lymphatic organs such as the spleen are primary sites of the body's immune response to foreign antigens. In order to augment the immune response after immunization, antigens have been targeted by local injection into lymphatic organs. Alternative strategies have targeted antigens specifically to receptors on the surface of antigen presenting cells to enhance immune response to antigens after vaccination. Here we present evidence that the humeral immune response can be strengthened by targeting antigens to lymph nodes via the bloodstream. We have previously developed an in vivo technology with phage display random peptide libraries to select for peptides homing into certain organs or tissues after intravenous injection. Here we took advantage of this system to obtain peptides homing to the vascular endothelium of lymph nodes after systemic administration in mice. Using an X2CX4CX library (C = cystein, X = any residue), we isolated two peptides that mediated homing of phage to lymph nodes after intravenous peptide insert (fd-tet phage), phage displaying either one of the peptides LNHP1 and LNHP2 showed preferential homing to the lymph nodes, while there was no preferential homing to control organs such as the brain. We then explored the possibility that targeting antigens to the lymph node vasculature might influence the immune response after vaccination. We vaccinated mice with phage particles, which are known to be potent immunogens and compared the humeral immune response of phage displaying lymph node-homing peptides to that of the insertless control phage. Mice immunized with lymph node homing phage had a markedly higher titer of anti-phage antibodies than mice immunized with fd-tet phage. Our results show that systemic targeting of antigens to lymph nodes enhances the humeral immune response after vaccination. This novel and simple way of targeting an antigen may have broad implications for the development of effective vaccines, production of antibodies, and immunotherapy. P671 THE ROLE OF PYRUVATE KINASE TYPE M2 IN TUMOR METABOLISM AND MONITORING OF THERAPY H.U. KI6r, RD. Hardt, B.K. (PK) is a key enzyme in glucose metabolism. It exists as a tetramer of four equal subunits in its active form. However, loss of the tissue- specific isoforms occurs during the development of tumors followed by the expression of the isoform Tumor M2-PK. The quantity of M2-PK increases due to the dissociation of the active form of four subunits into the weakly active form of two subunits. The dimeric form of M2-PK is called ,~Tumor M2-PK,,, which is generally detectable in tumor cells in high amounts. Different clinical studies showed, that Tumor M2-PK, which reflects a highly tumor-specific enzyme without organ specificity, is a suitable marker for a variety of tumors. Clinical studies are available for the following indications: lung cancer, breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, oesophageal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer and colorectal carcinoma. Tumor M2-PK concentrations were determined in EDTA plasma probes of 54 patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer (22 colorectal; 17 oesophageal/gastdc, 15 pancreatic/hepatobiliary), 68 healthy controls and 30 patients with IBD. There was a significant discrimination between tumor patients vs. IBD patients and controls. At a specificity of 95,6% it showed sensitivities of 63,6% (CEA 70%) in a showed best sensitivites in gastric/oesophageal, colorectal and hepatobiliary cancer, it was comparable to CA19-9 in pancreatic cancer. The determination of Tumor M2-PK in combination with more organ-specific traditional markers like CEA, CA-19-9 and CA 72-4 leads to significantly higher diagnostic sensitivities in the case of oesophageal cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal carcinoma. The determination of Tumor M2-PK in EDTA-plasma (ScheBo Bietech AG) is suitable to supplement the diagnosis of cancer, to follow-up the progress of the disease and for monitoring of therapy, as well as leading to cost savings and as individually tailored treatment by the use laboratory medical diagnostics. P672 PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMS: DETECTION OF UNDERLYING MALIGNANCY USING F18-FDG-PET U. Berner, C. Menzel, D. (PS) comprise a variety of clinical symptomes and diseases associated with underlying malignancy. Essential for patient management is a differentiation towards benign autoimmune diseases, that requires cost- and time-consuming diagnostic methods. The aim of this study was the evaluation of 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG- PET) for screening of malignancies in these patients. Methods: From 1996 to 2001 a total of 30 patients with suspected PS (m:f = 17:13, mean age 55, range 22-76 years) were investigated with 18F-FDG-PET. Diagnoses were cerebellar degeneration, erythrodermia, dermatomyositis, polneuropathia and others. PET-Scans were evaluated for convincing or suspicious signs of malignant metabolism and the results were compared to histopathologic (N=14), radiologic and follow up data (N=16). Results: An underlying malignancy could be detected in 8 / 30 Patients (27%). F18-FDG PET found 7 out of 8 malignant neoplasms. There were also one benign neoplasm and two inflammatory diseases. The remaining patients did not demonstrate a malignancy neither in the performed diagnostic procederes nor in their clinical follow up. Conclusion: The application of 18F-FDG PET as a screening tool for the detection of malignancy in suspected paraneoplastic syndromes seems to be of reasonable value. Key words: Paraneoplastic syndrome, F18-FDG-PET P673 ANTISENSE-TGF-BETA-20LIGONUCLEOTIDE AP 12009: RESULTS AND STUDIES R. Schlingensiepen, M. Goldbrunner, A. directed against transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGF-B2). Preclinical efficacy data in glioma have been previously published. Prior to application in humans, the safety was determined in pharmacological and toxicological animal studies. Safety pharmacology aspects were assessed in cynomolgus monkeys. After short-term infusion of AP 12009 (5 to 160 mg/kg b.w.), ,,no observed adverse effect levels\" (NOAEL) were determined for cardiovascular (20 mg/kg b.w.), clotting mg/kg b.w.), and hematological parameters b.w.), and for complement activation (5-20 mg/kg b.w.). Possible toxic effects were investigated after both local and i,v. application. Intrathecal bolus administration of 3.3 IJg/kg b.w. in rabbits, and 50 IJg/kg b.w. in cynomolgus monkeys revealed no clinical signs of toxicity or macroscopically visible changes. Direct application of AP 12009 into brain tissue of rabbits by intracerebral continuous infusion did not cause any clinical signs of toxicity or macroscopically visible changes at a dose of 28.5 IJg/kg b.w./day. Acute toxic effects of the substance have been assessed by i.v. administration in mice and rats. I.v. single bolus injections of 30 to 1,000 mg/kg b.w. did not cause toxic symptoms up to 100 b.w. LD50 in a 14-day b.w. in rats. A subchronic toxicity study with i.v. infusion of 1, 4, and 16 mg/kg b.w./day as continuous flow or 8 mg/kg b.w./day as short-term infusion was performed in cynomolgus monkeys. This treatment did not result in any premature deaths or effects on blood pressure, heart or respiratory rate. A dose-dependent influence on hematological parameters was observed as well as changes of clinico- biochemical parameters in the highest dose-group. Substance-related changes such as deposits and hypertrophy were documented for the liver. All lesions were reversible at the end of a 4-week treatment-free recovery period. AP 12009 revealed excellent local tolerability and high acute safety in single i.v. dose toxicity studies. For continuous i.v. infusion a NOAEL of 1 mg/kg b.w./day for 4 weeks was determined. Based on the published preclinical efficacy data and the results presented here, local administration of AP 12009 in patients with malignant glioma was determined to be safe. The substance is currently used in phase 1/11 trials for this indication. P674 CLONING, CHARACTERIZATION, AND REGULATION OF THE MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED HUMAN MAJOR VAULT PROTEIN/LUNG RESIST- ANCE PROTEIN (MVP/LRP) GENE PROMOTER U. Stein, W. Walther, S. Bergmann, L. conserved cellular organelles, which are suggested to be involved in the nuc]eocytoplasmic drug transport with respect to the defense against xenobiotics. They are the largest known ribonucleoprotein complexes and consist S 134 New Diagnosis and Modalities in Cancer Therapy of a small untranslated RNA and of three proteins: the lung resistance protein LRP identified as the human major vault protein MVP, and the minor vault proteins. Distribution of MVP/LRP in human normal tissues and tumors showed that of other drug resistance-related proteins, with high expressions in tissues chronically exposed to xenobiotics. We could demonstrate that the endogenous expression of MVP/LRP was inducible by as adriamycin, vincristin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil in human colon carcinoma cell lines. These elevated MVP/LRP expression levels were determined by real time RT-PCR and immunoflow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies. In order to get first insights in the regulation of this gene and to identify sequences, which are responsible for mediating the stress-induced effects, we isolated and cloned a 1.9 kb DNA sequence upstream to the transcription initiation site of the MVP/LRP gene, which showed basal promoter activity in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter assays. The promoter is TATA-less, and contains an inverted CCAAT-box (Y-box; potential binding of the transcription factor YB-1), an E-box-like element (potential binding of myc), and a Spl site located near to a p53 binding motif. Biological relevance of these elements were verfied by shift assays as demonstrated by binding of transcription factors. A panel of deletion mutants was generated, harboring defined promoter sequences/ consensus elements; e.g. with vs. without Y-box, or E-box, or p53-binding site. After transduction of these deletion mutant-CAT-constructs into human colon carcinoma cells, subsequent drug treatments with cieplatin, adriamycin, or 5- fluorouracil led to increased levels of CAT expression, as measured by CAT-ELISA. It turned out, that defined promoter sequences close to the transcription initiation site are decisive for the regulation of the MVP/LRP gene by external stress factors. Taken together, cancer therapy-related modalities such as chemotherapy might induce the expression of the MVP/LRP gene via these newly identified MVP/ LRP promoter A. Rosendahl, J. Thomale, Inst. of Cell Biology, Dpt. of Internal Medicine, Dpt. of Neurology (Essen) Accumulation and repair of specific Pt-DNA lesions are critical parameters for the efficacy of platinum based chemotherapy. In order to test this hypothesis, we have generated and characterized menoclonal antibodies (MAb) directed against Cisplatin-induced DNA adducts. Employing these Mabs in an \"Immune-Cytological Assay\" (ICA) enabled us to measure the level of specific Pt-DNA adducts in nuclei of individual cells. Investigating pairs of Cisplatin-sensitive vs. resistant human cell lines we could elucidate the role of the membrane transporter MRP 2 as a critical parameter controlling the level of adduct formation. Additionally we have examined the role of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway for the processing of Pt-DNA lesions. Compared to wild type littermates, XPA and XPC knockout mice turned out to be more sensitive to the acute toxicity of Cisplatin. It was demonstrated, that this hypersensitivity is correlated to a higher accumulation of intrastrand crosslinks (XPA-/-) or a nearly complete incompetence to remove these DNA adducts (XPC-/-) in various cell types. Our data showed, that DNA platination products can be repaired by NER already as monovalent adducts occurring as early intermediate structures during Cisplatin-DNA interaction. We have analyzed the processing of Pt-DNA adducts in different cell types of the nervous tissue. Adduct levels were found higher in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and satellite cells (outside the blood-brain barrier) than in the same cell type of the spinal cord. Furthermore the extent of DNA platination was higher in glial cells than in neurons originated from the same anatomical structure. The predominant damage of the dorsal root ganglion neurons and satellite cells is in good correlation with the sensory type of Cisplatin-induced polyneuropathy in humans. In a pilot study we have measured specific Pt-DNA adducts in normal and tumor tissue from patients with gastric or oesophageal cancer. Quantitative analysis in biopsies exhibited pronounced intercellular and inter-individual heterogeneity of adduct accumulation. Longitudinal studies will show, whether steady state levels of specific Pt-adducts in tumor cells may be indicative for the clinical outcome. P677 CANCER AND CHAPERONE - HSP70 MEMBRANE EXPRESSION AS A TAR- GET RECOGNITION STRUCTURE FOR A CELLULAR IMMUNOTHERAPY M. Hantschel, major stress-inducible heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) has been found to play key roles in cancer immunity. Previously, Hsp70 has been found on the cell surface of tumor cell lines but not on normal cells. This unusual Hsp70 plasma membrane expression correlates with an increased sensitivity to natural killer (NK) cells. In the present study Hsp70 and MHC class I membrane expression was determined on freshly isolated primary tumor material, metastases and normal tissues. Material and methods: 233 primary tumors including esophagus, stomach, pancreas and colorectal carcinomas and metastases were analyzed. A single cell suspension was prepared from the freshly isolated biopsy material. Viable cells were used for flow cytometric analysis using the Hsp70 antibody clone C92 F3 B1, the MHC I antibody and isotype matched control antibody. Results: The Hsp70 and MHC membrane expression varies in different tumor entities. Especially esohagus (100%), pancreas carcinoma (80%) exhibit an Hsp70 positive phenotype. Hsp70 membrane expression in colon carcinoma was 63%, in rectal carcinoma 44% and gastric carcinoma 48%. Interestingly, advanced tumor stages and metastases show elevated levels of membrane-bound Hsp70. The corresponding normal tissues of the different tumors were found to be negative for Hsp70 membrane expression. Conclusion: Similiar to tumor cell lines HspT0 was expressed on human primary tumor material but not on normal tissues. In vitro Hsp70 acts as a target recognition structure for NK cells. Therefore on might speculate about the immunotherapeutical potential of membrane-bound Hsp70 on gastrointestinal tumors. P678 HUMAN OVARIAN CANCER AND DENDRITIC CELL HYBRIDS GENERATED BY ELECTROFUSION F. Hilpert, J. Pfisterer, A. Heiser, C. KrL)ger, A. T-cell recruitment and helper T-cell support. Hybrid cells from ovarian cancer (OC) and dendritic cells (DC) generated by electrofusion (EF) should provide the prerequisites for enhanced antigenicity of OC due to presentation of tumor associated antigens in context with antigen-presenting properties of DC. DC's were prepared from leucapheresis under serum free conditions. DC and OC were analyzed for expression of MHC-I and -II, CD86, CD80, HEA and CA125. Cells were tranferred into low conductive media and mixed in a ratio of 1:1 to yield a total density of 2x107/ml. Fusion efficacy was measured using unspecific cell staining with fluorescent flow-cytometry and fluorescence microscopy (FM). EF was performed by di-electrophoretically alignment of cells in an inhomogeneous electrical field in an eleetroporation chamber before fusion with a single electric pulse under varying fusion conditions. Viability after fusion was assessed by dye exclusion. DC culture protocols and procedure of cell-transfer into low conductive media before EF has important impact on cell viability before and after fusion and fusion efficacy. EF of DC and human OC is possible as verified through FM after specific antibody and unspecific cell staining. But unspecific staining before fusion and subsequent FC is ineligible to assess fusion efficacy due to loss of fluorescent dyes during EF and appearance of 'pseudo-hybrids' just pretending cell-cell- fusion as confirmed by simultaneous FM. Specific cell staining with antibodies after EF and subsequent FC shows lower rates of double fluorescent cells but seems to be an eligible method to give a more precise measurement of fusion efficacy by FC. Cell viability after EF is dependent on electrical parameters and cell reconstitution afterwards. Overall viability is lower as expected and reaches a maximum of 50%. Electrofusion of DC and human OC is possible. Hybrid cells express the prerequisites for the induction of anti-tumoural T-cell response. While unspecific cell staining with dyes subsequent FC is ineligible, specific antibody staining after EF and subsequent FC in combination with FM seems to provide a precise assessement of fusion efficacy. P679 COMPARISON OF SENTINEL-NODE-BIOPSY AND ULTRASONOGRAPHY FOR THE STAGING OF PRIMARY CUTANEOUS MELANOMA A. Steinmann, T. Meyer, C. Schuler, FAU Erlangen-N0rnberg (Erlangen) Sentinel-Node-Biopsy (SNB) is an important staging procedure for primary cutaneous melanoma and will be required for accurate assessment of the N-category in the new AJCC staging system. UItrasonography of lymph nodes has been established as sensitive and -compared to SNB- readily accesible and affordable diagnostic tool in the follow-up of melanoma. Therefore we compared the value of preoperative lymph node sonography with the standard of subsequently performed SNB. At the department of dermatology sonography was performed to assess tumor thickness (Dermascan, Cortex, Denmark) and regional lymph nodes (Sonoline Siena, Siemens, Germany) in 36 patients (21 male, 15 female, median age 46 a) with primary cutaneous melanoma. These patients with sonographic tumor thickness > lmm were then referred to the department of surgery, where adequate tumor excision, lymphoscintigraphy and SNB were performed. The histology of the tumors (21 SSM, 10 NMM, 5 ALM ) revealed a median breslow thickness of 1,9mm (0,9-6,3mm). The SNB was positive in 7 patients (19,4%), negative in 28 patients and 1 cases was inconclusive due to loss of a histologic specimen. The sonography of regional lymph nodes revealed 3 cases with metastasis-suspect lesions, 18 cases with reactive lymph nodes and 15 cases with no detectable nodes. Comparing the findings of ultrasonography with the results of subsequent SNB there is a sensitivity of 42,9% and a specifity of 100%. We conclude that ultrasonography has an insufficient sensitivity to replace SNB as diagnostic standard, but yields a very high specifity when suspicious lesions are detected. It may be feasible to mark metastasis-suspect lesions during sonography followed by direct excision of these lesions without additive lymphoscintigraphy. This cost-effective approach has to be discussed regarding the contradicting aim for standardized staging procedures. S 135 New Diagnosis and Modalities in Cancer Therapy P680 LAPAROSCOPIC FLUORESCENCE DETECTION OF OVARIAN METASTASES is the application of specific photosensitizers which accumulate selectively in certain tissue. After light absorption through the photosensitizer which ideally accumulates in tumour tissue, certain photochemical processes were induced to show either fluorescence or destroy selectively tumour tissue. In a phase I study we assessed the possibility of detecting residual micrometastases laparoscopically in 29 patients with ovarian cancer after surgical treatment followed by platin based chemotherapy. Methods: All patients received 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) intraperitoneally 5 hours before laparoscopic procedure. Exogenously applied ALA results in endogenous production of the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX. and is accumulating in certain cells especially tumour tissue. A Wolf-Combilight PDD 5133 system served as a source of light which permits switching from whight light mode to blue light mode to excite protoporphyrin IX which has accumulated in the tissues. By means of blue light illumination of the light source intraperitoneal located red fluorescent lesions suspected as metastases were biopsied. There were also taken biopsies from non fluorescing lesion suspicious in white light mode. All laparoscopies were video-documented. Results: With a sensitivity of 92 % and a specivity of 98% tumour tissue could be detected by strong red fluorecence even in extremely small lesions less than 1 mm. Peritoneum, bowl and liver showed no fluorescence. There were no major side effects. Conclusion: Laparoscopic fluorescence detection of protoporphyrin iX after intraperitoneal application of ALA provides high sensitivity in detecting intraperitoneal metastases of ovarian cancer metastases. The fluorescence offers distinct optical differentiation between normal and malignant tissue for selective biopsies via laparoscopy. This principle of precise detection of malignant tissue may open new avenues in the diagnosis of intraperitoneal tumour spread of other malignant diseases, such as pancreatic and colon carcinomas. The photodynamic principle may also be an alternative treatment option in very small intraperitoneal malignant lesions. P681 SLIDE-BASED SIX COLOR IMMUNOPHENOTYPING microscope based technology of laser scanning cytometry (LSC) are well established procedures. In comparison to flow cytometry, this technology has the great advantage that only very small specimens are needed and that cells are fixed on a slide and therefore are available for morphological analysis: the slide is removed from the microscope after analysis, a conventional H&E staining is performed, and cells of interest are re-localised in the LSC in order to take micrographs. We have established an assay for immunophenctyping of peripheral blood leukccytes and compared the results with flow cytometry: typically, the coefficient of correlation ranged from 0.97 to 0.99 for the different cell subsets. However, up to now the spectral range of the LSC was limited to the fluorochromes FITC, PE, or dyes emitting equivalent spectra (Alexa\u00ae dyes, e.g.). We modified the instrument in order to extend the spectral range and introduced an altered filter setting so that we are now able to simultaneously analyse FITC, PE, PE-Cy5, and APC-Cy7. With this assay we are to simultaneously quantify all major lymphocyte subtypes (Th, Tc, B, NK) plus monocytes taking just 201JI peripheral blood for a single analysis. We have also developed staining panels for the quantification of memory-T-cells and the subtyping of T-cells according to addition to staining, the cells' morphology can be documented by micrographs. In conclusion, this assay might be of special value in establishing the immunophenotype and thoroughly monitoring lymphocyte subsets where only very limited samples are available, e.g. in paediatric oncology but also in adult cancer patients. P682 EVALUATION OF THE THERAPY RESPONSE WITH STI571 IN METASTATIC GASTROINTESTINAL STROMAL TUMOR (GIST) BY und Tumortherapie (Essen) Aim. There is no effective therapy for unresectable or metastatic GIST. The overall survival is poor with an estimated 10 to20 month median survival. First treat- ments with STI571 has revealed that up to 80% had a response rate ( 55% remission, 25% stable disease). Using conventional anatomical imaging, it gener- ally takes partly a long time to proof therapy response; therefore, it is desirable to have an early evidence of metabolic response. In addition, this could reduce high therapy costs. The aim of this study is the evaluation of [18F]-FDG-PET in the assessment of the metabolic therapy response of STI571 in comparison with CT scans. Methods. A number of 9 patients had subsequent FDG-PET and CT scans before and 4 weeks after initiation of STI571 therapy. PET imaging was visually assessed and the metabolic activity was measured using the FDG uptake value (SUV). Results. In all patients (pretreatment), there was a pathological uptake of tracer in all tumor lesions. After 4 weeks, a lack of biological response was shown in only 2/9 patients, thus there are 7 responder. In 37% of the metabolic responder, there was a reduction of tumor mass provided by CT scans. The non-responder exhib- ited a progress in CT. Conclusions. In summary, [18F ]-FDG-PET allowed a reliable and early assess- ment of the STI571 therapy response and is superior to non functional imaging. P683 FIRST EXPERIENCES IN CLINICAL ONCOLOGY WITH A COMBINED PET/CT SCANNER IN ESSEN WITH [18F]-FDG AND 124IODINE J. Kanja, Aim. it is known that FDG-PET imaging is a useful tool in clinical oncology. The difficulty in interpretation of the FDG-PET scans, in particular in the abdomen, is the lack of identifiable anatomical structures. Low contrast and low resolution of anatomy visualized in the PET scans are insufficient for an accurate anatomical localization of foci presenting abnormal uptake. Consequently, a combined PET/ CT scanner can resolved these difficulties. Both images are co-registered and can be acquired in a single session. Currently, there are eight PET/CT scanners installed worldwide for clinical evaluation. One of these systems is in use at the University of Essen since December 2001. Methods. The first clinical evaluation were performed with a combination of ECAT EXACT HR+ (PET) and emitters, FDG and 124Iodine, were used. Results and Conclusions. In this work, a range of different types of cancers including lung, head and neck, lymphoma, thyroid and gastrointestinal tract as well as neuroendocrine tumors were examined. This new kind of fused images will be presented. P684 DETECTION OF DISSEMINATED LUNG CANCER CELLS IN THE PERIPHERAL BLOOD AND BONE MARROW OF NSCLC-PATIENTS BY A NEW NESTED RT- PCR SYSTEM SPECIFIC FOR THE PLUNC GENE PRODUCT C. R6der, M. Ernst, A. B6hle, early stages is usually treated by radical surgical resection, but the 5-year survival rates are still unsatisfactory also in patients with relatively good prognosis. This may be due to undetectable metastases, or a generalized tumor cell dissemination at the time of operation, in order to detect disseminated tumor cells in the peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), and tissue specimen of NSCLC-patients, we established a highly sensitive RT-PCR assay specific for the recently discovered gene plunc (palate, lung and nasal epithelium clone), mainly expressed the respiratory tract. Methods: PB and BM was taken from NSCLC-patients after written consent before surgical resection. Total RNA was isolated from the mononuclear cell fraction which possibly also contained disseminated tumor cells. Moreover, RNA was extracted from tumor cryosections and from mononuclear cells of healthy blood donors. After reverse transcription the cDNA was analyzed for the plunc gene product by a nested PCR. Results: Plunc-specific the mononuclear cell fractions from blood of 9 healthy donors did not show any plunc expression. Of 4 NSCLC cell lines analyzed (BEN, Colo699, KNS62, MR65) only BEN was clearly positive for plunc mRNA, and was consequently chosen for further tuning and validation of the PCR assay in cell spiking experiments. Up to now, analysis of PB and KM of 90 NSCLC-patients revealed 29 positive findings (32,2%) in blood or bone marrow. Seven of these were positively tested in PB, 17 in KM, and 5 were positive in both compartments. 14 of the positive samples were derived from T1- and T2-R0 resected patients. According to histological 27,5% of squamous-, and 33,3% of large-cell carcinoma patients showed a positive RT-PCR reaction. Conclusions: A new highly sensitive nested RT-PCR assay was established for the detection of disseminated tumor cells in patients with Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. The detection rate achieved after investigation of 90 patients was 32%, showing a more frequent positivity in bone marrow than in blood samples. Further evaluation of the assay with respect to its prognostic value and clinical relevance seems to be promising because of the relatively high proportion of early tumor stages among the analyzed patient collective. P685 DEVELOPMENT OF IMAGING DIAGNOSTICS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF US- GUIDED FINE-NEEDLE PUNTURE (UFNP) IN Kliniken GmbH (Neuruppin) The modern imaging procedures are on the advance. The introduction of new techniques in sonography like improved doppler ultasound, harmonic imaging and contrast media can provide higher resolution and sensitivities. HelicaI-CT and multi-slice-techniques supply better results. Also the other imaging methods compete for the detectibility of focal lesions and the evaluation of dignity. In practice focal lesions are often more seen as before, e.g. in the liver. To distinguish between benign and malignant tumors remains a problem and the solution isn't possible by imaging alone, unless with high material and financial expenditure. Therefore is the meaning unchangedly high of the uFNP as a simple method with only few complications to receive cytological and histological material. The S 136 New Diagnosis and Modalities in Cancer Therapy sensitivity of the uFNP lies at 85-95% and was checked at our own patient data. Aim of the investigation was a comparison of the yield of uFNP and core needle puncture (CNP) as well as the review of verification of the advantage by composite use (,,twice repeated puncture\" - TRP). methods: A retrospective revision was carried out by 486 punctions. The lesions were 240 liver, 66 pancreas, 26 lymph node, 13 adrenal, 96 other. 114 lesions were punctured prospectivly (55 liver, 14 pancreas, 12 lymph node, 20 other). The yield was compared with core needle (CNP; 1,2a mm Trucut), FNP/histol. (0,7s mm Chiba) and FNP/cytoi. results: Retrospective analysis includes 95 malignant lesions of the liver, 18 tumors of the pancreas, 15 tumors of lymph nodes. The histologic sensitivity was higher as in cytology, except for adrenals. In particular the sensivity is high for liver tumors (91 % histology) but low in pancreas processes (68 %). The overall sensitivity was 89%. 94,7% overall sensitivity was obtained in prospective analysis. The TRP produced in comparison with ,,simple\" uFNP a significantly higher sensitivity at liver lesions (97,4%) and pancreatic tumors (90%). discussion: The sensitivity is highly in simple uFNP. The combination of FNP and CNP increased the sensitivity about 90% particulary in liver and pancreas processes. - The FNP is an highly sensitive procedure with only a few complications both to the clarification of the tumor dignity or, if metastases appears, for the primary tumor. The twice result puncture increases the yield significantly. Despite of advances in new imaging techniques, the uFNP keeps an important position in the diagnostic regime of the oncologist. P686 DIRECT LYMPHATIC MAPPING USING FLUORESCENCE (SLN) biopsy using radiolabeled albumin or intradermal blue dye has rapidly emerged as novel approach in patients with regional nodal micrometastasis. We have developed an albumin direct intraoperative fluorescence detection as well as gadolinium-albumin (Gd-HSA) for lymphatic mapping and SLN detection by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: In rats the normal lymphatic basins of the hind leg and at the retroperitoneal region were inspected. In rabbits SLN were stimulated with Freud's adjuvans. TCPC was covalenty labeled to human serum albumin in a 1:1 molar ratio and was intradermally injected in the foot in a total amount of 0.1 ml in rats and rabbits. Fluorescence was activated using a specific xenon-lamp. Then, fluorescence of the draining lymphatic vessels and SLN could be observed with a long-pass filter. Gadolinium also was covalently bound to albumin and was intradermal injected in the foot in a total amount of 0.2 ml in rabbits after Freud's adjuvans stimulation. MRI (1.5 T) was performed using specfic fat suppression technique. Results: The draining lymphatic vessels were identified by fluorescence inspection and were fluorescence stained by TCPC-HSA in all animals. Also the SLN and their parent lymphatic vessels, which usually were localized at the popliteal region, were well visible after fluorescent dye administration. Draining lymphatic basins were stained with fluorescence up to the retroperitoneal region 1 h after TCPC-HSA administration. Using Gd-HSA draining lymphatic vessels and SLN at the popliteal region could be demostrated as well. Coclusion: The two albumin labeled substances may offer a new approach in lymphatic mapping. TCPC-HSA may be useful as fluorescence dye for direct visualisation of draining lymphatic vessels and SLN and Gd-HSA seems to be promising as a specfic contrast agent for MR imaging at the same issue. Publication only P'687 DIAGNOSTIC UTILITY OF CYFRA 21-1 AND CEA IN THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF PLEURAL Weisser, Intern. Bergmannsheil (Bochum) The diagnostic value of CYFRA 21-1 and CEA was evaluated in malignant levels of CYFRA 21-1 and CEA were determined by means of two commercial enzyme immuneassays. Repunctures were included. Differences in the median values between the groups were checked using KruskalI-Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test. P < 0.05 was considered significant. As summarized in the table, significant differences were found among the four groups with regard to levels of CYFRA 21- 1 and CEA in the serum and pleural fluid. Using ROC curves, best discrimination between benign and malignant effusions was obtained by CYFRA 21-1 in pleural specificity). Considering ma-lignant effusions alone, best discrimination between mesothelioma and nonmesothelioma was obtained by CEA in pleural fluid (cut-off 2.3 ng/mh 83% sensitivity, 95% specificity). Additionally, in mesothelioma the CYFRA 21-1 levels in pleural fluid seems to be associated with the histological type with higher values in epitheloid tumors as compared to sarcomatoid and biphasic tumors. Thus, CYFRA 21-1 and CEA in the pleural fluid can be a useful addition in the differential dia-gno-sis of pleural effusions. Tumor marker 1.

Gr~nwald, Klinikum der JWGU (Frankfurt) This study aimed at the evaluation of PET for the initial and re-staging of Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL) according to its subtypes and in relation to the results of computed tomography (CT). Special attention was paid to the accuracy of PET for detection of bone marrow infiltration (BMI).We evaluated 60 HL (m:f = 31:29, mean age 37.8 yrs.); there were 22 examinations done for a primary staging (13/22 received bone marrow biopsy ; BMB) and 38 re-staging evaluations. PET scans were done after injection of fluorine-18-deoxyglucose (FDG) using a standard acquisition protocol and a Siemens ECAT Exact 47 dedicated PET scanner. CT investigations were done in several institutions. PET scans were evaluated qualitatively using a consensus approach of three experienced nuclear medicine physicians. A semi- quantitative measurement of the regional glucose metabolism was also carried out using the standardized uptake value (SUV).There were 39 cases with a nodular sclerosis (NS), 5 cases with mixed cellularity (MC), 3 cases with lymphocyte predominance (LP) and 13 non-classified (NC) cases. In 29/60 cases, viable tumour was detected by PET, these cases included 22 primary and 7 restaging procedures. Tumour uptake ranged from SUV 1.65 to 12.89, mean 4.3+/-3.1, median 3.57. Mean SUV in NS (n:6) was 4.2 and 3.5 for MC (n:l), 1.5 for LP (n: 1), 6.4 for NC (n:4) respectively. 31/38 restaging evaluations showed complete remission in PET and conventional staging, including a CT scan and a BMB in 11 cases. Bone marrow uptake in a total of 33 cases with BMB was evaluated. BMB was normal in all cases. PET showed homogenous bone marrow uptake in 32/33 cases (SUV references lumbal vertebra 1 and 3 were within a range of 0.58 to 2.49, mean 1.26 +/- 0.08). In one case the PET showed a significant multifocal bone marrow uptake - although not within the site of the BMB. PET is of major advantage for the staging and restaging of HL as it allows whole body screening in only one examination session. There are no relevant differences in glucose metabolism of the histopathologic subtypes, which can in consequence be investigated with no variance of accuracy. P'689 TREATMENT OF AN EXTENSIVE MALIGNANT MELANOMA (STAGE III) WITH OXALIPLATIN AND W. Dempke, treatment of patients with disseminated melanoma metastases has not been very successful. A malignant melanoma is a very herterogenous tumour that is extremely resistent against cytostatics, biomodulators, and ionising radiation in vitro as well as in vivo. Here we are reporting a 54-years old female patient with a tumour in an advanced stage and disseminated metastases in the lungs. After resection of a malignant melanoma of the mouth floor mucosa (primary tumour stage II) the patient was initially treated with alpha interferone as immunotherapy. Three months later disseminated metastases were found in the patient's lungs. She suffered from cough attacks and haemoptyses. Consequently, the patient underwent chemotherapy with BCNU / cisplatin, DTIC and tamoxifen. Nevertheless, the formation of lung metastases progessed. This progress could not even be stopped by the subsequent attempt of a therapy with temozolomide. When the patient was admitted to our hospital she was in a good physical condition with a Kamofsky Index of more than 80 %. Because of the patient's urgent desire for therapy we decided to start palliative chemotherapy with docetaxel (60 mg/m 2, d 1 and 8, q14) and oxaliplatin (80 mg/m 2, d 1 and 8, q14). The effectiveness of these pounds had already been confirmed by several in vitro experiments. After the first treatment cycle the patient's chest radiography revealed a slight decrease of the size and the quantity of the lung filiae. This tendency was confirmed after the second and the third treatment cycle. The patient did not have any problems with this kind of therapy. There was no occurrence of any toxic side effects. The patient's lung symptoms had disappeared. It seems that the combination of doxetaxel and oxaplatin is a feasible therapy option in patients with advanced refractory malignant melanoma. However more studies are clearly warranted to further eluciated this treatment protocol. S 137 New Drugs in Oncology/New Diagnosis and Modalities in Cancer Therapy New Drugs in Oncology/New DiaQnosis and Modalities in Cancer Therapy Oral Presentation 0690 INHIBITION OF ANGIOGENESIS AND REGRESSION OF HUMAN PANCRE- ATIC CANCER BY BLOCKADE OF EGF-R SIGNAL Regensburg (Regensburg) purpose this study was to evaluate whether down-regulation of EGF-R signaling pathway by inhibit growth and metastasis of human pancreatic carcinoma in nude mice. We also investigated whether the efficacy of gemcitabine - first line chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer - can be enhanced by concurrent administration of CGP75166 or C225. Therapy beginning 7 days after erthtotopic injection of lx106 L3.6pl human pancreatic cancer cells, produced 59%, 45%, and 85% reduction in pancreatic tumor volume in mice receiving gemcitabine, CGP74166, and combination therapy, respectively. Lymph node and liver metastases were most effectively reduced in mice receiving combination therapy. A significant survival benefit following combination therapy as compared was demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Similar results were obtained using C225 antibody. VEGF and IL-8 protein production was significantly lower in CGP75166 and CGP75166 plus gemcitabine-treated tumors which correlated with a significant decrease in microvessel density and an increase in apoptotic endothelial cells as visualized by fluorescent CD31/TUNEL double labeling. The data indicate that therapeutic strategies targeting EGF-R signaling have a significant antitumor effect on human L3.6pl pancreatic carcinoma growing in nude mice, which are mediated, in part, by inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis. O691 A monotherapy (1,5 30 min i.v.) in patients with relapsed neuroblastoma we saw some clinical anti-tumor activity with acceptable toxicity. We are now conducting a study with TPT and Etoposide (ETO). Methods: In our multicenter phase-II-study we included children a clinically proven relapse of neuroblastoma or neuroblastoma refractory to conventional therapy. Patients [pts] received a continuous infusion of 0,7 mg/m2/d TPT over 7 days (168 hours) followed by a daily one hour infusion of 100 mg/m2/d ETO on days 8-10. (CIV-greup). If there was no central venous line, TPT was given in a dose of 1 mg/m2/d as a 30 min infusions on days 1-5, followed by ETO with a daily one- hour-infusion of 100 mg/m2/d on days 8-10 (DIV-group). The planned therapy intervall between two cycles [cyl] was to be 21 days. Results: We enrolled 25 pts with a median age of 7,7 (min 2; max 30) years at study-entry in 17 participating centres. 22 pts are evaluable. They received a total number of 91 cyl with a median of 3 (1; 8) cyl per pts. 15 pts were given 59 cy] in the CIV-group, 7 pts were given 32 cyl in the DIV-group. The median daily dose of TPT was 0,7 mg/m 2 (0,34; 0,94) and 100 mg/m 104) the CIV-group and 1,0 (0,35; 1,0) and 100 (91; 101) in the DIV-group respectively. The main toxicity was hematologic (see table 2). In both groups the median WBC nadir was in 10 cyl in 8 pts; no bleeding complications. No therapy-related deaths. We saw an overall response rate in 78% of pts: 32% stable disease (SD) (median time to progression [q-I'P] of 82 (47;492) days), 23% partial response (PR) (TI-P complete response (CR) ('~'P 388 [145;416]). 22% of pts had no response (progressive disease (PD)). There was no difference in response rates between the DIV and the CIV-group. Conclusion: The combination of TPT and ETO in the described dose schedule is in view of toxicity a tolerable and save drug-regimen.We saw a surprisingly good response rate, much better than in published studies with TPT as monotherapy in relapsed neuroblastoma. There could be a prolongation of time to progression and perhaps in the rate of PR and CR, when the dose of TPT is increased. 0692 ANTINEOPLASTIC AND ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY OF ARTESUNATE Hautklinik, Erlangen-N0rnberg, Inst. f. Virologie, Universit&t Erlangen (Mainz, Eriangen; Chapel Hill, NC, USA) Twenty-two chemically characterized compounds derived from Traditional Chi- nese Medicine were analyzed. The antimalarial artesunate (ART) was among the most active compounds. ART did not exhibit cross-resistance to multidrug- resistant tumor cells overexpressing either MRP1, or BCRP genes. Isogenic p53 -/- knock out tumor cells were as sensitive as their p53+/+ counterparts indicating that ART was not subject to p53-mediated chem- oresistance. The evaluation of ART's anticancer activity in 55 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute, U.S.A., showed that ART was most active against leukemias and colon cancers. We mined the N.C.I. database and correlated the IC50 values with microarray mRNA expression profile of 465 genes. By hierarchi- cal cluster analysis we identified oncogenes and proliferation-regulating genes which were strongly downregulated in ART-sensitive leukemia and colon cancer cell lines. The role of proliferation for ART's response was corroborated using a panel of isogenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with defined genetic knock out mutations. ART also revealed antiviral activity. The replication of recombinant ganciclovir-resistant and -sensitive AD169-GFP human cytomegaloviruses (HCMV) was inhibited by ART with similar efficacy. ART inhibited the expression of immediate early, early, and late HCMV proteins. Band shift assays and Western blots demon- strated a reduced DNA binding activity and protein expression of the cellular transcription factors NF-kB and Spl which are involved in HCMV replication. In summary, ART's activity is not restricted to malaria treatment. Our results indicate that the drug acts in an antiproliferative manner on cancer cells and HCMV. 0693 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HEAT SHOCK PROTEINS (HSP) TO ACTIVATE HUMAN ANTIGEN PRESENTING CELLS: IMPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF HSP-BASED TUMOR VACCINES K Bethke, F Staib, M Distler, U Schmitt, H Jonuleit, A Enk, PR. Galle, M Heike, 1. Klinik d. Johannes-Gutenberg Univ. Mainz, Hautklinik d. Johannes-Gutenberg Univ. Mainz (Mainz) The unique role of heat shock proteins in cancer vaccines depends on their dual functions to shuttle bound tumor antigens into professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) and to activate professional APCs. Informations about differences between HSP in their efficiency to activate APC under defined experimental conditions are lacking so far. Here, we compared the capacities of recombinant human HSP60, human indicible HSP72, preparations of gp96 and HSP70 from human cells and tissue to activate or human monocytes or dendritic cells (DC). The experiments were performed under stringent conditions with highly purified human monocytes or monocyte-derived DC in presence or absence of human serum. We demonstrate that HSP60 induces human DC maturation and activates human DC to secrete proinflammatory cytokines. HSP72 induced DC maturation to a lesser extent but activates human monocytes and immature DC as efficiently as HSP60 to release proinflammatory cytokines. The independence of the HSP60- and HSP72-effects from endotoxin was shown by the resistance of these effects against pelymyxin B and by their sensitivity to heat treatment as well as by the inactivity of endotoxin controls at concentrations which were at least 100-fold above the endotoxin contents of the HSP. Preparations of HSP7O, which con- sisted mainly of the constitutively expressed HSP73, did only induce a marginal cytokine release from monocytes. Gp96 preparations did not have significant effects on human monocytes and monocyte-derived DC, indicating that these human APC populations are not susceptible to gp96 signalling under the stringent conditions applied in this study. The biological activity of gp96 and HSP70 prepa- rations was confirmed by their peptide binding activity. Additionally, cross-pres- entation of the melanoma from ex vivo reconstituted gp96/MART-1 complexes could be demonstrated. In conclusion, these findings show that HSP differ considerably in their capacities to activate highly purified monocyte-derived APC and underscore the potential of HSP60 and HSP72 as tumor vaccine constituents. (supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, SFB 432) 0694 CHEMOEMBOLIZATION OF THE LUNG IMPROVES TUMOR CONTROL IN A RAT MODEL P. Schneider, S. Kampfer, C. Loddenkemper, T. Foitzik, H. Buhr, Universit~tsklinikum Benjamin Franklin der FU (Berlin) Treatment of pulmonary metastases is still inadequate except in patients with resectable disease. In most patients, systemic chemotherapy does not improve survival but causes marked toxicity. Local chemotherapy, such as isolated lung perfusion (ILP), achieves a better response than systemic chemotherapy by increasing the drug concentration in the lung. However, ILP requires thoracotomy and installation of an extracorporea] circulation. The novel method we present here is unilateral chemoembolizatien of the lung by injecting the pulmonary artery with degradable starch microspheres (DSM) and cytotoxic drugs. In a solitary metastasis rat model, we studied the efficacy of chemoembolization compared to intravenous therapy, ILP and a control group. We investigated the clinical and histological tumor response as well as subacute toxicity of the lung. In 26 WAG/ Rij rats, a solitary metastasis was induced in the left lung by subpleural injection of 1.5 x 1000000 tumor cells of CC531 adenocarcinoma cell suspension. Fourteen days later, animals were randomized into 4 therapeutic groups. Group I received ILP with buffered starch solution without cytotoxic drugs (control group). Group II underwent i.v. therapy with carboplatin (45 mg/kg). ILP with buffered starch solution and carboplatin (15 mg/kg) was installed in group II1. Finally, chemoembolization with DSM (30 mg/kg) and carboplatin (15 mg/kg) was performed in group IV. Seven days later, the difference in the tumor volume before and after treatment was +422 mm3 (_+ 226) in group I, +70 mm3 (_+ 31) in group II, -8 mm3 (4- 17) in group III and -17 mm3 (4- 16) in group IV (p<0,05 group Ill and IV vs. group I and II). No tumor infiltration of the chest wall or pleural spread was observed in groups III and IV. Histologically, the area of tumor necrosis was largest in the chemoembolization group with extensive pyknotic and karyorrhectic cells. Mild hyperplasia, pulmonary edema and hemorrhage without subacute fibrotic changes were noted in all groups. This is the first study to perform chemoembolization of the lung in an animal model and demonstrate its efficacy. S 138 New Drugs in Oncology/New Diagnosis and Modalities in Cancer Therapy Compared to intravenous therapy, chemoembolization was more effective without serious toxicity. Its efficacy was comparable to that of ILP, but, for a possible clinical application, chemoembolization seems advantageous because it only requires the application into the pulmonary artery by endovascular catheter. Poster P695 TEMOZOLOMIDE AS THERAPY OPTION IN METASTATIC MELANOMA PA- TIENTS objective: Stage IV melanoma patients with a very advanced disease are usually excluded from clinical trials. We treated 25 stage IV patients with temozolomide - a cytostatic drug with 100% oral bioavailability and considerable penetration of CNS tissue. Patients/Methods: 25 patients (17 female, 8 male) between 24 and 82 years (mean: 55.5 years) were observed in this retrospective study. 19 patients had received at least one and up to four previous chemotherapies during the course of stage IV disease. 11 (44%) patients showed cerebral metastasis prior to therapy with temozolomide. 200 mg/m2 temozolomide were given orally at home on day 1 to 5 in week 1 and in week 5, respectively. Results: Out of 23 evaluable patients 2 (8.7%) showed a partial remission, 2 (8.7%) a minor response, 6 (26.1%) had a stable disease, 1 (4.3%) a mixed response, and 12 (52.1%) suffered from disease progression. Sites of remission included brain, lung, liver, lymph nodes and muscle. 2 patients interrupted therapy due to severe leuko- and thrombocytopenia (WHO grade 3 and 4). All other patients tolerated treatment with temozolomide well and no dose reduction became necessary.The median overall survival is 7 months (2 - 28+ months) since beginning of therapy and 15 months (4 - 63 months) since onset of stage IV disease. Conclusion:Temozolomide represents a safe treatment option in patients with metastatic melanoma and poor prognosis. P696 PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE NOVEL ANTICANCER AGENT RVISCUMIN B. Moeckel, ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP), is a biochemically well characterized drug. The lectin-like B-chain mediates cellular binding and uptake. RIP-activity of the A-chain is essential for induction of apoptesis and the biological effects of the drug: rViscumin exhibits cytotoxic and immunostimulatory properties and is effective on human immune and cancer cells. In studies with whole blood in vitro, rViscumin induces a set of intracellular cytokines (IL-1B, IL-6, TNF-a) predominantly in sensitive for rViscumin-induced apoptosis. Peak cytokine induction was close to the IC50 measured as apoptesis or decreasing viability indicating that the immunomodulatory activity of rViscumin is linked to the induction of apoptosis. Strong growth inhibition was found in human tumor cell lines and xenografts: the mean IC50 value was 0.16 ng/ml (IC70 0.4 ng/ml) for a set of 20 cell lines (Freiburg panel) and 0.9 ng/ml (IC70 3 ng/ml) for 42 human xenograffs. In the NCI 60 cell line panel the mean GI50 was 1 ng/ml (20 pM). In both panels prostate carcinoma, colon, ovarian, small and non small cell lung cancer lines were relatively sensiti- ve. Cancerostatic activity was even observed towards cell lines which were resistant to standard therapeutic agents, such as adriamycin and vindesin, showing that multi-drug resistance mechanisms do not affect cytotoxicity ef rViscumin. Pronounced antitumor activity was and xenograft models (CXF-280 colon cancer, LXFS 538 small cell lung cancer). In two different bladder cancer models and tumor colonisation models for metastasis inhibition rViscumin also led to a prolongation of survival. In two ongoing EORTC phase I clinical studies rViscumin is administered systemically (s.c. and i.v., respectively) to patients with refractory solid malignant tumors. In patients with superficial bladder cancer six weekly intravesical instillations of rViscumin are investigated in an ongoing dose finding phase 1/11 study. All studies showed so far that tolerability of rViscumin is good after systemic as well as local application. Thus, rViscumin is a promising new anticancer drug with an innovative dual mode of action, potentially applicable for a wide range of indications. P697 INHIBITION OF COLORECTAL TUMOR PROGRESSION BY CYCLIC RGD- PEPTIDES IN A CHEMICALLY INDUCED RAT MODEL U. Goldmann, U. Keilholz, B. cell surface molecules that mediate cell adhesion, but are also important regulators of tumor cell interactions with their microenvironment, tumor cell survival and growth. In addition, the &#61537;v&#61538;3-integrins appear to be critical for microvessel formation in tumor-induced neoangiogenesis. The present study is the first to investigate the effects of therapeutic &#61537;v&#61538;3-integrin inhibition in a chemically induced tumor model, which largely resembles human colon carcinomas. Methods: Tumor induction was performed in 47 male Sprague-Dawley rats using 1,2 Dimethylhydrazin (21 mg/kg) twice a week. After 20 weeks of tumor induction 100% of the animals developed adenocarcinomas with 14.0+2.1 macroscopic tumor nodules, but no distant metastases. During further tumor induction for additional 10 weeks rats were treated three times/week with (a) 15 mg/kg RGDfV- peptide that can block vitronectin and fibronectin receptors; an equimolar amount of an ineffective cyclic control peptide; or (c) with equimolar amounts of a linear RGDS-peptide. At the end of this treatment period rats were sacrificed, and tumor load was quantified macroscopically and confirmed by histological examination. For investigation of the involvement of tumor-induced neoangiogenesis microvessei density was determined using CD31-immunostaining. Results: After 30 weeks control animals (group B) had 13.3+_4.0 tumors. If rats were treated with RGDfV-peptide (group A) the numbers of tumor nodules was significantly reduced (p<0.005) to a median of 6.6_+3.0 macroscopic tumors which also represented a significant reduction (p<O.OO5) compared to prior to treatment. Application of linear RGDS-peptides (group C) did not affect the numbers of tumor nodules (18.1_+5.6). The diameters of tumor nodules were comparable (3.2-6.1 mm) in animals of all groups. In addition, microvessel density was significantly (p<0.05) reduced in tumors in group A compared to control rats. The major side effect in the treatment group was an increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that &#61537;v&#61538;3-integrin-receptor inhibition appears to be a therapeutic strategy for colorectal cancer. In our therapeutic model late onset of treatment with integrin-blocking peptides resulted in an inhibition of tumor growth and a reduced tumor load which appears to be mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of neoangiogenesis. P698 CHANGES IN PHARMACOKINETICS OF INFUSION formulation of polyethylene glycol-coated liposomes, has demonstrated activity against solid tumors with mild myelosuppression, minimal hair loss and a low risk of cardiotoxicity. For this new form of doxorubicin, a better pharmacokinetic profile than for the administration of free doxorubicin is postulated. It is further postulated, that the exceeding of the water solubility of doxerubicin in the ]iposomes results in a minimal drug-leakage of these long circulating particles. It was the aim of this study, to analyze the plasma levels of encapsulated and free doxorubicin. For this purpose, Caelyx was administered i.v. to patients with various refractory malignancies at doses between 30, 40, 50, and 60 mg/m 2 (doxorubicin HCI equivalent) within one hour, once every 28 days, for as long as patients respond to and tolerate treatment. To answer the question of a possible accumulation of caelyx, plasma and urine analysis was performed on day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 15, 22 and 28 of each cycle. For the quantification of caelyx, doxorubicin, doxorubicinol and 7-deoxy-doxorubicinolon, a wavelength: 470 nm, 550 used. Separation of encapsulated doxorubicin from free doxorubicin levels was performed by the use of a silica absorption method. Quantification of caelyx was done as free doxorubicin after destruction of the liposomes using HCI/ethanol. The limit of detection for doxorubicin and its metabolites was 0.1 ng/ml. The intra- and inter-day accuracy for this assay varied from 5% to 15% (from 10 gg/ml to 0.1 ng/ml, respectively), the precision was in the range of 7%. Up to now, blood and urine samples of 26 patients with 43 pharmacokinetically analyzed courses were enrolled into this study. There is no evidence for an accumulation of the free doxorubicin in plasma up to a dose of 50 mg/m 2 Caelyx every four weeks. The mean terminal half life for Caelyx was calculated to 3 days, clearance was determined to be less than 1 ml/min. The calculated pharmacokinetic parameters for the released doxorubicin gave evidence for an increased area under concentration/time curve (AUC) and mean residence time (MRT), and a decreased Cmax and clearance (CL) in comparison to earlier published pharmacokinetic parameters of conventional applicated free dexorubicin. P699 M. Ocker, C. Herold, Ganslmayer, (Adapalene, ADA) retinoids induce differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation inhibition in different cell systems. The effect of the synthetic retineid ADA on gastrointestinal carcinoma cells in vitro and human skin fibreblasts (Fib) were incubated with 10- 4 to 10-6 M CRA or ADA for 3 to 72 h. Proliferation was assessed using a BrdU- incorporation ELISA, apoptosis by flow-cytometry by 18 cleavage, by determining the breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential (JC-1 staining in FACS analysis) and by Western-blotting. Results: ADA reduced proliferation effectively at 10-5 M and completely stopped BrdU-incorporation at 10-4 M. CRA was only effective at high concentrations. Induction of apoptosis was time- and dose-dependent with a maximum after 48 S 139 New Drugs in Oncology/New Diagnosis and Modalities in Cancer Therapy h. 10-5 M ADA was as effective as 10-4 M CRA. Westen-Blot analysis revealed apoptosis induction via the mitochondrial, bax/bcl-2-dependent, pathway. The decrease of bcl-2-expression was accompanied by breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Expression of p21cip/waf remained unaffected, as was activity of caspase 8. Conclusion: 1) ADA inhibits proliferation of colorectal and hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro. 2) ADA effectively induces apoptosis in these cells. 3) Apoptosis induction is mediated via the mitochindrial way. 4) ADA is well tolerated in vivo and more effective than CRA. 5) The synthetic retinoid ADA could contribute to chemotherapy by BrdU-incorporation.

P700 ENHANCED ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY OF ANTI-VEGF ANTIBODY HUMV833 IN COMBINATION WITH GEMClTABINE THE HUMAN Br0ssel, B; Freemont, CA, USA) Neovascularization is a prerequisite for the growth of solid tumors. Cancer and stromal cells secrete angiogenic factors such as VEGF, which induces neovascularization. Renal cell carcinomas are a tumor type with poor prognosis in which VEGF has been shown to be a predictor of disease progression and prog- nostic indicator. The to VEGF165:1.18\u00b1O.31 x 10-10 M) and has previously been shown to have synergistic effects with the clinical agent gemcitabine in human tumor xenografts. Therefore, we have investigated the antitumor activity of HuMV833 and gemcitabine alone and in combination in the fast growing, highly vascularized human renal cell cancer xenograft RXF 944LX. RXF 944LX is the most angiogenic tumor in a panel of 36 human tumor xenografts, which was examined for vascular permeability (VP), vessel density (VD), and VEGF-expression. Hoechst H33342 staining was 99% (fluorescent fields/100 fields), VP measured by Evans blue extravasation 8.6 % (dose/g tumor), and VEGF levels evaluated by ELISA were 42 pg/#g cellular protein, hence, RXF 944LX had the highest values for all 3 determinants of angiogenesis. RXF 944XL was transplanted subcutaneously into nude mice. Gemcitabine 200 mg/kg was given i.v. on days 1 and 8, and HuMV833 i.p. at 100 #g/mouse every 4 days (days 1,5,9, etc.). These schedules were also used in the combination starting simultaneously or sequentially with a one-day interval. Both agents given alone were able to cause growth inhibition in 4%) and led to marked regressions. Sequential administration of both compounds showed slightly better results than the simultaneous schedule. Thus, our data suggest that gemcitabine can enhance the effects of anti-ang- iogenic therapies. Furthermore, the outcome of this study supports clinical trials in renal cell cancers with HuMV833/gemcitabine in combinations and indicates that the latter could be beneficial for patients with high levels of tumor VEGE P701 TAUROLIDINE - UNDERESTIMATED Freie Objective: Taurolidine, a derivative of the aminosulphonic acid taurine, is known for its antibacterial properties. Furthermore, taurolidine was reported to prevent adhesion of tumor cells to epithelial surfaces following laparoscopic surgery. Taking into account the key role of adhesion in the development of human solid tumors, the present study was initiated to assess the antineoplastic activity of taurolidine in brain tumor cell lines, and to elucidate the mechanism of its cells, and brain cells obtained from rat fetuses at day 15 of gestation were cultured and incubated with 1 #g/ml to 4 mg/ml of taurolidine to investigate cytomorphological and ultrastructural changes. Flow cytometry was performed to assess changes in cell morphology, DNA content, and DNA fragmentation and to determine membrane phosphatidylserine externalization. Results: The studies revealed that an exposure to taurolidine inhibited cell proliferation in each tumor cell line examined. The mean inhibiting concentrations IC50 for the individual cell lines ranged between 5 and 12 #g/ml. Taurolidine induced the concentration - dependent appearance of DNA debris in the sub-Go/ G1 region. Furthermore, a significant increase in the membrane externalization of phosphatidylserine following incubation with taurolidine could be observed. Conclusion: The present findings suggested that taurolidine seems to induce apoptosis in brain tumor cell lines and, via this pathway, has potential antineoplastic activity. P702 EARLY TREATMENT OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED MALIGNANT GLIOMAS WITH TEMOZOLOMIDE: FOLLOW UP OF 16 PATIENTS, D. Koch, N. Hopf, S. Klimpe, T. Hundsberger, Neurochirurgie, Neurologie (Mainz) Objective: Since 1999 Temozolomide has been registered for use in Europe as an oral alkylating agent for the treatment of recurrent gliomas. Due to the high recurrence rate evolving from remaining tumor cells, an early and aggressive therapy of malignant gliomas might be beneficial especially to young patients with a good Karnofsky Performance Scale. Methods: Out of a total of 60 patients 14 patients were treated with Temozolomide in newly diagnosed malignant gliomas anaplastic astrocytomas, 1 anaplastic oligoastrocytoma). In the course of an individual therapeutic concept these patients have received subsequent chemotherapy after complete resection (11) or biopsy (3) and radiotherapy. Temozolomide was administered in a standard dose of 200 mg/m2/d for 5 days in a 28-day cycle. In addition, 2 patients were treated with Temozolomide after partial resection of an anaplastic astrocytoma without prior irradiation. Results: The mean age was 51 years for the patients with GBM and 42 years for those with WHO Ill gliomas. The mean Karnofsky Performance Scale was 80%. So far, the patients have received an average of 5 cycles (3-7) of Temozolomide. We observed only minor therapy related side effects. Four patients showed skin reactions and one case a relevant thrombocytopenia WHO II1. Efficiency was documented with MRI of the brain every three months. The median follow up time was 9 months (6-30). One patient with an anaplastic astrocytoma (partial resection) is still in complete remission after 12 months. Six of the patients with GBM show stable disease with a progression free survival of 13 months (6-30), as well as three of the WHO III glioma patients with 11 months (8-16). Three patients (2 GBM, 1 anaplastic astrocytoma) showed early tumor progression (6 and 9 months and 8 months, respectively). Three patients with GBM died after 6 to 12 months, two of them treated with tumor biopsy and radiotherapy only. Conclusion: Early treatment of malignant gliomas with Temozolomide is feasible and well tolerated, but our small group of patients and short observation time does not allow a final statement regarding efficiency. P703 THE ANTI-IDIOTYPE VACCINE ACA125 INDUCES SPECIFIC AB3 ANTIBOD- IES WHICH MEDIATE ADCC AGAINST CA125-EXPRESSING TUMOR CELLS S. Reinartz, U. a clinical Phase 1/11 trial patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma were treated with the anti-idiotypic antibody ACA125 which mimicks the tumor- associated antigen CA125. The induction of specific anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab3) as a marker for induced immunity has a positive impact on survival. The aim of the present study was to characterize the Ab3 response and to examine antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in CA125-expressing tumor cells mediated by Ab3. Methods: Sera from 26 Ab3-positive patients were analyzed for binding of antibodies (either free or immunocomplexes) to isolated CA125 antigen by ELISA as well as reactivity with CA125-positive (OAW42) versus CA125-negative ovarian cancer cells (SKOV-3) by flow cytometry. Differences in lysis of CA125-positive and - negative cells by PBLs from healthy donors were assessed after addition of heat- inactivated pre- and postimmune sera. Results: The detection of CA125-specific antibodies in patients sera after vaccination revealed the existence of antibodies with different specificity to either isolated CA125 or CA125 on tumor cells. 18 of 26 tested Ab3-positive sera showed specific binding to CA125 on ovarian cancer cells, whereas only weak reactivity with isolated CA125 antigen was observed in 6 cases. However, after dissociation of antibody-antigen complexes by acid/heat-treatment reactivity with isolated antigen was detected in 20 patients. ADCC of CA125-positive cells, but not of CA125-negative ceils, was mediated by postimmune sera from 14 of 26 patients (10,8-50,0% lysis). Only patients with Ab3 binding to CA125-positive cells were able to develop ADCC. By contrast, there was no correlation between reactivity with isolated antigen and ADCC. Conclusions: The anti-idiotype ACA125 induces Ab3 with different specificity to isolated and membran-bound CA125. It seems that in immunized patients Ab3 reactive with shedded CA125 predominantly form complexes with circulating CA125 and are possibly not suitable for ADCC. Apart from this, the vaccine also induces Ab3 binding to CA125 on tumor ceils, which could in fact mediate specific ADCC responses. Thus, ADCC induced by Ab3 might be one possible cytotoxic mechanism of anti-idiotype vaccines. P704 MODIFIED OLIGODESOXYNUCLEOTIDES (MON) AS NEW THERAPEUTIC SUBSTANCES IN A PRECLINICAL PANCREATIC CANCER SYSTEM J. Tepel, C. March, S. Haye, M. Kruse, T. strategies are needed to reduce the high number of local recurrences in patients with pancreatic cancer after R0-resection. We have previously demonstrated the growth inhibitory effect of S 140 New Drugs in Oncology/New Diagnosis and Modalities in Cancer Therapy oligodesoxynucleotides (ON) on human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Our next aim was to select a sequence with a particular high growth inhibitory potential and to achieve a favourable cellular uptake and subcellular distribution by chemical modifications. This ON should then be tested as an adjuvant drug in the treatment of pancreatic cancer in vivo. Material and Methods: Cell proliferation and rate of apoptosis were tested in vitro by colorimetric and 3H-Thymidine-assays, the cellular uptake by confocal Laser- microscopy and FACS. For in vivo an orthotopic xenograft model in SCID-mice. Results: The comparative in vitro analyses of different modified 15mer ON showed the most efficient growth inhibition (-95%) and highest induction of apoptosis (- 65%) in various human pancreatic cancer cellines for a sequence called EVITON. The cellular uptake and intracellular distribution depended significantly on 3\"/5\"- terminal chemical modifications. Especially ON conjugated with tocopherol were superior to unmodified ON. In the animal model there appeared severe side effects at a dose of 18mg/KG. Beginning at a dose of 3mg/KG we noticed an up to fourfold enlargement of the spleen. A dose reduction to lmg/KG showed a decrease of tumor growth versus the control group of only 5%. However, at 3 and 6mg/KG we observed a significant reduction of pancreatic tumor weight (60%) and total tumor weight (50%) including pancreatic and metastatic tumor. Different application regimes (continuous versus interval) had no influence on the tumor growth inhibition. Summary: Modified ON can inhibit pancreatic tumor cell proliferation very efficiently and induce apoptosis in vitro, even in cellines which are highly resistant to death receptor mediated apoptosis. Conjugation with tocepherol improves the cellular uptake and subcellular distribution compared to unmodified ON. The tumor growth inhibitory effect in vivo is significant but may be accompanied by severe side effects at very high doses. Currently, a resection-model (R0/R1) has been established in orthotopic xenografted SCID-mice which allows a further approximation to the adjuvant situation in the clinical practice. P705 COBALT-ACETYLENE COMPLEXES: A NEW CLASS OF CYTOSTATICS WITH HIGH ACTIVITY AGAINST HUMAN BREAST CANCER CELLS I. Ott, B. Kircher, K. Schmidt, R. Gust, Freie Universit~t Berlin, (Berlin; Innsbruck, A) The cobalt-acetylene complex hexacarbonyl[2-propinylacetylsalicylate]dicobalt (Co- ASS) has previously been shown to have strong cytotoxic effects on adherent MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell lines with IC50 0.9 IJM, respectively [1]. To get more information about the selectivity further studies were performed on SD-1 myeloid leukemia) cell lines cultured in suspension. Furthermore, peripheral blood cells obtained from patients with acute myeloid leukemia were used. The cytotexic activity of Co-ASS was determined in concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 25 IJM. The effects were much lower compared with those at the breast cancer cell lines. Structural related complexes (hexacarbonyl[prop-2-in- 1 -ol]dicobalt, hexacarbonyl[diphenylacetylene]dicobalt) were investigated in the same in-vitro assays on the leukemia and lymphoma cell lines and showed also poor anti- proliferative activity. IC50 for the complexes were found between 12.3 and 25.51JM or were higher than the tested concentrations. Solubility studies on the active compound Co-ASS by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GF-AAS) showed a constant cobalt concentration in cell culture medium over a period of 8 days. Therefore, the discrepancy between activity against adherent and low activity against suspended cancer cells can net be due to sedimentation of Co-ASS on the adherent cell lines. A difference in physicochemical properties and cellular accumulation of the compounds or a specific mode of drug action can be considered. literature: If] K. Schmidt, M. Jung, R Keilitz, Inorg. Chim. P706 BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF A CLUSIANON-DERIVATIVE AS A NOVEL COMPOUND WITH POTENT ANTITUMORAL ACTIVITY D. Diaz-Carballo, R.A. Hilger, B. Strumberg, S. Seeber, Universitg.tskinderklinik Essen, Universit~.tsklinikum Essen (Essen) A complex extract derived from Caribbean Propolis was shown to have significant antitumoral activity in vivo in a mouse model. We used a semi preparative column packed with Nucleesil 100-7 C18 in an RP-HPLC to isolate several cytotoxic fractions from this extract by a gradient system. One of the cytotoxic fractions could be identified as a clusianon-derivative (CLU-X), a new compound with a potent cytotoxic effect on a wide variety of human tumor cell lines in vitro. A high grade of purity of this substance could be demonstrated using PDA spectroscopic analysis. The cytetoxic activity of CLU-X was then analyzed by SRB proliferation assay in a panel of non-tumoral (fibroblasts) and tumor cell lines of different histology (e.g. breast, stomach, lung, colon and ovarian carcinoma) both wild type and resistant to cisplatinum, doxorubicine, 5FU, SN38 and etoposide. Considering the IC50 obtained between wild type and the respective resistant sub lines, no cross-resistance of CLU-X to the above-mentioned cytotoxic drugs was found. In contrast to the tumor cell lines analyzed, human and mouse ffbroblasts demonstrated a high level of resistance to CLU-X. In several biological assays we were able to determine possible mechanisms of action of CLU-X. The telomerase activity in HCT8WT colon carcinoma cells analyzed by TRAP-ELISA assay was completely inhibited at 10-fold the IC5O of CLU-X. The activity of topoisomerase- I determined by relaxation assay from nuclear extracts of H460WT bronchial carcinoma was also inhibited at 20-fold the respective IC5O. Quantitative analysis of DNA isolated from HT29WT colon carcinoma cells, previously labeled with thymidin C14 and separated on agarose gels, showed a exposure to 1g-fold IC50 of CLU-X. In addition, a depletion of the S-phase in HCT8WT cells 24h after exposure to 1-fold IC5O of CLU-X using flow cytometric cell cycle analysis was detected. Finally, an increase of phosphoryiation of ERK1/2 (downstream signaling elements of the Ras/MAPK pathway) could be shown by Western Blot analysis of CLU-X treated HCT8WT cells. Conclusions: The clusianon-derivative CLU-X is a novel antitumoral compound with potent cytotoxic activity in a broad panel of tumor cells in vitro. Possible mechanisms of action are telomerase inhibition, topoisomerase-I inhibition and effects on the Ras/MAPK pathway. CLINICAL PHASE I STUDY OF THE MITOXANTRONE-DERIVATIVE BBR 3576 IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED SOLID TUMORS (A STUDY WITH THE PAR- TICIPATION OF CESAR-EWIV) K. Mross, M. three-center open phase I study of the mitoxantrone- derivative BBR 3576 was performed in 27 patients with advanced solid tumors without established systemic treatment option to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose-limiting toxicity (DLr). Secondary objectives included the evaluation of the toxicity profile and the time of recovery, the evaluation of the pharmacokinetics, the description of any evidence for antitumor efficacy and the recommendation of the dose of BBR 3576 suitable for phase 11 studies. The starting dose was 1 mg/m 2 and was increased up to 150 mg/m 2 in 9 steps according to an accelerated dose escalation scheme based on the safety profile of BBR 3576 assessed by the NCl Common Toxicity Criteria grading system (NCl- CTC). Vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters, ECGs, and adverse events were evaluated for safety assessment. The 27 Caucasian patients (12 females/15 males) were between 32 and 74 years old (median: 60 years) and had colorectal cancer (n=10), breast cancer (n=3), lung cancer (n=3), esophageal cancer (n=2), stomach cancer (n=2), ovarian cancer (n=2) and other solid tumors. The general tolerability of BBR 3576 was good. The leading toxicity was granulocytopenia with a nadir around day 14 after application of BBR 3576 which first appeared at the 90 mg/m 2 level (grade I]0. Of the 6 patients treated with the highest dose (150 mg/m 2) 1 patient had grade Ill and 2 patients grade IV granulocytopenia. There was only one grade III nonhematological toxicity in form of stomatitis in 1 patient at 150 mg/ m 2. All toxic side effects resolved spontaneously and without sequelae. Four applications of BBR 3576 was the highest number of treatment cycles (q 28 days)in 1 female patient with stabilization of stomach cancer on the 90 mg/m 2 level. Doses higher than 150 mg/m 2 were not investigated and it was decided to further investigate BBR 3576 on this dose level in phase II studies. P708 PHASE I-STUDY OF ONCOGEL - A NEW DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR THE LOCAL APPLICATION OF CYTOTOXlC AGENTS C. Oberhoff, U. D. Rohr, U. D. Rohr, M. E. Scheulen, R. A. Hilger, G. M. Zentner, J. C. McRea, A. E. Schindler, Universit~itsklinikum Essen, MacroMed inc. (Essen, Sandy Utah) In order to reduce systemic side effects of anticancer drug therapy, the development of selective anticancer drugs is one of the most important aims in oncology. Oncogel is a unique delivery system that allows a slow, continuous release of paclitaxel (Genexol) from the ReGel vehicle over a prolonged period (> 6 weeks). ReGel is a biodegradable triblock copolymer consisting of poly(lacitde-eo- glycolide)(PLGA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). ReGel is a free flowing, injectable liquid at temperatures between 0-15\u00b0C. After injection into the body, the liquid warms rapidly to form a semi-solid gel. Intralesional injection of QncoGel provides high concentrations of paclitaxel within the tumor tissue. Preclinical data demonstrate antitumor activity in several solid malignant tumors (breast, cervical, ovarian cancer). Within a phase I-study we evaluated toxicity and efficacy of OncoGel in patients with breast cancer and skin metastases. Beginning with a starting dose of 0,06 mg/cm3 paclitaxel, a dose-escalation was done within 4 dose-levels. 12 patients were treated with a simple and indolent injection of Oncogel into a local tumor side. After a period of 60 days no local or systemic side effects were observed. Several patients received multiple injections. OncoGel provides a new treatment modality for the therapy of superficial solid malignant tumors. The results of our phase I-study demonstrate, that OncoGel use can be regarded as safe, precise and predictable and can be administered in superficially accessible solid tumor nodules. More data are necessary to evaluate the role of QncoGel in clinical oncology. S 141 New Drugs in Oncology/New Diagnosis and Modalities in Cancer Therapy / Gene Therapy/Molecular Pathology PTO9 CLINICAL PHASE II STUDY OF METHOTREXAT COVALENTLY BOUND TO HUMAN SERUM ALBUMIN (MTX-HSA) IN FIRST LINE CHEMOTHERAPY OF PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA (A STUDY WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF CESAR-EWlV) M. Scheulen, U. Gatzemeier, J. v. Pawel, Kaukel, K. Mross, G. Hartung, bound to human serum albumin. According to the results of phase I studies (Hartung et al., Proc. Amer. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 19, 217a leukopenia, hepatic toxicity and stomatitis. Antitumor efficacy could be demonstrated in renal cancer and malignant mesothelioma. Thus, MTX- HSA was studied in a phase II trial in patients with malignant mesothelioma of the pleura or peritoneum unresectable or not amenable to radiation therapy as first line chemotherapy by weekly i.v. infusion of 50 mg/m 2. Intervals were prolonged in case of grade 1 thrombopenia, increase of bilirubin or stomatitis or grade 2 leukopenia according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria grading system (NCI- CTC). Aims of the study were the determination of its efficacy in terms of objective response (PR/CR) or stable disease for more than 6 months (NC>6mths) as well as safety and investigation of pharmacokinetics. Within less than one year 29 patients were entered into the study and recruitment was finished. Weekly MTX-HSA was generally well tolerated with 2% grade 3 and 12% grade 4 thrombopenia and 10% grade 3 and 2% grade 4 stomatitis occurring after a mean treatment time of 6 weeks. Lower grade rare side effects included nausea, anorexia, fatigue and elevation of transaminases. All toxic side effects resolved spontaneously and without sequelae. According to the long-term follow-up of 4 patients up to 4 years in the phase I study there is no indication of cumulative or late toxicity. Up to now, 23/29 patients underwent at least one tumor assessment after 8-12 weeks demonstrating 1 PR and 1 MR (minor response) and 11 patients with NC>3mths while 6 patients experienced early PD within the first 2 months. Time to progression is in the range of 0.7 to 6.2+ months (mean 3.5 months, median 4.3 months). In conclusion, weekly MTX-HSA is a well tolerated outpatient treatment for patients with advanced malignant mesothelioma which may be suitable for combination chemotherapy. Gene Therapy/Molecular Pathology Oral Presentation O710 CENTROSOME INSTABILITY OCCURS IN CARCINOMAS M. Goettingen (Bethesda, USA; Goettingen) Colorectal cancer cell lines can distinguished into a diploid, MMR-deficient and an aneuploid, MMR-proficient group. In order to understand the cytogenetic differ- ences and to elucidate possible mechanisms leading to these groups we have applied CGH, SKY and performed centrosome stains as well as pharmacological experiments investigating the function of centrosomes. Aneuploid tumors, most of which carried a p53 mutation, revealed 63 times more numerical and approx. more than 5 times the number of structural chromosome aberrations as the diploid cell lines. Such a pattern indicates a severe impairment of chromosome segregation fidelity. We find that all aneuploid cell lines show elevated numbers of centrosomes as demonstrated by gamma-tubulin staining whereas the diploid cells reveal the same numbers as control fibroblasts. In nocadozole wash-out experiments, we could demonstrate that diploid cell lines reveal a regrowth pattern which resembles that of fibroblasts whereas aneuploid cells widely failed to regrow indicating a functional deficit in these cancers. Incubation with the microtubule depolymerizing drug griseofulvin demonstrated that aneuploid cell lines are much more sensitive than diploid cell lines. Concentrations of 2.5 IJg/ml inhibited any successful mitoses in 24 hrs in aneuploid cell lines. These observa- tions imply that impairment of centrosome function causes aneuploidy in colorectal cancer cell lines and differentiates them from diploid, MMR-deficient cell lines. Therefore it is suggestive that two different pathways are involved in the devel- opment of colorectal cancers, opening a new field of therapeutical options. O711 PROLONGED SURVIVAL OF SCID of HSV-Tk-gene transfer and GCV prodrug therapy is an intensively studied strategy. However, very little studies focus on pancreatic carcinomas which are well known for their very dismal prognosis. We investigated the efficiency of GCV treatment of retroviral in vitro HSV-Tk-gene- transduced human pancreatic tumor cells in Two human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell Panc89 and PancTUI, were infected with a VSV-G-pseudotyped retrovirus containing the HSV-Tk gene. Level of HSV-Tk expression was detected by WB-analysis. Sensitivity of HSV-Tk- cell clones to GCV treatment was tested in 3H-Thymidine-assays and in PI- FACS-analyses. To study the in vivo effectiveness orthotopic tumors were established in SCID mice. The tumors contained either 100% HSV-Tk-transduced cells or 90% of wt-cells were coinoculated with 10% HSV-Tk-transduced cells. As a control group established tumors were only transduced with EGFP-vector. 7d after orthotopic injection of the tumor cells, treatment was started with GCV (62mg/kg) by i.p. application for 21d. After treatment was finished half of the animals were sacrificed to study tumor size and histology and the other half were analysed for survival without further treatment. Results: In WB-analysis both clones were shown to express equal levels of HSV- Tk. However, studying effectiveness of GCV 50% lethal dose (LD5O) in Panc89-Tk (LD50=0.01 [JM) be 100-fold lower than LDS0 in PancTUI-Tk (LD50=I pM). Average tumor size after 21d of GCV treatment was 307-398mm3 in PancTUI tumors and 4-207mm3 in Panc89 tumors, whereas lower values represent 100% HSV-Tk-transduced tumors, in survival analysis median survival times for 100% Panc89-Tk tumors was 84d, in 10% Panc89-Tk tumors 49d (log rank p<0.001). In 100% PancTUI-Tk median survival and in these two orthotopic pancreatic tumor models the HSV-tk/GCV treatment strategy proved to be effective in decreasing tumor growth and prolonging survival of the treated animals. Additionally, our results have been achieved in immunocompromised hosts whereby in a clincal setting an immunological bystander effect may improve the outcome of this strategy. However, futher investigations have to prove effectiveness of our studied therapy concept using in vivo infection of the tumors. O712 CLONING OF RECOMBINANT PRIMARY HUMAN T-CELLS FOR AN ANTIGEN- SPECIFIC IMMUNE GENE THERAPY P. Dall, G. RSder, metastasising cervical and ovarian cancers. Tumour cells expressing CD44v7/8 should be killed by genetically modified cytotoxic T-cells with an antigen-specificity against CD44v7/8. Using recombinant T-cell lines and primary T-cells the in vitro and in vivo functionality of the chimeric receptor (scFv(VFF17):alpha:zeta) was shown in a murine system. The chimeric receptor contains of a single chain fragement specific for CD44v7/8, the CD8alpha-hinge-region and the zeta-chain of the TCR/CD3. in animal experiments 70% turnout reduction could be achieved. Aim of this study was to check functionality of recombinant primary human T- cells. Methods: We used ecotropic retroviruses to transduce the murine packaging cell line PG13. The resulting amphotropic retroviruses were used for transduction of primary human T-lymphocytes. optimise transduction rates, primary T-cells were incubated with anti-CD3/CD28 prior to infection in presence of recombinant fibronectin. Gene transfer efficiency was evaluated by flow cytometry and gene expression by RT-PCR. Surface Iocalisation of the chimeric receptor was shown by FACS-analysis and T-cell/target-cell binding was determined by the rosetting test. Results: In PG13 cells stable integration, expression, and cell surface Iocalisation of the chimeric receptor was shown by RT-PCR and FACS-analysis, respectively. Optimising retrovirus infection gene transfer rates of 65% could be obtained in primary human T4ymphocytes. The transfer of the chimeric receptor gene revealed lower gene transduction rates. In infected cells transcription of the chimeric receptor could be detected by RT-PCR, but cell surface Iocalisation could not be shown via FACS-analysis or rosetting test. Conclusions: In contrast to the routine system and despite efficient gene transfer rates only weak transcription of the chimeric receptor was detected in primary human T-cells. Absence of the antigen-specific activity of the recombinant T-cells might be explained by failures in translation and further processing of the chimeric receptor. O713 PAM-1, A NEW HUMAN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY SPECIFIC FOR PRECAN- CEROUS AND CANCEROUS EPITHELIAL LESIONS I. Beyer, requires reagents and targets, which are specific for the disease. Furthermore, tumour-associated antigens should be closely related to tumour-specific behaviour like metastasis formation and uncontrolled growth. Most so far described molecules used as targets in histological analysis and clinical trials are differentiation antigens, which are qualitatively far away from specific tumour targets. In addition, most of the antibodies used in therapeutical studies are murine, chimeric or humanised and do also not represent ideal tools. Conventional Human hybridoma technology offers the unique possibility to gene- rate new fully human monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis and therapy and to characterise new tumour related membrane receptors within one experimental approach. Lymph node B-cells from patients with stomach carcinomas were immortalised by fusion to the heteromyeloma HAB1/X. Resulting monoelonal S 142 Gene Therapy/Molecular Pathology antibodies were firstly tested immunohistochemically on autologous tissue and then for specificity and function on a panel of malignant and healthy tissues. The corresponding receptors were isolated biochemically from membrane extracts and sequenced using MALDI technique. For functional analysis MFr, Cell-Death and Cyto-Death assays were used. A new 130 kD variant of CFR-1 (cysteine-rich fibroblast growth factor receptor) was detected by the human monoclonal antibody PAM-1 (Clone 103/51). The epitope was determined to be a N-linked carbohydrate side chain. CFR-1 is highly homologous to MG-160 and ESL-1, which are ubiquitously expressed on human tissues. However, the human antibody PAM-1 reacts with a variant of CFR-1, which is only expressed on human epithelial tumours and carcinoma precursors like gastritis, metaplasia, dysplasia (stomach) and adenomas (colon). Furthermore, expression of CFR-1 correlates with proliferation rate and increases with grade of malignancy. The fully human monoclonal antibody PAM-1, isolated from a patient with a stomach carcinoma, identifies a new proliferation marker, specifically expressed on precancerous and cancerous epithelial cells. The unique expression of this new molecule CFR-1 as a tumour marker offers not only the possibility to study specific proliferation processes of malignant and premalignant cells but is also of diagnostic and therapeutical value. O714 CHROMOSOMAL IMBALANCES DETECTED BY COMPARATIVE GENOMIC HYBRIDISATION (CGH) OCCUR IN PANCREATIC CANCER BUT NOT IN PANCREATITIS C. Schleicher, C. Poremba, H. is regarded as a potential preneoplasia for pancreatic cancer. However to date no molecular biological data are available to support this hypothesis. The objective of the present study was to investigate pancreatic adenocarcinomas of different stages and tissue from chronically inflamed pancreas for analogous genomic alterations. DNA was isolated from deparaffinised tissue of ductal (n=20) and mucinous (n=7) as from chronically inflamed pancreas (n=7). Tumours were classified according to the UICC guidelines from 1997. DNA from neoplastic or pancreatitic tissue samples were hybridised with normal reference DNA on unaltered metaphase chromosomes. Subsequent discrepancies between sample and reference DNA were classified as gains or losses respectively. Tissue samples consisted of at least 70 % malignant cells (pancreatic cancer) or ductal epithelia (chronic pancreatitis). Genomic imbalances were detected in 23 (85%) carcinomas of the pancreas in 2 or more chromosomal regions. Losses were observed more frequently (n=69) than gains (n=43). Deletions were found most frequently in lp (61%), chromosome 22 (57%) and 19 (44%), correlation between type or number of detected genomic alterations pN1), No genomic imbalances were detected in any of samples from patients with chronic pancreatitis. The identified chromosomal regions which contained the detected genetic alterations represent potential loci for new target genes, which seem to be of biological significance in the initiation and progression of adenocarcinomas of the pancreas. Since all relevant alterations could be detected in early as well as advanced tumour stages, detected genomic alterations can be regarded as early events in the tumorigenesis and progression of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. In contrast such imbalances do not seem to play e role in chronic inflammatory alterations of ductal epithelia. Therefore our findings do not support the hypothesis that chronic pancreatitis is a precursor lesion for pancreatic cancer. Poster P715 CAR IS A CELL-CELL ADHESION PROTEIN IN OVARIAN AND CERVICAL CANCER AND MODIFIES integrins and their influence on adenoviral gene transfer was characterized. Methods: A panel of four ovarian cancer cell lines and Hela cells was analyzed for subcellular localization of CAR and integrins by co-immunofluorescence and confocal laser image analysis. For determing a beta-galactosidase (AdGal)-expressing adenovirus was Immunofluorescence analysis revealed an evenly distributed punctate staining of CAR on singular cancer cells or on cancer cells forming no cell-cell contacts. In cellular aggregates, CAR was found to be highly enriched at cell-cell adhesion sites. No CAR expression was found at cell-matrix adhesions which stained positive for integrins. Dissociation of cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts by short trypsinization was followed by loss of focal enrichment and lead to an overall even membrane distribution with enhanced colocalization of CAR and integrins. This condition significantly increased adenoviral transgene expression. Conclusion: Enriched localization of CAR at cell-cell contacts and of integrins at cell-matrix adhesions can interfere with adenovira] gene transfer into ovarian and cervical cancer cells. The release of CAR from its confinement to cell-cell adhesions could result in more efficient adenoviral gene therapy with a potential for clinical trials. P716 ADENOVIRUS TARGETING STRATEGIES FOR VIRAL ONCOLYSIS AND GENE THERAPY OF MELANOMA D.M. Nettelbeck, A.A. Rivera, D.T. Curiel, University of Alabama at Birmingham (Birmingham, USA) Gene therapy and the recently established concept of virotherapy represent promising novel strategies to fight cancer. In this regard, adenovirus offers sev- eral advantages as gene transfer vector or oncolytic virus. These include the systemic stability of adenoviruses, their highly evolved gene transfer machinery, and the ease of virus production at high titers. Nevertheless, clinical applications require the development of advanced vectors capable of efficient and selective gene transfer to disseminated disease in vivo. Fortunately, adenoviruses are well characterized, thus allowing for molecular modeling of the virus for vector optimization. We superimposed molecular target- ing strategies on adenovirus at two levels: (i) capsid modification to alter the viral tropism (transductional targeting) and (ii) incorporation of cellular, tumor-specific promoters into the viral genome for selective gene expression (transcriptional targeting). Transductional re-targeting of adenovirus infection to tumor cells was achieved by engineering bispecific molecules, which bind to the adenovirus cap- sid and to a surface marker on target cells. We could demonstrate specific adenoviral infection of melanoma cells mediated by a novel second generation recombinant targeting molecule. The concept of transcriptional targeting was applied to develop a melanoma-targeted oncolytic adenovirus. We incorporated an optimized tyrosinase enhancer/promoter into the adenoviral genome to drive melanoma-specific expression of an essential adenoviral gene. This strategy resulted in e conditionally replicating adenovirus with specific cytotoxicity for melanoma cells. Specificity of virus replication for melanoma was shown to be 100- to 1000-fold. The combination of transductional and transcriptional targeting within one virus will further increase the specificity of adenovJrus as gene transfer vector or oncolytic agent. Capitalizing on novel technologies for the determination of tumor signatures, the described vector targeting strategies should benefit the development of effective clinical applications of gene therapy of cancer and viral oncolysis. P717 NEW HUMAN MONOCLONAL IGM ANTIBODIES ISOLATED FROM CARCI- NOMA PATIENTS AS DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC TOOLS S. Br~indlein, F. Hensel, J. Lorenz, be ideal adjuvant therapeutical reagents for all kinds of diseases. Polyvalent (crosslinking) and low mutated IgM antibodies (less immunogeneic) are believed to be the most effective weapons against cancer. The best source for these types of antibodies is the cancer patient itself. Using conventional hybridoma technique, not only fully human monoclonal tgM antibodies are isolated, but also new targets are identified by the same experi- mental approach. The resulting antibodies can be used directly for therapeutical purposes without further modulation and manipulation. B-cells from patients with carcinomas of colon, pancreas and lung were isolated from lymph nodes and immortalised by fusion to the heteromyeloma HAB-1/X. Resulting human monoclonal antibodies were tested initially on autologous tumour tissue and tumour reacting antibodies were further tested on panels of malignant and healthy tissues to determine the specificity. Antibodies were blotted on cell extracts to charactedse the targets and tested in functional assays for cytostatic/ toxic activities. We have generated and characterised five new human monoclonal IgM's. The mainly germ-line coded IgM antibodies CM-1 and CM-2 (colon), PM-1 and PM-2 (pancreas) and LM-1 (lung) are specific for malignant tissues and show only restricted reactivity with healthy cells. Biochemical analysis to determine the corresponding receptors are underway. Tested for functional in vitro activity, human antibody CM-1 inhibits tumour cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. Adjuvant treatment of cancer with monoclonal antibodies requires new antibodies and new targets. By using classical human hybridoma technique we have established five new human monoclonal IgM antibodies from patients with diffe- rent cancers. All five antibodies show a tumour restricted reactivity pattern and at least one antibody (CM1) induces apoptosis. This shows that carcinoma patients have an anti tumour B-cell immunity and manifest tumours are not a matter of quality but most likely of quantity of humoral immunity. P718 ANALYSIS OF TUMOR IMMUNOGENICITY, STRESS PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PHAGOCYTOSIS OF PARVOVIRUS HI-INFECTED HUMAN CELLS M. Heike, I. Med. Klinik, DKFZ (Mainz, Heidelberg) Mechanisms for unlimited tumor growth are the reduced apoptotic tumor cell death rate and immunologic escape mechanisms. The parvovirus H-1 preferentially replicates in and kills in vitro-transformed cells and reduces the incidence of spontaneous and implanted tumors in animals. We showed that H1 induced S 143 Gene Therapy/Molecular Pathology apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, but not primary hepatocytes (Moehler et al. Cancer Gene Ther. 2001). Due to these natural oncotropic and oncolytic properties H1 is a potential antitumor vector. Because these HI-induced cell lysatea may also activate a tumor directed immune response it is of notable interest to understand the immune reaction against H1 and HI-infected tumor cells. Methods: After HI-infection of human melanoma cells we analysed tumor cell death rate, expression of MHC, T cell costimulatory molecules and potentially immunogenic heat shock proteins. Futhermore, phagocytosis of HI-infected cells by immature dendritic cells was investigated by confocal laser microscopy. Results: All melanoma cells but not dendritic cells, T cells and B-cells were susceptible to H1 virus-induced cell death. 3 days after HI-infection melanoma ce]l number was reduced to less than 10%. Cell death correlated with H1 DNA replication and protein expression (Luciferase assay, Western) and with morphological features of apoptosis (Annexin by FACScan). Tumor cell expression of MHC-I, CD80, CD86 and stress protein HSC70 was net influenced by HI- infection. However, HI-infected tumor cell lysates induced HSP70 secretion into cell media. Phagocytosis of tumor cell lysates by APC was demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Discussion: HI-induced tumor cell lysis may induce a tumor-directed immune response via release of stress proteins by HI-infected cells and via phagocytosis of HI-infected cells by APCs. The observation that dendritic cells and T cells are not susceptible for Hl-virus induced cell death is an additional precondition for the tumor-directed immune response against HI-infected tumor cells. P719 DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION OF SURVIVIN SPLICE VARIANTS IN HUMAN RENAL CELL CARCINOMA novel member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (lAP) family, reduces the susceptibillity of tumor cells to proapoptotic stimuli, thereby promoting tumor cell survival during tumor progression and treatment with anticancer drugs. Recently, we identified two novel alternative splice variants of survivin, i.e. survivin-2B and survivin-deltaEx3, differing in their antiapoptotic properties. Thus, survivin-2B has lost its antiapoptotic potential and may act as a naturally occurring antagonist of antiapoptotic survivin and survivin-deltaEx3. Because the in vivo expression of these splice variants in human cancer has not been analyzed so far, 57 renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) were explored using Real-Time quantitative RT-PCR. We obtained results: 1. All RCCs expressed survivin-deltaEx3, survivin-2B, and survivin, the latter being the dominant transcript. 2. Comparing early and intermate stages with late stages of clear cell RCC, survivin and survivin-deltaEx3 remained unchanged, whereas expression of survivin-2B significantly decreased in late tumor stages. 3. Chromophillic/papillary RCCs, which are known to be less ag- gressive than clear cell RCCs, did not show significantly lower expression levels of antiapoptotic survivin and survivin-deltaEx3, when compared to stage adjusted clear cell RCCs. In conclusion our study demonstrates for the first time in vivo expression of functionally different survivin variants and suggests an important role of survivin-2B in the progression of human RCCs. P720 ANTITUMORAL EFFECTS OF A CONTINUOUS GENE THERAPY WITH THE GENES CODING FOR IL12, IL2, GAMMA-IFN AND B7.1 IN MICE TUMORS A. Dietrich, U. Brinckmann, C. Stockmar, A. ML~ller, M. SchSnfelder, Universit&t Leipzig (Leipzig) Introduction: Advanced tumors remain to have o poor prognosis. Cytocine gene transfer into tumor cells is known to be able to initiate tumor regression and to have antimetastatic effects in several animal models as well as in human trails. We established a mice - tumor model to investigate the effects of continuous cancer gene therapy, including APC - engineering and local stimulation of the immune system. Material and methods: The murine genes coding for Gamma-IFN and B7.1 (or IL12p35 and ]L12p40) were cloned in an expression plasmid (pRSC) with two multiple cloning sites. In addition we used a plasmid containing the gene for rolL2. Experiments were performed in C57/BL6 mice. B16 melanoma or Lewis lung carcinoma cells were injected intradermaly on the back. The overlaying dermis or the tumor were shot with a Gene Gun (particle mediated gene transfer) every fourth day sudden death, starting eight days after tumour implantation. Control groups were mice without any therapy (A) or gene therapy as described above with the empty pRSC plasmid (B). Therapy groups: 12: IL2, Day 16: Start as day ...; Group D: Day 8: Gamma-iFN/B7.1, Day 12: .... Results: B16 Melanoma: Mean survival time Differences to the control groups are significant. The tumor growth was reduced in all therapy groups (C and D significant). Lewis Lung carcinoma: Significant enhanced survival and a reduced tumor growth were only seen in the group receiving the genes coding for IL12 and IL2. Control groups for both tumors suffered a higher rate of pulmonary and liver metastasis. Also there were less inflammatory cells at the tumour site. Discussion: Continuous therapy with the Gene Gun is easy to handle and shows very good results. Therapy with IL12 and IL2 was superior compared with additio- nal Gamma-IFN/B7.1 or Gamma-IFN/B7.1 alone. Obviously APC-engineering is less sufficient in case of these tumors, known to be poor antigenic. P721 ANTISENSE STRATEGIES AND RELATED MECHANISMS: NEW C.B. Heise, EG.E. Perabo, Oncology World GmbH (Planegg) Although the inherited genetic diseases are an obvious target for gene therapy approaches, most gene transfer clinical protocols submitted for regulatory review to date have involved patients with cancer. Since oligonucleotides can theoreti- cally be targeted to any nucleic acid or protein sequence, an increase in the number of therapeutic antisense drugs targeting cancer is likely. However it is not only the target to consider but new approaches in antisense strategy to achieve successful treatment. Despite widely used backbone modifications like Oligonucieotides which cause enzymes like RNase P or RNase L to destroy the targeted mRNA are in development. To avoid exonuclease activity in vivo and to increase likelihood for binding multiple targets covalently closed multiple eligonucleotides are used. The same aim can be achieved with ribbon-type antisense oligonucleotides which consist of two loops containing antisense se- quences and one stem connecting the two loops. Masked antisense oligonucleotides are designed structured molecules in which the bulk of the antisense sequence is masked by partially complementary sequence in a hairpin structure and becomes available for hybridization only after a highly specific nucleation reaction with a short stretch of the RNA target. Ribozymes bind to substrate RNA through Watson-Crick base pairing just like antisense oligonucleotides, which offers sequence-specific cleavage of phosphodiester linkages without the aid of protein-based enzymes. The term RNA interference (RNAi) describes the use of double-stranded RNA to target specific mRNAs for degradation, thereby silencing their expression. This contribution highlights these strategies with focus on different gene-targets in precllnical and clinical investigation. P722 OVEREXPRESSION OF MTA1 PROMOTES TUMOR CELL MIGRATION AND A. K. Giehl, Universitaet UIm (UIm) The member of the nucleosome-remodeiling and -deacetylation complex (NuRD) that is in charge of transcriptional repression. Several studies demonstrated a correlation between the expression of MTA1 and the metastatic behaviour of breast, oesophageal and gastrointestinal carcinomas, suggesting that this protein might play an important role in tumor invasion and metastasis. To study mechanisms by which MTA1 contributes to metastasis, we constructed cell lines derived from the human ductal pancreatic carcinoma cell line PANC-1 exhibiting stable over-expression green fluorescent protein)-rat MTA1 fusion protein. EGFP- MTA1 was exclusively found in the nucleus of transfected cells, whereas EGFP resided mainly in the cytosol. Compared to EGFP-expressing cells, EGFP-MTA1- overexpressing PANC-1 cells showed markedly enhanced (i) cell migration in modified Boyden chamber assays and (ii) invasive behaviour when placed on the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken eggs. On the other hand, cell proliferation of EGFP-MTA1 clones was reduced when compared to controls. Although the mitogen- activated protein kinase ERK2 is important for the control of proliferation and migration of PANC-1 cells (Giehl et al., Oncogene (2000),19;2930), the activity of ERK2 remained unchanged in EGFP-MTA1 overexpressing cells, indicating that MTA1 is not involved in regulating this kinase. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis of EGFP- and EGFP-MTAl-expressing cells revealed a different subcellular Iocalisation directly or indirectly alters the expression and/or subcellular Iocalisation of various cytoskeletal components, which in turn leads to increased cellular mobility. Therefore, upregulation of MTA1 levels in tumor cells may be a major step to the induction of metastasis. P723 CHARACTERISATION OF Hildenbrand, A.M, Burger, E. Tetling, H.H. Biology Center at the University Gmbh Institute for Experi- mental Oncology (Freiburg) Cachexia is a common characteristic of a variety of cancers, which can not be explained by reduced food intake or anorexia and 30% of cancer deaths can be attributed to this paraneoplastic syndrome. Moreover, cachexia limits quality of life, response to chemotherapy, and survival time. Nonetherless, the molecular basis of the disease is poorly understood and approved therapies are not avail- able. The Freiburg human tumor xenograft panel comprises a collection of 350 patient- derived tumors which grow in nude mice. 10% of the latter, mainly cancers of the cervix, lung, pancreas and kidney are capable of inducing cachexia. Here we examined the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-lb, TNF- a and INF-g and their use for therapeutic intervention in 5 s.c. growing renal cancer (RCC) xenografts and cell lines derived thereof which show xenografts were transplanted s.c. into nude mice and grown until a body weight loss of 20% or tumor burden of 1.5g occurred. Tumor tissue, and plasma were S 144 Gene Therapy/Molecular Pathology collected as well as 24h conditioned media from lx107 exponentially growing cells. Cytokine levels were determined using ELISA kits specific for the human proteins. High IL-6 levels were found in all renal tumor specimens in concentra- tions up to 27ng/ml. TNF-a was analyzed in supernatants, were not measurable and IL-lb was only found in the conditioned media of non-cachectic RXF631L cells. Thus, TNF-a appears to be the only cytokine examined which is discriminative for cachexia and could be considered a therapeutic target. Since TNF-a has been reported to upregulate cyclooxigenase2 (COX2) and to be involved in cachexia, COX2 inhibitory and p.o.) for their potential to reduce cachexia-induced body weight loss (BWL) in RXF393 bearing nude mice. Interestingly, we found that both agents were able to prevent severe BWL (20%) for 5-10d despite progressive tumor growth. Moreover, nimesulide, the most potent agent, seems capable of reducing TNF-a levels -8- fold compared to vehicle controls. Our data indicate that TNF-a protein expression is associated with cachexia-induced body weight loss and that COX2 inhibitory agents could be used to modulate TNF-a levels and hence to treat tumor cachexia. P724 TET-INDUCED TRAIL EXPRESSION INHIBITS TUMOR GROWTH (Heidelberg, ULM) We utilized cells, transfected with TRAIL under tetracycline control (JURKAT- TRAIL-tet-on), for regulated induction of apoptosis in tumor therapy. Our in vitro studies show that tet-induced TRAIL expression in JURKAT-TRAIL-tet-on cells induces apoptosis in B-lymphoma (B JAB) target cells. Tumor growth of TRAIL- sensitive xenograffs was inhibited using the same donor-target system in vlvo. In detail, nude mice were xenografted either with B JAB or with TRAIL-resistant neuroblastoma (KELLY) cells. Tumors were inoculated with JURKAT-TRAIL-tet-on cells and expression of TRAIL was switched on by adding tetracycline to the drinking water. Tumor size was measured during a period of 4 weeks. BJAB- xenografts injected with control cells exhibited a twofold increase in tumor size compared to the tumors inoculated with TRAIL expressing JURKAT cells. In contrast, no alteration was observed in tumor size increase in nude mice xenografted with KELLY cells. These data indicate that control of tumor growth may be achieved with TRAIL expressing effector cells as a local delivery system. P725 CORRELATION BETWEEN VEGF TISSUE LEVEL AND KI-RAS OR P53 MUTA- TIONS IN HUMAN COLORECTAL Mutations in Ki-ras oncogene and p53 tumor suppressor gene are a common genetic event in the development of human colorectal carcinomas. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a well-characterized inducer of tumor angiogenesis. In various cancers an influence of mutated Ki-ras or p53 genes on expression of VEGF was found. The aim of our study was to investigate a possible correlation between the mutational statuses of Ki-ras and p53 genes and the expression of VEGF in co[orectal carcinomas. Methods: 54 patients (33 m / included in our study. For determination of VEGF concentration and isolation of DNA from homogenized tumor and adjacent normal tissue the VEGF QuantikineTM ELISA kit from R&D Systems and the DNA isolation kit from Qiagen, respectively, were employed. After polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications using the extracted genomic DNA as templates in combination with primers specific for the Ki-ras or the p53 gene, temporal temperature gradient electrophoreses 0-TGE) of the amplicons were performed to detect mutations in Ki-ras (exon 1) and p53 genes (exons 5-8). Results: VEGF concentrations in tumor tissues were significantly (p<0.001) elevated in comparison to normal tissue (879 pg/mg protein versus 83 pg/mg protein). In 21/ 54 (38.9%) tumors a mutation in Ki-ras and in 23/54 (42.6%) a p53 gene mutation was found. A simultaneous mutation of both analyzed genes occurred in 10/54 (18.5%) tumors. Relating VEGF concentrations to the identified mutations, we did not find any correlation between neither a single mutation in Ki-ras or p53 nor a simultanous mutation of both genes and VEGF concentration in tumor tissues. Likewise, no association between patient's gender, Dukes' stage, pTNM classification or localization of the tumor and VEGF concentration with or without respect to mutational statuses was found. Conclusions: Mutational status of the Ki-ras or the p53 gene does not seem to influence the level of VEGF concentration in colorectal carcinomas. P726 of be an unseful marker in HPV assosiated preinvasive lesions of the cervix. It is postulated that the expression of p16 could be a a sign of the inactivation of pRb for example via E7 of high-risk HPV and the consecutive upregulation of p161NK4a. There are two different ethiologic pathways developing vulvar carcinoma. The first one is accociated with HPV infection and occurs in younger women the second one is HPV negative and often accoiciated with lichen sclerosis or inflamation in older women.The retrospective analysis of vulvar carcinoma treated at our institution form 1990 until 10/2001 are analysed for HPV Infection. We used the GP5-GP6 primer for detection of HPV DNA. Further there was made high-risk typing of HPV positive tumors.The p161NK4a expression is made by immunhistochemestry. The criteria of expression was determined by (0) negative up to (3) positive.Of the 89 vulvar carcinoma 68 patients were HPV postive (76,4%) we detected in 57,4% HPV 16 in 8,8% HPV 18. In HPV positive vulvar carcinoma we found in 58% a p161NK4a expression. In the HPV negative carcinomas there were only 4 positive. The analysis of the p161NK4a status and the HPV detection rate in vulvar carcinomas underlie the model of the HPV induced molecular changes. Vulvar carcinomas are a useful clinical and biological model for further investigations in different pathways of carcinogenesis. P727 JET-INJECTION FOR EFFICIENT NONVIRAL IN OF THE LACZ AND TNF-ALPHA GENE INTO XENOTRANSPLANTED HUMAN COLON OR BREAST CARCINOMAS W. Walther, U. Stein, I. Fichtner, as eletroporation, particle bombardement or jet-injection have developed to attractive alternatives to viral or ]iposomal gene delivery systems. In this study the prototype of a jet-injector system, the ,,Swiss- Injector\" (EMS Medical GmbH, Germany) was used for the direct in vivo gene transfer of naked plasmid DNA into xenotransplanted human tumors. The study aimed at the simultaneous transduction of two different plasmids by jet-injection into tumor xenotransplants derived from human colon- or mammary carcinoma to evaluate jet penetration and distribution of gene expression in this tissue. In our in vivo studies xenotransplanted female NMRI-nu/nu mice were jet- injected simultaneously with beta-galactosidase (LacZ) and human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) gene harboring constructs. The animals received a maximum of 5 jet-injections directly into the subcutaneous tumors at a pressure of 3.0 bar. Each jet-injection delivered up to 10ul DNA-mix of the two plasmids (lmg/ml of each plasmid) and jets were penetrating 5 to 10 mm into the tumor tissue. 48h after jet-injection tumors were removed, shock frozen and cryosectioned for LacZ or TNF detection using the X-Gal LacZ- or TNF-specific ELISA was performed for quantitation of gene expression. Jet-injections were well tolerated by the animals, only minor bleeding was seen at the sites of jet-injection. The jet-injection of DNA leads to spread distribution of transduced areas covering up to 5 x 5 mm2 within tumor tissues for both genes. The X-Gal staining and TNF-immunohistochemistry in cryosections of jet-injected tumors LacZ- and TNF-expression. Furthermore, the LacZ- and TNF-ELISA showed efficient expression within the jet-injected tumor tissue, reflected by an LacZ-expression of up to 600 pg/mg protein and TNF expression of >200 pg TNF/mg protein. These studies demonstrate the usefulness of the jet-injection for the simultaneous intratumoral in vivo gene transfer of two different plasmid DNAs. Therefore, this technique can be employed for the nonviral gene therapy of cancer using only small amounts of naked DNA. P728 UTILITY OF HPV-TESTING IN THE SEARCH FOR TUMORS OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN O. Zivanovic, M. Simon, B. DQrkop, I. Pathologie, Universit~.t Bonn (Bonn) Tumors of unknown origin comprise a considerable problem in gynecologic oncology. Despite extensive diagnostic evaluation the primary tumor location or tumor origin often remain elusive. However, proper identification of the primary tumor can have significant impact on the individual prognosis and therapy. The causal association between HPV and virtually all cervical carcinomas is well accepted. However its utility in advanced oncologic disease is less well-established. The aim of our study was to determine the value of HPV-testing in tumors of unknown origin. Thirteen patients with tumors of unknown origin, either because of atypical clinical findings or because of indecisive histology were included. 8/13 patients had a positive past medical history for a gynecologic pelvic tumor. Paraffin embedded specimens were tested for HPV by consensus and type-specific PCR. 6 out of 13 patients with tumors of unknown origin could be identified as cervical carcinomas based upon the clinical findings and HPV results. Among 3 of 4 patients with histologically unusual pelvic tumors were either tested positive for HPV 16 or HPV 18. 1 out of 5 patients with cerebral tumors was tested positive for HPV 18. One patient with acute abdomen and an unusual squamous cell sigmoid tumor was tested positive for HPV 18. 1 out of 2 patients with an unclear spinal adenocarcinoma was tested positive for HPV 18.Some experimental markers, i.e. oncogenes and tumorsuppressors (c-myc, ras c-erbB2, p53), have been suggested to be potent diagnostic markers in the management of tumors of unknown primary origin. However their clinical significance still remains to be determined. In contrast, our data suggest that HPV can be considered a highly specific tumor marker. ]n combination with conventional diagnostic evaluation it is a valuable, fast and economic molecular diagnostic tool for the detection of tumors of unknown origin. S 145 Gene Therapy/Molecular Pathology / Cell Cycle, Apoptosis, Angiogenesis P729 DNA ANEUPLIDY, P53- AND K-RAS MUTATIONS IN THE CARCINOGENESIS OF THE GASTRIC REMNANT NEOPLASM A. Braun, R. (Tebingen, Bremen) Background: gastrectomy is associated with an increased risk of adenocarcinoma at the anastomosis of the gastric remnant, especially in patients who are at least 15 years' postgastrectomy and had undergone Billroth (B) II procedure, p53-, k-ras mutations and the occurrence of DNA aneuploidies are common events in the development of gastrointestinal neoplasm. This study tried to determine the frequent of these events during the development of gastric remnant neoplasm.Methods: 87 Patients had undergone subtotal gastrectomy (14 B I, 43 B il, 13 B II + Roux-Y and 17 B II + Braun's anastomosis). A total of 463 biopsies (3 Carcinomas, 2 low-grade Dysplasias and normal/inflammatory epithelium) from these patients were investigated by flow cytometry and single- stand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP). The median time interval from the original operation to the flexible gastroscopy was 15,7 years (range 1-55 years).Results: DNA aneuplidy was found in 5% (4/87) of the patients at the anastomosis and previous B II resection. One DNA aneuplidy could be detected in a carcinoma. At the median time of 20 years DNA aneuplidy was found after partial gastrectomy. 10,3% (9/87) of the patients showed p53 mutations, all had undergone B II procedures, p53 mutations could be detected at the anastomosis and at the median time of 25 years. K-ras Mutations were not found. onclusion: These results show that the occurrence of DNA aneuplidy and p53 mutation are common events in the development of gastric remnant neoplasm after a time interval of 20 years. Therefore, p53 analysis and DNA aneuplidy might be helpful in the classification of identification of patients at risk for cancer development. P730 GENE THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF SOFT TISSUE SARCOMA S. Fruehauf, S. Laufs, M.R. Veldwijk, Soft tissue sarcomas are mesenchymal tumors which respond poorly to systemic therapy. Recent studies suggest a higher response rate with increased doxorubicin dosage. However, this went along with a profound WHO grade Ill/IV hematotoxicity in 75% of patients. Transfer of the human multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene to normal hematopoietic stem ceils and transplantation may significantly reduce the hematotoxicity of anthracyclin-based chemotherapy. To test this concept of supportive gene therapy in advance of a clinical study we transduced mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) with the retroviral vector SF91 m3 containing the human MDR1 gene, transplanted these cells to immune-deficient mice (2 cohorts, 32 mice each), allowed six weeks for engraftment to occur and treated the animals with MDRl-based chemotherapy. In the MDRl-transduced group the proportion of human cells in the mouse bone marrow remained significantly higher (p<0.05) than in the mock-transduced control group. While the gene transfer rate was ca. 10% (cohort #1: 9.4%, cohort #2: 12.3%) and thus comparable to recent clinical trials, the gene expression was 59% of transduced cells and thus significantly higher than previously reported for less-advanced vectors. Due to the favorable data a clinical MDR1 gene therapy protocol for the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma was submitted.Gene therapeutic strategies may also be used to directly target sarcoma cells, e.g. by transfer of suicide genes. We found that adeno-associated virus-2 (AAV-2) vectors efficiently transduce human HS-1 and HT1080 sarcoma cells (>90%) while other tumor cell lines and primary human PBPC were less susceptible. The thymidine kinase (TK) suicide gene was cloned into an AAV-2 vector and a complete kill of TK-transduced HS-1 and HT1089 cells was observed following exposure or ganciclovir (GCV) while >90% of mock-transduced HS-1 cells survived at these dosages. Trans- plantation to immune-deficient mice resulted in a survival of >5 months in the AAV-TK-transduced/GCV-treated group while the mice in the mock-transduced/ GCV-treated group had died after three weeks.These data show that soft-tissue sarcomas are a particularly suitable model system for the development and clinical testing of new gene therapeutic concepts. Cell Cycle~ Apoptosis~ Angiogenesis Oral Presentation O731 A COMBINATION OF BIOMODULATING INDUCES MULTIPLE APOPTOTIC PATHWAYS IN HCC CELLS M. Ganslmayer, C. Herold, M. Hermann, D. Schuppan, Medizinische Klinik I, Medizinische Klinik Ill, Dept. of Cell Biology (Erlangen; Newcastle, GB) Aim: We showed that a combination of Tamoxifen (TAM), 9-cis retinoic acid the histone-deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) is highly active in arresting the proliferation of hepatoma cells in vitro. The effect of this combination on apoptosis and apoptosis- associated proteins is still unknown.Methods: The hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and HeplB were incubated with TAM, CRA, TNP (10-4-10-6M) and TSA (10-6-10-9M) as single agents or in combination. After 3 - 120 h apoptosis rate was quantified immunhistochemically and by FACS analysis after staining with propidium iodide. Changes in the expression of (pro)-caspase 3, bax and bc]-2 were assessed using quantitative Western blotting and activation of caspase 3 and 8 via a colorimetric assay.Results: The combination of TAM/CRA/TNP/TSA multiplied the effects of the single agents. Quadruple treatment caused a constant increase of (pro)- caspase 3 and bax levels during the 24 h of incubation, while bcl-2 was inhibited. Both, caspase 3 and 8 were activated more efficiently by quadruple therapy.Conclusion: 1) Quadruple therapy with biomodulators is far superior to monotherapy. 2) Bcl-2, an apoptosis-protecting factor located in the mitochondrial membrane, was reduced. 3) Bax, a destabilizer of mitochondrial membrane potential and inducer of mitochondria-linked apoptosis was increased. 4) Cell membrane associated caspase 8 as well as caspase 3, a inductor of DNA cleavage, were activated. 5) Therefore, this combination therapy activates different pro-apoptotic supporting the use of combiantions of biomodulators as a novel therapeutic strategy for chemoresistant 4 + 2 % apoptosis after 72 h, n/experiments = 3 Table 2 TSA 10 \"~ M TAMICRA/TNP 16 5 M and TSA i OTM pro-apoptotic bax protein 2 6 -+ 1.0 3.6 anti-apoptotic bcl-2 p~otein 0.4 + 0.3 0,2 \u00b1 O. caspase 3 2 1 \u00b1 0,5 4.0 \u00b1 3,0 -+ 1,2 ResuIts are means + SD of 3 exper;ments given as ratio vs. untreated HepG2 cells after 24 h. 0732 FURIN MEDIATES INVASIVENESS VIA Wick, C. Wild-Bode, M. Weller, Universit~it TL~bingen (TL~bingen) Migration and invasion for the neoplastic phenotype of malignant glioma. Ectopic expression of either bcl-2 or bag-1 enhanced migration and invasion of glioma cells in vitro and induced tumor satellite formation of LN-18 and LN-229 bcl-2 or bag-1 cells in a nude mouse brain tumor model. Coexpression of bcl-2 and bag-1 did not reveal synergy in any motility paradigm tested in vitro or in vivo. Bcl-2- and bag-l-expressing glioma cells exhibited enhanced release of the bioactive form of the promigratory and proinvasive cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)2. Increased TGF-beta release resulted from enhanced expression and activity of the TGF-beta convertase, furin. Furin is a proprotein convertase not only for TGF-beta but also for various other proteins, including metalloproteinases (MMP). Consistent with a biological role for a bcl-2- and bag- 1-dependent increase in furin activity, bcl-2- and selectively target furin, inhibited constitutive and bcl-2/bag-l-mediated MMP activity as well as invasion. This inhibition was not overcome by recombinant TGF-beta or hepatocyte growth factor, indicating that the metalloproteinolyic properties of TGF-beta depend on furin-like protease activity. A neutralizing TGF- beta antibody attenuated the invasive properties conferred by exogenous expression of bag-l, bcl-2 or both, thus supporting the idea of a self-catalytic action of TGF- beta via the activation of furin. In contrast, the MMP inhibitor o-phenantroline abolished the proinvasive action of bcl-2/bag-1. Consequently, bc]-2 family proteins use a furin-dependent pathway to promote migration and invasion in human malignant glioma cells. 0733 ALTERNATIVE SPLICING OF SURVIVIN LEADS TO LOSS OF CENTROMERIC ASSOCIATION DURING MITOSIS J. Liebmann, C. Mahotka, M. Wenzel, M. Schmitt, Gerharz, Heinrich-Heine-Universit&t (DQsseldorf) Objective: Survivin is a structurally unique member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (lAP) family that is overexpressed in most cancers and acts at the inter- face between apoptosis and cell cycle control. Here we analyse the function and subcellular Iocalisation of two novel splice variants, i.e. survivin-deltaEx3 and wich exhibit structural alterations of their BIR domain.Methods: Clon- ing of GFP-taggged constructs of cells, exhibited antiapoptotic potential after activation of CD95 (Apo/Fas)-induced cell death with apoptotic CH11 antibodies, whereas survivin-2B failed to inhibit apoptosis. 2. PSORT II analysis predicted a predominantly cytoplasmic ]ocalisation for survivin and survivin-2B, in contrast to a predominant nuclear Ioclisation of survivin-deltaEx3. S 146 Cell Cycle, Apoptosis, Angiogenesis 3. Confocal laser microscopy confirmed the predicted subcellular Iocalisation of the different splice variants. 4. Cell cycle dependent differences of Iocalisation became evident using CENP-F as a centromere marker protein: showed nuclear late G2, colocalisation with centromeres in the M-phase and association with the midbody in late telophase. In contrast, survivin-deltaEx3 exhibited nuclear Iocalisation in S and G2 phases, but no association with centromeres and midbodies during mitosis. 5. Comparative alignment with known nuclear targeting sequences of proteins revealed a novel bipartite nuclear Iocalisation signal in survivin-deltaEx3, but not G0/1, S and G2 phases might permit competitive binding to common interaction partners or formation of inactive heterodimers. Due to its nuclear Iocalisation in S and G2 phases, survivin-DEx3 might interact with as yet unknown nuclear targets, different from those of survivin. 0734 IDENTIFICATION OF A NOVEL ANTIANGIOGENIC MECHANISM OF IFN-A ACTION, OPERATING VIA SP1/SP3 MEDIATED INHIBITION OF VEGF GENE TRANSCRIPTION, A. Scholz, Z. Marschall, Sch~.fer, established as an antiangiogenic agent although the underlying mechanism of action remains incompletely understood. Neuroendocrine (NE) tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic tract are a particularly valuable model to study the mechanism of IFN-a action, because most NE tumors are extremely well vascularized and the clinical benefit of IFN-a treatment in these patients has been well documented. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) represents a key mediator of angiogenesis therefore promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Aim of this study was to characterize the antiangiogenic activity of IFN-a and a possible influence on VEGF gene expression.Results: Analyzing surgical specimens of human neuroeedocfine tumors by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we found a strong overexpression of VEGF in tumor cells as well as VEGF receptors in endothelial cells of surrounding tumor vessels. Corresponding to this result VEGF was detectable in three representative neuroendocrine tumor cell lines. In vitro, IFN-a treatment resulted in a decrease of VEGF expression due to a dose-dependent decrease of VEGF promoter transcription. This effect was not restricted to NE tumor cell lines. 5\"-Deletion analysis and heterologous promoter analysis revealed a IFN-a sensitive segment between -88 and -50 of human VEGF promoter. This region contains putative binding sites for transcription factors Spl/Sp3, Egr-1 and AP-2. Using reporter gene constructs with mutated or deleted binding sites as well as gel shift analysis we were able to show that the proximal GC-Box (-63/-50), binding Spl and Sp3, is sufficient for IFN-a responsiveness. IFN-a did not influence cellular concentrations of Spl or Sp3 but inhibited Spl mediated transactivation in a Gal4 reporter assay. In vivo, IFN-a inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis in a xenograff mouse model. Finally, neuroendocrine tumor patients treated with IFN-a demonstrated decreased VEGF plasma levels as well as reduced VEGF mRNA concentrations and microvessel density as assessed from biopsy material before and after IFN-a therapy. Sum- mary: These data suggest that the antitumor activity of IFN-a depends on its antiangiogenic activity due to Spl/Sp3 mediated transcriptional downregulation of VEGF gene transcription. 0735 OF GENE EXPRESSION KINETICS INDUCED BY LIGAND-MEDIATED TRKA-ACTIVATION A. Schramm, J. Schulte, A. Eggert, M. Grotzer, R. Patti, G. Brodeur, W. Havers, Universit&tsklinikum Essen, Childrens Hospital Philadelphia (Essen; Philadelphia, PA, USA) Expression of different neurotrophin receptors of the tyrosine kinase (Trk) family plays an important role in the biology and clinical behavior of neuroblsstomas (NB). Activation of these receptor tyrosine kinases stimulates a diverse array of cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation and induction of apoptosis. TrkA expression in neurob]astoma is concomitant with good prognosis of patients. Although functional studies have been undertaken to identify pathways involved in ligand-mediated TrkA activation a comprehensive view has not emerged. The recent advances in large-scale monitoring of gene expression enabled us to monitor kinetic expression data in living cells on a genome-wide scale. We here address the kinetics of gene expression due to TrkA activation by its ligand nerve growth factor (NGF). For this purpose the human neuroblastoma cell line SY5Y was stably transfected with a vector containing the coding gene for TrkA. Starting with 12000 genes present on the U95Av2 gene array (Affymetrix Inc.) a total of 117 genes were identified, whose expression patterns significantly changed between 30 minutes and 24 hours after NGF stimulation. We used RT-PCR or Western Blotting to validate results. SOM-clustering identified 8 groups of genes differentially regulated in this time course. Beside of immediate early genes (c-JUN, c-FOS, NGFI-A, NGFI-B) we found a set of transcription factors previously not linked to TrkA-signaling to be induced by NGF (MINOR and AREB-6). Signaling through the MAP-kinase pathway seemed to be affected in response to NGF-mediated TrkA- activation, since expression of MAP-kinase phosphatases was upregulated, while MKK-6 was downregulated. Expression of several genes known to be increased in malignant cells, e.g. HEC, FRIZZLED, IGFBP-4 and BMX was shut off, while markers of neuronal differentiation e.g. VlP and GAP-43 were induced as a response to NGF after 24 hours. This is in line with the hypothesis that NGF- mediated TrkA signaling contributes to a less malignant phenotype in neuroblastoma cells. In addition to enhancing effects on tumor cell differentiation, TrkA-activation in neuroblastoma might also modulate expression of tumor-associated genes previously not related to neurotrophin-receptor signaling. Poster P736 ENHANCED RESISTANCE AGAINST UV- OR TRAIL-MEDIATED APOPTOSIS OF OVARIAN CANCER CELLS BY DEXAMETHASONE IS ACCOMPANIED BY REDUCED CASPASE 3, 8, 9 ACTIVITY BUT NOT BY BCL-2 cells against UV- or TRAIL-mediated apoptosis was tested. Methods: Three ovarian cancer lines (OV-MZ-6, OV-MZ-30, OV-MZ-31) were treated with 1O0nM dexamethasone at various time points before irradiation with UVC light or before addition of TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand). Cell lysates were tested for the expression pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, BcI-XI, p53, DR4, DRS) by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Activity of caspases 3, 8 and 9 was analyzed by using the corresponding chromogenic substrates. Results: Dexamethasone pretreatment resulted in enhanced survival of all cell lines after treatment with both, UV-irradiation or TRAIL. No cytoprotective effect was found when dexamethasone was applied after exposure to UV light or TRAIL. The cytoprotective effect was independent of the p53 mutation status. Activity of caspases 3, 8 and 9 after UV-irradiation was inhibited in dexamethasone-treated cells. Levels of antiapoptotic Bcl members (Bcl-2, BcI-XI) and TRAIL- receptors DR4 DR5 remained unchanged in the presence of dexamethasone. Conclusion: The cytoprotective effect of dexamethasone in ovarian cancer cells was accompanied by an inhibition of caspase 3, 8 and 9 activity independent of Bcl-2 and BcI-XI upregulation. P737 EFFICACY OF ANTI-HUMAN VEGF ANTIBODY ON PRIMARY PANCREATIC CANCER TUMOR GROWTH AND LYMPH NODE METASTASIS IN AN ORTHO- TOPIC NUDE MOUSE MODEL C. (unpublished data) we could demonstrate that blocking murine KDR/flk-1 activation with an anti-mouse KDR/flk-1 antibody leads to a significant reduction of primary pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis as compared to untreated control animals following orthotopic injection of human pancreatic cancer cells in nude mice. Based on these findings a sensitivity of this tumor system towards anti-human VEGF antibody (R&D MAP 293) was assumed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic efficacy of anti- human VEGF antibody on human pancreatic cancer growing orthotopically in nude mice. Following injection of 8x105 L3.6pl human pancreatic cancer cells into the pancreas of nude mice, groups of nude mice were treated with 10, 30, and 100 ug/mouse of anti-human VEGF antibody by intraperitoneal injection on day 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19 after tumor cell injection. All animals were sacrified on day 22. The average pancreatic tumor weight was 0.29, 0.27, 0.37, and 0.69 mg following therapy with 100, 30, 10 ug/mouse anti-VEGF antibody and controls, respectively. Lymph node metastases were present in 3/8, 4/8, 4/8, and 6/7 animals following therapy with 100, 30, 10 ug/mouse anti-VEGF antibody and controls, respectively. There were no significant differences in body weight within the different therapy groups and controls. Microvessel density as measured by CD31 staining and the proliferation index as evaluated by Ki67 staining was significantly reduced in primary pancreatic tumors treated with 30 or 100 ug/mouse as compared to controls. The data indicate that in vivo therapy with a low dose of an anti-human VEGF antibody leads to a significant regression of primary pancreatic tumor growth and 50% reduction of lymph node metastases in an orthotopic nude mouse model. This effect is based on inhibiton of tumor-induced angiogenesis. P738 APOPTOSIS INDUCED BY (PBR) IS MITOCHONDRIA-MEDIATED A. Sutter, K. Maaser, M. B. von Lampe, M. Zeitz, H. Scher~bl, Universit~.tsklinikum Benjamin Franklin (Berlin) Background: In previous studies we have shown that specific PBR-ligands induced apoptosis in colorectal and esophageal tumor cells. The association of PBR with the mitochondrial permeability transition pore suggests a participation in mitochondrial apoptosis pathways. However, the mechanism of PBR-ligand- induced apoptosis of esophageal cancer cells has not been investigated so far. Methods and Results: Using primary cell cultures of human esophageal cancers and the human esophageal cell lines KYSE-140 (squamous) and OE-33 (adenocarcinoms) we studied the involvement of PBR in apoptosis of esophageal cancer cells. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy the subcellular PBR location was determined to be in the mitochondria. The specific PBR-ligand FGIN- S 147 in tumor cells. FGIN-1-27 decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, which indicates an early event in apoptosis. Furthermore, caspase-3-activity and DNA fragmentation were dose-dependently increased by FGIN-1-27. Using cyclospodn A, an inhibitor of the permeability transition pore, we demonstrated that a decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential is a prerequisite for PBR-mediated caspase-3 activation. On the other hand, the caspase-3-inhibitor DEVD-CHO did not prevent the PBR-mediated decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential. The sequence of PBR-induced apoptotic events occurs as follows: decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-3-activation and finally DNA fragmentation. Conclusion: Our data clearly demonstrate an involvement of mitochondria in PBR- ligand-mediated apoptosis. PBR may qualify as a new promising target protein for the chemotherapy of advanced esophageal cancer. P739 EXPRESSION OF PKI-67 RECOMBINANT TANDEM REPEATS MIMICS POSTMITOTIC EARLY G1 PHASE M.H.H. Schmidt, H.-P. Broil, Hospital Detroit (L0beck; Detroit, USA) Introduction: Monoclonal antibodies against the human nuclear protein pKi-67 (e.g. MIB-1) are commonly used in oncology for the assessment of the growth fraction of tumor cells. Their labeling index is proportional to the proliferation rate. pKi-67 is exclusively expressed in the active phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2, M) but is undetectable in quiescent cells (GO). The protein can be isolated in two isoforms with approximately 395 and 345 kD encoded by the same gene. Cloning of the pKi-67 cDNA revealed a very large gene (about 12,500 bp) with 15 exons. Alternative splicing of its mRNA results in the different isoforms of the Ki-67 protein whereby exon 7 is completely lost. Exon 13 is of special interest because it contains 16 repeated elements with a size of about 122 amino acids each. The mostly used antibody to detect pKi-67 is MIB-1, which detects the so-called ,,Ki- 67 motif\" FKELF in nine of the sixteen tandem repeats found in the protein. To investigate the function of these repeats we expressed three of them with a Tet- inducible system in HeLa cells. Methods: HeLa cells were transfected with a Tet-inducible vector expressing three pKi-67 tandem repeats analyzed by FACS, BrdU-incorporation assay, PCR, Immunoblots and immunocytochemistry MIB-2, Results: Expression three Ki-67 repeats caused a reduction of S-phase cells and a diminished BrdU-incorporation. Addition of a SV40-nuclear localization site (NLS) caused an accumulation of cells in G2/M-phase. MtB-1 was unable to detect both, recombinant repeats and native pKi-67, in the nuclei of these cells while it was still detectable by other antibodies (MIB-2, MIB-7, MIB-13 and MIB- 21). Conclusions: We hypothesize that the expression of 'Ki-67 repeats' in the nucleus prevents binding of MIB-1 to its epitope and leads to a functional inhibition of p Ki- 67 in G2/M by protein-protein interactions. In cells leaving mitosis to the G1 phase pKi-67 can hardly be detected by MtB-1, either. We assume that this is caused by interactions of the MIB-1 epitope rather than by a rapid degradation of the protein. Consequently, expression of recombinant pKi-67 tandem repeats mimics the postmitotic early G1 phase. We hypothesize that the epitope FKELF be also undetectable in tumor cells overexpressing pKi-67. P740 THE PROLIFERATION MARKER PKI-67 DRIVES THE CELL CYCLE IN A RAN AND CYCLIN B DEPENDENT MANNER M.H.H. Schmidt, R. Broil, M. Duchrow, Ford (Detroit, USA; LiJbeck) The Ki-67 antigen, pKi-67, is one of the most common markers of proliferating cells in research and pathology. It was originally described in 1983 as a protein associated with the active phases of the cell cycle. Further investigations revealed that it is only expressed in proliferating cells (GI-, S, G2- and M-phase) but absent in quiescent cells (G0-phase). Despite the fact that pKi-67 has been known for nearly two decades there is still no adequate understanding of it. To overcome this we used a combination of two- hybrid systems complemented by gene expression studies to put the protein in a functional context. In a yeast two-hybrid assay we screened four pKi-67 fragments, representing the complete protein, against a HeLa cDNA library. To verify the detected interactions we reclened the potential interaction partners and the pKi- 67 fragments into mammalian two-hybrid system expression vectors to consider secondary modifications. Additionally, we expressed the pKi-67 fragments in a Tet-inducible gene expression system to investigate its effects on HeLa cells. As pKi-67 binding partners we identified two ran-associated proteins, cell cycle regulatory proteins as well as several ATP-dependent helicases and nucleolar proteins. Additionally, we found the C-terminus to be associated with two heterochromatin-binding proteins. The spectrum of interactions implicates pKi-67 to have a very important function in the nucleolar reformation and the attachment of the chromosomes to the inner nuclear lamina after mitosis. Additionally, the preferential nucleolar localization of the protein can be explained. In the mammalian two-hybrid system pKi-67 showed a strong tendency for self-association. While expressing the four pKi-67 fragments in HeLa, we observed a delocalization of cyclin B1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleoli. This suggests pKi-67 directs the 'mitosis promoting factor' (MPF) to the nucleoli. Subsequently, a massive phosphorylation of the nucleolar proteins occurs, which results in the disintegration of the organelle. Summarizing, our data provides evidence that pKi-67 has an important regulatory effect on the cell cycle by supporting the onset and exit of mitosis. We hypothesize this influence to be mediated by the organization of the disintegration and reformation of the nucleolus. P741 ANGIOGENESIS AND (Freiburg) Introduction The formation of bone metastasis is regarded to be a result of interactions between metastatic cells and the unique microenvironment in the bone, but the mechanisms are poorly under-stood. ET-1, a vasoactive peptide that is a potent mitogen for tumor cells, has angiogenic activity. It has been identified to play an important role in the pathophysiology of osteoblastic bone lesions in patients with prostate cancer. The aim of our studies was to evaluate vessel density and the expression of ET-1 in bone metastases from cancer patients Methods 25 bone metastasis from patients with different primary tumors (14 breast, 4 unknown, 1 prostate, 2 renal, 1 thyroid, 1 urothelial, 1 colon and 1 squamous cancer), 14 non-metastatic bone specimen, HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) and HDMECs (human dermal microvascular endothelial cells) were analyzed. Paraffin embedded sections were stained with monoclonal antibodies that bind specifically to CD-31 or ET-1, using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. Microvessel density (MVD) was counted in hot spots as well as in representative areas of the adherent section. Semi-quantitative analyze was performed to differentiate between strong and week ET-expression. Results The number of microvessels in bone metastases from patients with breast cancer is significantly increased comparing to the MVD in non-malignant bone tissue. ET- 1 is present in metastatic bone tissue of 24 (24/25) specimen. ET-1 is expressed in all tumor cells and most of the tumor stroma cells, the staining is in general more intense in tumor cells. If osteoclasts are present, they have a strong staining for ET-1. In 8 specimens vessels stained positive for ET-1, as well as in HUVEC and HDMEC. In non-metastatic bone ET-1 is found to be expressed by periost and bone marrow cells only. Conclusions There is now for the first time evidence of increased microvessel density in bone metastases, which supports the hypothesis of an important role of angiogenesis in bone metastasis. Furthermore ET-1 expression has been shown in bone metastasis of various primary tumors. The strong staining for ET in osteoclasts may suggest a direct involvement of ET-1 in bone destruction. P742 ENHANCEMENT OF TRAIL-MEDIATED APOPTOSIS BY IONIZING RADIATION IN Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is known to be resistant against ionizing radiation (IR). Because TRAIL, a novel member of the TNF family, induces apoptosis in tumor cells, but not in most non-neoplastic cells, we analyzed the effects of combined TRAIL and IR treatment as well as its signal transduction pathways in 8 human RCC cell lines. Methods and Results: 1. As demonstrated by RT-PCR, all RCC cell lines expressed TRAIL as well as its death-inducing receptors DR4 and DR5. Decoy-receptor DcR1 3 ceil lines and DcR2 mRNA in all cell lines. 2. Exposure to TRAIL (10 or 100 ng/ml) induced apoptosis in 5 out of 8 cell lines, which was paralleled by a significant (p<0.05) reduction of cell number. 3. Treatment of RCC cell lines with IR (1 or 5 Gy) resulted in a significant (p<0.05) reduction of cell number after 5 Gy. 4. Combined treatment with TRAIL and IR resulted in a synergistic enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in one cell line (clearCa-22). 5. Western blot analysis revealed that the synergistic enhancement of TRAIL- induced apoptosis by IR was paralleled by an increase of caspase-3 and PARP- cleavage, without cleavage of caspase-6 and -7. 6. Combined treatment with TRAIL and IR in clearCa-22 augmented DR5 protein expression and induced caspase-8 cleavage whereas cleavage of caspase-9 was not observed. 7. Deficient activation of the caspase-9 pathway might be due to protein expression of the apoptosis inhibitor XlAP and lack of BID cleavage. 8. Lack of BID cleavage is not due to expression of phosphorylated Akt protein. Conclusions: Enhancement of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by IR is possible in a small proportion of renal cell carcinomas and might provide the basis for a new non-surgical therapeutic approach in RCC metastasis. Apoptosis induced by combined TRAIL and IR treatment appears to be mediated via the caspase-8 pathway, whereas activation of caspase-9 was not detectable. P743 THE COMBINATION OF TAMOXlFEN AND 9-CIS RETINOIC ACID SYNERGISTICALLY APOPTOSIS AND HUMAN HEPATOMA CELLS M. Ocker, C. Herold, H. Gerauer, M. I, Klinik III (Erlangen) Aim: al (N Engl J Med, 1996, 334, 1561) reported of a prolonged postope- rative survival after resection for HCC with retinoic acid derivatives. Tamoxifen S 148 Cell Cycle, Apoptosis, Angiogenesis (TAM) and retinoic acids (RA) alone have shown limited or no effect on HCC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. TAM is known to induce apoptosis in several tumor cell lines due to increased levels of TGFb (Chen et al, J Cell Biochem, 1996, 61, 9-17) Combination therapy of TAM and RA on proliferation and apoptosis of hepatoma cells has not been investigated yet. Methods: Hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and HeplB were cultured in 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and incubated with TAM, 9cis-RA (CRA), alone (10-4 to 10-6M) or in combination. DNA-synthesis, which is correlated to cell proliferation, was quantified using BrdU labeling (BrdU-Elisa) and cell counting after 24h of incubation. Apoptosis was assessed after TUNEL assay qualitatively. Quantitative western blots were performed to determine the expression of p21cip/waf and pro-apoptotic bax. Results: CRA induced a higher reduction of proliferation rate than TAM. TAM and CRA alone were able to induce moderate rates of apoptosis, with a detectable raise in cell death after 6h. Cells reached a S/G2-phase arrest before becoming apoptotic. Combination therapy increased apoptosis rates in HepG2 and HeplB cells, showing a synergistic effect. Expression of p21cip/was not increased by these drugs, neither alone nor in combination, but a time- dependent increase of bax-expression was observed. Conclusion: ) Monotherapy of TAM and CRA decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis moderately. 2) Combination of TAM and CRA showed synergistic antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in HeplB and HepG2 cells. 3 HeplB cells are more sensitive to treatment compared to HepG2 cells. 4) Expression of bax but not of p21cip/waf was induced by mona- or combination therapy. 5) Combination therapy may be far superior to monotherapy for HCC.

Mross, M. Medinger, M. MiJller, D. Laurent, B. Putz, A. M. Dugan, D. East USA) Angiogenesis is responsible for the growth and metastasis of malignant tumors. The most important factor in tumor angiogenesis is VEGF (vascular endothelial growth VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase, PTK/ZK, was examined in a dose escalating phase I study. Additionally, Color Doppler ultrasound (CDU) technique was used to assess changes in blood flow of liver metastases as surrogate marker. Tumor blood flow detected by this method correlated with vessel density in previous animal experiments (Can.Res 60, 2178- 2189, Apt 2000). 24 patients (11 female and 13 male) were treated (23 colorectal cancer, 1 breast cancer, all with liver metastasis) with PTK/ZK. Mean age was 59 years (38 - 74,). Cohorts of 3 patients were treated with 300, 500, 750, 1000 and 1200 mg PTK/ZK once daily continuously until progressive disease or toxicity occurred. The dose level 1200 mg was expanded by additional 9 patients. Blood flow was detected in representative vessels of liver metastases from all patients by CDU on day 0, 2, 28 and all subsequent 28 day cycles. No dose limiting toxicity has been observed. The most frequent adverse events were nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness and hypertension. Minor response or stable disease > 3 month was observed in 10 out of 19 evaluated patients. 5 patients failed evaluation for response because of toxicity or compliance. In contrast to non responders, systolic as well as diastolic blood flow was decreased by ~60 % in patients with minor response and stable disease after 28 days of treatment. This effect was positively correlated with increasing dose levels. PTK/ZK is well tolerated with a favorable pk profile. Blood flow measurements in liver metastases seem to be a useful pharmakodynamic marker for PTK/ZK treatment. Nevertheless, larger patient numbers are needed to increase significance of these data. The study is ongoing. P745 PROTEOLYSIS OF TOPOISOMERASE II AND DEFECTIVE DNA PROCESSING FOLLOWING TOPOISOMERASE II INHIBITOR TREATMENT OF LEUKEMIA CELLS IN VITRO F. Gieseler, D. Dartsch, Universit&tsklinikum Kiel, Toxikologisches Institut im UKE (Kiel, Hamburg) We looked for intracellular events after treatment of human leukemia cell lines with topoisomerase (topo) I1 inhibitors. > DNA binding of anthracyclines (ANTs) within 90 minutes, detected by quenching of H33342, is directly correlated with the rate of apoptosis. > Using the ,,comet assay\" (single cell gel electrophoresis) the initiation of DNA strand breaks immediately after treatment can be found. > These ,,early\" strand breaks are almost completely repaired within 3 hours. > ,,Late\" strand breaks associated with apoptosis can be found 20 - 24 hours later. > Sister chromatid exchange events (SCEE) have been determined 12 hours after treatment of HL-6O cells with idarubicin in a high frequency (comparable to mitomycin C, positive control). > Micronuclei (MN) have been determined after 1, 24, 48, 68 hours at a rate up to 230 MN per 1000 nuclei > Additionally, topo ]1 degraded to less than 30% within 6 hours. SCEEs are associated with DNA breaks in the course of DNA replication (,,replication fork\") and MN with DNA double strand breaks in mitosis (,,spindle apparatus\"). Thus they represent different types of molecular intracellular events after treatment. We assume that topo II degradation and defective DNA processing are critical events for apoptosis induction after tope I] inhibitor treatment. In addition, topo II seems to have a role in determining chemosensitivity, thus providing a link between DNA damage, DNA processing mechanisms and apoptosis. Since cellular resistance mechanisms belong to the most important factors for therapy failure, the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms accountable for apoptosis induction is crucial. Supported INDUCES GROWTH INHIBITION IN CANCER CELLS B. Sp~inkuch-Schmitt, G. Wolf, C. Solbach, S. Loibl, R. Knecht, polo-like kinases (PLK) in regulating several stages of mitotic progression has been born out in several species. Overexpression of PLK1 is observed in the majority of hitherLo analyzed human tumors. PLK1 overexpression is a negative prognostic factor in patients suffering from non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck tumors, esophageal carcinomas and melanomas. In order to define the role of PLK1 for mitotic progression of human cells and for neoplastic cell growth, phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were tested (breast cancer), HeLa $3 (cervical carcinoma) and A549 (non-small cell lung cancer) cells. ASOs were identified which suppress PLK1 mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent and sequence-specific manner. This approach also led to reduced PLK1 serine/threonine kinase activity. Downregulation of cellular PLK1 levels in cancer cells altered cell cycle progression moderately with an elevated percentage (20-30%) of cells in G2/M. Furthermore, cells with reduced PLK1 protein gained a rounded phenotype with multiple centrosomes. Moreover, ASO treatment resulted in potent antiproliferative effects in cell culture. Considerable antitumor activity was observed in vivo against A549 cells. This study suggests that antisense inhibitors targeted against PLK1 at well tolerated doses may be considered as a cancer therapeutic agent. P747 THE COP9 SIGNALOSOME AND THE UBIQUITIN SYSTEM REGULATE VEGF PRODUCTION IN TUMOR CELLS C. Pollmann, X. Huang, J.W. Mall, D. Bech-Otschir, Max-Planck-lnstitut (Berlin) Elucidation of the signaling pathways that control the process of angiogenesis constitutes the basis for the development of clinically applicable antiangiogenic drugs. Here we demonstrate that the COP9 signalosome (CSN) controls the major part of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production in HeLa and HL-60 cells. The CSN is a multimeric protein complex that cooperates with the ubiquitin/ 26S proteasome system in regulating the stability of several components of signaling pathways. VEGF expression is controlled by the or heterodimers) , AP-2, SP-1 and HIF-1 their respective promoter binding sites. Our studies with curcumin, an effective inhibitor of the CSN, revealed that approximately 75 % of the VEGF production in HeLa and HL- 60 cells are directed by the CSN. The treatment of these tumor cells with 50 IJM curcumin led to a drastic reduction of intracellular c-Jun levels due to its increased degradation by the 26S proteasome. An increase in cellular CSN activity on the other hand resulted in elevated c-Jun levels concomitant with a rise in VEGF production. These effects are independent of Jun-N-terminal-kinase (JNK) which is inactive under the employed experimental conditions. A competitor of CSN- dependent c-Jun phosphorylation, the N-terminal c-Jun fragment c-Jun(1-226), reduced HeLa cells. Under our experimental conditions HIF- 1alpha protein was not detectable. AP-2 and SP-1 signaling contributes less than a quarter to basal VEGF production and is independent of the CSN. Overexpression of p53 decreased VEGF production. Since c-Jun and p53 compete for CSN phosphorylation in vEro this effect may be due to rapid degradation of c-Jun by the 26S proteasome induced by p53. In summary, our data show that CSN mediated c-Jun signaling predominantly contributes to high VEGF production in S 149 Cell Cycle, Apoptosis, Angiogenesis HeLa and HL-60 cells and provide an explanation for the known antiangiogenic activity of curcumin. The fact that the CSN controls the major part of VEGF production in the examined tumor cell lines makes it an interesting target for antiangiogenic therapy. P748 APOPTOTIC CHANGES IN BRAIN TUMOR CELLS INDUCED BY TAUROLIDINE R. Stendel, G. Stoltenburg-Didinger, M. Brock, Freie Universit~.t Berlin (Berlin) Introduction Taurolidine, a derivative of the aminosulphonic acid taurine, is known for its antibacterial properties. Furthermore, taurolidine was reported to prevent adhesion of tumor cells to epithelial surfaces following laparoscopic surgery. In addition, a direct antineoplastic effect of taurolidine was described. The present study was initiated to assess the cell cycle alterations caused by taurolidine exposure to brain tumor cell lines. Material and Methods Rat-derived C6 glioma U373 astrocytoma/glioblastoma cells, and brain cells obtained from rat fetuses at day 15 of gestation were cultured and incubated with taurolidine in various concentrations to investigate cytomorphological and ultrastructural changes. Flow cytometry was performed to assess changes in cell cycle distribution, cell morphology, DNA content, and DNA fragmentation as well as to determine membrane phosphatidylserine externalization. Results: The experiments revealed that an exposure to taurolidine inhibited cell proliferation in each of the tumor cell lines examined. The median inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the individual cell lines ranged between 5 and 12 IJg/mL Exposure to taurolidine led to the concentration-dependent appearance of DNA debris in the sub-Go/G1 region. Furthermore, a significant increase in membrane phosphatidylserine externalization was observed after incubation with this agent. Conclusions The present findings suggest that taurolidine seems to induce apoptosis in brain tumor cell lines and, via this mechanism, has potential antineoplastic activity. Exposure to taurolidine led to the concentration-dependent appearance of DNA debris in the sub-Go/G1 region. P749 ADRENOMEDULLIN INHIBITS HYPOXIC CELL DEATH CELLS of O2ford (Tuebingen; Bethesda, USA; Oxford, GB) Objective: Uncontrolled growth of tumors leads to limited vascular supply and consequently to hypoxia at distances beyond the diffusion capacity of oxygen. When tumor cells are exposed to hypoxic stress, transcription of a battery of genes is initiated. Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a 52-amino-acid peptide which be- longs to the calcitonin gene-related peptide family. ADM has recently been re- ported to be upregulated by hypoxia. We have conducted experiments to elucidate the role of ADM in erldometrial carcinoma cells under hypoxia. Methods: The endometrial carcinoma cell Ishikawa was incubated hypoxia. ADM mRNA and peptide were quantified by RNAse protection assay and RIA, respectively. Ishikawa cells incubated with ADM (10-12M-10-6M) or stably transfected ADM-overexpressing cells were exposed to hypoxia and cell death judged by staining with propidium iodine (PI) and Annexin V. In ADM-treated or stably transfected cells expression of the anti-apoptot[o factor Bcl-2 was analyzed by RT-PCR and of Ishikawa cells transiently transfected evaluated by PI and Annexin V staining. Results: A time dependent upregulation of ADM mRNA expression was shown under hypoxia. Concentrations of ADM peptide in cultured media of cells under hypoxia were also significantly higher than those under normoxia. Addition of ADM dose dependently inhibited hypoxia induced cell death. Stably transfected ADM-overexpressing Ishikawa cells were also more resistant to hypoxia. ADM treatment dose dependently increased Bcl-2 mRNA and peptide expression. Bcl- ADM-overexpressing Ishikawa cells. Cells transiently transfected Bcl-2 were more resistant to hypexic cell death. Conclusions: ADM treated or stably transfected Ishikawa cells overexpressing ADM show increased resistance to hypoxia induced cell death. Those cells also show an upregulation of Bcl-2 which is protective against hypoxic cell death when transiently transfected into Ishikawa cells. Since Ishikawa cells express the ADM-receptor, production and secretion of ADM with consecutive upregulation of Bcl-2 could establish an autocrine/paracrine mechanism rescuing malignant cells from hypoxic cell death. Our observations therefore implicate ADM as a promoter of tumor growth and a possible target for anticancer strategies. P750 FLAVOPIRIDOL, A NOVEL CDK INHIBITOR MEDIATES CELL ARREST APOPTOSIS IN Perabo, L. a cyclin-dependant kinase (CDK) inhibitor currently investigated in clinical trials in various cancers. We investigated FP cytotoxcicity, apoptosis induction capacity and effects on cell cycle in bladder cancer alone and in combination with the antineoplastic agents Adriamycin (ADR), Methotrexate (MTX) and Cisplatin (CDDP). Transitional carcinoma of the bladder cell lines RTl12, RT4, T24 and SUP were exposed to increasing (0.1-10 pM) - 96 hr and assessed by MTT assay to determine the IC 20, 50 and 80 concentrations. Combination experiments were performed using the MTT at the IC20 dose of agents after 24h, Analysis of apoptosis induction and distribution of cell cycle after FP incubation during a 96h time course (at IC 20, 50 and 80) was performed by flow cytometry after AnnexinV/P] staining of cells, or BRDU and PI incubation, respectively. Exposure of bladder cancer cell lines to FP potently inhibited cell proliferation (IC 20 = 50-100 nM). IC 50 was achieved in the well differentiated cell lines at 150-350 nM, whereas poorly differentiated cell lines required >500 nM. induced apoptosis at doses of 100-500 apoptosis was induced by lower doses (50-100 nM), whereas in high doses (500 nM) FP induced apoptosis in approximately 80 -90% of all cells. Cell cycle evaluation demonstrated a progressive arrest at the G2/M phase beginning after 24h. There was no additive or synergistic cytotoxic activity of the combination of FP with ADR, MTX or CDDP. FP might be an attractive agent for the treatment of bladder cancer, however, interactions with other cytotoxic chemotherapy needs further evaluation. P751 HYPOXIA-INDUCED DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED PROTEINS AND GENES IN HUMAN MICROVASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL CELLS USING PROTEIN AND DNA CHIP TECHNOLOGY A. Abdollahi, V. Wollscheid, R. Rastert, J. Debus, P. pathways in endothelial cells. Methods: We report on the identification of a series of genes and proteins whose expressions varied with different exposure times under hypoxic conditions in vitro. DNA microarray technology and the CJphergens Seldi technique allow us to study several thousands of genes at one time. In addition to identifying unexpected genes and proteins, these technologies can facilitate the development of new hypotheses concerning how cells respond to hypoxia and the identification of co- regulated pathways in response to hypoxia or microenvironmental alterations. Results: Using the DNA-Chip we have been able to get expression profiles from complete human Unigene clusters which contain more than 50.000 elements covering more than 90% of the human genome, in a single experiment, providing clues to the functional role of many genes, including potentially important genes involved in different pathways like angiogenesis and apoptosis. Further, it gives us the opportunity to investigate a huge amount of ESTs and uncharacterized genes. We have applied the protein chips (Seldi technique) using four different surface chemistries (VVCX, BAX, H4 and IMAC) to investigate differentially-expressed proteins from the total protein extract of primary isolated human lung microvascular, dermal microvascular, and umbilical vein endothelial cells treated 4, 8 and 12h under 0.1% 02. Using Ciphergene protein chip technology we detected several (34) proteins which are up- or down-regulated depending on the length of hypoxic anionic (SAX) and bind on ions (IMAC). Further, different washing stringencies were used to modify the protein binding properties (e.g. by using different pH). Detecting alterations in gene expression associated with a hypoxic treatment over different time points should be an efficient way to uncover clues as to the specific molecular changes that contribute to the behavior of microvascular endothelial cells under low oxygen. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that hypoxia can affect the expression pattern of microvascular endothelial cells, and that several genes and proteins are acting in concert in response to this stress. P752 GENERATION OF ANGIOSTATIN BY HUMAN PANCREATIC CANCER CELL LINES IS MMP-2 DEPENDENT I. Celik, C, Boston, USA) Introduction: It has been shown, that suppression of a secondary tumor in vivo is angiogenesis dependent. Aim of this study was to identify human pancreatic cancer cell lines which are capable to suppress a secondary tumor in vivo and to investigate if these cell lines are involved in the generation of angiostatin (38-kDa internal fragment of plasminogen) and by which mechanism (e.g. involvement of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP's)). Method: Human pancreatic cancer cell lines (SU 86.86, HS 776T and AsPC-1) were injected in one flank of SCID mice (n=5/cell line). After reaching a tumor volume of approx. 500 ram3 the human fibrosarcoma cell line (HT-1080) was implanted as a secondary tumor in the opposite flank. Control animals (n=5) were implanted with HT-1080 cells on one flank only. The suppression rate (secondary tumor versus control tumor) was calculated as a function of time. In order to investigate the generation of biological active angiostatin by these tumor cell lines, plasminogen was incubated with serum free conditioned media (SFCM) of these cell lines. Purified proteins were analyzed by Western blot and sequence analysis. The generated protein molecules were assayed in endothelial cell prolif- eration assay. Furthermore, the presence of MMP-2 in the SFCM was analyzed using gelatin zymography. An unspecific MMP-inhibitor was used in an in vitro blocking experiment followed by Western blot analysis. Results: Two used cell lines (SU 86.86 and HS 776T), but not ASPC-1 were capable to suppress the growth of a secondary tumor significantly. Angiostatin- S 150 Cell Cycle, Apoptosis, Angiogenesis like molecules (38 kDa) generated from human plasminogen from SFCM of only SU 86.86 and HS 776T showed anti-proliferative activity. Western blot and se- quence analysis confirmed the identity of the anti-endothelial fragments as angiostatin. Gelatin zymography demonstrated that SFCM of SU 86.86 and HS 776T contained activated MMP-2, whereas SFCM of AsPc-1 did not. The addition of an unspecific MMP-inhibitor blocked the generation of angiostatin in SFCM. Conclusion: Two human pancreatic tumor cell lines that can suppress secondary tumor growth in vive have been shown to express activated MMP-2 which can generate active angiostatin from plasminogen. Therefore, it is cautioned that clinical strategies decreasing the proteolytic activity of a tumor like MMP-inhibi- tors, may also decrease the generation of angiostatin. This might be the reason for the failed clinical studies with MMP-inhibitors in the past. P753 DEFICIENT ACTIVATION OF CD95- AND APOPTOSIS: K. f0r Pathologie (Desseldorf) Objective: The CD95 and TRAIL death receptor system have been identified as a key mediators of anticancer drug-induced apoptosis. Therefore, we analyzed the contribution of the CD95 and TRAIL system to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in the epithelioid (ES) imm unohistochemistry. Results: 1. As shown by RT-PCR, Western blot analysis and flow cytometry all ES cell lines expressed CD95, TRAIL, TRAIL-R2 but not the CD95 ligand or TRAIL-R1. 2. Exposure to the agonistic anti-CD95 antibody CH11 or TRAIL resulted in induction of apoptosis and reduction of cell number in GRU-1A and GRU-1B after CD95 activation and in GRU-1 and after activation. 3. Treatment with bleomycin, topotecan, 5-FU, or methotrexate resulted in apoptosis and a weak reduction of cell number only. In contrast, taxol treatment resulted in pronounced cell death 4. 5-FU induced CD95 upregulation in all cell lines. 5. Antagonistic antibodies directed against CD95 receptor inhibited taxol-induced reduction of cell number, but not the weak effects of other anticancer drugs. 6. Additive effects could be obtained with cytokine and drug combinations, but synergistic effects were only detectable with combined topotecan and TRAIL treatment. Conclusions: Although a functionally intact CD95 and TRAIL signalling cascade is present in GRU-1 and its subclones GRU-1A and GRU-1B, most anticancer drugs of our study failed to effectively activate CD95 and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. This deficient activation of death receptor-mediated apoptosis might be involved in the drug resistance of human epithelioid sarcoma. P754 THROMBIN AS A SURVIVAL FACTOR OF IDARUBICIN-INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN HUMAN HL-60 CELLS A. Introduction: The pivotal role of thrombin as a key in the coagulation of blood has been well established years ago. Further on thrombin was shown to have several direct cellular effects like platelet aggregation, cell growth and differentiation. These cellular interactions are mediated via proteinase activated receptors (PAR 1-4). Methods: To investigate the influence of thrombin on tumor cell growth we used human HL-6O cells incubated with different concentrations of thrombin. Cell viability was measured by the Alamar blue assay. In the same setting we pre- incubated HL-60 cells with thrombin before treatment with idarubicin (Topo-II alpha inhibitor) in an IC5O concentration. Expression of PAR-1 receptors were tested by FACS-analysis. Thrombin activity in malignant effusions were tested indirect via F1+2 by ELISA. Results: Thrombin was able to influence HL-60 cell growth in a dual concentration dependent manner. Lower concentrations of thrombin (0,3 U/ml) provoked a significant induction of tumor cell proliferation (31%, p<0,Ol). In contrast higher levels of thrombin (>2 U/ml) leaded to an inhibition of tumor growth (37%, p<0,01). In patients suffering from malignant effusions we found greatly elevated thrombin concentrations compared to the serum levels of these patients ( 1.9 nmol/I vs. 12.1 nmel/I, p<O.001). In further investigations we could show that a pre-incubation of HL-60 cells with thrombin leaded to a state of chemotherapy resistance towards idarubicin in vitro. 1.8 U/ml thrombin totally abrogated the effects of idarubicin (p<0.0O5). Discussion: Aside of its key function in blood coagulation, thrombin also acts as hormone-like protein via PAR- receptors direct on tumor cell growth and apoptosis. Interestingly it may play part in chemotherapy resistance not only in vitro but also in vivo. Some recent studies were able to show that thrombin antagonists like heparin can prolong survival in tumor patients, which are not due to reduced thromb-embolism events. P755 THE ROLE OF TRAIL SIGNALLING IN OVARIAN CANCER I. Meinhold-Heerlein, M. Krajewska, U. GrOnn, H. Bettenderf, K. Borges, H. T. Bauknecht, J.C. Reed, Universit~its-Frauenklinik, The Burnham Institute (Kiel; La Jolla, USA; Bonn, TLibingen) Ovarian cancer carries a poor prognosis because of frequent relapses and resist- ance against cytotoxic drugs. It has been shown that TRAIL, a member of the TNF-family of death-ligands, can enhance the sensitivity of cancer cell lines to anti-cancer drugs. In addition, TRAIL selectively induces apoptosis in tumor cells, but not normal cells. To study the role of TRAIL signalling in ovarian cancer and to evaluate the applicability of TRAIL for cancer treatment, we investigated the expression of agonistic TRAIL-receptors, DR4 and DR5, and other members of the TRAIL signal- ling pathway in the ovarian cell lines HEY, BG-1, SK-OV-3, and OVCAR-3 by irnmunoblotting and examined cell death apoptosis (Histone/DNA ELISA), and effects on proliferation (WST-1 assays) following exposure to TRAIL alone and in combination with various cytotoxic drugs. From the parental cell line HEY, subpopulations resistant against particular cyto- toxic drugs such as cisplatin, etoposide, paclitaxel, and docetaxel were developed. Though all ovarian cell lines examined expressed DR4 and DR5, only HEY and BG- 1 were sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The chemoresistant clones of HEY became also resistant against TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The combination of TRAIL and anticancer drugs resulted in synergistic apoptosis induction, cell death, and cell cycle arrest. Expression of DR4 and DR5 was also evaluated by immunohistochemistry for 100 paraffin-embedded ovarian cancers, using a tissue-microarray approach, reveal- ing that most primary and relapsed ovarian cancers express these TRAIL-receptors in vivo. The frequent expression of TRAIL-receptors and other key molecules of the TRAIL pathway in ovarian cancers, and the synergistic cytotoxic effects of combining TRAIL with various anticancer drugs suggest that clinical trials on TRAIL are warranted for ovarian cancer. P756 TRANSFECTION OF THE NEUROTROPHIN-RECEPTOR TRKB RESULTS IN ENHANCED RESISTANCE TO CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN NEUROBLASTOMA CELLS B. Berlemann, R. He, Kremens, W. Havers, A. (Essen, delphia) Background: Expression of neurotrophin receptors of the Trk-family plays an important role in the pathogenesis, biology and prognosis of neuroblastoma, the most common solid tumor of childhood. The TrkB receptor is mainly expressed on aggressive, MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas with a poor prognosis. Activation of TrkB by its specific ligand Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) leads to proliferation and enhanced survival of neuroblastoma cells in vitro. Methods: To investigate the effect of TrkB expression on the susceptibility of neuroblastoma cells to cytotoxic drugs, we stably expressed the TrkB receptor cDNA in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. Resulting single cell clones were char- acterized by TrkB mRNA and protein expression, and by autophosphorylation of the receptor. Cell death was analyzed by MTT-assay and a specific Cell Death ELISA. Results: Treatment with the cytotoxic drugs doxorubicine, etoposide and cisplatinum in the physiological range of treatment doses demonstrated that expression of TrkB efficiently enhanced resistance to cell death in comparison to parental SY5Y cells and the empty vector control. The effect of TrkB on chemo- therapy resistance of SY5Y cells was inhibited by treatment with a neutralizing antibody against BDNF and with the resulted in fast apoptosis of SY5Y-TrkB cells in response to cytotoxic drugs. Thus, activation of TrkB by BDNF and functional TrkB survival pathways are required for enhanced resistance of SYSY-TrkB cells to chemotherapy. Conclusion: Expression and activation of TrkB enhances resistance of neuroblastoma cells to drug-induced apoptosis. This effect may contribute to th e unfavorable prognosis of TrkB expressing neuroblas- tomas. P757 14-3-3 EPSILON - A NEW BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION AS A REGULATOR OF THE TOPOISOMERASE II ALPHA ? T. Bartscht, M. Clark, M.O. Zahn, H. Schiller, D. Kroll, F. Gieseler, 1.Medizinische Klink, University of Colorado (Kiel; Colorado, USA) The 14-3-3 proteins belong to a well conserved family of seven isoforms, in addition to binding cruciform DNA structures, 14-3-3 proteins have been charac- terized as preferentially binding serine phosphorylated proteins and are implicated in the regulation of signal transduction pathways and cellcycle-associated pro- teins such as protein kinases Rafl, protein kinase C and BAD. We have shown that the interaction between 14-3-3 epsilon and topoisomerase II alpha reduces in vitro the induction of DNA damage by VP-16 in CCRF-CEM Cells (JBC 276, 13948-54, 2000) To investigate the biological function of this interaction we used the confocal laser scanning microscopy as well as the immunoprecipitation. We can show, that 14-3-3 regularly located in the cytoplasm of CCRF-CEM Cells shifts into the nucleus after treatment with VP-16. There it is co-located (CLSM) and binds to the tope II (Immunoprecipitation). In repetitive experiments we found this interaction preferential to the phosphorylated active form of the tope II. In previous experiments we showed, that the interaction of 14-3-3 and tope II relays the tope II from the DNA (JBC 275, 13948-54, 2000). However we found also proteolyses products of these interaction in the nucleus and cytoplasm. We think that the increasing amount of the active form of the tope II after treatment with VP-16 causes a shift of 14-3-3 to the nucleus. There 14-3-3 is binding to the active tope II, relays it from the DNA and the proteolysis of this complex is initiated. It seems, that 14-3-3 is a regulator of the topoisomerase II alpha. S 151 Cell Cycle, Apoptosis, Angiogenesis / Cancer Screening and Quality Assurance P758 FAS-LIGAND INDUCED APOPTOSIS OF BLADDER CANCER CELLS BY STA- B T-CELL of T lymphocytes are toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus. The enormous potency of these molecules is reflected in several preclinical and clinical studies in cancer therapy. We initiated this study to evaluate SEB- activity on T-cells as a new approach in the therapy of bladder cancer. Since the bladder cancer cells are susceptible for Fas-ligand based apoptosis, we first examined by in vitro studies in cell cultures if SEB (staphylococcal enterotoxin B) can induce Fas-ligand on peripheral blood cells (PBMC). Second we evaluated cytokJne secretion by PBMC after SEB treatment and finally investigated if SEB-activated PBMC are able to induce apoptosis in human transitional cell carcinoma cells (TCC) (in vitro). We demonstrated by fiowcytometric analysis pronounced time-and dose dependant induction of Fas-ligand on PBMC by SEB. Further, ELISA assays show a massive, dose dependant secretion of cytokines like IL-2, IFN-&#61543; and TNF-&#61537; released from SEB-stimulated PBMC. In experiments we demonstrated by flowcytometric evaluation of Annexin-V/PI staining that SEB-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells kill TCC cells by Fas-ligand. TCC cells treated with culture supernatant of SEB- stimulated PBMC presented a minimal response only. Application of PBMC at the time of maximum Fas-ligand expression and most pronounced cytokine secretion lead to a massive TCC cell death. In addition, we could show in a rat bladder cancer model that the effect of SEB on tumor cells is reproducable in CD8 we found that SEB treatment leads to an invasion of immune cells into the bladder wall and that all remaining tumors were apoptotic as examined by TUNEL test. No notable toxicity of SEB was observed in the animals. A further evaluation of SEB as a potential candidate for immunotherapy of bladder cancer in a clinical study seems promising. P759 A PLASMA MEMBRANE IMPERMEABLE TRIVALENT ARSENICAL IS A NEW ANGIOGENESIS INHIBITOR. O. Kisker, Donoghue, C. Becket, E. C. Chesterman, J. Folkman, P. Hogg, Philipps-UnJversit~t Marburg, University of New South Wales, Children's Hospital, Univerity of New South Wales (Marburg; Sydney, AUS; Boston, USA) Introduction: Endothelial cell proliferation is central to new blood vessel formation. Some endothelial cell surface proteins undergo redox reactions tP~at can result in reduction, formation or interchange of disulfide bonds. Redox active proteins can be targeted using trivalent arsenicals which form high affinity ring structures with closely spaced cysteine thiols. To investigate antiangiogenic properties we at- tached a trivalent arsenical to the thiol of reduced (GSAO). Method: in vitro and in vivo experiments. For antiproliferative activity different endothelial and non-endothelial cells were used. Additionally GSAO has been used in the chicken CAM-assay for analysis of angiogenesis. The compound was then used to treat a primary human pancreatic cancer (BxPc3) implanted s.c. into the dorsa of immunodefieient (SCID) mice. After tumor volume was at least 100 mm3 mice were randomized into three groups (n=5/group). The first group was injected (s.c.) with GSAO 2mg/kg/day, the second received 10mg/kg/day and the third group received placebo. The ratio of treated to control tumor volume (T/C) was determined. Treated tumors were examined histologically for (CD31), apoptosis (TUNEL) and proliferation GSAO inhibited the proliferation of BCE and BAE cells in a dose depend- ent manner (IC50= 0.1 IJM). GSAO did not effect the proliferation of non-endothe- lial cells. GSAO inhibited angiogenesis in the CAM-assay in manner. Subcutaneous administration 2 mg GSAO /kg /day caused a ~70% inhibition, while administration of 10 mg GSAO/kg/day caused a 90% inhibition of the rate of BxPC-3 tumor growth compared to placebo administration in tumor bearing mice. There was no apparent adverse side effects. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumors indicated a marked reduction in microvessel density in the GSAO-treated tumors (p < 0.001). The proliferation rate of the GSAO-treated tumors were the same. There was a significant increase in the apoptosis rate of GSAO treated tumors (p < 0.001). Conclusion: These findings indicate that redox events on the endothelial cell surface are critical for angiogenesis. GSAO is a new selective and potent ang- iogenic inhibitor and therefore a promising drug for cancer therapy. Cancer ScreeninQ and Quality Assurance Oral Presentation 0760 BREAST CANCER SURVEILLANCE IN WOMEN WITH HIGH FAMILIAL RISK FOR BREAST AND OVARIAN CANCER K. Rhiem, P. Breuer, A. Kempe, C. Kuhl, C. von M, Warm, P. Marlmann, Universit~tsfrauenklinik (Bonn, KSIn) Purpose: As part of the multidisciplinary program ,,Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer\" of the Deutsche Krebshilfe the center in Bonn actually cares for 698 women from 565 families with multiple breast and ovarian cancers. The effectiveness of intensive surveillance in these women is unknown. We present first results from a structured surveillance program offered to these women. Patients and Methods: Women meeting the inclusion criteria for familial breast and ovarian cancer (http://www.krebshilfe.de) were offered to participate in a structured surveillance program including physical examination, sonography every 6 months, mammography and MRI-mammography once a year. Detection rate and screening parameters were analysed after risk stratification. Only women taking part in the program for more than 1 year were took into consideration. These included 45 BRCA mutation carriers, 259 high risk and 177 moderate risk women. Results: Women with a high familial breast cancer risk show a high compliance for the program. Within a median follow-up of 2 years, 43 breast carcinomas were detected. Of these 23 were found in the first screening round and 10 in subse- quent examinations. In 10 cases recurrent tumors were detected. The detection rate was 92.59 for BRCA carriers, 40.31 for high risk and 15.04 for moderate risk per 1000, respectively. MRI-mammography showed the highest sensitivity and specivity of the screening methods. Sonography is superior of mammography in young women with dense breast tissue and is especiarly valuable as an interval investigation method between MRI scans. 85% of tumors were detected in early stages (T1/DCIS) and axillary node negative. Conclusions: With the inclusion criteria of the DKH for ,,Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer\" a group of women at increased breast cancer risk can be identified. The number of detected breast carcinomas in the high risk women is 7 fold higher than in the age matched population. A structural surveillance program including MRI and sonography allows the detection of early tumor stages. (Supported by the Deutsche Krebshilfe e.V.) O761 EUROPEAN GUIDELINES FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE IN MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING - UNDERLYING CONCEPTS AND CONTENT OF THE THIRD REVISED EDITION L. yon Karsa, C de Wolf, Objective The report outlines guidelines on the state of the art in quality assurance of mammography screening which should assure that the greatest possible benefit is achieved in breast cancer screening of the asymptomatic target population while at the same time causing the least possible harm. Materials and Methods Based on experience in European countries with national coverage of population- based mammography screening programmes, the Europe against Cancer Pro- gramme has developed quality assurance guidelines for mammography screening. Guideline development was coordinated by EUREF (European Reference Organi- sation for Quality Assured Breast Screening and Diagnostic Services). Under the supervision of EUREF, paneuropean groups of experts have revised the previous second edition of the guidelines and added new chapters. Results The third revised edition (Perry et al. [2001] European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Marnmography Screening, 360 pages) includes chapters on epidemiology, physico-technical aspects, radiography, radiology, histopathology and cytology, surgical management of screen-detected lesions, result monitoring and training. Draft EUREF certification protocols (working documents) and a document on breast centers from EUSOMA (European Society of Mastology) illustrate how improvements in quality assurance of breast services in screening stimulate quality improvement in breast services in general, i.e, in routine non- sceening services. Implementation the current edition of the European Guidelines is a basic requirement of several current pilot mammography screening programmes in Germany preparing for rolling implementation of the national screening programme beginning in 2003. Conclusions The current revised edition of the European Guidelines show the necessity for improvement in the quality assurance of the entire breast screening process, i.e. all activities associated with provision of screening services, from information and invitation of the target population to performance of the actual screening test and assessment and treatment of breast lesions. Closer cooperation between EUREF and scientific societies and professional associations involved in breast care can promote transfer of advancements in the quality assurance of screening to the nonscreening diagnostic and treatment setting. 0762 SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY VS. DIAGNOSTIC MAMMOGRAPHY - THE NEED FOR DIFFERENT APPROACHES AND SOLUTIONS - LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE INITIAL RESULTS OF THE WIESBADEN MAMMOGRAPHY SCREEN- ING PROGRAMME M. Reichel, H. Aust, B. Breast cancer screening is a public health intervention aimed at lowering breast cancer mortality in the target population. This exercise exposes large numbers of healthy women to diagnostic procedures, and therefore avoidance S 152 Cancer Screening and Quality Assurance of overdiagnosis is an important issue which needs to be addressed by quality assurance. Not surprisingly, reading screening mammegrams requires an approach which differs from that taken in the diagnostic mammography setting. Thus, referral to assessment for benign lesions is contraindicated in screening. Pro- blems and solutions for physicians accustomed to diagnostic mammography will be illustrated from cases and relevant initial results of the population-based mammography screening pilot programme in Wiesbaden, Germany. Materials and Methods: The target population of the mammography screening programme in Wiesbaden and Rheingau-Taunus County consists of a dynamic cohort of ca. 55,000 women (50-69 years). From July to September 2001 the first 1482 women attending screening were examined (CC and MLO projections) in the ambulatory screening centre in the pedestrian zone in the heart of the capital city of the state of Hesse. The rnammograms were read in the screening center on a part-time basis by outpatient physicians heretofore practicing diagnostic mammography in their offices. All readers had received special training in reading screening films and all films were double read under supervision of a reader with special qualification in reading screening films. The results of the screening examination and assessment of women recalled due to suspicion of breast cancer were documented and analysed, Results: By redefining the algorithm for recall to assessment in screening merely 102 (6,9%) screened women were recalled. A key factor in achieving such a low recall rate compared to the diagnostic mammography setting was the inclusion of previous diagnostic mammograms in the decision process leading to recall to assessment.. Closed biopsy was performed in 26 assessed cases (7 micrccalcifications, 19 masses). 12 biopsies yielded malignant and 14 biopsies benign lesions. Conclusions: The initial results in this population-based mammography screening programme fulfil the respective quality standards in the European Guidelines for the Quality Assurance of Mammography Screening. They also demonstrate the necessity for radiologists to differentiate between the screening and the diagnostic setting when reading films. 0763 IMPROVEMENT OF EARLY RECOGNITION OF CUTANEOUS MELANOMA: AN ANALYSIS OF MORE THAN 51.000 CASES OF THE CENTRAL MALIGNANT MELANOMA REGISTRY OF THE GERMAN DERMATOLOGIC SOCIETY U.M. Caroli, TL~bingen (TL~bingen) Background The Central Malignant Melanoma Registry has continuously registered more than 51.000 patients with cutaneous melanoma since the beginning of the eighties. Breslow's tumor thickness of the primary tumor is the most important prognostic factor for primary cutaneous melanomas and developement of early recognition can be analysed by its developement. Patients and Methods The present analysis comprises 44.665 patients diagnosed between 01.01.1980 till 31.12.2000 with primary cutaneous melanoma and data on Breslow's tumor thickness. Mean and median tumor thickness and its trend were analysed and additionally the percentage of thin (< 0,75 ram) and thick (> 4ram) tumors was examined. Results: Mean tumor thickness was 2.2 mm in 1980 and the median tumor thickness at that time was 1.4 ram. A continuous decrease in both, mean and median tumor thickness, has been observed. The mean value of tumor thickness was 1.4 mm (median value 0.6 mm) in the year 2000. The percentage of thin tumors increased from 27% to 60% (Delta 33%), whereas the percentage of thick tumors impaired from 14% to 9% (Delta 5%). Conclusion: During the last two decades a clear decrease in tumor thickness related to a more favorable prognosis in cutaneous melanoma has been observed. This is an indicator of improvement of early recognition of cutaneous melanoma, which is presently the most important contribution to enhance survival probability of this highly malignant tumor. 0764 HELP] NO EC APPROVAL OBTAINED! - PITFALLS IN ESSENTIAL DOCU- MENTS AND STUDY PROTOCOL Gaidzik, Klinikurn Wuppertal GmbH, SCHMID CONSULT International Clinical Research, institute University of Witten (Wuppertal; St. Gallen, CH; Witten/Herdecke) Introduction: Prior to the initiation of a Clinical Study Protocol the investigator has to obtain the approval of a local EC/IRB (Ethic Committee/Institutional Review Board). Frequently this procedure is being prolonged, since during reviewing the application documents, a number of questions have to be resolved by the Study site before the committee will be able to take a definite vote. In the worst case, the project will be rejected due to several reasons including the ethical aspects. However, such events do not fit the interests of both parties, and therefore some main aspects of these discrepancies will be discussed in the following. Method: A number of objectives will be presented, dealing with regularly or typically occurring problems, from the point of view of EC/IRB members and Clinical Research professionals. In addition, an overview will be given on a), basic documents to be submitted; b), essential elements of these documents (e.g., a correctly written Informed Consent is consisting of >20 particular items); c), how critical Protocol formulations might be handled; d), links to qualified aid; etc. Clarifying examples will be given as required. Results/Conclusions: A considerable part of difficulties arising during the EC approval process can be avoided already in advance by preparing all necessary documents as appropriate: E.g., application forms should meet all requirements of the local EC/IRB; the purpose and procedures of the trial should be clearly described; any attachments should be complete. Obeying the rules given by the ethical and professional baselines such as the ICH/GCP guidelines (International Conference of Harmonization/Good Clinical Practice) will diminish misunderstand- ings and unnecessary discussions, facilitate the work and, last not least, save time and money. Poster P765 PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT IN ONCOLOGY S. Hoelzer, S. Hundahl, J. Dudeck, Institute of Medical Informatics, Commission on Cancer, American College of Surgeons (Giessen; Chicago, IL, USA) Measures are designed to evaluate the processes and outcomes of care associ- ated with the delivery of clinical (and non-clinical) services. They allow for intra- and inter-organizational comparison to be used to continuously improve patient health outcomes. The infrastructure for clinical documentation is best developed and reported in the field of oncology, where mostly an interdisciplinary approach is required to diagnose, treat and monitor the malignant disease adequately, in this context, the use of performance measures always means to abstract the complex reality (medical scenarios and procedures) in order to provide an under- standable and comparable output. Measures can focus on global performance. The more detailed data are available the more specific judgements with respect to the appropriateness of clinical decision-making and implementation of evidence are feasible. By providing this information, deficiencies of patient care and unnec- essary variations in the care process can be uncovered. Such variations have contributed to disparities in morbidity and mortality. The developments in information technology offer the opportunity to analyse health-relevant information in order to make the delivery of health care services more transparent for consumers and providers. Global performance measures, such as an overall mortality can give a rough orientation how well health systems perform but they don't offer general solutions nor specific insight in care proc- esses. In contrast to these population-based measures, case-based perform- ance measures use a defined group of patients depending on specific patient characteristics and features of disease (tumour type, histology, staging, grading etc.). By means of these measures we are able to compare the number of patients that received a necessary, since efficient, medical procedure against those patients who did net. The use of case-based measures is a bottom-up approach to improve the overall performance on the long run. They are not only a tool for global orientation but can offer a straight-forward link to the areas of deficient care and the underlying procedures. Performance measures are relevant to providers as well as consumers, both from their own individual perspective. This approach of performance measurement can inform physicians in a meaning- ful and constructive way by monitoring their individual performance and by point- ing out possible areas of improvement. P766 PROSPECTIVE REGIONAL CASE MANAGEMENT-PROJECT OF BREAST CAN- CER PATIENTS STAGE I-IIA (TUZ) is a health insurance founded non profit organisation for data transfer, continous education, and quality improvement for medical processes. The TUZ organizes a prospective case management project monitoring breast cancer patients (I-Ila,<70a) in diagnosis, therapy and follow up in collaboration with 18 regional hospitals , the university clinic and 350 practitioners. All these members are collaborating already in the population based documentation (42.000 follow up treatment of patient)of the Tumorzentrum, initiated since 1992. For the preparation of the prospective study we have performed a retrospective analysis on 200 matched patients about the respective parameters to be tested prospectively. These should serve as control values for the prospective study: - Observance of the guidelines (German cancer society) - Time lags between treatment periods and total time of treatment - Quality of life (EORTC) - Costs. The retrospective analysis data show general accordance with guidelines in 58% of cases observed. Time lags between different treatment periods, e.g. radiation, adjuvant chemotherapy, show range from 0-116 days, middle 58 days. The data presented serve as a base of the prospective part of the study, which will start 2002. Effects of case management will be evaluated by comparison with matched control group. S 153 Cancer Screening and Quality Assurance P767 THE SKIN MELANOMA EPIDEMIC IN GERMANY: ANALYSES FROM THE SAARLAND CANCER REGISTRY. A. Stang, K. Stang, C. of cutaneous malignant melanoma has been rising in almost all caucasian populations. Detailed population-based time trend analyses of skin melanoma incidence and survival in Germany accounting for stage are important to understand the epidemic of skin melanoma and its implications for the survival over time. We analyzed skin melanoma data from the population-based Saarland Cancer Registry in Germany from 1970 through 1996. Incidence rates were ages- standardized (World Standard). We calculated 5-year disease-specific survival rates and assessed the effects of sex, age, calendar period and staging on the prognosis in Cox's proportional hazards models. In addition, we analyzed the mortality data based on death certificates for the same period. From 1970-72 through 1994-96, melanoma incidence increased 170% from 2.4 to 6.5 per 100.000 person-years among males and 150% from 2.4 to 6.0 per 100.000 person-years among females. The incidence increase levels off in the 1990ies. Mortality rates peaked in 1988-90. After 1988-90, the mortality rates declined among females and roughly remained constant among males. The increase in the incidence of localized melanoma and T1-T2 melanoma respectively is driving the overall incidence trend. Five-year disease-specific survival rates considerably increased within all age groups, especially in the oldest age group investigated (60-74): women had higher survival probabilites than men independent from age, stage and calendar period. The improvement of survival over time is most likely due to earlier detection of skin melanoma. The considerable proportion of newly diagnosed skin melanoma with stage T3 or T4 even in the 1990ies implicates a potential for improving the survival by earlier detection of skin melanoma. P768 STATUS REPORT \"ONCOLOGY 2000\" OF THE TUMOUR COUNTRY H. Kurbjuhn, Tumorzentrum Land Brandenburg (Frankfurt (Oder)) Brandenburg is the first country of the Federal Republic of Germany, where full area coverage of clinical cancer follow up documentation exists according to the recommendations of the UICC. The clinical cancer registers of the cancer centres Cottbus and Potsdam and the oncelegic centres Frankfurt (Oder), Neuruppin and Schwedt carry out the documentation of the diagnosed, treated and aftertreated tumour cases in close time relation to their appearance. The statistical relevant data base built up over the past 7 years is supporting very efficiently the therapy and follow up treatment of the patients. The average turnout registration rate of 90% in Brandenburg is demonstrating the effective work of the clinical cancer registers (net considering DCO- cases). The epidemiological relevant part of the data base is going to be included into the Common Cancer register of the new countries of the Federal Republic of Germany and Berlin. The five clinical registers are using the same turnout documentation system. Therefore it is possible to compare and evaluate the data obtained for the whole country. This evaluation is carried out once a year and it is resulting in a common status report. The paper presents the results of the status report ,,Oncology 2000\". This report differentiates from the reports of the former years because other partners of the oncologic care have contributed. Moreover the quality of the report has been improved significantly by using a quality assurance approach supported by the ,,Quality Conference Oncology\". This conference is involving the Health Insurance Companies, the Ministry of Health of the Country Brandenburg, and other partners+ Currently, the activities are focused using the data base for an improvement of treatment and aftertreatment of breast cancer and colorectal cancer. For this purpose two project groups have been formed. The results will be presented in the paper. P769 EARLY DETECTION AND PREVENTION OF TESTICULAR TUMOURS H.C. common malignancy in young men, has increased world-wide for decades. In Germany, about 2,500 malign testicular tumours are diagnosed in young man every year. Upon now, the physical inspection for military service is the only examination in young men which includes inspection and palpation of the testes routinely. Therefore, we analyzed results of the medical examination of the testes in young German draftees. Within 15 years (1983-1998), 8,285 testicular tumours were diagnosed on the occasion of the inspection of military service. This is about 0,19% of 4,266,572 mustered 19-year-old men. In this period, the portion of the mustered 19-year-old men declined from 70% (1983) to 40% (1998). The acceptance of the physical examination of the testes during muster is high: Only two out of 1,100 investigated young German soldiers reported that they had refused palpation of the testes. In this 1,100 young men, different benign diseases of the testes and proven risk factors for testicular cancer e.g. crypterchidism (n=21) and maldescensus testes (n=5) had been diagnosed. The main problem in screening for testicular cancer in 18-35-year-old men is to reach the target group. Primary prevention of testicular turnouts could be performed most effectively on the occasion of the physical examination according to the German youth-work-protective law (,,Jugendarbeitsschutzgesetz\") by identification and treatment of proven risk factors. Secondary prevention by early detection of teeticular tumours could be performed routinely e.g. on the occasion of the medical examination of new employees, the occasion of prescribed preventive medical checkups of the workforce, and routinely checkups by specialists in occupational medicine, general practitioners, and doctors for sports medicine. P770 THE CORRELATION OF PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF BREAST CANCER SCREENING AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS AMONG WOMEN IN GERMANY B. Prieshof, G. yon Minckwitz, J. Steffen, B. Schulz-Zehden, M. Erlangen, Bad Homburg, M[]nchen) Introduction: The long term outcome of breast cancer is positively influenced by early detection. The knowledge of psychosocial factors in women that influence the readiness to participate in screening and prevention posssibly could improve the early detection of BC. Methods: The German Working Group on Chemoprevention conducted a survey by telephone on 758 women representing an adequate sample of the German female population. In a questionnaire we assessed the participation on screening programmes, the attitudes towards BC prevention and special psychosocial traits such as self-esteem, personal body-care, breast-acceptance, breast-problems, fear of disease and fear of BC. Correlations between the questions regarding knowledge about BC, breast examinations and the attitude towards primary or secondary prevention and the psychosocial traits were analysed by a chi-square- test. Results: 83% of the women believe that the chances of a cure of BC are rather bad to none, but 86% believe that early detection can recognise BC in an early and curable stage. 69% of the women quoted to have yearly mammegrams. Women with a high fear of BC and a high index on personal body-care were especially active in regular BC-screening (p<O.001 and p=0.001 resp.) The main reasons stated not to go to serial breast mammograms were forgetfulness (19%) and fear of the examination (13%). 61% women are willing (23% probably, 14% not) to change their lifestyle if this could reduce their BC-risk. Personal body-care and breast acceptance have a positive influence on the readiness to change lifestyle (p<0.001 and p=0.005 resp.). Only 18% of the women believe that medication can reduce the BO-risk, however 43% would use some kind of chemoprevention if it would reduce their BC risk. This readiness is positively influenced by the subjects fear of BC and personal body-care (both p<O.001). Other psychesocial traits showed no significant correlation to the attitudes. Conclusion: Both, fear of BC and a high index on personal body-care are positively related to the readiness of regular breast examinations, changing lifestyle and usage of chemoprevention and may be used for implementation of screening and prevention programs. P771 DO NEW STUDIES OF ISCADOR PROOF EFFICACY IN CANCER PATIENTS? L. Edler, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (Heidelberg) Objective: A recent study has reported a clinically relevant and statisticalry significant prolongation of mean survival time in groups of patients assigned to the mistletoe extract Iscador. The findings have been based on data from a large epidemiological cohort recruited over a long period of time using matched pairs of treated and control patients. Methods: The results were examined for their compliance with criteria of good clinical practice (GCP) and for their value for evidence-based decision making. Criteria were patient selection and eligibility, statistical design, treatment modalities, statistical analysis method, and the information content of the reports. Results: External validity of the treatment result is low because of concerns of the follow-up in large and long-term observational studies and concerns of sub-group selection bias. Statistically inferior subgroup analyses are performed in place of multivariate analyses. Mean survival as outcome measure could be biased due to censored observations. Pooled combination of different tumors and stages does not allow to determine disease specific treatment effects. Finally, there exists uncertainty on quality due to the lack of information obtainable in the published scientific literature. Conclusions: The examined studies range low at a hierarchical quality scale and they do not fulfill the basic requirements of evidence-based medicine as integrating individual clinicar expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research. P772 WORKLOAD IN NURSING - AN EMPIRICAL STUDY COMPARING ONCOLOGY AND NON-ONCOLDGY B. purpose of this study was to explore the workload of nurses in oncology and non-oncology and to describe factors which contribute to it. In literature we found many references indicating that confrontation with sorrow, dying and death represent a special load factor for nurses. Since especially nurses working on oncology S 154 Cancer Screening and Quality Assurance wards are confronted with incurable and dying patients day by day, we hypothesised, that oncology nurses feel more distressed than nurses working in non-oncology. For this reason nurses from the department of general and thoracic surgery and -as a non-oncology comparison group- nurses from the department of ophthalmology (Christian-Albrechts-UnJversity, Kiel) were questioned. Material and methods: We used the ,,workload in nursing\" questionnaire developed by Bartholomeyczik et al. (1989). This questionnaire consists of twelve potential load situations referring to the scales ,,co-ordination and information problems\" and ,,psycho-physical overcharge\"i The analysis focussed on the areas with highest distress. Results: The response-rate was 56.6%. The sample consisted of 61 oncology nurses (51 females and 10 males) and 19 non-oncology nurses (19 females). On the scale ,,co-ordination and information problems\" both groups (oncology and non-oncology) scored higher values than the reference values in literature. Furthermore, the oncology nurses reported a higher extent of ,,psycho-physical overcharge\". We found no correlation between workload and life satisfaction (Diener 1985) and there were no significant differences in life satisfaction between oncology and non-oncology nurses. Furthermore we found a high (negative) correlation between workload and years of professional training (experience), i.e. with increasing years of professional training the nurses felt less distressed. With increasing age there was a similar correlation. Additionally, a strong religious belief was helpful for those nurses that felt extensively loaded. Conclusion: As a result of this study, the overall workload for nurses in both groups was high. Caring for oncofogic patients leads to a high extend of psycho- physic overcharge, which is amplified by lack co-ordination and information. In conclusion we think that especially oncology nurses should be offered psychosocial support or supervision. Another main target should be optimising management on oncology wards to improve working conditions for oncology nurses. P773 PARTICIPATION AT THE EARLY CANCER DETECTION PROGRAM IN CORRE- LATION TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF RISK FACTORS FOR BREAST- AND GENITAL CANCER S.P. Rennet, Y. Werner, Knowledge of risk factors for breast and genital cancer may affect the participation at early cancer prevention programs, A high participation rate is inevitable for the effectiveness of a early cancer prevention programm. Although the participation rate in Germany has been growing from 33 % to 51% many German women are still not involved. The ,,Dusseldorfer Cancer Prevention Study\" was initiated to receive information about knowledge of risk factors and of individual risk assesment from women in correlation to the participation in the early cancer prevention programm. Method: In 24 gynecological offices in Dusseldorf 2108 healthy women (aged 15 to 85 years) were interviewed with a new questionnaire e.g. about the knowledge of risk factors and indivual risk. The questionnaire is part of a nationwide study from the ,,Deutsche Arbeitsgruppe zur Chemopr&vention (DACH)\". 47 questions concerning breast cancer were formed by Paepke et al. (Department of Gynecology, Charite Campus Mitte, Berlin) and 38 questions concerning gynecological cancers were formed by Beckmann et al. (Department of Gynecology, H.-Heine-Universi- t~it, DL~sseldorf), Results: Breast cancer is considered to be the cancer with the highest incidence. For genital carcinoma, cervical cancer is considered to be most common. The overall risk for breast cancer is unknown. More than 2/3 of the women over- or unterestimate their risk for breast cancer. Women are not sufficiently informed about risk factors for breast cancer. Age as risk factor is only mentioned by 57 %. The information about genital carcinoma are even more scanty. Only 50 % know the difference between cervical and endometrial cancer. The individual risk- perception is unknown. More than 25 % have no idea about their own risk. Especially older people underestimate their risk for breast and genital carcinoma. Conclusion: The participation rate at the early cancer detection program is at the selected collective in gynecological offices high. Nevertheless the knowledge about risk factors and the indivual risk is not sufficient. Especially information of older women, where the incidence of gynecological cancer is high, is not adequat. This leads to decreased interest in the early cancer detection program. The gynecologist is the major source of information followed by TV, Radio and magazines. With more information given to patients the participation-rate and with this the effectiveness of screening methods could be increased. P774 QUALITY CONTROL IN COLORECTAL CANCER - POSSIBILITY OF DATA BASED MANAGEMENT USING CLINICAL CANCER REGISTER D. N0rnberg, C. L~schner, J. GmbH (Neuruppin) Introduction: Since 1992 five clinical cancer registers have been built up in the region of Brandenburg. They all use the same eleetronic system (GTDS)which makes it now possible to evaluate the dates of all registration centers of Brandenburg. The registration rate is estimated 88,5 %, which seems to be highly representative. Method: Since 1998 we have been particularly concentrating on the dates of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2000 1231 patients have been registered as newly diagnosed CRC. We found significant regional differences in diagnosed stadium and in quality of surgical therapy (R-0-resection) as well as in compliance with guide lines of adjuvant chemotherapy. Results: Of the 1231 CRC (in 2000) 693 have been diagnosed in men and 538 in women. 1,9 % of 753 colon carcinoma (CC) were only discovered in stadium 0, 15,1% in stadium I, 32,8 % in stadium II, 24,3 % in stadium III und 21,1% in progressive stadium IV. In rectal carcinoma (n= 478) we found following results: 3,1% stadium 0, stadium I 27,2 %, stadium II 20,9 %, stadium III 26,4 %, stadium IV 15,3 %. We found significant regional differences particularly Jn the early stadium 0 and I. We interprete this finding as a sign for insufficient presurgieal endoscopical examination. In some regions non of the histologically examined polypes were found in-situ-carcinoma. Differences in resection rate were ranging between 34,5 and 77%. R-g-resection was reported only in 55,1%. Former surgical studies in Eastern Germany were estimating a complete resection rate (R 0) of 85 %. Similar disappointing differences were found concerning the compliance with guidelines of adjuvant chemotherapy-application. 59 % (in 1999:47,1%) of the CRC in stadium III were reported to have received adequate adjuvant chemotherapy, as compared to the expected 90%. Discussion: The results of this nearly complete clinical cancer register illustrate the defencies in diagnostic and therapy of CRC. In conclusion we are aiming to improve the following procedures for increasing the qualitiy of both diagnostic and therapy: 1. Detailed data analysis, 2. Correct staging, 3. Publication of the dates of the different departments to comply with the established guide lines for adjuvant chemotherapy 4. Proposal for a screening programm-project of CRC in Brandenburg by coloscopy. P775 DIFFERENCES IN on Cancer, University of Utah (Lyon, F; Salt Lake City, USA) Objective: Published penetrance estimates of the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 differ widely, probably due to both genetic and non- genetic effects. The aim of the study was to examine the efficiency and bias associated with different sampling designs and statistical methods for estimation of cancer risk. The incidence of cancers other than breast and ovarian cancer in mutation carriers was assessed. Methods: An extremely large pedigree (K2082; ~1700 documented members) with liability to BRCAl-related cancer due to a nonsense mutation was studied. The pedigree had been identified through a cluster of 4 ovarian and 2 breast cancer cases and is regularly followed-up. Age-specific risk of breast and ovarian cancer was calculated by standard life-table method, maximum likelihood estimation over specified parameters, and maximization of the LOD score. The effect of ascertainment correction and censoring was investigated. Results: The obtained estimates of cumulative cancer risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer differed widely, indicating a strong intra-family variation that depends on the applied method, on the censoring scheme, and on whether the estimates were corrected for ascertainment. Informative censoring increased and ascer- tainment correction lowered the risk. Compared to studies on high-risk families, estimates obtained from K2082 were lower, and closer to those obtained from population-based studies. In carriers, the observed incidence of cancers other than breast and ovarian cancer was nearly threefold higher than the expected rate. No one single cancer site, except possibly prostate, was associated with the BRCA1 mutation. Conclusion: Our results show a variation in the estimated penetrances depending on choice of study population and statistical approach. True and accurate risk estimates provide the basis for individual risk assessment and genetic counselors should be aware of the non-genetic factors with influence on the penetrance. The overall risk of other cancers than breast and ovarian cancer seemed to be increased in mutation carriers. P776 FIRST RESULTS OF THE MODEL PROJECT FOR MAMMOGRAPHIC SCREEN- ING IN BREMEN H. Junkermann, A. Krastel, J. J. von Screening, Pathologisches Institut des ZKH Bremen Nerd (Bremen) The model project in Bremen started in July, 2001. This model project is designed to fulfil the European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Mammography Screening. For implementation of the invitation system it was necessary to make provisions for the data security laws. The invitation office is located at the public health institution in order to protect the privacy of the women who do not participate. The public health service law had to be changed to allow the transmission of the data from the population register. The invitation with a set date contains a brochure about advanteges and disadvantages of participation as well as limits of the method. Mammography is performed at a dedicated office by specially trained technicians. Obligatory double reading is done at the assessment center located at the largest hospital in Bremen (Zentralkrankenhaus St.JQrgenstrasse) by especially trained radiologists. The assessment of suspicious mammograms is done by the same radiologists. Clinical investigation, additional views, ultrasound and ultrasound or stereotactically guided core biopsy are performed in the same session. All results of core biopsy are discussed at a multidisciplinary meeting with the pathologists and gynecological surgeons from Bremen's five large gynecological hospitals, which take part in the surgical therapy of the patients. The breast care nurse and the technicians also attend this meeting. Postoperatively S 155 Cancer Screening and Quality Assurance / Quality of Life, Palliative Medicine, Management of Cancer Pain every case is also discussed by this panel. Up to now (November 2001) 1450 women attended. 118 were invited for assessment. 36 core biopsies have been performed. 16 carcinomas have been detected. During the last months the attendance rate has risen to about 50%. Our experience conferms that it is possible to set up a screening program that fulfils the European Guidelines for Quality Assurance under the conditions of the decentralised German health care system. P777 COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT: MODELPROJECT BREAST HEALTH - HESSEN,GERMANY U.-S. Albert, I. Na6+Griegoleit, Frauenselbsthilfe Darmstadt, Erlensee, Oberreifenberg) The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation inJated, coordinated and funded the modelproject \"Breast Health - Hessen, Germany\". Representatives of 11 key local breast health-related organizations of the county of Hessen set their goal to conduct a needs assessment of breast health services in order to identify, quantify and understand gaps in breast health. Methode: 1.Demographic and service related regional data collection 2. Simulta- neously, comparable questionaires were distributed concerning breast health issues to a representative population based group of healthy women, survivors, outpatient gynecologists, radiologist and general practitioner, hospitals and health care providers. 3. 2 Focus-group were conducted with healthy women and survi- vors Results(Preliminarely): 1. 4750 primary breast cancer cases each year, 1.327 death/year, 60% diagnosed stage II or more. Healthy women (n=323) and survi- vors (n=228) are unaware of the strong correlation between age and breast cancer risk. Primary Source of information for healthy women are gynecologists (60%) and 88% prefer to be approached for early detection by them. 78% of the gynecologists (n=150,21%) recommend regular mammograms. 71% of the gynecologist would adhere to a guideline for early detection. Radiologist (n=20;30%) perform an average of 2500 mammograms/year and see the need for improving quality in early detection. The general practitioner(n=112 random sample) has only 2 breast cancer patients/year and does not consider breasts of symptom-free women to be of his/her concern. 62% of the survivors detected their breast cancer themselves and more than 70% clearly expressed their dissatisfaction with the psychological help and support during diagnosis, treatment and follow- up. Conclusion: The data is judged to be representative for the county and has thus an impact on national level. The primary need is an information and educational campaigne for women and doctors. The second major need which has to be met urgently is by developing local strategies for giving psychological support to women during diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. Already established resources should be promoted to share their know-how in further cooperation. Quality of Life, Palliative Medicine t Management of Cancer Pain Oral Presentation 0778 INFORMATION NEEDS AND PATIENTS COUNSELLING IN Patients' needs for information and help in the decision making process have become an important topic within the last decade. Due to the increasing amount of information by a variety of different media including internet, patients need orientation and individual consultation to enhance their competence in decision making. Therefore, the Tumor Biology Center, Freiburg, has established a research project in 1999. The patients receive a comprehensive consultation including medical aspects, complementary medicine, psychological counselling, diet counselling, as well as consultation concerning physiotherapy and physical therapy. This consultation is addressing those patients who want to take crucial decisions concerning further cancer treatment and who need a second expert opinion, The aim of the study is to get more information about the motivation, reasons for demand, patients information needs and effects of a 'second opinion' consultation, Materials and methods: In a pilot study the consultation procedure has been standardised and documentation systems have been established. Based on this work a study is carried out, asking for patients' needs, expectations and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C3O) before the consurtation. Four months after the consultation, patients are again for their quality of life and whether they have translated into action the recommendations. Results: In November 2001 an initial sample n= 530 patients has been examined and recorded. First results show that the patients complain about lack of time of their physicians and wish more time for detailed discussion including psychosocial aspects of the disease. There is a great demand for consultation on complementary medicine. The patients choose the second opinion, because they need herp for their orientation about advantages and disadvantages of therapy options. Conclusions: A further evaluation shall clarify, which recommendations from the different consultations (medical, psychological, dietary etc.) have been translated into action or, if not, what were the obstacles and barriers. The study shall help to provide detailed information about patients' needs in a comprehensive care system including information and consultation in the after- care. 0779 CHEMOTHERAPY WITH 5-FU / FOLIO ACID HAS NO NEGATIVE IMPACT ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER (UICC Ill). FIRST RESULTS FROM THE ADJUVANT INTACT PHASE lU TRIAL H. Flechtner, A. Wein, T. Liersch, B. Reingruber, J. biological indicators quality of life (QoL) is considered a major outcome variable in the treatment of cancer diseases. In the rnTACT study, chemotherapy with 5-FU / folic acid (CT, 24-h-inf./month over 6 months) is compared with no adjuvant treatment (control group, CG) in patients with colorectal cancer (UICC III) after curative turnout resection. We evaluated whether the cytotoxic therapy impaired the patients' QoL. Patients and methods: This is a prospective, controlled, randomised, multicenter phase Ill trial N=120 patients were evaluated in an interim analysis (date of analysis: 04.10.01). The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire was used for QoL assessment. A one-year follow-up after start of chemotherapy was considered sufficient to evaluate a possible negative impact of the chemotherapy regimen on quality of life. Assessments were performed prior to start of therapy, and after 2, 6 and 12 months. Results: Of all patients, no QoL data were available in 64 patients which was caused by organisational (70.3%, e.g., center did not cooperate)) or patient related (29.7%, e.g., analphabetic, foreign language) reasons. From the remaining 56 patients (CT: 34, CG: 22), 82% of all possible evaluations could be analysed which rate fulfills the EORTC-criteria for a valid interpretation of QoL data (> 80%). Between baseline and endpoint, cognitive functioning improved in CG but slightly worsened in CT (p=.029); however, this finding is mainly due to baserine differences between both groups, cognitive functioning was high both in CT and in CG 1 year after surgery. In [ntra-group analyses, QLQ-C30 scales physical, role, and soical functioning as well as global health status / QoL improved in CT, but remained unchanged in CG, whereas emotional and cognitive functioning improved only in CG. In symptom scales, fatigue decreased in CT, in CG, nausea/vomiting and appetite loss were tess pronounced after 1 year. Conclusions: QoL assessments are still difficult to organise in multicenter clinical trials. In patients with analysable data, CT did not impair but improved relevant QoL dimensions, especially globally assessed QoL. rt may be concluded that active adjuvant treatment even if as toxic as our chemotherapy regimen compared to no treatment might induce beneficial effects in patients with a colerectal cancer after curative turnout resection. Sponsored by Theo and Friedl SchSIler Foundation 078O UNCONVENTIONAL MEDICINE IN standard therapy, oncological patients in a sizeable percentage tend to use different forms of unconventional medicine (UM). UM is defined as diagnostic or therapeutic modality, which is used for prevention, diagnostic or treatment for cancer but wherefor scientific prove of efficacy is weak. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of UM in patients with gynecological and breast cancer. DESIGN: In 2000, 1030 women (20-90a) were questioned with a two-parted questionary (55 questions). In the general part (30 questions), anamnestic and individuelr data were generated. The second part (20 questions) was about specific data about the use of UM. Patients had breast cancer (n=796), en- dometrium cancer (n=40), cervical cancer (n=97) and ovarian cancer (n=97). RESULTS: In a first analysis of 313 cases, 77% of the women have amenorrhoea, 60% have cancer in their family and 40% are smokers. One third of patients is willing to change their live-situation, 19% have serious problems in their relation- ship. 57% have not been thinking about using UM. 38% have used or still use UM. In 92%, UM is additional to conventional medical treatment. As the only therapy, UM is used in 4%. Most common in UM is misteltoe preparations, immunostimulatory drugs, enzyms, vitamins and minerals. 48% spend up to 100 DM per month for UM. In 46%, the UM is payed by the hearth insurance company. We will report about the final results of all 1030 women. CONCLUSION: The results so far show, that every third patient with gynecological cancer or breast cancer uses UM additional to conventional medical treatment. So, UM is a common modality of treatment in cancer patients, physicians should be informed about the different forms of UM. They should be abre to give detailled and serious informations to their patients to help them to find their way in the otherwise very complex field of UM. O781 THERAPEUTIC AND DIAGNOSTIC INTERVENTIONS DURING THE FINAL STAGE OF GYNECOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES - A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF 500 PATIENTS H.L. Sommer, S. Gastroph, K. Gutschow, oncological departments are mainly dedicated to focus the cure of marignant diseases, or, at least, to prorong the patients' lives. The importance of palliative care, i.e, providing best symptomatic care during the final stage of malignant disease in the expectation of a very rimited life expectancy may be greatly underestimated in these institutions. S 156 Quality of Life, Palliative Medicine, Management of Cancer Pain Method: Patients charts of 500 patients with breast, uterine and ovarian malignancies were reviewed for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions during the four final weeks of these patients. In addition, 50 structured telephone interviews with the spouses of the deceased were performed no later than one year after the patients' death. Results: In only 118 patients (23.6 %), the date of death was not approximately anticipated. In 457 patients (91.4 %) radiographic tests, such as x-ray were performed, while in 191 patients (38.2 %) intensified diagnostics, such as computerized tomography were conducted. Multiagent chemotherapies were applied to 219 patients (43.8 %) during the four final weeks of life. Bothering symptoms, classified as major disturbance of quality of life by the patients, could not be treated successfully in 94 patients (18.8 %). Telephone interviews revealed that the spouses' original ambivalent attitude towards diagnostic and therapeutic interventions changed in favour of palliative measures from the retrospective view several months after the relative's death. Conclusion: Frequent diagnostic and therapeutic interventions may compromise patients' quality of life during the final stage of malignant diseases, if these interventions are not solely aimed to improve bothering symptoms. Distracting the informed patient's awareness of the approaching termination of life may prove counterproductive, while psychooncolegical support might be more helpful. 0782 PREOCCUPATION WITH DEATH AND DYING, ANTICIPATION OF POOR PROG- NOSIS AND IMMINENT DEATH AS A SOURCE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER C. Schweiger, T.C. Vollmer, Psychooncological opinion mainly supports an open handling of death-related thoughts in patients with cancer. Although this in the long run reduces fears and raises the quality of (remaining) life, we have to consider that the active unaided process of thinking about and accepting a premature death might lead to an extremely stressful experience. Psychological distress in turn is widely studied in its bad effect on treatment outcome/compliance and patients\" quality of life. We therefore investigated, whether reflections about death and dying and/or the feeling of imminent death (serf-designed Likert-scales) are accompanied by the expectancy of a poor prognosis (considering curability and the life-threatening impact of the disease), psychological distress and a declining quarity of life. In a prospective trial 80 inpatients (mean age 46, range 18-75) with hematological malignancies (approx. 50% in relapse) were given self-rating scales to quantify their reflections about death and dying. Furthermore anxiety and depression (HADS), quality of life (FACT), mood (POMS) and illness-related coping styles (FKV) are surveyed. Analysis show that a present preoccupation with death is highly significant correlated with lowered hopes to be cured and a feeling of impaired health. This is combined with highly significant negative correlations with the total score of quality of life and the subscales ,,psychological well-being\" and ,,spiritual well- being\". Consistent results are shown by the anxiety and depression scores and the POMS-subscale ,,depression\". Moreover, the FACT+subscale ,,spiritual well- being\" admits interesting information about the specific spiritual problems associated with the preoccupation with death and dying and the feeling of nearness to death: as a general tendency, patients see less meaning in life, do not feel inner harmony, may not take comfort in themselves and do not find inner peace or belief, that things will turn out satisfactory. Conclusion; The study suggests, that an momentary activated process of reflecting the deadly outcome of cancer induces accompanying emotionar destabilisation and the need of support. Therefore psychooncological intervention should be available to relieve, to facilitate the acceptance of the deadly progression and to develope a more hopeful attitude. Poster P783 EXPECTATIONS AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY K. Wagner, M. Koller, D. Stula, A. patients' therapy- related expectations in relation to global quality of life before and after radiotherapy Material/methods: In a prospective observational study 85 patients with different tumor-sites were questioned before and after radiotherapy. EORTC QLQ C30, Siegrist's PLC and own scales were used. Results: Factor analysis indicated that therapy-related expectations come in three broad categories: pain-/emotional control, healing and tumor-/symptom control. Patients' healing expectations significantly exceeded the physicians expectations. This expectation was associated with high quality of life. In the group as a whole quality of life was little altered by radiotherapy but it became substatially worse in those patients who had expected healing but percieved that this had failed even though the Karnofsky status did not change. Healing expectation was the only single predictor significantly related to quality of life. Conclusions: Cancer patients' expectation of healing is a component of good quality of life, whereas more limited expectations (pain control, tumor control) relate to lower quality of life. Further studies should implicate patients\" coping strategies in reference to quality of life. P784 IMPROVED OVERALL SURVIVAL AND SUSTAINED QUALITY OF LIFE IN PA- TIENTS WITH GLIOBLASTOMA TREATED WITH MULTIMODAL THERAPIES AT ,RELAPSE P. Hau, U. Baumgart, A. Bock, T. Jauch, H. Koch, A. Survival after first line therapy Js still poor in patients with glioblastoma. In the situation of recurrent disease, the role of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy as second-line treatments have been discussed controversially. This study was performed to elucidate the impact of salvage therapy on survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Furthermore, we addressed the question of changes in quality of life under this treatment. Patients and Methods: In this prospective observational trial, 188 patients were eligible for follow up with evaluation of survival data in 127 patients and quality of life data in 47 patients at this point. 90 of them received therapy at relapse. Results: A statistically significant improvement for median overall survival after diagnosis (mOS-1, 66 weeks) and after initiation of salvage therapy (mOS-2, 35 weeks) compared to a standard group (mOS-1, 30 weeks and mOS-2, 15 weeks) and to historical controls could be demonstrated. Progression free survival at 6 months, 12 months and 24 months and overall survival at 12 months was favourable in the group with serial interventions as well. Therefore, median overall survival was armost doubled in comparison to the standard group and to historical data if serial interventions were performed. These results seem to be dependent on certain prognostic factors like age, completeness of first resection, and Karnofsky performance score at relapse. Moreover, our data suggest that re-interventions go along with sustained quality of life as evaluated with the validated quality of life questionnaire EORTC C-30. Conclusion: We conclude that in the setting of recurrent or progressive glioblastoma, re-interventions are feasible and advisable, especially in patients with good prognostic factors as age under 55 and Karnofsky performance score over 60, and can be performed without decreases in quality of life. P785 PALLIATIVE RESECTION OF GASTRIC CANCER: IMPACT OF SYMPTOMS ON POSTOPERATIVE SURVIVAL AND QUALITY OF LIFE V. Kahlke, B. Kf3chler, A. Schmid, B. Kremer, Uniklinikum KJel (Kiel) Patients with advanced gastric cancer may present mild or severe symptoms. Palliative resections have been shown to increase survival in some patients with incurable gastric cancer. In this single-center-study the impact of preoperative intensity of symptoms on the surgical procedure, postoperative survival and QOL was evaluated in a palliative setting. In a retrospective analysis of 405 patients with gastric cancer treated between 1992 and 2000, 133 (33%) patients suffered from incurable disease (tumor stage pTxNxM1). Patients were classified to have major symptoms, if presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, stenoeis or perforation caused by the tumor. All other patients were defined to have minor symptoms. Since 1998 QOL was assessed by EORTC-questJonnaire prospectively, including 20 patients with incurable disease. The questionnaires were given to the patients before operation, before discharge and 3 months after operation and analysed by t-test. Survival, hospital mortality and morbidity were assessed and analysed by log-rank-test and Chi-Square-Test, respectively. 55 of 133 patients (41%) with incurable gastric cancer presented with major-symptoms and 78 patients with minor symptoms. 43 of the patients with major symptoms (78%) underwent gastrectemy, and 12 (22%) patients underwent laparatomy only or gastrojejunostomy (Lap). Gastrectomy was performed in 63 patients (81%) with minor symptoms and 15 patients (19%) underwent Lap. In patients with incurable gastric cancer hospital mortality with 11.3% was significantly greater than in the group of patients undergoing surgery for curable gastric cancer (4%), with no differences between patients with or without major symptoms. The morbidity in patients with major and minor symptoms was almost equal (41% and 40 %, respectively). Patients with minor symptoms survived with a median survival of 6 months significantly longer than patients with major symptoms (4 months), which was not influenced by the type of operation. QOL was not different in patients with major or minor symptoms before operation or 3 months thereafter. However, before discharge, patients with major symptoms estimated their QOL better than patients with minor symptoms. In patients with incurable gastric cancer the preoperative intensity of symptoms has a significant impact on QOL and on the survival following the operation. However, it has no influence on the type of surgical procedure. P786 QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND ACUTE TOXICITY UNDER RADIOTHERAPY AS A FUNCTION OF AGE A. Peters, H. Willers, A. Hartmann, Lukaskrankenhaus, UniversitAtsklinikum (Neuss, D0sseldorf) Purpose: Despite an aging population, toxicity data on elderly patients is scarce. In this prospective single-institution cohort study we investigated the influence of age on quality of life (QoL) and acute toxicity for various standard radiation treatments outside a crinical trial. Patients and Methods: One-hundred-and-fifty-nine consecutive patients who S 157 Quality of Life, Palliative Medicine, Management of Cancer Pain underwent radiation therapy of the breast-, the chest-, the head&neck- and the pelvic region were enrolled. Quality of life and acute toxicity were assessed by EORTC questionaires (QLQ-C30, QLQ-BR23, QLQ-LC13, QLQ-H&N35) and CTC- scores prior to and at the end of the radiation course. Data were dichotomised at an age of 70 years. The resulting groups were balanced with regard to gender, tumour site, radiation dose and additional chemotherapy. Results: Overall, QoL slightly decreased under radiotherapy but there was no significant difference between older and younger patients. The same applied to the recorded CTC-scores. In a subgroup analysis, treatment related toxicity was least in breast cancer patients and most pronounced under radiation of the head&neck region. Especially younger lung cancer patients had a better QoL after treatment despite some toxicity. The site of irradiation had stronger influence on QoL and CTC than age. Conclusion: The data suggest that the impact of radiotherapy on QoL and acute toxicity is not age-dependent following various standard treatments of breast-, bronchus-, pelvic and head&neck carcinomas. P787 PLACES OF DEATH IN JENA, THORINGEN, IN 1999 B. van Oorschot, V. Klak, Jena e.V. (Jena) Several recent surveys show that most people want do die at home. In Germany, there is very few data about the places dying actually takes place. We know that about 60 - 90 % died in a hospital, but we don't know anything about the percentages of people dying in homes for the elderly, nursery homes or at home. Ochsmann (1998) showed that 39% of deaths occurred in private homes, 56% were institutional (hospital 43%, nursery home 14%). Own recent studies (2001) reveal that 77% of the Th0ringen inhabitants want to die at home. Method: In June 2001 we analyzed the 1999 death certificates in Jena (a town in ThQringen with a population of about 100.000). These certificates distinguish between four different places of death: private home, hospital, nursery home and others. Additionally, we documented the cause of death in three groups: Malignancy (ICD C00-C96), accidents, poisoning and other consequences of defined reasons (ICD 10S00-T98) and others. Our results are compared to a similar study done in Rheinland-Pfalz in 1998. Results: AIItogether, 860 deaths occured in Jena in 1999. 247(28%) people died in private homes, 155(18%) in nursery homes, 418(49%) in a hospital and 40(5%) in other places. Looking at patients dying from malignant diseases, 115(54%) died in a hospital, 69 (32%) at home , 24 (12%) in nursery homes and 4(2%) in other places. Summary: Comparing the data from Jena and Rheinland-Pfalz, there are significant differences in the places of dying. Moreover, there is an obvious gap between the places people theoretically prefer for dying and the actual places death occurs. Especially the high percentage of patients with malignancies dying in hospital in Jena is striking, because in these cases death usually is not a sudden incidence. We know that with good palliative care more than 70% of patients die at home with good symptom control. In Jena, an in-patient palliative-care unit is missing as well as an out-patient palliative care team. P788 COMBINED TREATMENT WITH RADIOTHERAPY AND IBANDRONATE FOR METASTATIC BONE DISEASE O. Micke, F. Bruns, E. Horst, N. Universit~itsklinikum (MOnster) The aim of this explorative randomized phase II-study was to investigate the synergistic effects of local radiotherapy combined with intravenously applied Ibandronate. From 10/1999 until 11/2001 32 patients (median age 57 years) with lyric bone metastases from various solid tumors were treated. 25 were analyzed. ECOG- PS: 0-2. Median follow-up: 12 months. A total dose of 36 to 40 Gy (single dose 2 Gy) was locally applied on painful metastases. Treatment group A (n=13) received 4 mg Ibandronate i.v. on the first day of irradiation plus 3 mg every 28 days for one year. Group B (n=12): 1 mg Ibandronate on day 1, 8, 15, 22 of radiotherapy and an additional 3 mg i.v. every 28 days for one year. The patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups A and B, stratification according to histology. Pain intensity was measured using a visual analog scale (VAS), the need for analgetics was documented (WHO-analgesics-score) and recalcification was semiquantitatively analyzed. A retrospective matched-pair analysis with a historic control group was also conducted. The median baseline VAS-score was 8 (range: 10-4): B: 7 (range: 10-4). 8 weeks after the beginning of treatment the median VAS-score was 1 (range: 5-0): B: 0 (range: 3-0). At the time of data analysis the median VAS-score was 0: group A: 0 4-1); group B: 3 5-1). After 8 weeks of treatment the median analgesics score was 1 (range: 4-0): group A: 1 (range: 4-1); group B: 1 (range: 3- 0). At the time of data analysis the median analgesics score was 1 (range: 3-0): In group A 3/13 patients had a complete, 6/13 had a partial and 4/13 a beginning recalcification. In group B the numbers for complete, partial and beginning recaleification were 4, 5 and 3 out of 12 patients, respectively. The total recalcification rate (complete and partial) was 18/25 (72%). There was no significant difference between both treatment groups. Compared to the historic control group there were significant better results in terms of pain relief and recalcification (72% vs. 48%; p<0.5). Conclusion: The combination of local radiotherapy and intravenously applied Ibandronate leads to a fast and substantial pain relief with a long term effect. P789 EFFECTS OF MODERATE EXERCISE TRAINING ON IMMUNOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS IN THE REHABILITATION OF COLON CAN- CER PATIENTS T. Schulz, H. L6tzerich, B. (K61n, Bad Oeynhausen) For a couple of years moderate physical exercise has been inversely associated with colon cancer and metastasis. Physical activity modulates immune functions and psychological reactions and is said to lead to a reduced transit time of potential carcinogens in the faecal stream. Besides the preventive character of moderate physical activity on carcinogenesis it seems to be appropriate to use moderate sport in the rehabilitation of cancer patients to restabilize immunological functions and psyche. We investigated therefore the influence of a 5 week ergometer training on parameters of the immune system and the psychological reactions in the rehabilitation of colon cancer patients. 49 female and male colon cancer patients took part in the study; 25 patients belonged to the training group, 24 to the control group. Ergome- ter exercise training was to be performed once a day for about 40 minutes, 5 days per week for 5 weeks at a moderate training level. Before and after the 5 week training period blood samples were taken to determine natural killer cell cytotoxicity, phagooytosis and burst activity of granulocytes and were investigated by flow cytometry. For the determination of the psychological parameters we used two questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30, FPI-R). At the end of the study there was an increase in the duration of the training time and the power of the training group. But this did neither induce changes of the natural killer cytotoxicity nor changes of the phagocytosis activity of the granulocytes and monocytes. Even the burst activity showed a significant decrease due to the physical activity. No significant changes could be found due to the training, neither in the leukocyte nor in the lymphocyte subpopulations. In addition, we discovered positive changes in psychologicaJ parameters like mood status and the valuation of the quality of life. Besides, we found positive correlations between immunological and psychological parameters. In conclusion, our study supports that moderate exercise training in the rehabilitation of colon cancer patients is an alternative way to restabilize the immune functions and the psychological reactions. Further investigations have to show if an exten- ded exercise training period of the cancer patients may obtain improved effects on the immune system. P790 SELENIUM IN THE TREATMENT OF RADIATION-ASSOCIATED LYMPHEDEMA after surgical and/or radiotherapeutic treatment or as a consequence of tumor compression. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of selenJum in the treatment of lymphedema of the trunk, the extremities and the head and neck region in radiation oncology. Material and Methods: Between 1996 and 2000 a total of 48 patients were treated for acute or chronic lymphedema. 8 had an edema of upper extremities and 4 of the lower extremities; 36 patient suffered from lymphedema in the head and neck region. 20 of these patients showed signs of an endolaryngeal edema associated with stridor and dyspnea The patients received sodium selenite (350 IJg/kg m2 body surface daily p.o.) over four to eight weeks. If the treatment was not effective after 4 weeks, additional proteolytic enzymes could be given. All patients had a stage 0 to 2 according to the classification of F61di. The treatment effect was evaluated at the end of therapy and two months later: The circumference of the extremity was measured by a standardized equipment. Additionally the skin folds index and a five-items score adopted from Miller et al. and the RTOG was used. According to this scale all patients had a grade II to IV. The self-assessment of the patient was done by a visual analog scale (VAS). Results: In patients with edemas of the extremities we found a significant reduction of the circumference compared to the unaffected side as well as an improvement of skin folds. Clinically 32/48 patients had a marked reduction of lymphedema. According to the five-items score 14/18 evaluated patients had an improvement of more than one grade. The self-assessment with VAS showed a reduction of 3.2 points. 14 patients received additional proteolytic enzymes. These drugs were effective only in 2. No tracheostomy was necessary in 13/20 patients with endolaryngeal edema, further 5 patients received a temporary tracheostomy, and only 2 patients got a permanent tracheostomy. No episodes of erysipelas were observed. Overall the treatment was well tolerated by all patients. Conclusion: Our results suggest that sodium selenite has a positive effect on acute and chronic lymphedemas in radiation oncology. The treatment is well tolerated and easy to deliver. S 158 Quality of Life, Palliative Medicine, Management of Cancer Pain P791 IMPACT OF SURGERY ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER C. Schmidt, M. L6hnert, H. Objective: To Measure the impact of surgical procedures on perceived quality of life (QoL) for patients with colerectal cancer. Hypothesis: Differences surgical procedures for colorectal cancer are associated with different outcomes in perceived of quality of life. Methods: This retrospective study included 570 patients with colorectal cancer who had undergone surgery at least one year previously in our department from January 1992 to December 1997. All patients who were alive on 1st April 1998 received a questionnaire about socio-economic parameters, general and disease specific QoL. Details of medical and drug history, histology, stage of disease and therapy given were collected from the patient's charts, General quality of life was measured with the EORTC-QLQ-C-30 and specific Qol was measured with a module for colorectal cancer. In addition, the patients received a questionnaire asking about the extent of incontinence and problems with the colostomy including sexual dysfunction. Patients were divided into groups with abdominoperineal resection (APER), anterior resection (AR) with/without Pouch and resection of the sigma (SR). Results: There were no significant differences between the surgical procedures regarding the scales of the EORTC-QLQ-C-30. All questionnaire used, showed a good reliability and validity. The grading and staging of the tumor had no significant influence on patients QoL. Incontinence was the most important factor for patients with AR plus pouch with adverse effect on QoL. This factor was dependent on the anatomical site of the tumor. Radiochemotherapie had only negative impact on QoL in patients with APER. For patients receiving APER sexuality was more impaired than for patients receiving AR or SR. Men scored significantly worse than women. Sixty percent of the patients with APER needed help with their colostomy. Only 20% did and irrigation. The age of the patient at surgery had significant influence on outcome in terms of QoL.. Conclusion: QoL is an important additional parameter to measure outcome after colorectal surgery, especially with regard to incontinence, impact of colostomy and sexual life. P792 TOTALLY IMPLANTABLE BRACHIAL VENOUS PORTS SYSTEMS FOR PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY: HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE AND LESS ACCESS- RELATED COMPLICATIONS B. Schlehe, C. Rudlowski, (Aachen) Introduction: Venous access is a problem for patients receiving prolonged courses of cytotoxic therapy. in particular for breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy a safe and comfortable intravenous access is very important. We descripe the safety, effectiveness and impact on quality of life of brachial implanted central-venous miniport systems. Methods: Beginning in September 1999, 110 venous miniports (Cook titanium Petite Vital-Ports, Cook Canada, Stouffville, Ontario) were implanted in 107 cancer patients for infusion of antineoplasmic agents and antibiotics among them 88 breast cancer patients. The retrospective analysis was performed analysing outcome measurements as port complications, access strategy failure, access- related anxiety, pain and quality of life. The quality of life was asked in questionnaires. Results: All ports were successfully implanted. There were no procedure-related complications. In 254 patient days per implanted port-system 17 complications occurred (15,5%). 6 systems (5,5%) were changed due to infection, leakage of the catheter near the chamber or dislocation. The patient's acceptance of the port- systems was very well. Conclusion: Brachia] central-venous miniport system implantation is a safe and easy procedure with a high success rate and low complication rate which can be performed in an outpatient setting. Especially after surgery for breast cancer a brachial implanted miniport system is a functional and cosmetical superior alter- native compared to conventional port systems. P793 INFLUENCE ON QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIO- THERAPY AND SIMULTANEOUS RADIO-CHEMOTHERAPY B. Schymura, Radiotherapy causes further distress on cancer patients. Both, a tumorspecific therapy and, for example patient's age, Karnofsky performance scale and tumor stage as well, are factors which influence quality of life. Reason of the study: Are there differences of quality of life (qol) of patients who obtain only radiotherapy (RT) and patients undergoing a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy (RCT)? Methods: 767 (53%) of 1447 patients gave their consent and fulfilled inclusion criteria. 460 (31,8%) patients completed sociedemographic variables and parameters of their disease and the following clinically established questionnaires of psychodiagnostics at three defined dates of measurement (q-1 = at the beginning, T2 = at the end, T3 = six weeks after termination of therapy): Questionnaire on Life Satisfaction (FLZ), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G), Self- Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Questionnaire on Psychosocial Distress (FBK), Questionnaire on the Assimilation of Disease (FKV), Social Support Scale (SSS) and Questionnaire on side effects (NW-X). Results: 325 (70,7%) patients received only RT, 135 (29,3%) patients RCT. The mean age was 56 respectively 61 years. Sociodemographic variables as well as parameters of the disease had no influence on qol. No statistically significant influence on life satisfaction was to be proven in both groups. Physical wellbeing of patients receiving RCT was significantly worse at \"1\"2 and T3, but reached nearly the same scores at T3 like at T1. Patients undergoing RCT showed significantly higher values of depression only at T2. Both groups presented a low level of psychosocial distress, preferred suitable mechanisms of coping and socially were well supported. Side effects were noticed as low or moderate by all patients. Conclusion: Qol of patients undergoing radiotherapy wasn't significantly influenced by simultaneous chemotherapy. The results of this study could be useful for the decision of a tumorspecific combined therapy. P794 INFORMATION SERVICE FOR CANCER PAIN : A TELEPHONE INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM CANCER PAIN AND THEIR RELATIVES S. Simon, Informationsdienst Krebsschmerz (Heidelberg) AIM: In March 2000, the telephone information service ,,Krebsschmerz\" (Cancer Pain) was added to the cancer information service of the German Cancer Research Center with the aim of improving the situation of cancer patients. Initially, it was financed for a year by the German Federal Ministry for Health. As of July 2001, the project has been supported by the National Associations of Health Insurance Funds. The provision of individual, patient oriented information is intended to support the preservation or rediscovery of a good quality of life despite serious illness. Well informed patients: - Can communicate better way with the doctor treating them - Are able to cope with problems caused by therapy - Have less reservations about therapy involving medication - Experience subjectively less pain Procedure: The service provides patients with comprehensible and scientifically founded information on therapy for tumor pain. - It informs patients or their relatives individually on the basis of the WHO pain scheme and the current state of knowledge in the treatment of pain. - It provides informative material and the addresses of specialized institutions. - It attempts - as far as possible - to ascertain the reasons for the inadequate treatment of the patient concerned and to encourage communication about these problems between the patient and the doctor. Previous Experience: There are two clearly identifiable areas that can be seen as the cause of insufficient patient care: - Incomplete implementation of WHO recommendations - Lack of communication between the patient and doctor A survey was carried out of 120 cancer patients affected by pain by telephoning them back four weeks after initial contact was made. This provided the following results: - Approximately 70% of the patients reported a significant reduction in pain. - In the time period mentioned, over 80% of patients had spoken about the pain with the doctor treating them. - The quality of the therapy for the pain had, in the opinion of those concerned, improved from ,,inadequate\" to ,,satisfactory\". The number of those classifying their therapy as ,,good\" or ,,very good\" had clearly risen. Conclusion: Comprehensible information, in connection with good communication between the patient and the doctor treating him/her, is clearly a significant prerequisite for improving the situation of the patient suffering from tumor pain. P795 REFERENCE-CENTER ON QUALITY OF LIFE - RESULTS AFTER THE FIRST 4 YEARS T. KL)chler, M. Berend, J.-U. 12. 2001 the ,,Deutsche Krebshilfe\" (DKH) granted the set up of a new reference center (RC) on Quality of Life (QoL) in Oncology. The goals of this project were: - to promote and educate methods of QoL-assessment, - to counsel scientific protocols on how to evaluate QoL in specific research questions or areas, - to initiate QoL - studies in Germany and - to start building up a QoL - databank for different tumor entities. These goals have all been achieved, except the databank, which has been realized only in parts. In detail: The first goal - promotion and education of QoL-assessment has been adressed with 26 scientific publications, 13 book-chapters, 58 talks at scientific meetings, 32 published abstacts, 25 talks in cont. education programs and 24 posters. Concerning the second goal -counselling on QoL- about 70 different studies/ protocols have been assisted (from doctoral thesis up to multi-center- trials). ,,Typical problems\" in this area were - the lack of genuine research questions in the QoL-part of the study/protocol and an according studydesign; - the use of appropriate QoL-instruments; - ,,technical\" aspects of QoL-assessment; - the S 159 Quality of Life, Palliative Medicine, Management of Cancer Pain appropriate evaluation concept; - appropriate statistical methods (FORUM 5/ 2000). For the third goal two major activities can be pointed out: First within the prospective quality-assurance program ,,Operative Oncology\" QoL-assessment at 6 timepoints (from preop, to 2-years-followup) became clinical routine. With more than 2000 expected surgical patients with gastrointestinal or lung cancer an accurate description of the course of QoL after surgical intervention will be possible. Furthermore specific surgical and oncological questions can be adressed by ,,tailoring\" the overall dataset into specific subsets. Second major area concerns prostate cancer: recently of 5 different studies on PCA, of which some have been assisted by the RC, QoL- and medical data have been collected to perform an empirical metaanalysis on now more than 1OOO PCA-patients. Accordingly - looking at the fourth goal- mainly QoL-data of patients with gastrointestinal cancer, lung cancer and prostate cancer are the core of the QoL-databank, which is still in the process of being built up. In summary an interdisciplinary center for QoL-research has been succesfully established in German oncology, thanks to the DKH. The future challenge will be to keep it alive and working, since QoL will certainly stay being a topic in modern oncology. EUTHANASIA: Innenstadt (M0nchen) Medical doctors in civilized countries are increasingly faced with decisions about end-of-life issues. This is a consequence of an increasing population ageing and considerable advances in medical technology in the fields of life sustaining and prolonging treatments where the process of dying has begun and the prognosis is poor. Moreover, the bioethical principle of respect for the patient's autonomy is being overstressed in the physician-patient relationship so that patients can even claim for termination of their lives. As a result, The Netherlands have legalized euthanasia on 10 April 2001, empowering the doctors with the possibilities of actively killing and assisting in patients' suicides when patients choose for that ,,alternative\". Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide have been daily practice in the Netherlands for many years, where pain, suffering, degradation and the wish to die with dignity are the main reasons why patients request for euthanasia. Physicians will be exempted from criminal liability, provided they satisfy the so- called due care criteria. The ,,Death with Dignity Act\" from 1997 permits physician in Oregon to prescribe lethal pills to their incurable patients. Germany belongs to those European countries which strongly refuse the Dutch euthanasia policy. However, euthanasia has never been part of the medical duty of care. Not the killing of patients, but the effective relieving of pain and suffering should be the leading principle of medical and ethical practice. This can be reached by good palliative care with providing competent skilled care which is inherently embedded in a virtuous attitude of compassionate caring about the patient as a person. The current article rejects killing as due care for several reasons, but proposes a novel concept of 'RAHME' which demands from physicians to be companions to the terminally ill and dying until death. The attitude of Rahme faces the vulnerable and dependent human individual corporeality that does not loose his or her dignity despite all his or her infirmity and frailness. In this sense, RAHME-based alleviating care, as it has been incorporated in the 'Principles Concerning Terminal Medical Care' by the German Medical Association and in the recommendations of the Council of Europe, provides active life support. Active killing is superflous, ethically unjustifiable and should remain a criminal offence. P797 THE INTRODUCTION OF ANTIEMETIC REGIMENS - ROLE OF MACY A. Klinikum Fulda (Fulda) The control of chemotherapy-induced emesis and nausea has been improved by the introduction of 5-HT3-antagonists. The good control of acute emesis led to an uncontrolled use of 5-HT3-antagonists in our hospital. The costs of 5-HT3- antagonists should be reduced without influencing the effectiveness of the therapy. Since October 1996 guidelines for antiemetic therapy are established at a medical ward. 5-HT3-antagenists are administered in combination with corticosteroids intravenously only at the day of chemotherapy. The antiemetic therapy is dispensed by the pharmacy together with the chemotherapy for the individual patient. For at least 4 days the patient receives metoclopramide and/or corticosteroids as oral medication. The effect of the therapy is documented by the patient himself with the help of record-sheets. Within one year 500 cycles had been administered, 186 (37%) record-sheets returned and were evaluated by the pharmacy. The complete control of emesis was 93%, of emesis and nausea 78%. The costs have been reduced to nearly 50%. The regimens were introduced at the gynaecologic ward as well. Within six months 227 cycles of chemotherapy and antiemetics had been administered, 117 (52%) record-sheets were returned to the pharmacy. The control of emesis was 53%, of emesis and nausea 21%. Delayed emesis and nausea occurred often (47% / 77%) due to the lack of compliance for the oral medication on day 2 to 5. Since January 1997 the information of the patients has been improved by leaflets and counselling. From January to June 79 record-sheets of 165 (48%) returned. Delayed emesis and nausea could be further reduced (25% / 52%), because of a better compliance. A re-evaluation in 2000 verified these results. Guidelines, the control of the therapy by the patient himself and co-operation of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and technicians led to an effective antiemetic therapy. P798 ORAL KETAMINE IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER PAIN IN AN OPIOID- In most tumor patients pain treatment according to the WHO scheme results in satisfactory and efficient pain control. Nethertheless, in a minority of patients pain therapy fails due to development of opioid tolerance. The blockade of N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors has strong analgetic effects by opioid-independent mechanisms. Moreover, experimental data suggest the involvement of glutamate release and subsequent activation of NMDA receptors in development of opioid tolerance. Therefore, the use of drugs with NMDA antagonistic properties might achieve analgesia as well as prevent opioid tolerance. Case: A 13-year-old cachectic boy with advanced neuroblastoma was presented to us with ubiquitous pain. Pain intensity was rated as worst pain possible. Pain therapy consisted of 700 pg/h transdermal fentanyl and paracetamol. Additional administration of morphine was without any significant effect. Under the assumption of opioid tolerance development we supplemented pain therapy with oral L- methadone 15 mg/d which is thought to possess NMDA antagonistic properties. Within 10 days, the boy was able to reduce the dose of fentanyl to 450 IJg/h and a satisfactory analgesic therapy was achieved. Four weeks later, reappearing pain necessitated readmission of the patient. Again, opioids alone were insufficient. Thus, we replaced L-methadone by ketamine i.v. to achieve a stronger NMDA antagonistic effect. Synchronously, we changed transdermal fentanyl to i.v. morphine. After 36 hours, morphine and ketamin were converted to an equianalgesic oral administration. The child was released to home care with oral ketamine 5 x 100 mg/d and slow release morphine 3 x 600 mg. He rated pain as mostly moderate. No significant side effects, especially no hallucinations were observed. Discussion: A limited number of studies reports beneficial effects of parenteral ketamine in adult cancer patients (1, 2). Very few case reports deal with oral administration of ketamine (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of oral ketamine therapy for cancer pain in pediatric oncology.Ketamine and possibly other drugs with NMDA antagonistic properties might be a valuable tool in refractory pain. Further research concerning dosage and long term effects is desirable. 1) Bell RE Pain. 1999; 83:101-3. 2) Mercadante S, Arcuri E, Tirelli ANALYSIS OF COMPLEMENTARY/ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (CAM) USE BY HEAD NECK CANCER PATIENTS J. BQntzel, M. Glatzel, O. becomes more importance in the treatment of patients with advanced head and neck cancer too. The purpose of this analysis was the statistical description of the preparations and treatment used by our patients after succesful finished primary therapy. Material and methods: From March to October 2001, the interviews of 174 patients of the out-door-department (Suhl) were analyzed. Patients comprised 32 women and 142 men with a median age of 60 years (range 31-80). The follow- uptime was in median 2 years (range 0-12). All patients were irradiated during the primary therapy. At the time of interview 48/174 (27,5 %) patients were still smoking, and 106/174 (60,9 %) were still drinking alcohol. UICC-stagee: I - 9 pts, II - 20 pts, III - 31 pts, and IV - 114 pts. Results: 100/174 patients (57,5 %) did not carry out any further supplementary therapy. 42,5 % admitted carrying out an additional therapy. The median time of usage was 12 month (range 1-72) The patients reproted in detail about: spiritual helps in 2 cases, physical therapies in 15 cases, mistle applications in 12 cases, vitamins in 36 cases, encymes/co-factors in 4 cases, other biological forms of treatment in 16 cases, substitution of trace elements and electrolytes in 27 cases, other alternative, not categorized therapies in still 11 cases. The therapies were used after asking the family doctor in 31/74 cases and the pharmacist in 53/ 74 cases. The oncologist was informed in only 25/74 cases. 24/74 patients reported about better general appearance due to alternative therapy, 49/74 have not seen any changes. Conclusions: Nearly the half of all head neck cancer patients are carrying out CAM after succesful treatment of the primary disease. The head and neck oncologist has to include this knowledge into his considerations. The value of such preparations has to be tested in further studies. P8OO OPTIMIZING MULTIMODAL STRATEGIES IN ONCOLOGICAL THERAPY IN A SURGICAL DEPARTMENT E. Staib-Sebler, Uniklinik Frankfurt (Frankfurt am Main) Purpose: Pre-peri-and postoperative chemotherapy has to be carried out in multi- modal gastrointestinal therapeutic strategies. A pilot project was established in the department of general surgery to combine the aspects of internal and surgical therapy. We started in 1992 with a physician specialized in medicine and psychotherapy. She was not participating in the usual surgical routine and rotations. Today this team consists of a second resident not participating in the rotations, a nurse, a receptionist and a study nurse. Methods: The field of responsibility covers the indication and administration of S 160 Quality of Life, Palliative Medicine, Management of Cancer Pain intra - arterial and systemic chemotherapies, and its follow up. Mostly, treatment was guided by study - protocols (SAKK, EORTC, ALM, CAO, AIO). To improve patient' s quality of life, therapies where conducted on an outpatient base. The team was also disposable for psycho-social care of the patients and their relati- ves, and, furthermore, was disposable for supervision of the nurses. Pts were constantly looked after beginning from the time of their diagnosis of cancer throughout the complete course of disease. By this management, identification with a life threatening disease was facilitated. Because chemotherapy and follow up were conducted in the department of surgery, an optimal flow of information concerning intraoperative results and postoperative follow up was possible. Results: 2692 treatment plans with 330 pts in the year 2000 were conducted. Therapy consisted of cytostatic chemotherapy (60%), examination of new patients (10%), monitoring of disease (20%) and practising supportive care and psychotherapy (10%). Between 1992-2000, 364 patients which were oncologically supervised are deceased and 171 (46%) are still alive in live in good condition at home. Conclusion: By intensifying the central idea of patient' s care we improved the quality of life and life expectation of our pts, as it was shown in several studies. With this pilot project, many pts had the option to cope with their death at home (47%), which is a remarkable improvement compared to 12% of those pts which were usually allowed to die at home. In our opinion, a non - surgeon physician, who is constantly available for cancer - patients is a desirable prerequisite to fulfil a holistic claim to treat patients. This is even possible in the daily routine of a university hospital. P801 PALLIATIVE-CARE-TEAMS IN MECKLENBURG-VORPOMMERN - THE CAN- CER PAIN J. Ernst-Moritz-Arndt- Universit~t (Greifswald) Aim of the investigation: The cancer pain initiative Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (MV) is a joint demonstration project of the medical board MV and the pain service at the E. M. A. University Hospital, sponsored by the Federal Minister of Health. It was run 1996-2000 to improve outpatient palliative care in cooperation with general practitioneers (gp's) and district nurses. Methods: A survey in 500 physicians was conducted 1997 and 1999 in two regions: Mecklenburg and Vorpommern. Quality management interventions in three counties of Vorpommern include: (1) information for professionals, patients, relatives about cancer pain therapy and palliative medicine, (2) four quality circles (participants: 50 physicians, 12 nurses; exchange of experiences in interdisciplinary working groups), (3) a palliative-care team (pct = physician and nurse) supports the health care professionals in cancer pain therapy and palliative medicine in the outpatients and the hospital, (4) documentation of pain treatment and palliative care. Results: 50,6% of the questionnaires were returned. 50% of the gp's know the WHO-ladder and 75,5% have prescription forms for strong opioids. In more than half ot the patients the gp's wish to have a multidisciplinary cooperation to treat difficult pain patients. The pct achieved 4.791 contacts to 542 patients to optimize palliative care and cancer pain treatment: In 39% of the patients an increase of the opioid dose could solve pain problems, in 15% a change was made from parenteral to noninvasive treatment and in 13% a step up in the WHO-ladder was necessary. The evaluation of economic data revealed a saving of costs of about 233.000 per year if 3 pct's are working in an area of 250.000 - 300.000 inhabitants Conclusion: A pct is able to improve cancer pain therapy and to avoid admission to the hospital The additional interventions are suitable to implement WHO- and DKG-guidelines. After the end of the demonstration project in december 2000 negotiations succeeded in August 2001 in a funding for one further year by the social security in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, so the pct's in Vorpommern are the first regularly working in Germany.Acknowledgements: supported by Fed. Mini- ster of Health cases is secondary to small-cell or squamous cell lung cancer. A common non-malignant cause is thrombosis associated with central venous catheters. Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice in malignant SVC syndrome providing symptomatic relief in 70 % of patients. Especially in gross mediastinal masses of squamous cell carcinoma response to therapy may be delayed. Endovascular therapies with thrombolysis, angioplasty and the percutaneous delivery of metallic stents offers immediate relief from symptoms and persistent good long term results. Material and Methods:We present the cases of seven patients with hemodynamicaly significant occlusion of the SVC and/or the Vv. brachiocephalicae or the Vv. subclaviae which underwent endovascular intervention. 4 patients had lung cancer with mediastinal lymph node metastases, 1 patient was diagnosed Osteosarcoma and 2 patients had a catheter induced SVC syndrome. All patients with malignant tumours were previously treated by radiochemotherapy. Wallstent protheses (n=13) of various lengths and diameters (median length 5 cm, median diameter 16ram) were inserted in 6 patients. In 1 patient the guide wire could not pass the obstructed region and the intervention was cancelled. Minor or major complications didn't occur. In 2 Patients only the vena cava was stented, in 4 patients extensive tumor masses also obstructed the Vv. brachiocephalicae and/or the subclavian veins and therefore these vessels were stented as well. In 2 patients 2 stents were inserted, in 1 patients 3 stents were used, in one patient 4 stents were applicated and in 2 patients 1 stent was sufficient. Results:Immediate remission of obstruction of the venous inflow was obtained in all patients. Relief of symptoms within 3 days after the intervention also occurred in all 6 patients. Conclusion:For palliative treatment of SVC syndrome the endovascular application of the Wallstent endoprothesis is a highly effective treatment modality often associated with immediate symptom relief. Individual treatment planning and exact diagnostic evaluation before the intervention are necessary as the specific anatomical situation often requires the reconstruction of the brachiocephalic and subclavian veins as well. Publication only P'803 ERYTHROPOETIN THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH MALIGNANT DISEASE DUR- ING RADIATION THERAPY O. Micke, F. Matzkies, Erythropoetin therapy for correction of anemia in patients with malignancy is a cost intensive but widely accepted procedure. According to previous studies dosages of 10000 IU three times per week are necessary to reach an increase in hemoglobin values in 60 % of the investigated patients. Recent data confirm a positive influence of correction of anemia on patients outcome after radiation. Since patients non responding to erythropoetin therapy often present iron deficient erythropoesis it is necessary to detect sensitive markers for iron deficient erythropoesis during or even before erythropoetin therapy. In our present study we therefore investigated the response of erythropoesis to a single dose of 10,000 IU erythropoetin in patients with anemia due to advanced tumor disease. Beside conventional markers as transferrin saturation and ferritin we investigated percentage of hypochromic erythrocytes and zinc protoporphyrin. 10 Patients of advanced malignant diseases of different histologies were treated with a single dose of 10,000 IU. Parameters were measured at baseline and on the five following days. Convenient to anemia of chronic disease we found enlarged ferritin values 642 \u00b1 102 Fg/I and slightly diminished transferrin saturation 17 + 4%. Reflecting enlarged iron stores with reduced availability of iron to erythropoesis. During the daily observation over 5 days there were only insignificant changes of the observed parameters. Hemoglobin values showed a slight increase from 9.8 \u00b1 0.6 to 10.1 \u00b1 0.7 g/dl. Percentage of hypochromic red cells increased from baseline 11 \u00b1 4.3 % to 15.2 \u00b1 5.1% and zinc protoporphyrine showed an increase from 65 \u00b1 6.2 to 69 \u00b1 7.6 IJmol/mol heine. According from these data a high substitution of erythropoetin did not necessarily lead to a fast response in patients with solid tumor during radiation. Additional markers as zinc protoporphyrin and hypochromic red cells reflect a profound iron deficient erythropoeisis in the presence of elevated ferritin values. In further studies it is necessary to investigate these parameters for their capability to detect patients with pronounced iron deficient erythropoesis not responding to erythropoetin therapy, which may benefit from an intravenous iron substitution. P'804 SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IN PATIENTS (PTS) WITH FAR ADVANCED MALIG- NANT TUMORS OF THE HEAD AND NECK F. U. Puschmann, M. Georgi, Fachkrankenhaus Marienstiff Schwarzenberg (Schwarzenberg) Introduction & objective Pts with far advanced tumors of the head and neck represent a significant group among the totality of patients in our hospital. The symptom management for these Pts as well as our communicative behavior were reviewed within the framework of our in-house palliative analysis. Patients & methods The prospective descriptive analysis (significance test: chi-square-test) involved 82 Pts, 69 men (84 %) and 13 women (16 %), from samples from the years 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001: Nasopharyngeal carcinomas n = 9 (11%), lip, oral, oropharyngeal carcinomas n = 48 (58 %), hypopharyngeal carcinomas n = 15 (18 %), laryngeal carcinomas n = 10 (12 %). The average age was 57.4 (36 - 84) years. In 33 % of them, secondary diseases, in 24 % metastases and in 10 %, secondary malignant tumors were found. The palliative medical treatment included nursing 100 %, physiotherapy 88 %, psychotherapy 23 %, chemotherapy 34 %, minor operations 10 % radiotherapy 7 %, ergotherapy 20 %. transfusions 15 %, infusions 34 %, medicamentous therapies 42 %, administration of bisphosphonate (pamidronat) 10 %, complementary methods 7 %, PEG 41%, lymphatic drainage 29 %, inhalation 58 %, tracheostoma 16 %, voluntary workers 21%. When admitted to hospital, the Pts were found to have a performance status of 40 - 50 % (48 %) as well as a symptom frequency > 4 (57 %). Results: We were able to discharge our Pts from the hospital with a significantly (p < 0.001) improved performance status (KI > 50 %) and significantly (p < 0.001) fewer symptoms. The symptoms most frequently encountered - pain 78 %, cachexia/weakness 78 %, dysphagia 66 %, lack of appetite 51%, lymphoedema 29 %, obstipation 24 S 161 Quality of Life, Palliative Medicine, Management of Cancer Pain %, depression 22 %, nausea/vomiting 26 %, cough/irritation of the throat 27 % as well as other discomforts (fetor, infection, ulceration) 31% - were significantly ( p < 0.05/< 0.001) controlled. The pain intensity NAS 5+ was reduced significantly (p < .001). 72 % of the Pts had been insufficiently informed at the time of admission. We spoke more often (p < 0.001) to the relatives about death than to the Pts. The death rate was 24 %. Conclusion: The muitiprofessional integrated treatment proves to be successful in the palliative medical treatment of the a. m. tumors. We still see room for improvement in regard of our communicative behavior. P'805 ENDURANCE TRAINING WITH UROLOGICAL TUMOR PATIENTS C. PreuS, C. Peters, T. Schulz, H. Michna, K. Halstenberg, S. Welter, F. Sommer, future demographical prognoses point out, cancer, prevention, therapy and rehabilitation take up a cumulative higher place value in research and community. Results from epidemiological studies point out a tumor protective mode of operation of exercise. Clinical studies with breast cancer patients as well as basic research refer to the positive mode of operation from exercise subse- quent to the therapy, whereas for male patients due to desiderative studies are missing concepts and recommendations. Until today for this theme there are no publicized full and comprehensive studies in an integral approach with concrete training recommendations for cancer patients during and after therapy. Because of the great uncertainty and demand for concrete recommendations concerning exercise with regard to tumor patients the German Sport University of Cologne (Institute of Morphology and Tumor Research) in cooperation with the Clinic and Policlinic of Urology of the University of Cologne developed a concept for the realisation of a three month moderate endurance exercise program based on the standardized ergometry. Patients included into the study are male urological tumor patients receiving chemotherapy or after prostectomy. The concept comprises, regarding to functional parameters, a three month moderate endurance training program with orientation to an increase of training duration by a constant level of training intensity. The current pilot study verifies the purpose of the project with respect to the practicability of the chosen training concept for male tumor patients. The collected heart rate values during the moderate exercise as well as the survey of the subjective values based on the scale of Borg, verifys the applicability under the formulated intentions.Respective to the results of the clinical study with breast cancer patients the integration of sports in the rehabilitation add to an enhancement of quality of life. The training concepts for female patients are predominantly based on positive psycho-social purposes and content and add decisively to the establishment of more than 550 cancer aftercare sport groups in Germany. The results of the present study should help to develop and establish training groups with for male convenient contents and purposes, as well as in first place should contribute to concrete training recommendations for cancer patients during therapy. P'806 THE WHO'S NEW ICF (FORMERLY ICIDH) AS AN AID TOWARDS A THERA- PEUTIC EXERCISE REHABILITATION PLAN FOR MAMMA-CA-PATIENTS K. SchL~le, Deutsche Sporthochschule Kbln (Kbln) Problem The ICF, adopted by the WHO in July 2001, has, from the beginning, met with a more positive reception in rehabilitation circles than the IClDH introduced in 1980. It makes a substantial contribution to an improved and uniform understanding of rehabilitation. This is all the more important, as rehabilitation will presumably gain in significance as a result of DRGs. Patients will be let out of hospital earlier and admitted for rehabilitation treatment. What is new in the ICF is its moving towards a reference to resources in the patients/ rehabilitees undergoing rehabilitation. In considering patients' rehabilitation potential, it is among other things, not merely their functional disabilities which will be taken into account, but more especially their remaining activities. Personal, social and environmental contextual factors will also be taken into account. These aspects are also useful in deciding whether an AHB is to take place on an in-patient or out-patient basis. Method. The DVGS (German Association for Health Sports and Sports Therapy) has already established a three-stage scheme for the therapeutic exercise sector: planning - realisation - evaluation. Planning for intervention takes impairment here as its initial point of reference, whereby medical and nursing measures play a central role. In cases of reduced activity and participation, questions as to therapeutic exercise will be raised, which have to be answered and planned for in conjunction with the rehabilitation team. In the realisation of the rehabilitation plan using sports therapeutic measures, the character of the defect will determine whether physical or psychological procedures take precedence. As diseases with tumours are not infrequently also a result of lifestyle, educational and pedagogical factors must be taken into consideration, so that patients achieve a higher degree of health competence. An evaluation of these measures, together with any changes in procedure resulting from them, will ensure the demands made on quality management and protection are achieved. In this contribution sports therapy will be presented using the rehabilitation of mamma-carcinoma as an example (see scheme). Conclusion. The scheme presented here can at any time be applied to other therapeutic fields. All sections (medical/psychological/physiotherapeutic and sports therapeutic etc.) are to be integrated according to the same pattern, which will lead to a uniform understanding of rehabilitation. P'807 PATIENT SATISFACTION WITH INFORMATION ON CANCER TREATMENT - ADAPTATION OF A CANADIAN-QUESTIONNAIRE FOR APPLICATION IN GER- MAN-SPEAKING COUNTRIES- A. S.C. Mailfair Taylor, E. Erdfelder, U. Jaehde, Institut of Pharmacy, University of Bonn, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Department of Psychology, University of Giessen (Bonn; Vancouver, CDN; Giessen) Objective: In Germany there is no suitable tool yet to get feedback on patient satisfaction with the information they receive regarding cancer treatment. It is therefore the aim to prepare the Canadian \"Patient Satisfaction with Cancer Treatment Education (PS-CaTE)\" questionnaire developed by the British Columbia Cancer Agency for the use in German-speaking countries. Methods: The translation process was performed following the forward/backward translation method. Prior to distribution the resultant German version pre-tests were performed to confirm the reliability of the tool. The questionnaire was answered by 61 randomly chosen cancer patients. The corrected item-total correlations, Cronbach's alpha, and Spearman-Brown assessed using SPSS\u00ae 10.0 for Windows.To facilitate an interpretation of subgroups with different information needs the questionnaire was supplemented with additional demographic data. Results: 47 out of 61 questionnaires were completed and served for the statistical evaluation. The reliability analyses for the total 14-item scale showed corrected item-total correlations larger than 0.6 for 12 out of the 14 items, Cronbach's alpha (internal consistency) of 0.9215 and Spearman-Brown Coefficient of 0.9153. Factor analyses showed that the patient satisfaction subscales chosen in the Canadian questionnaire did not seem to be appropriate for the German version. Conclusions: The total 14-item version of the questionnaire can be used for measuring patient satisfaction with information received about cancer treatment. The two items showing a corrected item-total correlation less than 0.6 were not replaced since the German translation should be as similar to the original version as possible for comparison reasons. Continuing investigations should focus on detecting subscales and validation of the selected tool to make sure the measured aspects actually reflect patient satisfaction. Once established in the German setting it should facilitate patients\" feedback on the information received and help cancer care providers to develop needs-based information strategies.

P'808 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN QUALITY OF LIFE AND SURVIVAL IN OVARIAN CANCER PATIENTS D. Koensgen, J. Sehouli, I. the last years an increased number of clinical trials have explored QoL in ovarian cancer. Mostly, they focussed on development and validation of questionnaires. Few working groups are investigating QoL as an outcome param- eter. Recently, QoL was described as a relevant predictive and prognostic factor in cancer patients. There are lacking data concerning the role of GeL in ovarian cancer. We conducted a systematic review to investigate the prognostic value of QoL in ovarian cancer. Methods: We performed a literature search in different databases (timeframe: 1966-2001). Different articles were enrolled by hand searching strategy. To evalu- ate the validity and transparency we applied the methods of \"evidence-based medicine\". A detailed descriptive analysis was performed. The level of signifi- cance was defined at p< 0.05. Results: QoL was defined precisely, assessed by questionnaires and included into the study objectives in only three trials. For instance, 230 publications were identified in medline. Only in 29 (12.6%) studies QoL was measured by question- naires and established as a primary aim. Only three studies enrolled ovarian cancer patients and fulfilled the criteria of validity, transparence and clinical significance. 1110 patients were enrolled in these trials. The rate of ovarian cancer was 19%, 55% were diagnosed in advanced disease stages. Different mono- and multi-dimensional questionnaires were applied. The average compli- ance rate was above 80%. In two physical activity seemed to be the most important dimension of QoL as an independet prognostic marker. The global QoL and emotional functioning scores were additional significant prognostic factors in one trial. None of the symptoms of ovarian cancer reached statistical signifi- cance. Conclusions: The role of QoL as a prognostic marker in ovarian cancer patients is uncertain. To yield more evidence further trials with clear definition and method- ology are needed.

P'809 NETWORKING OF CANCER PAIN-RELATED INFORMATION: (Planegg bei ML~nchen) Today, new knowledge discovery processes permit to transform masses of data into useful knowledge. A central issue of these modern technologies, which are primarily based on the combination of expert scholarship and modern information technology (e.g., data warehousing, data mining), is the necessity to interlink different information sets. With respect to cancer pain - one of the cardinal presenting symptoms in cancer S 162 Psychologic Issues patients which is, moreover, often worsening as the disease progresses - net- working of information to other tumor-related data (e.g. tumor epidemiology) is a major challenge, because cancer pain is often seen as an isolated phenomenon. For the purpose of data networking, well-defined cancer pain syndromes may, however, be suitable linking keys. The precise characterization and prevalence assessment of cancer pain syn- dromes has been an issue since the early 1980s, as a thorough understanding of the often complex pain syndromes and their pathophysiology was considered to be a prerequisite for optimal diagnostic assessment as well as optimal therapeu- tic management of these patients. In 1999, a working group of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Task Force on Cancer Pain headed by A. Caraceni and R.K. Portenoy published the results of an international survey of cancer pain characteristics and syndromes. In this comprehensive study, 22 cancer pain syndromes out of a list of 51 tumor-related and 18 treatment-related pain syndromes were found to be most prevalent. In our feasibility study the PubMed database was screened using MeSH thesau- rus terms to retrieve all relevant publications for most prevalent cancer pain syndromes. The results of the ongoing cluster analysis of these data sets and the concept of networking the information will be presented. higher than immediate post-treatment levels (p=0.001). Affective fatigue and HADS anxiety levels changed in parallel to the FAQ global score with a decrease at tl (p=0.048 and p=0.001, respectively) and an increase at t2 (p=0.006 and p<0.001, respectively). Cognitive fatigue remained at about the same level at tl and increased by about 66% at t2 (p=0.002). Patients with high breast cancer related distress had higher fatigue scores as measured either with the FAQ (rho=0.59, p<0.001) or the VAS-F (rho=0.63, p<0.001). Patients with limitations in carrying out moderate activities had higher FAQ fatigue values (p=0.042) and those with limitations in climbing several flights of stairs had higher FAQ (p=0.021) and VAS-F levels (p=0.013). Hormonal therapy had no influence on fatigue. Pretreatment fatigue was a good predictor of fatigue at 2.5 years after RT explaining 48% (FAQ) and 34% (VAS-F) of it's variance. Conclusions: Long-term follow-up of fatigue after adjuvant radiation therapy for breast cancer displayed an unexpected rise at 2.5 years as compared to immediate post-treatment values. We hypothesize that rising anxiety levels are responsible for this increase. Anxiety presumably involves to some extent fear of turnout progression. Fatigue after RT correlates with functional impairment and cancer related distress and therefore can be considered an important factor for the patient's quality of life. Psycholo~lic Issues Oral Presentation O811 THE ROLE OF HOPE AND CONFIDENCE IN PREDICTING QUALITY OF LIFE AFTER SURGERY FOR COLORECTAL CANCER PATIENTS M. Berend, J. Siebmann, Universit&tsklinikum (Kiel) Objective: Newer coping theories take the meaning of positive affect into account. Positive affect reflects general levels of well-being, energy and high activity. Optimism, according to hope and confidence regarding the future health state can be understood as an aspect of positive affect. In the previous study we were interested which factors predict quality of life (QoL) over the course of the disease in colorectal cancer patients. The main hypothesis was that a high preoperative optimism is a positive predictor for postoperative global health. Methods: In 4/98 the model ,,Operative Oncology\" was established by the Dept. of Surgery of the University of Kiel. A routine assessment of QoL in 7 diagnostic subgroups starting before the operation up to two years follow-up is part of the internal quality management. Diagnosis specific modules that complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 were developed prior to the study. In the presented analysis only data (preoperative, 3,6,12 month postoperatively) of patients (N= 142) with colorectal cancer were included The prediction was determined by multiple regression models. All questions of the QLQ-C30 and the additional modules as well as socio- demographic information and medical parameters were included. Results: The first steps of analysis revealed no meaningful model of prediction (all patients included), we found that there were substantial differences concerning gender: The regression models for the women based mainly on level of symptoms. Other meaningful predictors are: severity of illness, aspects of the general conditions and their effects on social and role functioning. Altogether the prediction models for the male patients are more reliable. They differ centrally from the prediction models for the female females: the most important item for the prediction of global health 3 and 6 month after surgery is hope an confidence. Conclusion: The prediction model for men is stable. We found that preoperative hope and confidence is a strong predictor for global health 3 and 6 month after surgery for male gender. The prediction model for women is less reliable, however the level of symptoms, severity of illness, general condition and social- and role functioning are predictive for postoperative global health in female patients. Furt- her analysis including more patients and a longer follow-up will show if these models are stable and applicable to other diagnostic subgroups of patients with gastrointestinal cancer. O812 LONG TERM FOLLOW-UP OF FATIGUE AFTER ADJUVANT RADIATION THERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER: TIME COURSE AND CORRELATION TO DISTRESS, ANXIETY AND FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT H. Geinitz, F. Zimmermann, R. Thamm, M. Purpose: To evaluate fatigue 2.5 years after adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) of patients with breast cancer and to assess its relation tO pre- and immediate post- treatment levels. Methods and Materials: 38 of 41 patients who's fatigue was evaluated during adjuvant radiation therapy (Geinitz et al. InLJ.Radiat.Oncol.BioI.Phys. 2001) were assessed in this follow-up study. Patients were sent the Fatigue Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ), a visual analog scale on fatigue intensity and on breast cancer related distress (VAS-F and VAS-D), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and three questions of the Short-Form 36-1tern Health Survey (SF- 36). All 38 patients who were alive at 2.5 years (t2) and who did not experience a second malignancy returned their questionnaires. The values were compared with pretreatment (tO) and immediate post-treatment levels (2 months after RT, tl). Results: Fatigue as assessed with the FAQ dropped below pretreatment levels 2 months after RT (p=0.026) and at 2.5 years it had risen again to levels significantly O813 PSYCHOSOCIAL VARIABLES AS PREDICTORS FOR OVERALL SURVIVAL IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER PATIENTS ? M.H. Weiss, V. Budach, D. Geismar, K.D. Wernecke, Humboldt (Berlin) Background: To test the relevance of psychosocial variables, among them health related quality of life measures in a multivariate context, for long-term survival in head and neck cancer patients is the main objective of this prospective study. Here, also the more existential aspects in quality of life ( sense of meaning; optimism vs. resignation, social support) are assessed additionally. Methods: The questionnaire with 50 items was used in 308 patients with head and neck cancer before treatment (QOL1), after treatment (QOL2) and with a 6 months follow-up (QOL3) following a validation and feasibility study. The treatment groups are defined as: (A) accelerated hyperfractionated radiation of 77.6 Gy or (B) a combined accelerated chemoradiation with a total dose of 70.6 Gy plus 5FU/ Mitomycin C. Kaplan-Meier analyses as well as Cox -regression analyses were conducted to check the impact of psychosecial variables on survival rates. Results: The psychosocial scores are ,,time-sensitive\" indicating a decrease of quality of life scores during RT/CRT and a substantial increase after 6 months (p< 0.001; Manova). Moreover, there is a strong evidence, that psychosocial varia- bles have an independent impact on overall survival rates (p<0.001;Kaplan-Mei- er). Even, the basic QOL-scores (prior to therapy) show a strong correlation to overall survival (p<0.001 Cox-regression), indicating that subjects with high scores on ,,optimism\", ,,sense of meaning\" and low scores on ,,fatigue\" as well as a higher physical performance status profit significantly better from both therapies. Conclusions: The hypothesis should be proved, that patients could profit from psychological intervention prior to treatment trying to reach a better mental adjustment to radiotherapy respective chemoradiatio. In general, the results indicate quite clearly that more intensive supportive measures are needed to optimize the radio-chemo-treatment procedures. O814 PSYCHOEDUCATIONAL GROUP INTERVENTIONS PROVED HELPFUL DUR- ING CANCER TREATMENT F. Lordick, H. G0nde], C. von Schilling, F. WQrschmidt, (M0nchen) Background: Psychoeducational interventions are an instrument of supportive care focussing on the patients' disease-specific knowledge and coping strategies. Psychoeducation is well established in the U.S. In contrast, in Germany the implementation of this psychooncelogical tool is still very poor, particularly during the acute phase of cancer treatment. Methods: 108 cancer patients were assigned to an interventional group IG (n=51) or to a control group CG (n=57). The IG patients underwent six group sessions dealing with informations about chemo- and radiotherapy, surgery, nutrition, pain management, complementary medicine, social and legal aspects, as well as practical relaxation training and individual coping. The course was held by a multidisciplinary team of cancer therapists. Quality of life, coping, anxiety and depression were assessed by means of the EORTC QLQ C30, TSK and HAD-S at the beginning (tO) and after two (tl) and four (t2) months. Results: The IG and CG patients did not differ in age, duration since diagnosis and stage of disease (p>.05), whereas differences were noted in the patients' education and population size at town of residence. Curative cancer treatment was more often intended in ]G patients (p=.003). Follow-up until t2 was successful in 45/51 of IG patients and in 40/57 (70%) of CG patients. At tl, IG patients felt better informed about disease-specific topics vs. CG patients (p<.001). The IG, but not the CG patients improved in the EORTC-subscale ,,emotional functioning\" (p=.032) and ,,quality of life\" (p=.004). At t2, the state of disease-specific information (p<0,05) and some coping strategies (TSK; p=.01) were better in the IG patients. Over the whole follow-up period, only CG but not IG patients deteriorated in the HADS-subscore ,,depression\" (p=.014). Conclusion: Some medical and socio-demographic differences between the interventional group and control group were found, which are probably attributable to the non-randomized study design. However, the results suggest that a short- term psychoeducatianal intervention in cancer patients is feasible and can result S 163 Psychologic Issues in a better disease-specific state of information, quality of life, coping and affective state during the acute phase of cancer treatment. Including health economic evaluation, it remains to be elucidated in a larger and randomized trial if psychoeducation should be proposed as a standard of cancer care in Germany. O815 DEVELOPMENT AND PSYCHOMETRIC TESTING OF AN EXPERT RATING SCALE FOR BASIC DOCUMENTATION IN PSYCHO-ONCOLOGY - FIRST RE- SULTS T. Brandl, M. Keller, G. Strittmatter, G. Blettner, E. Schneider, A. Schumacher, H. Kappauf, Germany is characterised by substantial heterogeneity with respect to therapeutic interventions, diagnosis, documentation and evaluation. This makes communication amongst different professionals working in (psycho-)oncology difficult. There is a lack of psychometrically tested and practically relevant categories for the economic, illness-specific and standardised description of the psychosocial situation of cancer patients. Frequently, cancer patients who develop psychological problems are diagnosed using psychiatric terminology, which is both inappropriate for this patient group and may result in potentially harmful labelling. Against this background the aim of the multi-centric research project described here is the development of a basic documentation system for psycho-oncology (PO-Bado). The PO-Rado is an expert rating scale designed for the reliable, valid, practically relevant and economic assessment of all significant aspects concerning the psychosocial condition of cancer patients. The emphasis is on both problems and resources to obtain a comprehensive evaluation. It is intended for all clinical settings and all cancer diagnoses and illness stages and can be applied by medical doctors, psychologists, social workers and other psycho-social carers. Ultimately, it may serve as a tool not only for the assessment of patients' psychosocial condition, but also as a tool for the collection and comparison of data across several settings and diagnostic groups and for quality management. After the first phase of the project (lasting one year) a first version of the rating scale can be presented. It includes a section for the documentation of socio-demegraphic and medical data and five sections in which items about the following areas are rated using a five-point Lickert scale: (1) physical problems (2) psychological problems (3) social and other problems (4) resources/management of the illness (5) co-operation/indication. This version comprising 36 items was used with over 200 patients in several institutes and was subjected to psychometric testing. The results of this first phase will be presented in detail. The project is commissioned by the largest psycho-oncological association in Germany, the Deutsche Arbeitsgemeinschaft Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft e.V. (DKG). financially supported by Deutsche Krebshilfe e.V.. Poster P816 FEAR OF DEATH AND DYING HEMATOLOGICAL Program, HWZ der Universit~tt (M0nchen) Patients confronted with the diagnosis of cancer are exposed to the possibility of a presumably premature death. Fear of death and dying, more often explored in healthy subjects, is rarely the aim of research in a clinical setting. Therefore, little is known about the prevalence of death related fears and its psychological effects on patients with life-threatening illness. We intended to investigate, whether patients with cancer show a different level of fear of death and dying in comparison to a healthy control. In addition, we investigated whether those patients can be characterized by specific aspects of death related fears. Furthermore, the associated illness-related coping styles (FKV), measures of quality of life (FACT) and of anxiety and depression (HADS) were explored. In a prospective trial the data of 60 inpatients (mean age 46, range 18-75) with hematological malignancies (apr. 50% in relapse) were assessed. Fear of death and dying is measured with the German ,,Furcht vor Tod und Sterben\"-scale (R. Ochsmann, 1993). Additionally, a newly developed self-rating (Likert-) scale is applied to collect data about the subjective attitude towards the quantity of reflections about and the closeness to death. Analysis surprisingly show that patients confronted with a life-threatening illness have significant lower general fear of death and dying (p<O,Ol) in comparison to a healthy control group. Detailed analysis of the subscales (sc) pointed out that the highest differences appear in scl ,,general encounter with of dying\" (p<O,01). On the other hand only one out of six sc shows, that cancer patients have a significantly higher fear, namely sc2 ,,the fear of being dead\". This fear is especially related to the fact that they are no longer available for family and friends. Fear of being dead is also the only sc significantly correlated with general anxiety (r=.352, p<O,01), the subjective attitude towards the proximity of death (r=279, p<O,05) and various coping styles (r=.279 - r=.341, p<O,05). Conclusively, the fact that fear of death and dying is in general correlated with less psychological well-being (r=-.377, p<O,01) but fear of being dead is the only positively correlated sc to cancer patients' anxiety, we have to focus on this special aspect of human fear in the situation of being confronted with a life threatening illness. P817 CONSULTING THE \"VITAMIN C\" OF AN EFFECTIVE PSYCHOONCOLOGY. DEVELOPEMENT OF AN INTERNAL COMMUNICATION CONCEPT IN A Objective: One of the most serious problems of effective work in psychooncology is the isolation of psychooncologists in clinical context and the lack of communication. Although the need for interdisciplinary teamwork is obvious those structures are difficult to implement in a university hospital. Since march 2000 the bavarian ministry of art an sciences supports our project ,,developement of an internal communication concept for patients, doctors and psychooncologists\". Round to this we intended to improve the interdisciplinary dialog to increase the effectiveness of psychooncological (pc) work and the quality of patients care. Method: Step 1: Foundation of LebensMut; an interdisciplinary project team discussing all kinds of non-medical problems with doctors, nurses, psychologists and other clinical members to detect actual communication problems, to solve them and to satisfact the demand for more openess in pc matters. Step 2: Seperation of patients information on one hand and patients consulting on the other. Integration of the different experiences in the discussions of LebensMut to form new caring concepts and programs. Step 3: Implementation of a central phone- and e-mail hot line (call center) for all three kinds of calls: a) patients asking for inforamtions, b) patients asking for consultation appointments, c) doctors asking for informations. Step 4: Creation of a so called ,,central consultant\" Results: Collecting prospective data of 18 month in pc working schedule we could show: 1. Higher acceptance of and demand for pc care: the consultation-rate increased by 35%. A success in patients care. 2. Increased efficiency: less therapists gave patients less counselling and could therefor concentrate on the main pc therapy. 3. Doubling of special information programs and events for doctors and patients without increasing costs. A contribution to doctors and patients satisfaction. Conclusion: The secret of integration on one hand and seperation on the other leads to an effective psychooncological care concerning interdisciplinary, communication and satisfaction for patients, doctors and therapists. Our study leads to the conclusion that the position of a ,,central psychooncological consultant\" makes pc work easier in cause of structured coordination, transport of information and prevention of ,,cristallisation processes\" in the interdisciplinary dialog in a university hospital. P818 PSYCHOSOCIAL CENTRE an institution for the psychosocial care of the chronically ill. The efficiency of the PSZ performance has so far been evaluated by two independent studies. 1. First, a longitudinal section study of the PSZ was performed over a period of two years with scientific support of the University of Wuppertal, Prof. Dr. H~.cker (1996-1998). Methodology: among others, the Hornheider questionnaire, a change questionnaire and a questionnaire about contentment of life were applied within the study. Furthermore, medical data bases were determined. Results: the study comes to the conclusion that patients taken care of suffer significantly less from the burden of disease (such as inner restlessness, lack of self-confidence, lack of social support) than patients not taken care of in comparison. In addition, an accompanying psychosocial support leads to a higher quality of life. 2. Second, the PSZ underwent evaluation by the University of Cologne, Prof. Dr. G. W. Lauth (1999/2000). Methodology: within this study, the offers of the PSZ were evaluated by taxonomies about coping with chronic disease (Moos; Tsu) as well as with the help of interviews with employees and executives of the PSZ. In addition, qualitative interviews examined the use or non-use of the offers by the chronically ill and their families. Results: the study shows clearly that a support in a community-related environment and an early agreement to psychosocial care makes access easier and reduces complications due to illness. The results were fed back to the PSZ and its employees in order to ensure further development. Conclusion: a local and community-centered psychosocial care is of significant advantage for the individual needs of the chronically ill; the offers of the PSZ has proven to be a recommendable additional offer within the network of care for chronically ill patients. The PSZ is composed of three supporting columns: column 1: therapy and counselling, column 2: exercise/physical work/creativity; column 3: education. S 164 Psychologic Issues P819 PSYCHOSOCIAL CARE NEEDS OF CANCER PATIENTS AT THE BEGINNING OF A RADIATION THERAPY S. Fischbeck, K. Obert, Objective: Many cancer patients, who have to be treated with a radiation therapy, are burdened with fears of the technical equipment and the side effects of this treatment. For others the hope to be cured is the main experience. The physician, who is in the duty to inform the patients about the treatment and to get the patients\" agreement with it, is in the dilemma, to find the best psychosocial care for each patient. However, there is little systematic knowledge about the patients\" wishes with respect to psychosocial support through their radiotherapist. In a pilot study we identified types and importance of cancer patients\" psychosocial care needs before the radiation therapy starts. Material and methods: We asked radiotherapists (N=6) and cancer patients (N=6) to rate the importance of psychosocial care needs of the patients\" in three categories: (category 1) ,,Need for infomation and participation\", (category 2) ,,Need for acessibility of the physician\" and (category 3) ,,Need for socioemotional support\". For this purpose we used a standardized care needs interview with N=129 care needs items. Further on we made a content analysis with interview transcripts. Results: In the course of quantitative analysis we found convergences and discrepancies between the physicians\" and patients\" ratings. In the view of the radiotherapists and cancer patients it is of highest importance that the radiotherapist informes them appropriately about the irradiation planning and the treatment of it's side effects. We found different assessments also: In the first category it concerned e. g. the communication about the prognosis of the illness, in the second category the possibility of getting a doctor in the clinic by phone and in the third category speaking about the fear of dying. The content analysis showed various reasons for the different ratings between radiotherapists and cancer patients, and within the two groups. Conclusion: The rating of the physicians as like as the patients helps us to select predominant psychosocial care needs of cancer patients and to shorten the questionaire for a main study. Our results should help radiotherapists to enhance the quality of the doctor-patient communication and finally the cancer patients' quality of life. P820 AFTER GENETIC COUNSELLING FOR HNPCC: CHANGED PERCEPTIONS? R. Jost, Keller, Heidelberg, Inst. fQr Humangenetik (Heidelberg) Purpose Colleagues in human genetics, surgery, and psychosocial counseling visit with each person/family in our clinic as part of a national, multicenter study of HNPCC. In order to learn more about the short- and long- term psychosocial consequences of genetic testing for HNPCC, prospective data from patients (P) and persons at risk for HNPCC (RP) are being collected at seven timepoints, including TO (pre-counseling), T1 (4-6 weeks after initial counseling), and later timepoints T2-T6. Objective To study how and if 1) cancer worry and anxiety and 2) perceptions of the arguments for (pros) and against (cons) genetic testing for HNPCC changed after initial counseling. Methods Data were collected using self- completed questionnaires. Scores from HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and IES (impact of Event Scale) of P and RP were compared from TO to T1, and frequencies of Likert-scale responses about pros and cons of genetic testing were compared for P and RP for both timepcints. Results To date, data from 31 respondents (n =15 P; n =16 RP) have been collected (response rate: 88.6%). Though not statistically significant, P and RP demonstrated lower HADS and iES scores after counseling. RP scored slightly higher on HADS scales than P at TO, but still fall into normal range. For P and RP, preference for certainty over uncertainty and potential relief from a negative genetic test result were the most cited pros of genetic testing at TO. Patients rated genetic testing pros and cons very similarly at TO and TI. However, RP viewed several arguments differently after counseling. For instance, more RP at T1 (81%) agreed that genetic testing would help them do something to lower their children's and relatives' risks than at TO (38%). After counseling, several more RP disagreed with the arguments that they would not deal well with a positive result (mutation) or learning of their children's increased risks. Conclusions After the initial counseling session, P and RP appear to worry less about cancer, though our continued research with this population will better inform this observed trend. Findings reflect that in contrast to P, RP are more influenced by counseling regarding how they view pros and cons of genetic testing for HNPCC. Education about HNPCC and genetic testing is one hypothesis for the shifts in perceptions. P821 EVALUATION OF AN OUTPATIENT PSYCHOONCOLOGIC GROUP INTERVEN- TION (EPOG) - A RANDOMISED MULTICENTER TRIAL - GRANTED BY THE GERMAN CANCER AID (DEUTSCHE KREBSHILFE E.V.) J. Weis, from English speaking countries show that structured psychooncologic group interventions improve mood, quality of life and coping. Even positive effects on survival have been reported, but these effects have not been proven yet. In Germany, up to now, randomised trials have neither been performed to examine the positive effects of such an intervention on survival, nor on psychological outcome. The Tumor Biology Center, Freiburg, has developed a structured cognitive-behavioural group training programme (CBGT) for outpatients, which is now being evaluated in a randomised multicenter trial. We hypothesise that compared to an untreated control group, twelve weekly 2 h sessions of CBGT, would reduce anxiety and depression, lead to a better quality of life and improve coping skills. Patients and methods: Patients meeting the following criteria are included: Women with primary breast cancer and women or men with primary colon cancer, without metastasis, who have undergone surgery within the previous 18 months. After informed consent patients are randomised, either in an intervention group beginning immediately, or in a waiting group, starting nine months later. The CBGT includes information, cognitive interventions, visualisation, and homeworks. Subjects in both groups are administered EORTC-QLQ-C30, SF-12, HADS-D and a coping questionnaire (TSK) at baseline, after three, six, and nine months. We ihave planned to recruit 240 subjects within three years in five oncologic centers in Germany. The study has a power of 80% to detect an effect size of 0.40 if it is real. Two sided error level alpha is 5%. Preliminary Results: After a pilot study with eight participants, twenty-nine subjects were included in the coordinating center within eight months. With fifteen of them, two groups were conducted. The programme was well accepted and assessment of each session showed high satisfaction of the participants on an 11 point rating scale. The other centers began recruitment after a collective training of the therapists. Groups in the other centers will start in January 2002. Discussion: In Germany it still has to be proven that the participation in CBGT programmes is helpful and beneficial with regard to mood, quality of life and coping. Approximately one year after starting the study we are confident, that we will reach our goal to add some evidence to the question whether psychooncologic group intervention is efficient in an outpatient setting. P822 MEASURING PSYCHOSOCIAL COMORBIDITY IN SURGICAL CANCER IN PATIENTS S. Sommerfeldt, T. Lehnert, C. Fischer, M. Riesbeck, M. Kliniken (Heidelberg, DLisseldor 0 Purpose: Psychological comorbidity is a common finding in hospitalized cancer patients. Yet the validity of identifying distressed cancer inpatients in a surgical hospital is widely unknown. Therefore we explored the prevalence of psychological comorbidity in surgical cancer inpatients of a university clinic. Methods: The target group included patients >=18 years with malignant tumors of different sites and stages. N=189 of the cancer patients admitted to surgery wards were consecutively recruited and assessed preoperatively. Using a multilevel approach psychosocial distress was measured by patients' self-report (HADS-D, Hornheide Questionnaire HF-9) and rated by surgical residents and nursing staff (author derived instrument). As a diagnostic criterion the Structured Clinical Inter- view (SCID-I, based on diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV), was administered to a subsample of n=78 patients recruited after balanced randomizing. Results: We found 24 psychiatric current SCID-I diagnoses in n=22 (28,2%) of the patients, predominantly adjustment disorders (71%), major depression (16,7%) and panic/phobic disorders (8,3%). At a value of HADS-D sensitivity was specifity In nurses' and surgical residents' judgement of psychosocial distress high values of sensitivity (95,0% and 100,0% respectively) were associated with low specifity (31,4% and 14,5% respectively). Conclusion: There is considerable evidence that HADS-D and HF-9 are suitable measurements for identifying highly distressed cancer inpatients, whereby diffe- rent threshold values have to be discussed. This similarly applies to surgical residents' and nursing staff' results. These findings also suggest, that the validity of their assessment of cancer inpatients' psychosocial distress could be improved and more relevant training should be implemented. P823 HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) AS PREDICTIVE MEDIATOR VARIABLE OF SURVIVAL IN PATIENTS WITH WHO Ill/IV BRAIN TUMORS AND BRAIN METASTASES S. Sehlen, M. Lenk, Herschbach, prognosis for patients with high grade astrocytoma as well as with brain metastases of extracerebral primaries is often fatal despite intensive therapy. Because therapy regimens are often conducted in a palliative intent, HRQoL issues grow to increasing importance. None of the previously conducted studies has been designed to show HRQoL as a determinant or mediator variable for survival. Methods: From October 1997 to October 2000, 153 Patients with external beam radiotherapy of the brain or of parts of the brain were screened. 26% refused to participate and further 47 patients were excluded for not meeting the study protocol criteria. 57 Patients with complete data were eligible, 33 with primary brain tumours, 24 with brain metastases. Patient investigation included the assessment of information on personal life situation. All information was collected by self-administered questionnaires. HRQoL was measured by means of FACT-G (version 3), a widely used cancer-specific instrument. FACT-G is taking into account the multidimensional concept of the psychological construct of HRQoL and leads to separate results on five subscales S 165 Psychologic Issues (physical, functional, emotional, social, relationship with doctors) as well as to a global HRQoL score Results: HRQoL scores were calculated separately for both patients with primary brain tumours and brain metastases. Besides lower values in the physical subscale, no significant differences were found between the two patient groups. No significant survival differences between patients with primary brain tumors (26.4 months) and with brain metastases (28.3 months) were found. We divided the patients into two groups along the 40th percentile of the FACT-G sum score. Between these two groups, we found a significant survival advance for the group with the higher overall HRQoL in contrast to the one with the lower level (p=0.0039). tn order to find factors relevant for the prediction of survival, we performed an explorative Cox-Regression analysis which revealed a significant influence of the FACT-G sum score (p=0.007). Conclusion: HRQoL measured by means of the FACT-G does distinguish patients with a longer expected survival from those who are going to die sooner. In an explorative Cox-Regression analysis, HRQoL was a main influence on patients' survival. Further research on larger patient samples needs to be done in order to create a survival-predicting model for all-day clinical work. P824 THE \"HERFORD MODEL\" h QUALITY DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHOONCOLOGICAL CARE IN THE HERFORD COMMUNITY CLINIC M. Kusch, I. Abt. The idea of the ,,Herford Model\" describes the concept of providing psychooncological care and support to in- and outpatients with cancer and their relatives. Within 1995 and 2001 the psychooncological team had contact with about 3000 patients. About 12.000 sessions applying this concept were carried out.This ,,Herford Model\" represents one significant emphasis of the SULO- Foundation. Another aim is to prove the necessity and practicability, the efficiency and the effectiveness of psychooncological provision in institutions of the acute- care-sector. After the phase of implementation of the department into the Herford Community Hospital (1995 - 1996) the department confirmed the psychosocial support structures (1997 - 2000) within the hospital. In 2001 the Health Care Reform forced the department to further optimize this psychooncological care. Three aims were followed: The efficiency of psychooncoiogy was examined in cooperation with the international consulting agency Mc Kinsey. The impact of psychooncology was proved in cooperation with the Department of Medical Psychology of the University Clinic of Hamburg. A new quality assurance system was developed according to the Herford Model and implemented into a ,Computer-based Management-Sy- stem Psychooncology\" (CMP\u00a9). The lecture highlights the realisation of the three optimizing strategies. P825 THE \"HERFORD MODEL\" Ih IMPACT AND INDIVIDUAL BENEFIT OF PSYCHOONCOLOGICAL PROVISION IN THE HERFORD COMMUNITY R. Stecker, U. Koch, A. Mehnert, I. M~Jcke, M. Abt. am KKH (Herford, Hamburg) The ,,Hertord Model\" describes the structures of the Department of Psychooncology at the Herford Community Hospital and its psychooncological provision process. To about 700 patients per year psychooncological support is given by four psychologists and one music-therapist. The team is supported by one coordinator. In addition to this, the department provides further education and supervision to the complete clinical staff, to selfhelp groups and other social institutions in the Herford region. The departement is steadily optimizing its strategies of providing care and support. Therefore a ,,start-up-assessment-screening\" of psychosocial burdens combined with a follow-up assessment was developed to demonstrate the impact and the individual benefit of psychooncological provision using a pre-post-assessment- strategy.Psychooncology is considered to be evidence-based since years (i.e Spiegel et al., 1989, Fawzy et al., 1993), but the proof of its impact in the daily routine is yet outstanding. Hence a screening-assessment was developed and tested concerning its practicability between July and November 2001. It was handed out to patients who were diagnosed for the first time (N=246 non-oncological vs. N=86 oncological). Between November 2001 and January 2002 a catamnestical study followed with N=368 patients to whom psychooncological support was provided between August 1st 2000 and August 31st 2001. Both assessments will be transformed into brief forms and taken over into routine provision from March 2002.The lecture highlights the development of the assessments and the steps towards a validation. Further an overview over the priliminary results will be given. P826 CANCER IN CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS - QUALITY ASSURANCE OF AN PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTION PROGRAM Counseling center stiftung phSnikks established a psychooncological intervention program for children, adolescents and young adults plus bereaved parents.The mean of patients is N=140 per year. 1999 the German Cancer Help (Dt. Krebshilfe) granted a study to assess quality assurance of the whole familiy orientated programm. Material and methods: 61 children plus 80 adults participated in the study between 1999 - 2001. For evaluation purposes they filled out following questionaires: SF 36 (Quality of Life, Qol) Kindl (Qol of children) ,,Beschwerdeliste nach Zerssen\" (physical functioning), GBB-KJ (physical functioning of children), FKV (coping), ALS (self esteem of children). The aim of the quality assurance program was to evaluate a) the feasibility of the program itself and the used instruments, b) the impact of the psychooncological intervention on quality of life. Results: Those clients who have been in active counseling and rehabilitation had a near 100% compliance concerning the instruments. Those clients who participated the standardized intervention program before 1999, had 73% compliance during the course of follow up. The evaluative instruments are very well accepted by the patients. Furthermore they are sensitive enough to detect ,,highly stressed families\" and changes over time due to the intervention program, i. e. serve as well as diagnostic as well as evaluative tools. In some instruments however further development to increase sensitivity are needed. The effect of the interventions showed most clearly in th Qol instruments, especially in the psychic and social dimensions. The quality-assurance-program granted by the German Cancer Help demonstrated an optimal degree of compliance with the intervention program itself as well with the evaluative instruments. The instruments chosen for treatment evaluation by the therapeutic team serve their purposes good enough, but can be optimized in terms of sensivity. P827 INPATIENT PSYCHOSOCIAL REHABILITATION AFTER ALLOGENIC BMT - ANALYSIS - M. Birmele, Objective: scientific results published about inpatient psychosocial rehabilitation after BMT. The review of the literature shows, that patients after BMT are faced with a lot of problems. Important goals of rehabilitation after BMT are to cope with the sequelae of the illness and the treatment, preparing the vocational integration, the adaptation to the changes in life, improving neuropsychological functioning and the emotional well-being. Materials and methods: Since 8 years we have established an interdisciplinary program for patients after BMT. The psychosocial program concludes individual psychotherapy and psychosocial counselling, relaxation techniques, social counselling and neuropsychological training. The patient also attend in a specific psychoeducative group therapy. As methods of quality assurance we have implemented a system of psychosocial documentation, including psychosocial anamnestic data, basic medical information and evaluation of the individual therapy. The descriptive analysis is based on n = 117 records. Results: Evaluating the topics of the individual counseling and psychotherapy, BMT-patients are interested in getting informations about special psychooncological interventions, especially inpatient or ambulant psychosocial support (psychotherapy, social counseling, support for the family and relatives). Other important contents coping, reintegration in employment and reducing emotional distress like depression and anxiety. The descriptive analysis of interview data shows that physical impairment and GvHD are important reasons for psychological distress. For improving coping strategies, social support is basically important, especially from spouse and relatives. 50% have neuropsychological impairment. Conclusions: Inpatient rehabilitation is important for the reintegration of BMT- patients, it is possible to identify psychosocial problems and special support can be offered. We need adequate facilities and specific treatment for patients with problems in coping, neuropsychological functioning and psychosocial adaptation. There is a need for empirical based evaluation of the program. A longitudinal follow-up study for the entire program is in planing. P828 EFFECTS OF A SPECIFIC MULTIMODAL IN-CARE REHABILITATION PRO- GRAM ON QUALITY OF LIFE AFTER RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY FOR CAN- CER OF THE PROSTATE AND NECESSARY TIME OF STAY. RESULTS AFTER ONE YEAR FOLLOW-UP, O.G. Dombo, U. Otto, D. Bochum, Zentrum f. Rehabilitationsforschung Uni Bremen (Bad Wildungen-Reinhardshausen, Bochum, Bremen) On the one side radical prostatectomy for early stage prostate cancer provides best curation rates, on the other side it may intrude patient's quality of life (QOL) by functional impairment of lower urinary tract and loss of erectile function e.g. We therefore developed a special in-patient rehabilitation program. As part of a prosprective multi-center study for effectiveness of specialist in-care rehabilitation and for identification of possible predictors of necessary time of stay 153 patients after radical prostatectomy have been evaluated for disease-related QOL with EORTC-QLQ-C30, additional prostate-modul, SF-36 and specialist assessment scales at beginning and end of in-patient rehabilitation and after 6 and 12 months, discriminating between 3 or 4 weeks duration of stay. Data clearly demonstrate high significant effectiveness of the special in-care rehabilitation program on symptom- and QOL-scores during the time of stay, mostly further improvement after 6 months and mostly stability after one year. Data suggest, that patients with impaired QOL show better results when staying more than 3 weeks. QOL-Predictors for necessary time of stay could be identified and will be presented. Conclusion: Inpatient rehabilitation proves highly effective in improvement of QOL S 166 Psychologic Issues in patients after radical prostatectomy. In case of reduced scores of QOL recognizable in selected predicting items, we recommend a four-week in hospital stay for long-term-success; this is to be expected in 70 % of our patients. As patients with non-curative results of radical prostatectomy present ,,better\" QOL as cured patients, coping-aspects should be taken into account for measuring QOL. P829 FEAR OF NEGATIVE SIDE-EFFECTS IN CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AS A PREDICTOR OF THERAPY-ASSOCIATED PSYCHOLOGI- CAL DISTRESS (TPD) K. Budischewski, S. A. Rahn, H.D. B~ttcher, Goethe-Universit~.t (Frankfurt) Purpose: To evaluate which negative side-effects of radiotherapy cancer patients are afraid of and whether these anxieties vanish in the course of the radiation treatment, in comparison to chemotherapy and surgery, the functionality of radiotherapy is widely unknown. This lack of knowledge leaves space for unreal fears. As a result, the therapy-associated psychological distress (TPD) of radiotherapy might be much greater than necessary. Patients and Methods: N=244 cancer patients (156 w, 88 m) were asked to answer the following question: ,,Which negative side-effect of radiotherapy do you fear most?\" prior to irradiation and in the third week of therapy. Breast cancer was the most frequent diagnosis (43%) in this sample. Other diagnoses were head and neck cancer (10%), brain tumours (10%), lymphomas and other diseases. Results: Prior to Radiotherapy the ,,fear of damage of viscera (heart, lung)\" ranked first, followed by ,,fear of burns\", ,,changes of the skin\", ,,pain (unspecified)\", ,,second tumor with swallowing\", ,,nausea/vomiting\", ,,latent side-effects\", ,,fatigue\" and ,,lymphoedema\". In the third week of radiotherapy the ranking was (in descending order): ,,fear of damage of viscera\", fear of burns\", ,,problems with swallowing\", ,,latent side-effects\", ,,changes of the skin\", ,,loss of hair\", ,,second tumor (radiogenic)\", ,,lymphoedema\" and ,,changes of mucosa\". Conclusions: Very many patients are afraid of negative side-effects of radiotherapy. Especially the ,,fear of damage of viscera ,, and the ,,fear of burns\" play a prominent role in the patients' minds'; despite the fact that these side-effects are rare. In the next step of this study we will investigate the fears of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. P830 USER ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT OF AN ONLINE - INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR SARCOMA PATIENTS J. Lueckert, P. Hohenberger, A. Hermann, HU, Robert-R6ssle-Klinik/FU, Kiln. & Gemeindepsych, HU Berlin, Charite, Robert-Rhssle-Klinik, FU Berlin, Arbeitsber. Kiln. & Gemeindepsychologie (Berlin) In the German medical landscape patients are more and more seen as users of a service offer. In alliance with their doctors they should be able to make competently treatment decisions and act as well informed patients who are interested in and cooperating at their course of treatment. This kind of patient's participation is called ,,Shared Decision Making\". Shared Decision Making has however as well requirements: On one hand cooperative decisions need a mutual process of information, on the other hand the ability of using information. The developed web pages should refer to these requirements. The Mutual Process of Information At the planning of the web pages net only experts have been involved to offer information from their point of view, but also patients and lay people. They had a chance to give a feedback, which kind of information they concider as being useful for them in their own clinical history as well as being meaningful for the prevention of difficulties and misunderstandings in a sarcoma-patient's treatment. The patients and lay people were invited to use their own information experience. The Ability of Using Information Especially in acute situations there is an imbalance concerning the need to handle much information on one hand and the patients' reduced cognitive capacity on the other hand. That means, that the patients have to handle with many unknown medical facts and improve their medical knowledge for being able to take part in the treatment decisions. Nevertheless they are also burdened by emotional, social and organisational concerns, which occupy mental resources. For the patients planning their treatment is very important, but it has a meaningful requirement: Mastering the other burdens. Regarding this, the patients have also been involved in the planning of the Information System not only, to specify guidelines how to get along with those problems (level of contents), but also to tell, which way to give information is helpful (level of information's organization). Beyond a specialist's perspective on medical and psycho-social information, the patient's participation in the web page development enlarged the range of information by their specific point of view as well as their special service interests concerning the management of clinical and all day life. The web page concept will be presented. Publication only P'831 ANXIETY AND PATIENT INFORMATION IN RADIOTHERAPY. FIRST RESULTS OF A PATIENT SURVEY, C. Sch~tfer, B. Dietl, K. Putnik, M. Herbst, Strahlentherapie (Regensburg) Background: Patient information can cause or aggravate anxiety. Anxiety itself impairs patient information and reduces satisfaction of the patients. Therefore, we designed a questionnaire to examine the level of satisfaction, information, and anxiety. All patients received a general patient information and afterwards they got a booklet about radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: The questionnaire consistes of 38 items, 7 concerning information (A), 7 satisfaction (B), 7 anxiety (C), 7 assessment of the booklet (D), and 10 demographic (E). A ordinal scale (-2 until +2) was applied, assessing each item. For each group (A,B,C,D) a sum score was definied. Up to now, we interviewed 20 patients. Results: Booklet sum score was rated as good (18 pat.) or intermediate (2 pat.), info and satisfaction sum scores were rated as good (17 pat.) or intermediate (3 pat.), anxiety sum score was rated as intermediate (11 pat.) or low (9 pat.). All patients considered the booklet as an enrichment of the patient information. Critical points were: illustrations of the booklet, the length of the text, and missing therapeutic advices. Conclusions: Our new questionnaire is suitable for use in clinical routine. The booklet was rated positively by all patients: The global level of information and satisfaction was high and anxiety level was low. In future, we plan a comparison between this group and a historical group, which got no booklet. Then we hope to make definitive conclusions about the initial questions concerning anxiety after patient information. P'832 STATE AND TRAIT-ANXIETY IN ONCOLOGICAL PATIENTS M. Gaspar, J. Barth, Reha-K]inik Nordfriesland (St. Peter-Ording) OBJECTIVES: Anxiety appears as one of the most frequent and dominat problems in tumor patients. Based on the reflections of C. D. Spielberger, anxiety can be distinguished into a situative (state) and a attributive (trait) form. ]'he aim of the study was to evaluate, to what extend individual psychic reactions are diagnose-specific and dependend on predispositional factors. METHODS: Using the state-trait-anxiety-inventory (STAI) all and accom- panying persons admitted to the Rehabilitationsklinik Nordfriesland were interviewed during a period of two months. In addition to age, sex and diagnosis the date of diagnosis and the verbal and emotional abilities of relief were analysed. RESULTS: 413 questionnaires displaying a return of 76 % were evaluated. The level of anxiety was shown to be diagnosis specific but independent from patients affiliation to sex. Accompanying persons partially have a higher level of anxiety compared to patients. More results will be presented and discussed in detail. CONCLUSION: The results of the study show diagnosis specific relations between state and trait- anxiety. P'833 VISUALISATION IN CASE OF BREAST CANCER T. ReiB, E. Haupt, A. Wischnik, Klinikum Augsburg (Augsburg) Objective: How many breast cancer patients would like to see their own tumor for a better understanding and how could patients benefit from that. Materials and methods: For that investigation 263 patients from the organization ,,mamazone\" have been asked by mail: Do you have any idea how your tumor looks like? Would you like to see your tumor if that would be possible? Why do you want to see your tumor? Do you want to receive a photo of your tumor? When do you want to get the photo? Where do you want to keep your photo? Results: 110 mamazone-members with an average age of 51 years responded to our questions. 30% of them had no imagination of the tumor, 70% get a very plastic imagination of the tumor. 28,7 did not want to see the tumor, 66,3 wanted to receive a photo (5,9% no answer). 8,9% said that such a photo would cause a bad influence to them, no influence 39,6%, and a good influence 41,6%. There have been a lot of different, individual and emotional reasons for the pros and cons. One of the main reasons was the wish to visualize the tumor for a better understanding, which helps to fight against the cancer. Conclusion: It is not a question of right or wrong if a patient wants to visualize the own breast cancer. But for a few breast-cancer-patients it is helpful to see the tumor or to have a photo of the tumor, therefore at our clinic these patients new will have the options and we will investigate the effects by that in cooperation with our psychooncelegists. S 167 Other Other Oral Presentation 0834 LONG TERM SURVIVAL OF CANCER PATIENTS IN GERMANY ACHIEVED BY THE END OF THE 20TH CENTURY H. Brenner, Background. Long term survival is a main outcome measure in monitoring progress against cancer. Progress in both early detection and therapy has led to a gradual increase in long term survival rates of patients with many forms of cancer over the past decades. However, such progress is disclosed with substantial delay by traditional methods of survival analysis. Methods. We employed a new method of survival analysis, denoted period analysis, to provide up-to-date estimates of 10-year relative survival rates of patients with cancer (1). Our analysis is based on data from the population-based Saarland Cancer Registry and includes survival data up to the year 1998. Results. For all forms of cancer combined excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, 10-year relative survival for the 1994-1998 period is 42.6%, about 4 percent units higher than the estimate of 38.8% obtained with traditional ,,cohortwise\" survival analysis. The most recent period estimates of 10 year relative survival for common cancer sites are as follows: stomach 26.0%, colon prostate 65.6%, kidneys 54.2%. Conclusion. Although long term survival rates achieved by the end of the 20th century are higher than previously suggested by traditional survival analysis, long term survival rates for various forms of cancer still lag behind those achieved in other countries such as the United States (2).

Franzkowiak Erlangen-NQrnberg (D~Jsseldorf, Erlangen) The intended introduction of the Australian DRG case classification system in Germany - optional as of 1 January 2003, mandatory as of 1 January 2004 - will represent a fundamental change to the former system of hospital remuneration for in-patients. The technical basis for converting the case classification system currently in use in Germany is version 4.1 of Australian DRG systematics as well as the 2002 version of the German guidelines for coding of diseases and procedures. The first comprehensive version of the coding guidelines was issued by the Association of German Hospitals (Deutsche Krankenhausgesellschaft), the central associations of the German health insurance companies (Spitzenverb~nde der Krankenkassen) and the federation of private health insurers (Verband der privaten Krankenversicherung). The lecture will look at examples of guideline-supported, stage-oriented therapies for solid malignant neoplasias according to the model set out by ISTO (Information Centre for Standards in Oncology), before presenting a comparison between these medical content and a system of evaluation and classification according to DRG. The aim is to illustrate the discrepancY between the medical and nursing expenditure required for a stage-oriented, multi-modal therapy and the simplified system of calculation according to the DRG system for remuneration. The question of whether such a complex oncological therapy can be adequately rendered amenable for accounting purposes to the new German DRG system, which has yet to be completed, is raised and discussed in the light of the current developments in this area. 0836 QUALITY ASSURANCE FOR HEALTH CARE INFORMATION SYSTEMS U. PrL~mel Philippsen, O. Iseringhausen, AFGIS (OsnabrQck) Quality Assurance for Health Care Information Systems: AFGIS, the German Action Forum Health Information System, an initiative of the German Ministry of Health What is AFGIS? The ,,Aktionsforum Gesundheitsinformationssystem (AFGIS)\" was founded in 1999 on the initiative of the German Federal Ministry of Health. AFGIS unites organizations, federations and enterprises who want to actively participate in constructing principles of quality assurance for health information systems, for the citizens of Germany. A prerequisite for the formation of such a health information system is the development and usage of a permanent quality assurance process for health information, particularly in the new media. Of absolute importance for this aim is the agreement on quality criteria which are to be applied, especially to information on the internet web pages. In particular, all visitors of websites on health information must be able to detect what the source and age of the respective information is. The following quality criteria have been defined: 1. Transparency of the information provider. 2. Transparency of the aims of information and target groups. 3. Transparency of authorship and sources of information. 4. Transparency of actuality of sources and date of publication of information provided 5. Transparency of options and ways of user feedback. 6. Transparency of quality criteria used in assessment, evaluation and managing the information provided. 7. Transparency in the type of information in terms of editorials, commercial and public relation information. 8. Transparency of funding, sponsorship and donations. 9. Transparency of management and evaluation of usability and educational intent. 10. Transparency of data management, retrieval and data protection. What are the targets of AFGIS? The ,,Aktionsforum Gesundheitsinformationssystem\" wants to ensure the optimum quality of health information in particular in the electronic media (Internet) optimise the usability of electronic media within the areas of health, prevention, curing and aftercare of illnesses and all aspects attached thereto. At the same time AFGIS also wants to continuously analyse and point out risks, weak points, gaps and quality faults of health information offers in the new media be able to advance methods and instruments of quality assurance and the quality management as well as the development, testing and application of strategies, measures, criteria and procedures. 0837 KNOWLEDGE BECOMES MOBLIE - MOBILE VIRTUAL COMMUNITIES FOR CANCER PATIENTS H. Krcmar, H. Stamatiadis-Smidt, Universit#,t Hohenheim, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (Stuttgart, Heidelberg) Informational and emotional support for cancer patients within the framework of a community based on new mobile media is an option offered to cancer patients as an objective of the COSMOS project. COSMOS stands for Community Online Services and Mobile Solutions. Funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research, the sub-project Healthcare Community Engineering is designed as a co-operation of the Hohenheim University, the Technical University of Munich, the Krebsinformationsdienst and several partners from the industry sharing technological and information architecture expertise. The new media have changed the information seeking behaviours of cancer patients and their families dramatically: Medical professionals remain an important source of information, but, many families nowadays utilise the internet as a source in daily life more often. For the first time, cancer patients have almost the same access to science based knowledge as their doctors. Patients use the internet for far more applications than only knowledge retrieval. Virtual communities have formed for example, in which patients and their relatives exchange information and emotional support independent of time, cost, stage of disease, mobility and independent of structures inherent in self help groups. With the new futuristic forms of mobile communication, cancer information will acquire a new dimension. Not only will one to one communication be available, but the whole library of science will be accessible via services like UMTS. How patients and their families as well as health care professionals will use these media, how they will interact and which new options will emerge, will be evaluated in the COSMOS project. COSMOS will implement two pilot communities. By March/April 2002 the launch of a first pilot virtual community for cancer patients in Stuttgart is projected, followed by a control group in Tuebingen six months later. Socio-technical design of the virtual community platform will be based on prior investigations of cancer patients' information and interaction needs. Thus the cosmos project will try to show how the challenging opportunity of new mobile media for sharing information and interacting within virtual communities can be used for support in coping with cancer. 0838 COST-MINIMIZATION ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT THERAPEUTIC REGIMENS FOR TREATMENT OF LYMPHOMA U. Rehwald, Rationale: So far no standard therapeutic regimen has been established for treatment of older patients with relapsed follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [NHL]. Most German physicians use either of CHOP chemotherapy (doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, prednisone), 4-6 monoclonal antibody rituximab (375mg/m a weekly x 4). Efficacy of these three regimens is considered to be identical, whereas toxicity, costs of treatment, and toxicity-related costs are different. Methods: A computer model was established in order to evaluate costs of various therapeutic regimens from the perspective of the statutory health insurance. Since all three treatment regimens are usually applied on an out-patient basis, costs were calculated for a standardized patient attending a hemato-oncologist in private practice. Total costs were calculated by adding up costs of treatment and costs of related toxicity. Cost of treatment consisted of drug costs, costs of supplies, and physician costs. Results: According to our model, treatment costs were *4980 for (.6729 .12,161 for rituximab. Costs of supplies and physician costs were 3% of total treatment costs for rituximab, while this share was 14% for fludarabine, and 41% for CHOP. The average S 168 Other toxicity-related costs were .22 for rituximab, so that total costs added up to +12,183. Total costs for 6xCHOP chemotherapy were .8024, for 4xfludarabine -9697, and for 6xfludarabine .14,520. The addition of G-CSF during neutropenia after an episode of neutropenic fever raised the costs for 6xCHOP to .19,725. Summary: When comparing treatment costs of different therapeutic alternatives for NHL, drug costs were always higher than costs of supplies and physician costs. Since most chemotherapeutic regimens are related to high rates of side effects, toxicity-related costs contribute significantly to the total costs of therapy (37% for fludarabine, 38% for CHOP). Our computer model can be used for determination of the average costs of an (oncological) therapy for a standardized patient using literature-based efficacy and toxicity data as well as the pricing system of the German national health insurance. While economic evaluations along clinical trials are very time-consuming, this model provides a quick glance on cost drivers and allows variation of important variables. Poster P839 A UNIQUE SUBSET OF T CELLS THAT SHOW ANTI-TUMOR RESPONSE: CD8+ NKT CELLS INDUCE TUMOR REJECTION. C. Normal CD8+ T-cells play a role in tumor rejection. The immunological functions of NKT cells remain to be determined especially in the anti-tumor response. Their function, regulation and relationship to other cells in the immune system are not fully understood. We investigated the role of NKT-cells in a tumor mouse model. Methods: This work was based on a established tumor model with EL4 thymoma cells that were transfected with co-stimulatory molecules B7-1 or B7-2. NKT- cells were established on day 20 from EL4-B7-1 bearing mice. The cells were characterized by FACS and their function was analysed under different in vitro stimulations. Results: This report demonstrated the existence of NKT cells in tumor bearing C57BL/6 mice, that co-express CD8 and CD161 (NKI.1) surface markers. These cells were kept in long term culture with interleukin-4, but produce large amounts of IFN-y following activation. NKI.I+CD8+ T cells showed a potent NK-like cytotoxic activity against multiple tumor targets and lysis was independent of MHC-class I or non-classical MHC-class I molecules (CDld). Furthermore the cytotoxic activity was enhanced by co-stimulatory molecules on tumor cells. Also the CD8+ NKT cells showed an antibody-dependent-cell-cytetoxicity (ADCC). Conclusion: Taken together, this study indicates that CD8+ NKT cells showed a anti-tumor response directly by lysing tumor cells and indirectly by inducing a Th- 1 immune response. NKT cells that are expanded in tumor bearing hosts may function as a part of the innate immune system potentially involved in tumor surveillance. P840 THE VX2 CARCINOMA IN NEW ZEALAND WHITE RABBITS AS AN ANIMAL MODEL TO INVESTIGATE LYMPHOGENIC METASTATIC SPREAD IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER A.A. (Marburg) Background: The mice and the rate are well established animal models in clinical oncology. With regard to their behaviour of predominatly hematogenous meta- static spread a new animal model characterized by predominantly lymphogenic metastatic spread was investigated due to its suitability to examine metastatic spread of head and neck tumors. Material and method: In 16 adult New Zealand white rabbits VX2-carcinomas were initiated at the dorsum of the ear. Eight up to 30 days following tumor induction the animals were killed and the topography of the resulting lymph node metastases were investigated histologically. Results: The parotid lymph node was shown to be first lymph node containing an isolate 0.2mm metastasis 8d following tumor induction. 21d after tumor induction a necrotic lymph node metastasis with perinodal spread could be observed. The caudal mandibular lymph node was the second lymph node to be involved into lymphogenic metastatic spread. Conclusion: The consistent location and surgical accessibility of cervicofacial lymph node metastases in VX2-carcinomas in New Zealand white rabbits allow further detailed investigations regarding lymphogenic metastatic spread of in- duced VX2 carcinomas in the head and neck area. P841 EXPRESSION OF CD44S AS PROGNOSTIC FACTOR IN SOFT TISSUE SAR- COMA OF THE ADULTS M. Peiper, T. Sate, T. Streichert, E. Achilles, W.T. Knoefel, J. Izbicki, Chirurgische Klinik (Hamburg) Background. The expression of CD44 has been identified as prognostic factor in several malignant diseases. However, only few data exist correlating CD44 expression in soft tissue sarcoma with subsequent tumor progression or recurrence. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of CD44s in adult soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Methods. Tumor specimens of 62 patients with STS were evaluated regarding CD44s expression using immunohietochemietry. The significance of the proposed prognostic indicators was evaluated in relation to survival and local recurrence. Results and Conclusions. Sixtytwo tumor specimen of primary soft tissue sarcomas could be evaluated in this study. Of all analyzed specimens, 49 tumors were CD44s positive compared to 13 CD44s negative tumors. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated significantly better survival among patients whose tumor was CD44 positive (P = 0.015), the only other predictor of survival was resection quality (R0)(P < 0.05). CD44s expression correlates with prognosis of soft tissue sarcomas. CD44s may, therefore, play a pathogenetic role in tumor progression P842 ADJUVANT HIGH-DOSE INTERFERON-ALPHA-2B FOR HIGH-RISK MELANOMA patients with stage lib- and stage Ill-melanoma are at high risk of disease recurrance after definitive surgery. Considering recently published trials adjuvant therapy with high-dose interferon-alpha-2b seems to be the most active treatment regimen to prevent relapse. Materials and methods: Since 9/97 a total of 136 patients with stage lib-and stage Ill-melanoma were treated at our institution with high-dose interferon-alpha-2b after surgery. We report about the first 100 patients (52 males, 48 females, medium age 48 years) after a medium follow-up of 34 months. Stage distribution (DDG)was: Iib:12%, Illa:9%, IIib:73%, IV(skin):6%. Among the stage lib-patients the medium breslow-thickness was 7 mm (4-10 mm). Among the stage IIIb-patients had micrometastasis in or ELND, the primary melanoma was unknown. Results: 86% of the planned interferon-dose could be delivered during the i.v.- phase of treatment, 62% during the s.c.-phase. Dose reduktion was necessary in 72% during the one year treatment-phase. Main side effects were fatigue, headache, nausea and neurotoxicity with depression in 20% of all cases. Discontinuation of treatment due to toxicity occured in 18%. All toxic side effects disapeared after treatment disruption. 57% of the patients relapsed (14% regional relapse, 43% distant relapse). 65% of the relapsed patients died of melanoma. 1 patient without relapse died of an intercurrent second malignoma. 43% of the patients are still relapse-free. Conclusion: Treatment with high-dose interferon-alpha-2b is feasible at an outpatient basis. Side effects were remarkable but the vast majority of our patients completed the one year treatment phase. Considering the poor prognosis of the treated population the 57% relapse rate after a medium follow-up of 34 months is encouraging. Our data correspond well wkh the recently published data of ECOG- and Intergroup-trials for high-dose interferon-alpha-2b in high-risk melanoma. P843 EFFECTS OF (ANTI-) HORMONAL THERAPIES COMBINED WITH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ON EXPERIMENTAL BREAST CANCER GROWTH T. Schulz, H. L6tzerich, S. L6ffek, K. Smolnikar, The role of endogenous estrogens in connection with breast cancer is widely recognized. Therefore, besides surgery the treatment with (anti-)hormones is one of the major forms of breast cancer therapy. The combination of physical activity with a (anti-)hormonal therapy may increase inhibiting effects on mammary tumorigenesis, because physical activity has repeatedly shown to reduce breast cancer growth. We therefore investigated the influence of voluntary exercise in combination with a (anti-)hormonal treatment ('ramoxifen, Megace) on tumor growth and nonspecific immune functions in female Sprague Dawley rats. For the study design the rats were randomly assigned into 3 groups of sendentary and exercising animals after receiving the chemical carcinogen DMBA. The animals in the exercise groups started the training for 4 weeks after a palpable tumor size of 50 mm 2, Tamoxifen (5mg/d/kg bw) and Megace (25mg/d/kg bw) were given s:c. After 4 weeks the rats were dissected, the spleen was excised and blood samples were taken. We determined tumor weights and examined nonspecific immune functions (e.g. natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity against YAC-I tumor cells and phagocytosis ability of granulocytes and monocytes). Compared to the non-treated and the Megace control group, the Tamoxifen treatment led to a reduced tumor weight. In addition, we could find a reduced tumor weight for highly active rats (exercise >2000m / day) in the Megace treated group. This reduced tumor weight reached the level of the Tamoxifen treated control group. Also, we could find a reduced (but not significant) tumor weight for the highly active rats in both the Tamoxifen and non-treated groups. Concerning the parameters of the innate immune system, we found an enhanced phagocytic ability for the granulocytes and monocytes in the Tamoxifen treated groups in comparison to the non-treated and Megace groups. Megace treatment induced an increased NK cell activity in comparison to the Tamoxifen and non-treated groups.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that physical activity is able to alter (anti)hormonal therapies and that (anti)hormonal therapies may enhance innate immune functions. This study was supported by the Mildred Scheel foundation. S 169 Other P844 RECONSTRUCTION OF BLADDER WALL BY BIOHYBRID, TISSUE ENGINEERED MATRIX B. Brehmer, D. Rohrmann, G. Jakse, RWTH-Aaehen (Aachen) INTRODUCTION: Whenever there is a lack of native urologic tissue, reconstructive surgery of the bladder is usually performed with different bowel segments. In attempt to avoid complications associated with bowel segments tissue engineered bladder wall replacement was developed with autologous cells and a biodegradable scaffold. MATERIAL & METHODS: Skin biopsy was performed in 6 minipigs. 3-4 weeks after primary fibroblast and keratinocyte cell culture, the cells were seeded in a sandwich model on a collagen scaffold. 2 weeks later a part of the bladder was resected and the bio construct was implanted using a part of the ileum denuded from mucosa as support. 1, 2 and 3 months after augmentation the pigs were scarified; urodynamic, compliance and histological examinations were performed. As control group we used bladder augmentation with a well differentiated keratinocyte epithelium is established and is still present on the reconstructed bladder wall three months later. 2. The overal shrinkage rate was 7%. 3. The engineered bladder wall is less compliant than the native one. 4. An initial inflammatory reaction disappeared after 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Reconstruction of the bladder wall is possible with a tissue engineered construct of autologous cells and a biodegradable collagen scaffold. The keratinocytes are not replaced by urothelium. A initial inflammatory reaction with a minor consecutive fibrosis leads to less compliance of the bladder wall and a shrinkage of about 7%. P845 PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF THE MULTICENTRIC THERAPY rare in childhood and adolescence. Epidemiological data and data on therapy are scarcely available, so that a german prospective study was initiated. Patients and methods: As a prospective interdisciplinary therapy trial of the Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, the study \"Malignant endocrine tumours in childhood and adolescence - GPOH-MET 97\" was opened in April 1998. Up to November 30st 2001 120 patients < 18 years such t~mours could be registered. Results: 61 children and adolescents suffered from thyroid cancer (TC). 36 pa- tients presented with to 16,0 years, median 12,9 years, mean 12,3 years), whereas 8 patients with follicular TC (3 boys, 5 girls; age: 6,3 to 17,2 years, median 13,7 years, mean 12,3 years) and 16 patients with medullary TC (9 boys, 7 girls; age: 5,1 to 17,3 years, median 11,5 years, mean 10,9 years) were registered. In 4 children and adolescents a MEN-2- Syndrom was diagnosed (2 x MEN-2a, 2 x MEN-2b). An adrenocortical carcinoma was diagnosed in 9 patients (3 boys, 6 girls; age 1,0 to 16,1 years, median 5,8 years, mean 7,5 years). Data dealing with metastases at diagnosis, therapy and outcome were available for only 6 children and adoles- cents: 4 patients suffered from metastases at diagnosis and in 1 girl without metastases two local relapses were observed. 5 patients were treated by cyto- static therapy. The outcome of the observed patients showed 2 complete remis- sions, 2 partial remissions and 2 deaths. A phaeochromocytoma was found in 14 children and adolescents (10 boys, 4 girls; age 6,0 to 17,5 years, median 10,6 years, mean 11,0 years), none of them suffered from a MEN-2-Syndrome. Only 1 tumour was definite malignant. Carci- noid of the appendix were diagnosed in 28 patients (15 boys, 13 girls; age 8,3 to 17,4 years, median 12,3 years, mean 12,3 years). Carcinoids in other Iocalisations were not found. All patients are in complete remission after appendectomy. Finally, we obvserved 8 patients with extremely rare tumours.Conclusions: a) Differantiated TC has a good prognosis, b) Medullary TC has a rather severe prognosis. After surgery effective therapeutic options are rare. c) Adrenocortical carcinoma is uncommon in childhood. Children with metastatic disease at diagno- sis have a poor prognosis, d) To achive more data for these tumour entities more patients are needed. Therefore an European study seems to be necessary. P846 MOLECULAR MEDICINE: THE NEW human genome has been sequenced, everyone of us will become a potential candidate for genetic counseling and testing. Within a short period of time everyone will obtain his personal genetic passport identifying deleterious and susceptibility genes. With the availability of presymptomatic tests for late-onset disorders and the possibilities of prevention and treatment, the conflict between directiveness and non-directiveness will dominate the counseling setting. The HGP will have a considerable impact on the comprehension of disorders and diseases resulting from monogenetic, multifactorial or the combination of genetic and environmental factors. In many cases the new knowledge will undoubtedly improve and increase the repertoire of conventional preventive and therapeutic means. On the other hand, molecular medicine will also have a tremendous influence on our society, culture and behaviour. The genetic passport will mainly uncover predisposition, deleterious and susceptibility genes for which no preventive nor therapeutic options exist so far. This new medicine will create an increasing number of 'unpatients', a group of individuals who are in the usual sense neither healthy nor ill. They have to live with the risks of potential harms to their health inscribed in their recessive genes, which can mean enormous psychological pressure and unconvenience to them. Besides, 'unpatients' might be classified as artificial genetic tribes who will undergo stigmatization and discrimination. The moral principles which are at stake here, are the principles of autonomy, nonmaleficence and beneficence towards the unpatients. From these principles confidentiality, privacy and value-neutrality arise. Genetic information about a patient's/client's carrier status should not be uncovered to other family members, to his employer or insurance company without his permission. It is and must remain the exclusive right and responsibility of the affected individual person to decide about these sensitive issues. To achieve this, future counselors will need to acquire both a professional competence to inform adequately about the genetic conditions including available treatment and preventive options, and a humane i.e. empathic competence to enable the counselee the highest reachable autonomy. P847 MERKEL CELL CARCINOMA - RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF 17 CASES U. Wollina, E. Hohaus, J. Sch6nlebe, E. Kiemm, E. K6stler, Hautklinik Friedrichstadt (Dresden) Objective: We want to report clinical experience with neuroendocrine Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)of skin, including treatment and outcome. Subjects and setting: Seventeen patients with MCC diagnosed and treated at the Hospital Dresden-Friedrichstadt, Germany, Departments of Dermatology and ETN during the years 1984-2000 were analysed. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with histologically proven MCC and survival data were obtained. Results: Six male and 11 female patients with an age between 68 to 90 years were identified. The primary tumor was found in the head and neck region (n=8), on the upper limbs (8), and lower limbs (1). Twelve patients were in tumor stage I, three in stage II and one in stage Ill. 16 patients were treated, one patient refused any therapy. First line therapy was surgery with wide margins in 16 patients followed by Ioco-regional radiation in 16 of 16 cases. Follow-up data were available in 16 patients. After primary treatment a CR was achieved in 13 (81%), three had a PR. The median of relapse-free survival was 44 weeks. The median of overall survival was 102 weeks. Until now 12 patients are still alive, five patients died. The cause of death was MCC in two patients, leukemia in one, arteriosclerosis in another. The cause of death was unknown in one patient. Three patients with a PR had a median overall survival of only 48 weeks. Conclusions: Primary surgery with wide margins combined with radiotherapy seems to provide better results when a CR could be achieved. P848 REDUCTION OF SKIN TOXICITY OF PEGYLATED LIPOSOMAL DOXORUBICIN (PLD) BY CONCOMITANT APPLICATION OF DEXAMETHASONE (DEX) PYRIDOXlNE (PYR) IN PATIENTS (PTS) WITH ANTHRACYCLIN SENSITIVE MALIGNANCIES RU. Honecker, F. Mayer, R.A. Hilger, U. L. (TLibingen, Essen) PLD (Caelyx) has shown activity in a variety of malignancies. Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) are mainly palmar-plantar erythema (PPE), mucositis and myelosuppression. The present study evaluated the maximum tolerable dose intensity (MTDI) when given with DEX and PYR to reduce the incidence and severity of skin toxicity. DEX 8 mg was given twice daily p.o. from day -1 to day +5 and PYR was given 100 mg twice daily p.o. continuously. PLD was applied at doses escalated from 40 to 50 to 60 rag/m2 given q 4 weeks. In a second step, interval reductions from 28 to 21 and 14 days were planned. To be evaluable for skin toxicity, pts had to receive at least 2 cycles of therapy. MTDI was 60 mg/m2 q 4 weeks. 46 mostly pretreated pts with advanced disease, median age 58 years, have been included in this study. 15 pts received less than 2 cycles and could not be evaluated regarding skin toxicity (6 pts early progress, 4 pts hypersensitivity to PLD, 4 pts refused second cycle, 1 pt died of sepsis in neutropenia). A total of 101 cycles was applied. Incidence and severity of toxicities of PLD 60 mg/m2 q 4 weeks were the following (number of pts evaluable): PPE (24 pts) 9%. One toxic death occurred after one cycle of PLD 60 mg/m2 (1/46, 2%). No decrease in cardiac function, even in pts pretreated with anthracyclins, was observed. Conclusion: The observed incidence of 8% of severe (\u00b03-4) PPE at a dose level of 60 mg/m2 q 4 weeks with concomitant administration of DEX and PYR appeared reduced compared with reported frequencies of 20-30% without concomitant medication at even lower doses of PLD (50 mg/m2 q 4 weeks). The definite role of DEX and PYR can only be examined in a randomized trial. However, due to a clinically significant incidence of severe (\u00b03-4) mucositis and leukopenia, a dose of 60 mg/m2 q 4 weeks should not be generally recommended in heavily pretreated pts with advanced disease. S 170 Other P849 DOES PREOPERATIVE BODY IMPEDANCE ANALYSIS (BIA) PREDICT COM- PLICATIONS AFTER SURGERY FOR GASTROINTESTINAL MALIGNANCIES? Altendorf-Hofmann, Universit~it (Jena) Background The risk of postoperative complications after abdominal surgery depends on various factors, including comorbidity, ASA classification, and extent of surgery. Identification of predictive parameters is extremely difficult because of its complexity, and so far no generally accepted predictive test exist. Preliminary data from our department suggest that altered body impedance analysis (BIA), an indirect, bioelectrical, low-cost method to assess body composition, is associated with an increased risk of postoperative surgical complications. Therefore, we performed a prospective clinical study to test whether preoperative body impedance analysis (BIA) predicts complications after surgery for gastrointestinal malignancies. Materials and Methods BIA was measured preoperatively in 184 patients with gastrointestinal malignancies. Two electrodes were located at the patients wrist and ankle and different conductivity of high freqent electric voltage through body tissues was measured. The following parameters were included in a modified novel formula, called ,,Jena Index\": phase ankle, intra- and extracellular water, body mass index, lean and extracellular mass. All data regarding the patient, disease, comorbidity, operation and complications were recorded. Results BIA measurements were technically easy to perform and reproducible. Morbidity and mortality were 49.5 % (91/184) and 14.7 % (27/184), respectively. A pathologic predicted 85.2 % (23/27) of postoperative deaths. For postoperative deaths in the most representative group of reactal cancer (n=60) the positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 94.5 and 34.8 %, sensitivity and specificity were 80 and 70 % (p = 0,02). Conclusion Our data demonstrate that the ,,Jena Index\" using BIA is a promising novel test to predict the risk of severe postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies. A prospective randomised single blinded trial will be performed to verify these data with a larger group of patients. P850 INFLUENCE OF A MODERATE ENDURANCE EXERCISE TRAINING ON THE NATURAL KILLER CELL ACTIVITY IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS C. Peters*, H. LTtzerich, K. Sch~Jle, B. Oeynhausen) Since numerous independent studies indicate a stimulating influence of moderate exercise training on the immune function, in the context of prevention and rehabilitation of cancer physical activity is currently acknowledged. In contrast, it is well established that stress may be immune-suppressive which is documented by a decreased activity of natural killer cells (NK cells). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of a mode- rate endurance exercise training program on special immune functions of 49 breast cancer patients. 24 women trained 5 times a week during six weeks of a rehabilitation cure and 1 to 3 times a week for further six months in an ambulatory group; the other 25 women served as controls. At the beginning of the cure, after the cure and at the end of the project blood samples were taken to determine the number of natural killer cells and the function.The moderate training caused positive effects on the natural killer cell cytotoxicity which was significantly increased in the training group in comparison to the control group. Furthermore, a detailed analysis concerning the frequency of training sessions within the training group showed, that women who trained more frequently reached higher values of natural killer cell cytotoxicity in comparison to women who only trained less frequently. In this subgroup NK cytotoxicity was only slightly increased. Our results demonstrate that moderate exercise training is able to restabilize a reduced NK cell cytotoxicity in female breast cancer patients. Special attention should be given to the training program. Based on our data an adapted, moderate endurance training with a frequency of 2 to 3 times a week is recommended and should be integrated into the rehabilitation program of breast cancer patients. P851 CANCER REGISTRATION AND FOLLOW UP - HOW THE PATIENTS CAN BE INCLUDED G.M. Kroll, B. Hangarter, A. Gransow-G6v, E. Breuer, Institut fL)r Pathologie (Aachen) The collecting of cancer follow up data is often complicated by missing response from the follow up doctors. We have documented primary breast cancer of the female inhabitants in the region of Aachen since August 1995. We collect data from patients on the tumor status, the primary therapy and follow up. In addition, patients are asked about their quality of life, using EORTC QLQ C30 and EORTC QLQ BR23 questionnaires every six months. Starting in the year 2000 we have asked the patients, who answered the questionnaires on the quality of life, about their state of disease and last follow up. Only suspected recurrences were then discussed with the follow up doctors. Response of the patients was good. Only few did not answer and most answered completely satisfactory. This experience supported our view, that patient cooperation in cancer patients concerning the documentation is very good, if the patients feel informed and accepted. The combination with our quality of life questioning brought most acceptable results. P852 ACTIVATION OF COAGULATION IN CANCER PATIENTS WITH PERMANENT INTRAVENOUS PORT SYSTEMS AND THE RISK OF THROMBOSIS H. Flath, M. Zahn, M. H6pfner, H. Schiller, T. Bartscht, F. Gieseler, University Hospital of Kiel (UKK), Dept. of Internal Medicine (Kiel) Introduction: 29 cancer patients with permanent intravenous port systems were examined by sonography of the port system and determination of coagulation parameters such as Quick, PTT, Fibrinogen, F1-F2 fragment and D -dimers in order to detect the incidence of thrombosis of the port systems in those patients. Methods: All patients received cytostatic treatment of gastrointestinal and lung adenocarcinomas in the outpatient oncology ward. The age was between 37 and 79 years, 23 men and 6 women. The coagulation tests were performed after puncture of a peripheral arm vein. Sonographic examination was realized in B- mode with a 7 MHz High-End device by GE, Milwaukee, USA, Logiq 700 Expert Series Systems. Results: In 9 of the 29 patients thrombosis at the port system was detected by sonography, six of these patients showed pathologic tests for F1-F2 fragment and D -dimers. In 5 patients with a pathological D-dimer test no thrombosis was detected by sonography. In two more patients with elevated D-dimers and F 1 + 2 sonography was infeasible due to anatomical reasons. Thus phlebography was performed and thombosis was found in one of those patients. Discussion: Tumor patients in therapy have multiple pro-thrombotic risk factors: centralvenous catheters (permanent port systems), thrombin activation by tumor related factors (cancer procoagulant A, tissue factor, etc.) and direct vasotoxicity of chemo- therapy. In our small group in 9/29 of the patients thrombotic material could be visualized at the catheter and elevated coagulation parameters have been found. Possible clinical relevance (micro-embolic events, super-infection, thrombosis) could be verified in a larger population with similar risk factors. P853 HIGHLY EFFICIENT SALVAGE CHEMOTHERAPY FOR ClSPLATIN AND IFOSFAMIDE Erlemann, Germing, M. Aivado, R. Krankenhaus (Duisburg, DL~sseldorf) Thymoma is within the epithelial cells of the thymus. Lymphocytic elements are present in various degrees and may even predominate histologically. While noninvasive thymomas -previously described as ,,benign\"- have an intact fibrous capsule and are freely movable and easily resectable, the invasive form - previously referred to as ,,malignant\" - invade surrounding structures and may be difficult to resect. Thymomas may metastasize but usually do so inside the thorax and rarely affect extrathoracic areas. The vastest treatment experience exists with polychemotherapy including cisplatin, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (PAC) and ifosfamide single-agent chemotherapy. Both options led to overall response rates (ORR) of 70% and 46%, respectively. The combination of cisplatin, doxorubicin, vincristin and cyclophoephamide in not previously treated patients led to ORR of 92% with 43% complete remissions (CR) Corticosteroid treatment has been effective in all histologic subtypes of thymoma with an ORR of up to 77%. We report two cases of invasive thymomas that were refractory to cisplatin and ifosfamide-based chemotherapy. The first patient, a 50-year old woman, had received operative removal of a lymphocyte-rich thymoma with adjuvant radiotherapy (50Gy). Three years later she relapsed and received two cycles of PEI-chemotherapy (cisplatin, etoposide, ifosfamide) resulting in no change. Operative tumor reduction was performed again, and Interferon/Interleukin II maintenance therapy started. After progression with atelectasis of the left upper lung, AIO chemotherapy (doxoruicin, ifosfamide and vincristine) was administered without any improvement. Salvage chemotherapy according to the German multicenter trial for B-acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL-protocol) was started and striking tumor reduction was achieved. The patient is still under therapy. The second patient with lymphoepithelial thymoma was operated on but relapsed three years later and was treated with combination radiochemotherapy achieving partial remission. At his second relapse five years later polychemotherapy resulted in CR. At his third relapse another three years ahead the tumor was cisplatin, etoposide and ifosfamide resistant. Two cycles of B-ALL protocol were administered resulting in CR. High dose chemotherapy with BCNU, etoposide and cyclophosphamide and autologous stern cell support was given. The patient\" remains in CR for more than two years. P854 USE OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (CAM) IN CHIL- DREN WITH CANCER - A LITERATURE REVIEW A. Hartig, A. L~ingler, Med. Hochschule Hannover, GemeJnsch.-KH Herdecke (Hannover, Herdecke) There is a worldwide increasing use of CAM, which now has reached between 20% and 64% in the adult population. In pediatric patients studies about CAM are rare. For pediatric oncology patients are only seven published studies about the use of CAM available, four from the United States and one from Australia, Finland and Canada each. For these studies from 15 to 366 patients mostly the parents answered a questionnaire, in two studies combined with a personal interview. The patients where recruited from outpatient clinics or were former patients of the pediatric oncologic department, performing the study. None of these studies was a S 171 Other multicenter study. All of them where retrospective studies, in which patients/ parents where asked about the use of CAM after the diagnosis of cancer. The results were a prevalence of CAM use between 9% and 84 % of pediatric cancer patients. Furthermore a comparison of the data from the United States shows, despite the lack of a study comparing patients at the same hospital after a few years, a very high increase of the use of CAM from 9% (1977) and 16% (1981) to 65% (1997) and 84% (2000) of the pediatric oncology patients. The other three studies (published between 1994 and 1998) showed an average use of CAM between 40% and 46%. Three studies found, that only half of the patients/parents (44%, 50%, 53%) discussed the use of CAM with their doctors. Three studies showed that parents regard CAM-methods in a large range to be effective in relation to the intention of their use (84%, 49%, nearly all aims reached). In two studies patients/ parents where asked about side effects with the result of 17% side effects and 14,7 % cancellation of the CAM without serious side effects. There is a high use rate of CAM among pediatric patients which are enrolled in clinical trials. The newest publication from the United States shows, that 84% of the interviewed patients used CAM and 85% of these patients took part in clinical trials. Although the use of CAM among adult cancer patients in German speaking countries is high (32% in 1986, 52% in 1991, 58,4% in 1998), there are no German published data for pediatric oncology patients. A first German wide retrospective study to evaluate the use of CAM in German pediatric oncology patients is under progress. P855 PERIOPERATIVE RESULTS AND MID-TERM FOLLOW-UP IN PATIENTS UN- DERGOING OPEN HEART SURGERY HAVING DIAGNOSED BUT NOT SURGI- CALLY TREATED CANCER H.-G. Wollert, D. Klahre, Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Klinikum Karlsburg (Kaflsburg) Due to the increasing age co-morbidity plays an important role and influences early, mid-term and late results in patients undergoing open heart surgery. Pa- tients having malignant diseases are referred for emergency but also for elective cardiac surgery and in a substantial percentage the cardiac procedure should be done previously to cancer surgery. Starting 1996 at our institution 49 cardiac procedures using extracorporeal circu- lation have been done before surgery for the malignant disease in those patients (see tab.) 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 04/2001 Tumor(n) 6 10 11 5 7 5 9 4 Valves 0 3 4 0 2 3 All patients but 2 left the hospital for rehabilitation (96%). Major complications were found in 5 patients (bleeding, cardiac/multiorgan failure). Mid-term follow-up concerning survival, cardiac and tumour symptoms as well as quality of life were assessed by an inquiry to practitioners and patients. There were four death so far (two carcinoma related, two due to cardiac reasons) betwee one and 22 months (mean 13month) after heart surgery. Clinical acceleration of tumour growth due to the cardiac procedure was not observed. Careful selection of patients allows good perioperative results but sequence of surgical procedures has to be assessed carefully in those critically ill patients. P856 INFLUENCE OF TIGHT JUNCTION PROTEINS IN THE GENESIS I. Moll, Universit&ts-Klinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg) It is a dogma, that the barrier function of the skin is held upright mainly by corneocytes and lipids. However it is still under discussion, whether cell-cell- junctions, e.g. Tight Junctions, are involved as well. In simple epithelia and endothelia Tight Junctions are known to be responsible for the formation and maintainance of the tissue barrier between compositionally distinct compartments, e.g. the blood-brain-barrier. They are composed of various transmembrane (Claudin 1-20, proteins 1-3 (ZO-1-3), Symplekin). In this work we focus on the occurrence of Occludin, Claudin 1 and ZO-1 in malignant melanoma compared to normal interfollicular epidermis. Investigations were performed by immunofluorescence microscopy using previously described specific antibodies. As previously shown by us and others in normal interfollicular epidermis Occludin and ZO-1 are expressed in the Stratum granulosum and the transition layer, while Claudin 1 occurs in all layers. Now we show that in contrast there is no expression of ZO-1 in epidermis adjacent to malignant melanoma. There is a strong expression of ZO-1 in malignant melanoma, in contrast to melanocytes, which are known to be negative for ZO- 1. Whereas Occludin and Claudin 1 are absent from malignant melanoma cells. They occur in normal interfollicular epidermis adjacent to a malignant melanoma, but Occludin is present in all layers and is no more restricted to the Stratum granulosum and the transition layer. These results clearly show a downregulation of ZO-1 in normal interfollicular epidermis adjacent to a malignant melanoma and an induction of ZO-1 in melanoma cells. We discuss a central role of ZO-1 in the genesis of malignant melanoma. Ongoing investigations will elucidate the function of ZO-1 and other Tight Junction proteins in malignant melanoma. Publication only P'857 NON-EXPERIMENTAL VS. EXPERIMENTAL CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY - POS- SIBLE SYNERGY S. Hoelzer, J. Dudeck, Institute of Medical Informatics (Giessen) The value of observational studies, registry data, or the analysis of comprehen- sive clinical databases to generate new medical knowledge are controversially discussed. Observational studies are used to evaluate the effectiveness of medi- cal interventions in the clinical routine (\"real-world effectiveness\"). Undoubtedly, they are important to describe patient characteristics, to monitor trends, to discover patterns of care, and to evaluate the use of practice guidelines or other tools of evidence-based practice. In addition, these studies are used to control the results of clinical trials. Several clinical examples for the scientific sound use of data from observational studies will be used to underline their potential for the patient as well as the healthcare providers. The analysis and results of observational studies can generate new hypotheses for future clinical research. In contrast to randomized, controlled clinical trials the data of an observational study doesn't prove the efficacy of specific clinical interventions. But modern methods of data collection and quality standards can minimize systematic bias. Available information technologies for data manage- ment and analysis, and the evolving infrastructure of epidemiologic and clinical tumor registries, such as National Cancer Databases, offer a detailed and up-to- date picture of the current provision of healthcare services in oncology. Thus, with its sensible use a non-experimental study may contribute to the total body of relevant evidence. Although the studies of experimental and non-experimental clinical epidemiology have different foci and primary objectives, both study types complement each other resulting in synergistic effects. P'858 PORT-CATHETER-SYSTEMS - COMPLICATIONS IN A FOLLOW-UP STUDY OF 311 IMPLANTED CASES S. Leinung, M. Wenzke, Sch6nfelder, The of a venous port-catheter-systems is very important and safty in the oncology. But we saw catheter lesions often in the last time. That is why we analysed this problem.311 port-catheter-systems were implanted in the V. subclavia by Seldinger- technique at the surgical clinic I of the University of Leipzig in the term from 1.1.1994 to 31.12.1999. This patients were followed up till 31.12.2000, with a mean-time-observation of 45 months. We saw 53 (17%) complications at 44 port-systems. At this we saw 21 cases (6.7%) immediate after implantation (up to 30 days postsurgica]). Long-term- complications from day 31 were evident in 27 patients (8.7%). We registered 20 (6,4%) infection, 1 (0,3%) secundary hemorrhage, (0,9%) 5 (1,6%) katheter, 2 (0,6%) dislocation of port, 4 (1,2%) pneumothorax, 2 (0,6%) disconnection of catheter, 4 (1,3%) (0,3%) I (0,3) (2,9%) and 1 (0,3%) dislocation of katheter-parts in blood-ciculation. The location of the catheter's lesion occured in 9 cases (2.9% of 311) right at the change of direction with the entry into the musculus pectoralis. Typically lenghway rips. We consider the change of direction as a responsibity for material fatigue of the catheter. During implantation you should avoid strictly any hard changes of the catheters direction, because this is where breakage happens. This leads to the conclusion that you should favour the catheter-implantation by exposure of vena basilica in the infraclavicular triangle. P'859 TOPICAL TREATMENT OF MALIGNANT WOUNDS IN PALLIATIVE CARE U. Wollina, K. Hohaus, G. Hansel, R. Dzingel, E. K6stler, Hautklinik Friedriohstadt (Dresden) Malignant wounds are defined as cancerous skin ulcers resulting from either a primary cancer or metastatic spread to the skin. Their frequency has been estimated in leg ulcers as 2.2 per 100 leg ulcers in Australia but only 17 cases of squamous cell carcinoma were identified in 10,913 leg ulcer patients in Sweden. The optimal treatment is curative anticancer therapy, in many cases surgery or radiotherapy. However, in many cases the treatment is only palliative. The major S 172 Other / Associated Symposia treatment obejectives are to improve patient's comfort and quality of life. It is important that treatment prevents infection and bleeding as far as possible. An improvement of pain and malodorous lesions often is required. Microbial decontamination and mild debridement are essential tools. New types of wound dressings but also approaches like traditional medicine and biosurgery may be helpful. By the use of non-invasive techniques such as contact-free remission spectroscopy the efficacy and effects of treatments can be evaluated in an objective way. An overview is given about recent developments. Associated S~/mposia A860 EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF THE STANDARDIZED MISTLETOE EXTRACT (ISCADORA) IN THE POSTSURGICAL THERAPY OF PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY BREAST CARCINOMA: A MULTICENTER, CONTROLLED, RETROLECTIVE COHORT STUDY ACCORDING TO GOOD EPIDEMIOLOGICAL PRACTICE (GEP) GUIDELINES. P.R. Beck, J. Hanisch, J. Hoffmann, R.E. Dierdorf, M. Werner, Th. Sch~rholz, B. Schneider, IFAG Basel (Basel, CH) In 16 study centers the efficacy and safety of the standardized mistletoe extract Iscador& were studied retrolectively in a cohort of 1442 patients with primary breast carcinoma submitted to surgery. 732 patients (control group) received postsurgical conventional anticancer therapy (radio-, chemo-, or hormone therapy) only, and were compared with the test group of 710 patients who received additionally various doses of Iscador& with a treatment duration of 3 6 months and a follow up duration 3 3 years or until death. Patients with a history of tumor relapses, distant metastasis, or previous radio, - chemo-, or hormone therapy were excluded. The primary endpoint of lscador&'s efficacy was the reduction of side effects of the conventional anticancer therapy in comparison with the control group. The secondary endpoints of efficacy consisted of the reduction of disease-related symptoms, and the Karnofsky Index. As the primary endpoint of safety the number of patients with side effects attributed to the Iscador\u00ae treatment was chosen. Results: The risk of side effects of the conventional anticancer therapy in the control group was 4-6 times higher (adjusted for confounders and baseline imbalance) than in the Iscador\u00ae group. 16.2% vs. 54.0% of the patients (Iscador\u00ae vs. control group) experienced side effects from the conventional anticancer therapy (statistically significant). The total freedom from all symptoms, the global efficacy assessment, and the Karnofsky Index were also significantly better in the Iscador\u00ae group.. There were six cases (0.8 %) of systemic side effects associated with Iscador\u00ae: tiredness, atopic eczema, hyperactivity, weakness, and bacterial skin infection. Iscador& caused local reactions at the injection site in 123 of 710 (17.3%) patients, which were rated ,,severe\" in 10 patients and required therapy discontinuation in 5. The overall treatment safety was rated ,,very good\" in 98.2% Iscador& patients as compared with 81.6% patients in the control group (significant). In conclusion, in this retrolective cohort study the standardized mistletoe extract Iscador& proved to be an effective and safe adjuvant treatment to the conventional anticancer therapy in the postoperative stage of primary breast carcinoma. A861 ABSENCE OF TUMOR GROWTH STIMULATION IN A PANEL OF 26 HUMAN TUMOR CELL LINES BY ISCADOR IN VITRO AND IN VIVO G. Viscum album (mistletoe) are widely used as complementary cancer therapies in Europe. The mistletoe lectine have been identified as the main active principle of mistletoe extracts. They have been shown to exhibit cytotoxic effects as well as immunomodulatory activities. Latter is exemplified by induction of cytokine secretion and increased activity of natural killer cells. Recent reports however, indicated a possible tumor growth stimulation by mistletoe extracts. Therefore, the three aqueous mistletoe extracts Iscador M special, Iscador Qu special, and Iscador P were evaluated for antiproliferative and/or stimulatory effects in a panel of 26 human tumor cell lines in vitro using a cellular proliferation assay. The doses tested ranged from 0.0015 - 15 pg/ml administered for 4 days. The results show no evidence of stimulation of tumor growth by any of the three Iscador preparations, comprising central nervous system, gastric, non-small cell lung, mammary, prostate, renal, sarcoma and uterus cancer cell lines as well as cell 4 cell lines from hematological malignancies and melanomas. To the contrary, Iscador preparations containing a high lectin concentration (Iscador M special and Iscador Qu special) showed antitumor activity in the mammary cancer cell line MAXF 401NL at the 15 #g/ml dose level with a more than 70% growth inhibition compared to untreated control cells. Iscador P, which contains only trace amounts of mistletoe lectin I showed no antiproliferative activity. In vivo investigations showed no evidence for a growth stimulation in 2 human melanomas, 2 mammary and 1 renal cancer model as well as an acute lymphob- lastic leukemia. This systematic preclinical study resulted in no evidence of a tumor stimulation in 26 human tumor cell lines invitro and in 5 human xenograft models in vivo. A862 MANAGEMENT OF INFECTIOUS COMPLICATIONS Dept. of Hematol./Oncology, Charite (Berlin) In febrile cancer patients (pts), empirical antimicrobial intervention is mandatory. For unexplained fever (rue) in high-risk pts with long lasting neutropenia, an anti- pseudomonal broad-spectrum beta-lactam, given alone or in combination with an aminoglycoside, represents the first choice and induces a stable defervescence in approximately 60% of pts treated. Distinct subgroups of pts have been identi- fied in whom initial modification of antimicrobial treatment is recommended, i.e. those with venous catheter-related infections, who may require a glycopeptide antibiotic, and those with pulmonary infiltrates who should be given early ampho- tericin B. Rationale modification of treatment in non-responders with persistent rue has rarely been studied. Supplementation of a glycopeptide has not been shown to be as effective as placebo. Empirical addition of an antifungal agent, however, appears to be beneficial in these pts. New antifungal agents such as caspofungin or voriconazole offer significant better tolerability as compared with amphotericin B. It must be emphasised that in pts with persisting fever, high- resolution computed tomography of the lungs is very helpful to detect pulmonary infiltrates much earlier than on conventional chest radiography. Pts with neutrope- nia of less than 10 days may be treated with oral amoxicillin/clavulanate plus ciprofloxacin. Although evidence-based guideline for prophylaxis and clinical management of infections in neutropenic patients are available (www.dgho- infektionen.de), those patients should be subject to controlled clinical studies. A863 PROBLEM SOLVING IN PALLIATIVE MEDICINE F. Nauck, D. Beck, Palliative medicine is dedicated to the treatment and support of patients with active, progres-sive, far-advanced disease for whom the prognosis is limited and the focus of care is the quality of life. The comprehensive approach means that in addition to the treatment of physical symptoms the integration of psychosocial and spiritual needs of the patients as well as of their relatives is necessary. Unbearable pain often is predominant, and its management requires the adequate drug and dosage with the adequate applica-tion route and timing. The individual dosage has to be titrated and may have to be adjusted with increasing pain. Problematic situations: In the course of the malignant disease problems with pain and symptom control may arise repeatedly. Psychosocial problems, misunderstandings between patients and staff or barriers with patients and rela- tives may prevent effective therapy as well as wrong drugs, dosage or application. Using video-based case reports solutions for problematic situations will be discussed with the participants of the symposium. Conclusions: Pain management and symptom control with adequate drug regimes as well as intensive psy-chesocial care are important for palliative medicine. Morphine remains the gold standard for cancer pain management, but new galenic preparations have added to the armatorium. The individual planning and the continuous adaptation of the therapeutic regimen during the course of the disease will lead to solutions even for prob]ematic situations. Standardized recommendations or even guidelines are available only for few areas of palliative medicine, and the patient-centered multidisciplinary discussion of unresolved prob-lems is one of the essential features of palliative care. A864 MYOCET: THE LIPOSOMAL FORMULATION C.E. Swenson, Elan (Princeton, NJ, USA) Liposomes are microscopic, closed lamellar structures formed when amphipathic lipids (usually phespholipids) are exposed to an aqueous environment. They were first described in 1965 and it was soon recognized that their ability to entrap other molecules in the internal aqueous space or the hydrophobie membrane had potential application in the delivery of drugs. Technically, liposomes are simple to prepare. Indeed, when appropriate lipids, in appropriate concentrations, are exposed to water, liposomes form spontaneously. In actual practice, however, there are a large number of variables to consider in producing a liposomal preparation of a particular drug for a particular indication. These include the properties of the drug, efficiency of encapsulation, homogene- ity, size and surface characteristics of the resulting particles, drug to lipid ratio and permeability and stability of the preparation. Myocet was developed in order to target doxorubicin to tumor sites while sparing healthy tissues; in particular, the heart. Myocet is a non-pegylated, liposomal form of doxorubicin in which is complexed with citrate inside the vesicle. The aggregation state of the internalized doxorubicin and a pH gradient across the liposomal membrane are responsible for the slow rate of drug release from the liposome in vivo. The small size of the lipesemes allow them to remain in the circulation until they accumulate in tumors through the leaky vaseulature that supplies these tissues. Preciinical studies have shown the accumulation of doxorubicin in tumor tissue after treatment with Myocet and anti-tumor efficacy that is at least equivalent to conventional doxorubicin. In addition, the peak and overall exposure of normal tissue (heart, gastrointestinal tract) to doxorubicin is less after Myocet than after conventional doxorubicin, resulting in reduced cardio- and gastrointestinal toxicity. S 173 anthracyclines are amongst the most utilised antitumour agents, their clinical utility is limited by a potentially life-threatening form of cardiotoxicity. Development of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy is closely associated with the cumulative anthracycline dose. At a lifetime dose of 450 to 550 rag/m2, approximately 5% of doxorubicin-treated patients develop congestive heart failure (CHF). At 1000 mg/m2 the incidence of CHF reaches approximately 50%. Anthracycline-mediated cardiotoxicity theoretically starts with the first application. The cardiac damage is initially subclinical, but continued treatment results in progressive myocyte damage leading to cardiac dysfunction. Anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy is irreversible and may proceed to clinical CHF. The risk of cardiotoxicity is increased in children, elderly patients, and patients with pre- existing cardiac-disease or concomitant or prior mediastinal or chest irradiation. Several strategies have been devised to circumvent these adverse effects, including the development of less toxic analogues, liposomal encapsulation, alterations in scheduling and the addition of cardioprotectant agents. The clinical use of prolongated application is limited by practical considerations. Epirubicin, a semisynthetic derivative of doxorubicin, has a lower cardiotoxic potential. However, the definition of the equivalent dose compared to doxorubicin remains controversial. Cardioprotective agents such as dexrazoxane can increase other side effects like myelosuppression and might interfere with the antitumour activity. Liposomal encapsulation alters the tissue distribution and the pharmacokinetic properties of anthracyclines. Reduced free drug concentrations in plasma and targeted delivery to the tumour with sparing of healthy tissue results in an improved therapeutic index and decreases the risk of cardiotoxicity. Myocet, a novel non-pegylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, is equally effective compared to doxorubicin but associated with a significantly lower risk of cardiotoxicity. Thus, liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin extends the treatment options especially in patients at increased risk of developing cardiotoxicity allowing higher cumulative doses to be administered. Myocet is currently indicated for first-line therapy of metastatic breast cancer. The potential as effective combination partner is supported by emerging data which indicate good tolerability in combination with taxanes and herceptin. A866 CLINICAL Anthracyclines are a potent group of cytotoxic agents with substantial activity against a wide spectrum of solid tumours and haematological malignancies. They are used for preoperative, adjuvant palliative treatment. The non-pegylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, Myocet, exhibits several advantages over conventional anthracycline preparations. At standard doses of 60-75 mg/m2, Myocet has an equivalent antitumour activity to conventional doxorubicin but a significantly reduced risk of cardiotoxicity. The results indicate that compared with conventional dexorubicin more cycles and higher doses of Myocet could be administered. This may be especially important in patients at increased risk of cardiac toxicity and may lead to the development of new and more effective combination regimens.Four phase II trials of Myocet in metastatic breast cancer have been carried out. Patients achieved objective tumour response rates of 43% to 56% with acceptable levels of toxicity at doses of 60-75 mg/m2 Myocet. Based on the results from the phase II studies, 3 randomized clinical trials in metastatic breast cancer have been conducted, comparing Myocet as single agent or in combination with cyclophosphamide to conventional doxorubicin or epirubicin. They showed that, on a milligram-per-milligram basis, Myocet exhibits equivalent antitumour activity to conventional doxorubicin and superior activity in terms of progression-free survival compared to epirubicin. Furthermore, subgroup analyses indicate that Myocet might have a higher antitumour efficacy than dexorubicin in patients who have received prior adjuvant anthracycline treatment. At the same time, Myocet is significantly less cardiotoxic than conventional doxorubicin, allowing the application of significantly higher lifetime cumulative doxorubicin doses. This was especially relevant for patients at an increased risk of cardiac failure, defined by pre-treatment with anthracyclines, prior mediastinal or chest irradiation or patient age of at least 65 years.Based on these results, Myocet is currently indicated for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Studies in combination with taxanes and herceptin are ongoing. The excellent cardiac safety profile of Myocet and emerging data, which indicate good tolerability in combination with other agents, suggest the potential for further investigation in the adjuvant setting. Furthermore, Myocet is currently studied in new indications such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). A867 MYOCET IN COMBINATION WITH TRASTUZUMAB: A NEW OPTION FOR MENT OF HER20VEREXPRESSING BREAST CANCER J.U. is overexpressed in 25-30% of breast cancers, which predicts a very poor prognosis for these patients and indicates a direct role for HER2 in the pathogenesis and clinical aggressiveness of such turnouts. A recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab) directed against the HER2 protein has been successfully developed. Trastuzumab causes a marked downregulation in HER2 expression in cancer cells and demonstrates good antitumour activity in patients with metastatic breast cancer in combination regimens with the anthracyclines or paclitaxel. Recent evidence indicates that HER2 positive turnouts preferentially respond to anthracyclines. Therefore, chemotherapy regimens incorporating doxorubicin and trastuzumab in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer could lead to the development of a highly efficacious therapy. However, the combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin results in unacceptably high levels of cardiotoxicity. In one trial (Slamon et al., 2001), 27% of patients receiving doxorubicin/trastuzumab developed cardiotoxicity compared with only 8% of those treated with doxorubicin alone. These results suggest that it would be of benefit to treat patients overexpressing HER2 with a regimen containing trastuzumab combined with a less cardiotoxic anthracycline than doxorubicin. Myocet is a novel liposome- encapsulated of doxorubicin, with significantly less cardiotoxicity than conventional doxorubicin.To determine the safety and efficacy of Myocet and trastuzumab in combination in advanced breast cancer (ABC), a phase 1/11 study has been performed (Theodoulou et al.) in patients with HER2 positive tumours: 2-3+ by immunohistochemistry or FISH positive. 37 mg/m2) intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks; trastuzumab (4mg/kg) IV week 1 followed by 2mg/kg IV weekly. An overall response rate of 60% was observed in a lst-3rd-line setting in patients, of whom 30% had prior trastuzumab and 37% were pretreated with a median cumulative dose of 240mg/m 2 doxorubicin. Although a lifetime cumulative dose of up to 840mg/m ~ doxorubicin was administered, only one reversible cardiotoxicity class Ill/IV was observed. These most promising data lead to the conclusion that the combination of Myocet/trastuzumab is a well-tolerated, active regimen even in heavily pretreated patients with HER2 positive tumours. A868 PEDIATRIC PALLIATIVE MEDICINE AND PAIN THERAPY - AN ORPHAN OR A PROBLEM CHILD? B. Zernikow, Universit~t Witten/Herdecke (Datteln) Introduction. Pain is one of the main factors that influence the quality of life of pediatric tumor patients. In the palliative phase, pain control and psychosocial care are the focus of medical and nursing endeavors. Nation-wide quality assurance projects have been set up or are being initiated. Pain therapy. STOP (Schmerz-Therapie in der P~idiatrischen Onkologie &#8793; pain therapy in pediatric oncology) was evaluated by means of a pre- and post- therapy questionnaire-based survey. Quality assurance measures in the STOP project were actively implemented at 9 clinics (education courses throughout the country; introduction to pain assessment and documentation; documentation, evaluation and benchmarking of all pain therapies) and passively at 67 clinics (printing and dispatch of >5000 copies of the GPOH pain therapy guidelines and pain assessment cards). Upon completion of the STOP project, smileys were used with significantly greater frequency (pre: 48 %; post 65% of the clinics, p 0.001). Bone marrow biopsies were carried out with significantly greater frequency in analgo-sedation (pre 32%; post 46%, p = 0.001). The degree of satisfaction with the individual pain therapy received was significantly higher (pre 34%, post 64% P= 0.001). Comparing the clinics with active and passive educational measures, the use of morphine and the regularity of the use of EMLA in the ,,active\" clinics increased significantly and the use of piritramide decreased significantly. In the ,,active\" hospitals, the times of severe pain were reduced by 20%. Palliative medicine. PATE (palliative medicine and therapy and their evaluation in pediatric hematooncology) was applied in a similar fashion to STOR The aims of PATE are: the analysis of structure and contents of pediatric oncological palliative medicine in Germany, the definition of recommendations on the control of pain symptoms and psychosocial care; the development of organizational models of pediatric oncological palliative care; the creation of research structures on the quality of life of children. The preliminary results will be presented. Conclusion. in Germany, the quality of pediatric oncological pain therapy has been decidedly improved by the nation-wide project STOR Similarly good results are hoped for from PATE in pediatric palliative care. STOP/PATE are supported by the Deutsche Kinderkrebsstiftung and the company Mundipharma GmbH, Limburg/Lahn A869 PALLIATIVE HOME CARE SERVICES TO IMPROVE THE CARE FOR THE SE- VERELY ILL AT HOME 3-. Schindler, Palliativmedizinischer Konsiliardienst in NRW (Geldern) For a long time, the medical and nursing care of severely ill and dying patients in their homes has been neglected in Germany. Many patients are still referred to a hospital at the end of their life although care at home would be possible and is preferred by most of the patients. Over the past few years, however, there is growing understanding of how important it is to deliver high-quality palliative care in the home care setting. Pioneers for this change have mainly been voluntary hospice organisations which have started to support the dying and their families in an adequate way over the last 20 years.Care for the dying, however, quite frequently implies problems which even keen relatives and volunteers cannot handle. General practitioners, too, may be overtaken by specific problems e.g. in terminal cancer. Therefore about 70 % of all cancer patients still die in hospital, only 30 % in their familiar surroundings.Palliative home care services - often working in close cooperation with oncologists or specialists for pain therapy - can offer great help for patients, relatives and general practitioners in this situation. Due to their specialized knowledge and their constant availability, most severely ill cancer patients (53-86 %) can die at home, competently cared for. Very often, S 174 Associated Symposia nursing aspects play a central part in the care of patients and families, thus a specialized palliative nursing care will need more attention within the structures of palliative care being offered up to now.in Germany only very few specialized palliative home care services exist (about 20) at present varying widely in structure. Their financial reimbursement is usually not guaranteed by health insurances. This is amazing as all data suggest that they greatly diminish in-patient demand. instead of implementing palliative home care services, however, recent regulations (concerning regulations for nursing care) and forthcoming decisions (introduction of the DRG) of the health care authorities interfere with high quality care of the dying at home rather than help in this urgently needed new domain. A870 PALLIATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY - A NECESSARY MUST, AN OPTION OR JUST A NECESSARY EVIL? R. Hartenstein (MLinchen-Untergiesing) More than 90% of the patients in palliative care suffer from the advanced stages of incurable progressive cancer disease. Particularly in the fluid transitional phase of the disease, when palliative antineoplastic therapy that aims at relieving the symptoms (clinical benefit response) or maintaining the state (maintenance therapy) collides with the palliative intention of systemic symptom-related and psycho- social care, as well as during the terminal phases of life when the aim is to improve the quality of life without lengthening life, oncology and palliative medicine are sister disciplines, working together within the network of care for cancer patients.In this late phase of incurable tumor-related disease, the palliative therapy directed at the tumor (e.g. chemotherapy) is an important option, provided the advantages of the therapy outweigh the side effects and strain on the patient. In stages of incurable cancer, when tumor remission and improvement of life expectancy are targets of the therapy, the palliative oncological therapy is an absolute indication. Here too, when taking a decision on therapy, it is important to give due consideration to the benefit achieved versus the strain involved and above all, the specific life perspective of the informed autonomous patient. Summarizing the palliative oncological therapy (e.g. chemotherapy) for incurable tumor disease is never a ,,must\" and never ,,just a necessary evil\" but always an option dependent on medical indication and the will of the patient. The early integration of palliative medicine with predisposed patients makes sense to ensure continuity in the care of incurable cancer patients until the end of their life and in the care of their relatives. Reiner Hartenstein A871 TREATMENT OF CANCER PAIN PATIENTS WITH Introduction: it has been estimated by the WHO that cancer pain affects at least 4 million people world-wide. With increasing acceptance of the WHO-guidelines for cancer pain management pain relief may be achieved for the majority of patients. Oral morphine, by international consensus, is the epioid of choice in the treatment of cancer pain, but not all patients get sufficient pain relief under the treatment of morphine. The new strong opioids available can be an answer for patients with difficult pain syndroms. Patients and Methods: In our palliative care unit we treat cancer patients with difficult pain syndroms. In a computer engineered database we collect the data of all our patients focussing on pain and other symptoms as well as drugs for pain therapy and symptom control on a daily bases. This includes the assessment of pain in a numeric or verbal rating scale. We analyised the data collected over a period of 20 months. Results: Between 10/99 and 05/2001 263 patients were admitted to our palliative care unit. Of these patients 76 % suffer from pain. In 90 % of our patients we are able to reach pain freedom or a satisfactory pain relief (reduction >50 %). Most of these patients are treated with morphine (51%). But in some patients there is no adequate pain relief or side effects occur under morphine and we are forced to change to an alternative drug. From the 26 % of patients under strong opieids at discharge other than morphine 42.3 % oxycodon. Besides strong opioids patients are treated according to the WHO - guidelines with nonopioids, supplemented with coanalgetics where appropriate. Comment: For a sufficient treatment of cancer pain physicians should be able to know the causes and types of pain, to discuss the side-effects of opioids, its myths and facts, to know the different classes of drugs such as opioids, adjuvants and nen-opioid analgetics. An accurate assessment and a precise diagnosis of the underlying pathomechanism of pain is necessary for the successful cancer pain therapy. Conclusion: Morphine is still the goldstandard in cancer pain relief but the wide range of inter-and intraindividual effects and side effects of opioids in different patients makes alternatives for a sufficient treatment necessary. The new opioids are able to relief strong pain in cancer patients, but until now there are no differential indications for choosing the right opioid at the right time. S 175 "}
