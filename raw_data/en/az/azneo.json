Some sources state that the term is in reference to when the Native Americans would paint their faces red, but others proclaim it's related to the scalping incidents. During the mid-19th century, authorities offered bounties for the scalps of Indians and referred to them as redskins. This issue has resurfaced once again as a dispute between the Washington Redskins and the Native Americans over the name of this certain National Football League team. In the 1700's , people were travelling from Europe and England to join the Colonies. These colonies had many resources available, and the port cities of New England were quickly turning into trading centers. One of the most abundant commodities in New England were its trees. Especially the white pine trees, which, untouched, had grown tall, straight and wide, optimal for the masts of British naval ships. Meanwhile, in England, most of the suitable trees had already been harvested and used, therefore they saw the opportunity using these trees from the colonies presented. Because of this, Parliament and King George III declared that any white pine in the colonies belonged to him, solidifying this with enacting a law that protected \"any white pine tree of the growth of twelve inches in The Cherokee people used plants for medicinal use. In fact, some plants had more than one use. Take the Qua lo ga, or common Sumac, for example.

Scared and confused, she called the cops to come help her, resulting in her losing all her friends. Melinda refuses to speak up and tell anyone why she called the cops that night. \"Tree\" represents Melinda's growth as a character throughout the school year as she learns to deal with what happened to her.

It is shown despite the most difficult backgrounds, challenging roadblocks, and strenuous lifestyles. These people vary from having great fears, physical challenges, or no support from loved ones. No matter what challenges materialize, this incredible will-power emerges from within and persists to the very end.

Forgot to pick up an important note from the office? Has the meeting with your therapist that you booked a week ago completely forgotten? A frail memory can be totally disappointing in our daily life! The cool, upland air, flooding through the everlasting branches of the lively tree, as it casts a vague shadow onto the grasses ' fine green. Fresh sunlight penetrates through the branches of the tree, illuminating perfect spheres of water upon its green wands. My numb and almost transparent feet are blanketed by the sweetness of the scene, as the sunlight paints my lips red, my hair ebony, and my eyes honey-like. The noon sunlight acts as a HD camera, telling no lies, in the world in which shadows of truth are the harshest, revealing every flaw in the sight, like a toddler carrying his very first camera, taking pictures of whatever he sees. My head looks down at the sight of my cold and lifeless feet, before making its way up to the reaching arms of an infatuating tree, glowing brightly virescent at the edges of the trunk, inviting a soothing, tingling sensation to my soul. I feel it radiating into my blood, as my heart skips a beat. Soon, enlightened by a beating pair of wings effortlessly moving up and down, more fragile than the glass that once was sitting on the edge of the table.
