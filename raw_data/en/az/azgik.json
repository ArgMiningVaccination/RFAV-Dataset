Here are 6 helpful resources to get you started with utilizing the power of natural medicine.", "sitename": "Food Revolution Network", "date": "2019-10-02", "cleaned_text": "Have you ever had a cold, and instead of turning to a bottle of cold medicine or some ibuprofen, you ate a clove of garlic or drank a cup of ginger tea? Natural remedies like these have been around for thousands of years and have been utilized around the world. Allopathic medicine has achieved many lifesaving and pain-reducing breakthroughs over the last couple hundred years (including anesthesia, modern surgical techniques, and antibiotics). But it's lost sight of the effectiveness of many natural treatments. Trained by pharmaceutical companies, doctors now prescribe pills instead of the plants whose healing properties often inspired the drugs in the first place. While the manufactured drugs are often far more potent than the plants from which their active ingredients were identified, many also come with significant costs. These can include a dizzying array of side effects, decreased effectiveness over time, and the potential to cause debilitating dependency (like the opioid crisis). As the limitations of pharmaceuticals become increasingly apparent, more and more people are turning to natural medicine as a resource to alleviate their pain and help them achieve healing. Since 2007, approximately 38% of adults and 12% of children in the United States [have used](https://nccih.nih.gov/research/statistics/2007/camsurvey_fs1.htm) some form of natural medicine. And the [rates](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/dbaf/787c74b082c06f50da0452ab2f725de068a3.pdf) of complementary and alternative medicine are even higher in Southeast Asia, where many natural medicine modalities [originated](https://cam-europe.eu/cam-modalities). But what exactly is natural medicine? Defining Natural Medicine Natural medicine is a form of medicine that uses the healing powers of nature to support the body in healing itself. It typically applies a holistic, rather than reductionalistic, approach \u2014 seeking to treat the whole person, rather than focusing mainly on addressing specific symptoms. Types of natural medicine may include things like nutrition, herbalism, chiropractic, ayurveda, acupuncture, yoga, meditation, naturopathy, and many other complementary and alternative approaches to healing. For an overview of some popular natural medicine types and techniques, check out the Association for Natural Medicine in Europe's website, [here](https://www.anme-ngo.eu/en/eu-agenda/cam-forschung/153-eu-agenda-cam-en.html).
