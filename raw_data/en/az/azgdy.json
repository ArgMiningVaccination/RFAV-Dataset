Some of the vaccines may be given as part of a combination vaccine so that a child gets fewer shots. Talk with your doctor about which vaccines your kids need. Birth [HepB](/en/parents/hepb-vaccine.html): Hepatitis B vaccine. Ideally, the first dose is given within 12-24 hours of birth, but kids not previously immunized can get it at any age. Some low birth weight infants will get it at 1 month or when they're discharged from the hospital. 1-2 months [HepB](/en/parents/hepb-vaccine.html): Second dose should be given 1 to 2 months after the first dose. 2 months [DTaP](/en/parents/dtap-vaccine.html): Diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine [Hib](/en/parents/hib-vaccine.html): DTaP - Hib - IPV - PCV - RV 6 months - DTaP - Hib: This third dose may be needed, depending on the brand of vaccine used in previous Hib immunizations. - PCV - RV: This third dose may be needed, depending on the brand of vaccine used in previous RV immunizations. 6 months and annually [Influenza (Flu)](/en/parents/flu-vaccine.html): The flu vaccine is recommended every year for children 6 months and older: - Kids younger than 9 who get the flu vaccine for the first time (or who have only had 1 dose before July 2022) will get it in 2 separate doses at least a month apart. - Those younger than 9 who have had at least 2 doses of flu vaccine previously (before July 2022) will only need 1 dose. - Kids older than 9 need only 1 dose. - The vaccine is given by injection with a needle (the flu shot) or by nasal spray. Both types of vaccine can be used this flu season (2022-2023) because they seem to work equally well. Your doctor will recommend which to use based on your child's age and general health. The nasal spray is only for healthy people ages 2-49. People with weak immune systems or some health conditions (such as asthma) and pregnant women should not get the nasal spray vaccine. 6-18 months - HepB - Measles, mumps, and rubella (German measles) vaccine. Sometimes given together with the varicella vaccine and called MMRV. - PCV [Varicella (chickenpox)](/en/parents/varicella-vaccine.html) 12-23 months [HepA](/en/parents/hepa-vaccine.html): Hepatitis A vaccine; given as 2 shots at least 6 months apart 15-18 months - DTaP 4-6 years - DTaP 9-16 years - Dengue vaccine: This vaccine is given in 3 doses to children who have already had [dengue fever](/en/parents/dengue.html)and who live in areas where it is common (such as Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). 11-12 years [HPV](/en/parents/hpv-vaccine.html): Human papillomavirus vaccine, given in 2 shots over a 6- to 12-month period. It can be given as early as age 9. For teens and young adults (ages 15-26), it is given in 3 shots over 6 months. It's recommended for both girls and boys to prevent genital warts and some types of cancer. - Tdap: Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis booster. Also recommended during each pregnancy a woman has. [MenACWY](/en/parents/meningitis-vaccine.html): Meningococcal vaccine. Protects against meningococcal bacteria types A, C, W, and Y. A booster dose is recommended at age 16. 16-18 years [MenB](/en/parents/meningitis-vaccine.html): Meningococcal vaccine. Protects against meningococcal bacterium type B. The MenB vaccine may be given to kids and teens in 2 or 3 doses, depending on the brand. Unlike the meningococcal conjugate vaccine, which is recommended for all, the decision to get the MenB vaccine is made by the teens, their parents, and the doctor. It is only recommended as routine for kids 10 years and older who have specific conditions that weaken their immune system, or during an outbreak. Other Things to Know - The HepA vaccine can be given as early as 6 months of age to babies who will travel to a place where hepatitis A is common (they will still need routine vaccination after their first birthday). It's also recommended for older kids who did not get it in the past. - The MMR vaccine can be given to babies as young as 6 months old if they will be traveling internationally. These children should still get the recommended routine doses at 12-15 months and 4-6 years of age, but can get the second dose as early as 4 weeks after the first if they will still be traveling and at risk. - The flu vaccine is especially important for kids who are at risk for health problems from the flu. High-risk groups include, but aren't limited to, kids younger than 5 years old and those with chronic medical conditions, such as [asthma](/en/parents/asthma-basics.html), heart problems, [sickle cell disease](/en/parents/sickle-cell-anemia.html), diabetes, or [HIV](/en/parents/hiv.html). - Pneumococcal vaccines can be given to older kids (age 2 and up) who have conditions that affect their immune systems, such as asplenia or HIV infection, or other conditions, like a [cochlear implant](/en/parents/cochlear.html), chronic heart disease, or chronic lung disease. - The meningococcal vaccines can be given to kids as young as 8 weeks old (depending on the vaccine brand) who are at risk for a meningococcal infection, such as [meningitis](/en/parents/meningitis.html). This includes children with some immune disorders. Kids who live in (or will travel to) countries where meningitis is common, or where there is an outbreak, also should get the vaccine. [COVID- 19 vaccines](/en/parents/covid-vaccines.html)and [booster shots](/en/parents/booster-shots.html)are recommended for adults and kids 6 months of age and older. Everyone who is eligible should get these as soon as possible. - Adults who were fully vaccinated against polio as children can get a polio vaccine booster dose if they're at risk for exposure to polio. This can include people who: - travel to areas where there's a high risk for catching polio - might be exposed to poliovirus at work - have close contact at home with someone who has polio Note: An outbreak is when a disease happens in greater numbers than expected in a particular area. If you have questions about vaccinating your family during an outbreak, ask your health care provider or contact your state or local health department. Date "}
