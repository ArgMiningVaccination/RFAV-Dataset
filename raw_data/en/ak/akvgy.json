What was your life like before SWIHA? What led you to SWIHA and to your particular program of study? Why are you passionate about this modality?: Before SWIHA my life was on autopilot I was literally living each day just to survive the struggles I was having at the time and not enjoying the moments of calmness because I didn't even recognize them at the time. I started seeing my daughter's hypnotherapist to help me with my stress and anxiety and when I saw the results which brought sanity back into my life, I was amazed and wanted to learn everything I could about hypnotherapy so that I can use this holistic approach to continue to help myself and at the same time help those in my inner circle.

While he enjoyed facilitating the health and healing of others, a few years ago he was called toward change. \"I started noticing that I was feeling extremely stressed,\" Victor tells us, \"I had very low energy and motivation. I was also feeling extremely irritated most of the time and walking the line between negativity and anger. I started becoming more and more aware of this, and I started thinking that I needed to make a change from my day job as a massage school director. I didn't know what or how to do it. Although I had my clinic operating with a team of therapists, I had many attachments to jobs as 'just' forty hours per week. However, when you actually do the math, the average American spends a collective thirteen years and two months of their life at work. So, why are three quarters of Americans reportedly unhappy on the job? And why should we be okay with spending so much of our life in a discontent state? According to [The American Institute of Stress](https://www.stress.org/workplace-stress), one in four people surveyed had been driven to tears due to work-related incidents and 65% reported that job stress caused difficulties resulting in decreased productivity. It's not just a mental/emotional problem, though: job stress has been demonstrated to be associated with increased rates of heart attack, hypertension and other disorders, and 62% of people reported leaving work experiencing fast-paced world means that each day we face challenges\u2014whether it's finances, family, career, or relationships\u2014and it can be easy to go, go, go! until suddenly we're running on empty, our self-esteem is plummeting and we feel disconnected or numb.

I found that my coach asked great questions that I hadn't thought of. It made a big difference Mindfulness is an ability we all possess. Just like a muscle, the more often that we choose to utilize it, the greater the ability grows. At its most basic definition, living mindfully is making the choice to be fully present in each moment. By bringing awareness to what you're directly experiencing (sounds, scents, sensations) you can reduce ruminative thinking, improve your memory, and find a greater appreciation for both positive and negative experiences. Meditation is a tool for becoming more mindful. It is an exploration of our internal landscape, where we unleash our natural curiosities and suspend our judgement. Often times, we're not even aware of how busy our brains are, so by making the time to \"check-in\" and observe our thoughts, we can learn to better problem-solve and discover the root cause of our gone full circle: from her roots as a middle school and high school teacher to her exploration as a student at SWIHA, she is now returning once more to the world of education as a [Life Coach](https://swiha.edu/life-coaching/)!

Yet, it wasn't until she trained in a diverse spectrum of specialties at SWIHA\u2014including massage therapy, yoga, aromatherapy, life coaching, mindfulness, guided imagery, and hypnotherapy\u2014that Dana found an appropriate name for the phenomenon she was encountering. \"I became consciously aware of the importance of returning to the parasympathetic\u2014or \"rest and digest\"\u2014state as often as possible,\" she reflects. \"So many of the body, mind, and spirit's important functions take place Clinical Hypnotherapist [Stacia Aashna](http://www.staciaaashna.com), one of the best ways to start the New Year is with a detox of body and mind.

For those who don't know, \"booch\" is the term for a [fermented tea beverage](http://gtslivingfoods.com/) that detoxifies the body and builds the immune system. It is an ideal companion for those brave souls who are ready to detox their mind of old \"personal lies\"- that inner dialogue of unconscious, reinforcing statements that keeps you from evolving into your best, most confident, happiest self. Yet, drinking tea is not the only way to \"clear\" yourself internally in preparation for what 2018 will bring!

In fact, during the first 20-hour weekend of her [Life Coaching program](https://swiha.edu/life-coaching/) at SWIHA, Jewel felt intuitively called to volunteer as the demo client for a fear-related exercise being led by master instructor Richard Seaman in front of a room of nearly fifty people. While there was a part of her that didn't want to be put in spotlight, there was also a part of her that knew she was being compelled to step up and face her fears! A Lion Among Wolves And face her fears she did!
