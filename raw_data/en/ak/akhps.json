I've read that breast cancer patients should avoid those. Anyone here have knowledge of it or use it personally?0 - [DianaNM](https://community.breastcancer.org/en/profile/DianaNM)Member Posts: 62 I've been hanging onto that study about women over 60s and HT as part of my reason for not taking Femara. Hadn't noted the bit about tumor size being under 1cm, mine was 2.5 cm, and I am 59. Rats. Saw the Integrative Oncologist yesterday. Wasn't a great visit, but she did agree to test some of my vitamin levels and to eventually order a 24 hour urine test for hormones, if my insurance approves it. She was concerned that I am not taking Femara, and was not moved by my argument that my Estradiole level tested at 3.9. Guess I will revisit this tomorrow when I see my regular Onc. I just can't find anything that says Femara has any magic in it aside from suppressing estrogen. I know estrogen fluctuates, but 3.9 is pretty darn low. I'm dealing with truncal lymphedema and it feels like that's all I can handle right now.0 - Thx for the link, Deanna. Looks quite promising! RE: \"white button mushroom extract ... 5 8 or 13 grams...\" Sooo, sounds like they are using supplements. My integrative DR sold me some Mushrooms which I have been heistant to take since I have low BP issues, but when I called his office he said if you had *already* low BP it would not lower it. Perhaps it is time to start popping them!0 - Mini - I have a lot of experience with Ojibwa Tea. Not the same as Essiac tea which is a brand name and the company added red clover and I think a few more herbs even later on. The red clover must be avoided by breast cancer people. I was told this by the one who makes the organic Ojibwa tea. The Ojibwa tea was used on many with breast cancer who were on their death beds. There are many books with stories on recoveries. On the sheep sorrel and turkey rhubarb, I don't know, they are phytoestrogens. We shoud check into it. I think I will ask my endo too. And Michelle, the woman who makes the best Ojibwa tea. But I do know the red clover it a huge NO, bcz in female cancers it will cause the tumor to grow, but I do not know why. When the red clover is a no and the other two are all right, I am confused at the moment. So let's do check out why. The Ojibwa tea, it is just not enough in this day and age with all that we go out of balance from, but it is helpful for liver cleanse, blood purifier, blood builder in all ways, parasites, and so much more. For cancer, one can never say it would or would not work,, but it is good for protocols. Received my package from the endocrinologist. D3, T-3 / T-4 for thyroid, melatonin and bioidentical progesterone. I am a week away from feeling like a new woman. Maybe I will even color the grey with something natural. LOVEEssa0 - [rgiuff](https://community.breastcancer.org/en/profile/rgiuff)Member Posts: 339 I used tincture of rhubarb, which I believe is the same thing as turkey rhubarb (rheum palmatum), a couple of years ago to deal with the hot flashes from tamoxifen. My oncologist was the one who recommended it. I did find it to work somewhat, but I never ended up reordering it and it wasn't an easy supplement to find. Only on the internet, did I find it. And I had to search high and low to find anything mentioning it being good for hot flashes. There is plenty about how it is used as a laxative. He recently recommended it again and I asked why it works, is it a phytoestrogen? He said he didn't think so, but he knew that a study done on it had shown it to be effective against hot flashes for unknown reasons. We then discussed phytoestrogens. He doesn't feel that they are strong enough to cause any harm, but also doesn't feel that they have been proven effective enough to help menopause symptoms either, so why bother taking the risk.0 - du\" Do people still use the word DE rather than DU when talking to strangers? I should practice my Danish with you. My brother lives in another state and since he was only 8 when we came to the US he only remembers a few words anyway. I was 11 so understand a little more--0 - I looked on the site that makes the E-Tea and it recommends that it not be taken by people with BC. I think I'm at the better safe than sorry point on this one and will not take it. I will look for the Ojibwa tea. I'm not a tea fan, but I'm drinking it anyway. I'm hoping it's one of those acquired taste. I found some excellent blueberry tea in a tea store in Miami Beach. I'm drinking white tea now. I'm going to see if adding a cinnamon stick will give it some zing. :-)0 - Geranium oil mixed in water actually makes a spray that helps hot flashes. Just spray the area around you. Yes, Mini, definitely not Essiac tea with the red clover when one has a feminine cancer. Definitely not. LOVEEssa0 - Actually,you should look over your insurance info and then call to see what out of pocket would be,some insur only pay if its for a diagnosis related test and some will pay something regardless or just depends on how the MO writes it up,they just wanted me to know it was avail if I wanted it. One sad story I heard from a woman at the chemo lab when I told her I was a mess cause I just had implant surg,she said to me, Oh the doctor never told me I could do that,I am still wearing a prosthesis on my cancer side. I almost passed out from shock,How dare they not tell her that its the law and her right! We have got to keep talking and marching and walking and wearing slogan shirts until women know what their rights are. I will never forget as a little 12 yr old girl seeing my aunt after her Halsted operation. I was terrified all my life that would happen to me and now my worst fears have come upon me but thank God we have options now since the 1998 WHCA was signed.0 - [Beckers](https://community.breastcancer.org/en/profile/Beckers)Member Posts: 979 Hi there. I'm 6 weeks from surgery and see my MO next Tuesday and I know AI's are next on my to do list. I have browsed this thread. I'm nervous because I am >98% ER + and already 40-50 lbs overweight and AI's can make me gain and the my fat is loaded with estrogen??? I also have family history of heart disease. Heavy sigh. I'm so tired and now I need to get to researching this issue. I read that AI's are not as effective for obese people. I am BMI 31. I have lost 6 lbs but have a way to go. I did not do chemo as my onco score is 19. I thought the AI was the big gun to prevent recurrence for me. Now that I had them remove my breasts, it would be stage IV if it does come back. This is a lot to take in. Your thoughts are appreciated. (I will also read this thread and research better when I'm rested up.)0 - I always thought that being apple-shaped rather than pear-shaped was due to the heart, but I learned that estrogen is stored in fat, and belly fat is particularly close to the breast making it a short journey for the CA cells. I have not read anything about AI's being less effective on heavy women, though I'm far from an expert. I didn't last on the AI's, but I've seen many ladies post that they did not gain weight on either the AI's or Tamox. I wonder sometimes if some of the weight gain is stress related. I actually lost weight on it because I lost my appetite. I ate from necessity not hunger. Definitely rest up and then do your research. Remember that there are several AI's, so if one doesn't work you can try another. Some folks do horribly on one but are fine on another. Everyone's experience is different. I am curious to know why you say if you have a recurrence or a new tumor it would be stage 4. I've never heard of that; especially with a new tumor. Is this something you've read. If so, would you mind sharing the site. I'm still learning too. :-)0 - Mini: Maybe she means that because her breasts are gone the cancer (if it would recur) would go to an organ? But she could get a new cancer in the chest wall couldn't she?. And that wouldn't be a recurrence then. Correct me if I'm wrong - just guessing0 - Dogs, that is so cool that you remember some. Nej, at det i Hornbek vor min bedstefar farmor osse bode. Min mor or far blev skilt or vi to born rejste wid min mor til Amerika i 1947. Jeg var elve or min bror var otte aar. Momine - please correct these sentences. The words don't look right; I don't write or speak Danish these days. Do you ever visit Denmark? I haven't been back since the early seventies.0 - Could be Dogs. It is my understanding that we can get a new cancer unrelated to the BC or a mets of the existing CA. One is a reoccurence and one a recurrence, though I don't remember which is which. If its a mets than yes it would likely be a IV, but a new cancer could be a stage one depending on where and when it's found. I think that's the hardest part of all of this. That little cloud looming over us. It's not like a broken bone that you have fixed, or an organ you have removed that will solve your problem. I try to accentuate the positie as the old song goes, but it's hard. I'm told it gets easier to do with time. Here's hoping they're right. :-)0 - Dogs, yes, \"Gr\u00e6kenland\" is Greece. Your grandparents must have been fairly well to do and proper people, those are both rather fancy addresses I grew up in Denmark and all my family is there, so I go back fairly often. I think it is amazing that you can remember as much as you can, considering how long you have been away. Was your mom American? As for your sentences: Er det Greece? Jeg i Hornbek vor min bedstefar farmor osse bode. Min mor or far blev skilt or vi to born rejste wid min mor til Amerika i 1947. Jeg var or min bror blev skilt, og vi to b\u00f8rn rejste med min mor til Amerika i 1947. Jeg elleve og min bror var otte \u00e5r.0 - Momine: Thanks for the corrections! Until my Dad died at 93 he would send me Danish magazines so I wouldn't forget the language, but that was in the nineties so I haven't read anything in Danish since then. Now I'm inspired to buy a Danish dictionary. I would also like to get a Danish cookbook. I still remember my mother's delicious recipes: Rodgrod med flode, fiske frikadeller, etc. My mother was Danish also. She was a ballet dancer and started her own school before I was born. My Dad worked for the Danish \"congress\" as a translator. He knew many languages and gave me my love of books! He was very reserved; no hugs or kisses, but I adored him. But that's kind of how it was in the 30s and 40s. We kids were brought up very strictly. No talking at the dinner table! In bed by 8! I have some reels of film of all of us from years ago. My mother was always filming us-- Had them transferred to video some years ago. I brought one of the copies to give to my Dad when I saw him in Switzerland for his 90th birthday. Strangely enough, he sat and watched it without saying a word and then walked in the other room. I thought maybe it was hard for him to see himself as a young man, fit and full of life. I really thought he would find it fascinating (as I did)0 - A cancer which is not a met of your bc, usually determined by biopsy, can easily be a new primary. That's why those of us with mets don't say we have bone, liver lung cancer etc. Our biopsies show that they are breast cancer cells that traveled elsewhere. But new primaries are certainly possible. Caryn0 - If we get a recurrance,its considered stage IV? OMG,why? I am taking Femara,no problem,had Arimidex and had a lot of problems with it,look up the list of side effects,if its on there,I most likely had it,stopped it due to shortness of breath and the horrible mouth sores or craters all inside my mouth I was in extreme pain. My PS also insists that I take Protandim which is a herbal pill with turmeric and milk thistle. It helps with my energy a little. I also take the mushroom extract when I remember,I have all sorts of supplements but I cant take them all cause it upsets my stomach.0 - Layla, A local recurrence, i.e. in the breast or local nodes, is not necessarily stage IV. A metastasis to a distant area such as bone, liver, lung, brain is Stage IV. There are some gray areas that fall in the stage III or IV range because the dx may be unclear. Caryn0 - No Layla, Yours looks like early stage BC. I doint know your ki67 score, but mine was under 5% making mine luminal A which is very very early...not LIKELY to hop to stage IV. ALL things are *possible* in the ugly world of cancer, but you dont look like a high risk. Try not to add that to your worries! have a good day.0 - Hi! I would like to get those books you mentioned... what foods help the immune system and to inhibit estrogen Thanks for your information0 - Hi! I would like to get those books you mentioned... what foods help the immune system and to inhibit estrogen Thanks for your information0 - where can you get alot of those supplements you spoke of? The turmeric that has 96 percent curcumin in it, too? I also heard puree pumpkin is really packed with vitamins that help fight BC and build the immune system -- and to drink lots of water. Also to take pectin (the high grade type) before and after surgery. It helps keep cancer cells from dividing and spreading - makes them clump together. Google it -- and they practice it at Cancer Trt Ctr of America...mind/body/spirit healing0 - Lauryn Mushrooms and red grapes have anti-estrogenic properties. Cruciferous veggies are good too, but don't overdo if you have a goiter.0 - Dogs, what an interesting life you have had. It is a pity that your mother didn't maintain the language for you, but I also know how hard it is to do. If you have a kindle or iPad, check out Danish books in digital form. It can be a lot cheaper and easier than \"real\" books. You can also access Danish papers and magazines online quite easily. The main papers are Politiken and Berlingske Tidende. A nice ladies' magazine (easy to read) is Alt for Damerne. Google translate is quite good for single words or small phrases. Good luck with it.0 - [graced](https://community.breastcancer.org/en/profile/graced)Member Posts: 22 Lauryn, I'm not sure which post you're referring to but Dr. Joel Furhman has a new book out called \"Super Immunity\" that talks about the foods to strengthen the immune system. I have been getting many of my supplements like the maitake, turmeric and green tea from vitacost.com. I'm sure there are others. I will need to find other sources for some of the other things but haven't gotten that far yet in my research. \"Waking the Warrior Goddess\" talks specifically about breast cancer and includes foods/supplements as part of its holistic approach. \"Outsmart Your Cancer\" is another book that was recommended by someone on the boards. I bought it - just haven't had time to start reading it yet. I'm sure others may have more to add here.0 - Outsmart Your Cancer was OK, but as helpful as I'd hoped. I'm going to look for the Super Immunity and Walking with the Warrior Goddess books. Lauryn-Drinking a glass of water with lemon (I use pure organic lemon juice) is a gret way to start the day. A natural liver cleanse. Everyone, with or without cancer, should start the day that way.0 - Momine: I remember those newspapers. I will check them out. Also the translate thing. My Mother did not want to keep up with the Danish language. She said that now that we were in America we should speak only English. She was desperate to lose her accent which she hated. When people asked her where she was from she would say \" Well----I was born in Denmark, but spent a lot of time in Paris.\" LOL! She was only in Paris while attending the Sorbonne University and didn't graduate. But she did dance in various cities in Europe---but----the total time couldn't have been more than a couple of years! I would tease her about being a snob - hoping people would think she was French (which was in her mind much more glamorous) Writing to you brings so many memories. I should really PM you from now on I think. The other posters are probably getting irritated---0 Categories "}
