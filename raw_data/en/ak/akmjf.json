In the presence of optimum sunlight, water, and air, new life germinates. The seed coat eventually bursts open, and the primary root, known as the radical, emerges. Then, a plant begins to grow, striving toward the sun. What are you striving towards? Was the soil in which you were germinating conducive to springing forth with renewed purpose and energy? Spring is always a great season for cleansing away the old, for releasing what no longer serves and then, starti ng anew. It is time to awaken, to start anew, time to let your radical emerge. In natural health, we look at health on all levels of being: physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. We recognize that our thoughts create our reality. And, over the past y ear, many of us are wondering, how did we create THIS reality?! Then, we wonder, how are we going to change it? How can we do anything about it? It feels big; it feels overwhelming. It might feel like you are powerless to make any changes. This ide a, that you are powerless, couldn't be further from the truth. What is your truth? What do you want your reality to be? First, you have to get in touch with your inner truth and really feel it. Then, when you recognize that some of these external factors, this \"reality\" in which you are living, does not match your tru th, then your power resides in how you choose to participate. Every time you spend money, you participate. On what are you spending your money; whom are you supporting with your dollar? Every time you choose to stay silent, to not speak up for truth, to comply, to make things easier or more comfortabl e by allowing injustice to happen, you participate. Have you studied history? Were great freedoms won by those who just went alo ng with what most knew were wrong? Like it or not, we are part of this collective, and we are participating. Right now, we sti ll have a fair amount of choice in our participation. It is, therefore, our responsibility, our duty, to participate in a way that w ill make this world a better place. Again, I ask you: what do you want your reality to be? If you would like a future that supports health and freedom, then yo u must awaken and be conscious of how you are participating. You do have power, and we are creating together. We can help each other. If we change, the world changes. The universe changes! \"Uni\" comes from the Latin root, meaning \"one.\" One - verse. Every time we grow and raise our level of consciousness, we inspire others and give them courage to awaken, to live t he truth that sets us all free. There is light at the end of the tunnel; it calls to us to stretch out and grow into our full p otential. Let's bloom the most beautiful (organic) garden ever!

In the north, growers are starting to plant their long -day onions, leeks, and shallots. Even though the thought of planting anything right now might seem outrageous, because it is, after all, just barely spring, it is time to start preparing your planting beds and gardens for the growing season. 2020 had its challenges that have carried right over into 2021. So many adjustments have been made, and the reality is that we have not only learned to survive but to also thrive. Growing your own food is one way of knowing where your food comes from, having your own control over its growth, and the ability to go from garden to table in a short period of time. You don't need acreage to grow your own food. Small plots, like flower beds, are a great way to start, as well as small containers you can put in your yard, patio, or front step. The nice thing about High Mowing Seeds is that you can grow them indoors in small pots so that you can have fresh herbs and micro greens anytime of the year. Getting started now will give you a nice foundation of roots, and then, when the spring weather starts, you can plant them in the ground. This is a great family project as well and teaches us all that we do have control over our food and nutrition without much fuss. Lettuce is just not a summer product anymore! Getting started may seem a bit daunting, but here are a few tips for first time growers: 1. Pick a great spot - or, adapt the spot you've got! Plants generally require 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight a day. Can't quite get six hours of sunlight in one spot - do not fret! Choosing the right plant for your spot is key. There are many varieties of plants that likely can handle the shade just as well. 2. Make sure you have a plan before you plant. If you're using the garden and planting in the ground or arranging containers on the patio, it's important to have a plan so that you can utilize the space you have, the ground you plant the seeds in and the vegetables and herbs that you like to eat are key to having a fun and successful crop. 3. Timing is Everything! Plant things that will allow you to harvest food many times throughout the growing season. Plant herbs in containers, so that when the cold weather sets in again... and you know it will, you can bring your food supply inside. The nice thing about High Mowing Organic Seeds is that you can find them all year long. Plan big but start small. Once you have mastered the small space, then you can grow your confidence and experience as well as a larger garden space. Remember, your plants need to survive in a healthy growing environment. Don't set plants out too early. Wait until you are past the frost -free date for your area. And, if you do get caught in the cold, covering your plants with sheets and pillowcases generally do the trick. 4. Plant It and Forget It - NOT! Your garden plot, either outside or in, is a living ecosystem and will need oversight and care. You are their protector, and your job is to keep everything in an optimal growing environment. Don't over water (hover), watch for pests or disease (observe and nurture), and if you see bugs, pick them off by hand and put them in soapy water to die. Put up small fencing or cages that will protect your plants from predators (that dang rabbit!). There are a few tedious things that must happen in any food plot like weeding, thinning, and other meditative tasks (discipline). Make time for your garden every day. It is like raising a child or taking care of another person or pet. 5. Plant Early, Pick Often - Replant Again if You Can: High Mowing Seeds are available all year long - and can be grown inside and/or out. Picking your crops can stimulate them to produce more. Picking things earlier, as soon as they look too good to eat, will ensure that they have not went past their prime, and the quality and taste are there for you and your family to get the most nutrition from the plant. 6. Enjoy the Garden Path and the Journey You will Take: You will get lots of opinions on what is right, wrong, and otherwise. Make this your project, your adventure, your path. Make friends with other gardeners or start a block garden if you have space for you all to work in and to enjoy. Don't go it alone if you don't have to. Share your crops with neighbors, friends, and family. Gardening is tough, but don't be too hard on yourself if something doesn't go to plan. This is life -long learning at its best, and gardening is an exceptionally good teacher on the art of letting things go. After all the challenges of 2020 and at the beginning of 2021, let us look towards the future, and let the past go. Take control over the things you can. Every spring is a chance to start over again with a clean slate. Gardening can be a great way to de - stress, get your family involved, get outside (even 10 minutes in the sun has many health benefits), develop resilience, and share your crop (food, knowledge, or both)!

By Julie Wagester High Mowing Seeds are Here at Herbs Etc 3 4 Discovering natural health has not only helped me physically, but mentally and emotionally, as well. I want to help people discover that there is a natural answer to their problems and that it can work when they stick to it and are persistent with it. When it comes to bettering their health, a healthy balance is the key. Having a history of natural health education, I have applied that knowledge into my daily life when working within Herbs Etc. From customers who come in asking where the ear candles are, to customers who come in with health complaints, I look forward to applying my studies to help them understand the best route for their rehabilitation. The experience has helped me understand how to properly deal with those who are in need of some extra TLC. Recently, I have gained the opportunity to expand my knowledge into the realm of colonics. Here, I am able to help individuals in a more hands -on approach and assist them with their gut health and in turn, the condition of the rest of their body and mind. The colon should be the first of all of the body systems to be cleansed, paving way to a good channel of elimination, allowing the body to cleanse other organs. By helping heal gut disturbances that may be due to years of toxic build up from poor diets and antibiotics as well as improper elimination habits, colonics can greatly help those who want to improve their overall health. Colonics has been known to help clear the body of skin ailments, decrease and even diminish the growth of candida/yeast, which in turn helps cut down sugar cravings and bloating, and help relieve the occasional \"stomach ache\" by lessening the workload that the body has to do when needing to eliminate whatever is causing the problem. Book an appointment soon to do some \"spring cleaning.\" Carla worked in the medical field for twenty two years as a radiologic technologist and an ultrasound technologist. Her interest in natural health began almost 30 years ago when her mom took her to a class on digestive health at Herbs Etc. A few years later, when her son wouldn't sleep more than 2 hours at a time - day or night - she scheduled her first natural health appointment with Dr. Baker. It took Dr. Baker minutes to assess that dietary changes were exactly what he needed. In less than 2 weeks of implementing the changes, he started sleeping through the night....after almost three years of sleepless nights, she was intrigued and impressed. This sparked a desire in Carla to learn and use natural remedies for her children and herself. After a long battle with Lupus and her daughter being diagnosed with Celiac disease, the desire to become a naturopathic doctor grew even more. Carla's desire to walk a path of healing with her clients is a top priority to her. With a special interest in autoimmune issues, emotional healing, and nutrition, she is passionate about essential oils, flower remedies, iridology, and how our emotions affect our health. Carla is a Natural Health Therapist studying to be a Naturopathic Doctor at the Naturopathic Institute, seeing clients at Herbs Etc. Introducing Megan Silvers Colon HydroTherapist Introducing Carla Anderson Natural Health Therapist 5 Dr. Culley -Healy's best advice to students Products we apply topically should be food for our skin, free of toxins, additives, synthetics and long words we can't pronounce. In today's sea of toxic products, however, this is hard to come by. Most people have subconsciously adopted the common misconception that our skin and the rest of our body are two separate entities and therefore, don't think twice about the ingredients in their daily product regimen. I am going to bust that myth with one simple sentence: anything applied to the skin is absorbed into the bloodstream in 26 seconds. This makes the skin a direct pathway for toxicity or valuable nutrients to enter the body, and it should be treated as such! Our skin is the first line of defense against anythin g our body comes in contact with in the environment. Meaning, it needs the same nutrients in order to protect our internal systems adequately. This includes vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and even fruits, vegetables, and herbs! Herbs Etc. is now carrying a line of products that beautifully encompasses all of these principles called Elina Organics. Elina Organics is based in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and is formulated to work synergistically with the body's natural processes to bring true healing from within. These products are food grade organic, all natural, toxin free, and Non -GMO, while using herbal extracts, live probiotics, fermented foods, and minerals to nourish the skin and body. Each product is also transdermal, meaning it is able to reach the dermal layer of live skin cells. This allows damage to be reversed at its deepest level. Elin a Organics products are also bio energized with various plant and gemstone frequencies to invoke an even deeper level of healing. Viewing health internally and externally, meaning taking care of the inside and outside of the body, allows for a fully holistic approach, which is truly the path for healing that lasts. Chloe has been using natural health principles in her daily life for around 10 years. This journey truly began when she decided to job shadow with a naturopath during her senior year of high school. She became fascinated with energy work and was attuned for Reiki I and II in June of 2018. Shortly after, Chloe decided to enroll as a student at the Naturopathic Institute to become a Naturopathic Doctor. Around the same time, Chloe also discovered the world of Holistic Skin Care and began an apprenticeship to become a Holistic Esthetician. During Chloe's apprenticeship, she had the honor of training personally with Elina Fedotova: Holistic Esthetician, Cosmetic Chemist, and Founder and Formulator of Elina Organics. She is now a Licensed Esthetician by the state of Michigan, as well as a third year student in the naturopathic program. Chloe is extremely passionate about melding her background in Holistic Skin Care with her education in natural health to bring a unique, naturopathic approach to the health of the skin and body overall. Chloe is also passionate about energy work, flower essences, and making herbal medicines. Here at Herbs Etc., she is currently offering Holistic and Natural Facials, Light Healing Touch, and Reflexology. If you wonder why all the staff here at Herbs Etc. is looking so youthful and glowing, it's because we are clients of Chloe! Thanks Chloe....Bessheen Baker, ND Introducing Chloe Kolberg Holistic Esthetician 6 It's time for spring cleaning, so open the win- dows, shake out the rugs, hang the laundry on the line, and read below for some ideas on how to clean out the buildup. After all, the birds are singing; wouldn 't it be nice if your body felt like singing, too? For the Skin: Make sure to drink pure, clean water: \u00bd of your body weight in ounces every day. Add some organic lemon or lime for fresh flavor. Plus, if you add a pinch of quality 'Redmond Real Salt ' to that, you have your own electrolyte drink! *Dry Skin Brushing: Use a dry bristle brush or dry loofah and brush all over the skin of your body in circles moving toward the chest. Do this every day to slough off dead skin, activate the lymphatic/detox system of the body, and help your biggest organ of elimination (your skin!) work more effectively to release toxins. For the Lymph: For starters, Dry Skin Brush- ing is great for the lymph, too, so that 's a bonus! (Herbs Etc. carries the right brushes.) *Make sure to schedule a bodywork session. Regular massage, or a more focused lymphatic drain massage, improves circulation, breaks up congested lymph and cellulite, and can help to reduce fluid retention. *Jump, move, shake! Jumping or bouncing on a mini -trampoline/rebounder and shaking on the Body Vibe at Herbs, Etc. are excellent, low - impact ways to move your body, activate muscle fibers, and encourage the circulation of lymphatic fluid. For the Gut: Clean up your diet - cut out wheat, dairy, sugar, GMO 's, and all kinds of processed foods. Consuming bone broth is healing to the gut which also benefits the im- mune and nervous systems and is especially good for allergies. *Chew slowly and mindfully when eating. Di- gestion begins in the mouth, so you are more likely to absorb your nutrition and eliminate waste better by c -h-e-w-i-n-g. *Schedule a Colon Hydrotherapy session. Honestly, if you 've never experienced it, it is far better than you imagine, and when you 're done, you feel like you 've had a shower on the inside! For the Liver: The liver loves lemons, apples, beets, and greens, so eat lots! Turmeric is a great anti -inflammatory that makes the liver happy, and Milk Thistle even helps the liver regenerate. Don 't forget that the liver is a big filter, so avoid toxins everywhere you can - in and on food, in cleaning and laundry products, personal care products, on your lawn, etc., so it doesn 't have to work so hard and express its unhappiness by hot flashing, skin rashing, not sleeping, and the like. For the Lungs: Breathe freely. Go outside into the fresh air of nature and take some deep breaths. Diffuse essential oils in your home such as Citrus Fresh or Sacred Mountain. Add some plants to your indoor space. Choose at least one practice from every section, and your whole body will be feeling more spic, span, and singing spring! See one of our Naturopaths for an even deeper and personalized cleansing program. Spring Cleansing By Amy Jo Howard, ND, CH Enjoy! 7 Plant stem cells, or Gemmotherapy, is a branch of herbal medicine containing nutrient rich stem cells. Most herbal medicines are extracted from the adult plant material, whether that is the leaf, flower, bark, or roots. The plant stem cells, also called meristems, are harvested and prepared from the young buds or young rootlets at precise seasons before the chlorophyll (plant blood, green pigment) sets in. Once chlorophyll is pre- sent, many healing enzymes, minerals, and nucleic acids (RNA) only found in the embryonic tissues are lost. The embryonic tissue also holds the blue- print of the adult plant. When prepared as a medicine, the energetic as- pects are captured, helping to enhance the emotional and mental weak- ness of the client. Each plant stem cell has different nutrient chemistries which have an affinity to targeted tissues and organs. Plant stem cells awaken the body's innate, self -healing abilities leading to rapid tissue re- generation. The following is a brief list of Dr. Hertzberg's top 25 plant stem cells and their empirical uses.

In fact, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a vaccine is \"a product that stimulates a person's immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease.\" Isn't it interesting that neither Pfizer nor Moderna claim this to be the case for their COVID -19 \"vaccines?\" Because, instead of containing the coronavirus antigen, these injections contain synthetic RNA fragments encapsulated in a nanolipid carrier compound for the sole purpose of lessening clinical symptoms associated with the S -1 spike protein, not the actual virus. This means that these injections do not offer immunity or inhibit transmission of the virus; their goal is to lessen your infection symptoms when or if you do get infected. The idea behind using mRNA in a \"vaccine\" is to trick your body into creating the SARS -CoV-2 spike protein so that your immune system will produce antibodies in response. Before we go further with this idea, let's talk about what mRNA (messenger RNA) normally does in the body. Our DNA is transcribed, or written, into messenger RNA (mRNA); the mRNA is translated into proteins which make up our tissues, organs, and ultimately, body. mRNA serves to regulate gene expression in the cells. It is not normally moving freely through the body; if it is, it is serving as a danger signal to the immune system, and the body has lots of enzymes to break down free RNA and DNA, because not broken down, they create inflammation. So, having synthetic mRNA in a \"vaccine\" turns the body into a viral protein factory, because this RNA is carrying the message of how to translate the proteins of your body into the SARS -CoV-2 protein, and this keeps antibody production activated continually which means your immune system is on constant alert with no ability to shut this process off. Now, this mRNA is being delivered via a nanolipid, specifically PEGylated polyethylene glycol ( PEG is synthesized by polymerizing ethylene oxide, the main ingredient in antifreeze) , which makes it thermostable (this means that the body can't break it down using its enzymes) and also, allows it to enter every cell in the body, which changes the regulation of our own genes. In particular, the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) has questioned whether lipid nanoparticles are safe, because research has shown that they are taken up readily by the brain due to their lipophilic nature and have the ability to bypass the blood brain barrier. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., reports that studies show 1 in 7 Americans may unknowingly be at risk of experiencing a life -threatening anaphylactic reaction to the PEG itself. In addition to having the message of the SARS -CoV-2 protein, this synthetic mRNA also has the message for the gene syncytin. Syncytin is the endogenous gammaretrovirus envelope that is encoded in the human genome. In whatever tissues syncytin is expressed aberrantly, the body creates inflammation and is unable to regulate communication between that tissue and the immune system. For example, if syncytin is expressed aberrantly in the brain, multiple sclerosis usually develops. \"Vaccine\" or Experimental DNA Manipulation? By Amy Jo Howard, ND, CH 11 Anyone with inflammatory diseases, autoimmune disorders, or immune deficiencies from viruses or other pathogens and environmental toxins will be especially susceptible to experiencing severe side effects or death as a result of receiving an mRNA Covid -19 injection. Among the conditions at the highest risk are: cancer, multiple myeloma, non -Hodgkin's lymphoma, Crohn's, Parkinson's, fibromyalgia, psoriasis, IBS, diabetes, ADHD, and rheumatoid arthritis, to just name a few. Interestingly, if you visit Moderna's website, they have a section titled: \"Our Operating System.\" Within this section, it states: \"Recognizing the broad potential of mRNA science, we set out to create an mRNA technology platform that functions very much like an operating system on a computer. It is designed so that it can plug and play interchangeably with different programs. In our case, the 'program' or 'app' is our mRNA drug - the unique mRNA sequence that codes for a protein.\" Hold that thought........ Let's recap: the thing that the media is calling a Covid - 19 vaccine does not fit the legal or medical definition of a vaccine; the main purpose of this injection is to trick your body into altering its own DNA/gene expression to make virus proteins instead of the body tissues it should be making; this synthetic mRNA is packaged into a nano - sized synthetic version of antifreeze, partnered with a gene that, when not expressed properly, creates all kinds of inflammatory diseases. And, Moderna explicitly says that it is designed to \"plug and play interchangeably with different programs.\" [.......Excuse me?! Plug and play?! I AM a HUMAN BEING!!!] In the words of David Martin, Ph.D., \"the legal ramifications of this deception are immense.\" Martin cites 15 U.S. Code Section 41 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, a law that governs advertising of medical practices and Moderna's own SEC filings which stresses that its technology is a \"gene therapy technology.\" So, if vaccination is a public health measure that is supposed to protect and benefit the collective, then the vaccine would need to provide immunity from the specified disease and inhibit transmission of the disease. (This is where we started, right?) However, how many people would volunteer to receive experimental gene manipulation? Would you agree to be an experiment for a chemotherapy gene technology for a cancer you do not have? Would you agree to be an experiment ? Calling this a vaccine allows circumvention of liability. Martin also says, \"You're being lied to. Your own government is violating its own laws. They have shut down practitioners around the country, time and time again, for violating what are called 'deceptive practices in medical claims.' Guess what? They're doing exactly that thing.\" Judy Mikovits, Ph.D., a cellular and molecular biologist, recommends some of the same strategies used in treat- ing a SARS -CoV-2 infection for those who have received the injection and now, question that decision. Eat a clean, organic diet; avoid processed foods; detox heavy metals and glyphosate (RoundUp); enhance glutathione production; take supplements, including Vitamin D, Vita- min C, Zinc, N -Acetyl -Cysteine, Quercetin, and B vita- mins. The naturopaths at Herbs, Etc. are not advising the injection for anyone and would also add Iodine, Selenium, Boron, Silica, and a probiotic to the list of countermeas- ures. Because this injection is gene experimentation, a more personalized approach may be needed, so please consider consulting with your naturopath. The naturo- paths at Herbs, Etc. are taking consultations for live blood analysis to give a more in -depth assessment of how your immune system may be responding following both the test and the injection. If you would like to monitor your health in this way, please call to schedule an appoint- ment. And, let's not even get started on the PCR test...... there are additional problems with this as well.
