Patients who requested a visit received a COVID-19 vaccine from one of APH's trained nursing staff,\" said APH Director Adrienne Sturrup. The program's success was apparent in the demand APH saw - At its height, the waitlist for home visits topped 500. The MVP was able to reduce the waitlist to zero by the end of 2022. In 2023, the demand for home visits has dropped significantly, allowing efforts and resources to focus on other priority populations, including senior centers and long-term care facilities. COVID-19 vaccines are widely available throughout the community at doctor's offices, pharmacies and other providers.
