Results vary depending on age and extent of lung damage. A minimum of three months of treatment are required to show clinical improvement. Remarkable improvement has been noticed in several patients where the extent of lung damage was not total.](https://himveda.com/interstitial-lung-disease-ayurveda/) How we treat it at [HimVeda](https://himveda.com/): After assessing the disease status and going through the investigations, we decide on the treatment. After that, we judge the body constitution of the patient and the status of [Agni ](https://himveda.com/ayurveda-diet-concept-agni/)(metabolism) at the cellular level. Predominantly [Pungent](https://himveda.com/pungent-taste-ayurveda/) and [Bitter ](https://himveda.com/bitter-taste-ayurveda/)tasting herbs are selected and then processed according to the patient's stage of disease and body type. We don't advise [Panchakarma](https://himveda.com/panchakarma/) procedures for this condition. The patient's heart must be strong to withstand Panchakarma. Otherwise, many side effects will be produced. ILD weakens the heart and lungs. So medicine and diet alone suffice. When patients first come to us, they are usually on Steroids. After about two months of Ayurvedic treatment, Steroids are slowly reduced. How to contact HimVeda? You can call us on 9736853285, and we will connect you to [Dr. Guleria.](https://himveda.com/ayurvedic-doctor-dharamshala/) After a brief initial discussion, he will ask for medical records that can be sent on WhatsApp. Once he is satisfied that good results can be achieved, we can book an appointment for you to visit the clinic. Medicines can also be sent online if desired but only after a detailed discussion with Dr. Guleria over the phone. What does Ayurveda say about ILD? Interstitial lung disease (ILD) in Ayurveda is described under 'shwas roga.' Shwas Roga is a broad term encompassing all respiratory diseases. ILD is a 'sannipapata' disorder (involving all three doshas) with the predominance of 'Vata' dosha (air element) in the Kapha seat. Pitta (fire element) and Kapha (water element ) also get disturbed, but the degree of involvement varies according to etiological factors, age, habitat, etc. In modern medicine, Interstitial tissue is the name given to the tissue around the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. Interstitial lung disease occurs when an injury (by internal /external factors) to the lung interstitium causes an abnormal healing response. As a result, the interstitial tissue becomes scarred and thickened. So Oxygen enters the blood with difficulty. The patient usually complains of difficulty in breathing and a dry cough. Lifestyle and Diet: Breathlessness gives a tough time to the patient. To reduce the mucus congestion in the chest, we advise an upper back massage at bedtime. This is done with special oils but can also be done with lukewarm sesame /mustard oil with a pinch of salt mixed in it. Sometimes we advise a powder pottali (bolus) massage. This is followed by hot water fomentation.
