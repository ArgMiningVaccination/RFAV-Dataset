Determining their comparative cost -effectiveness will further provide an economic 6 perspective to inform the choice of sedative in this setting. 7 Methods 8 This analysis used data from a RCT conducted in Hong Kong A&E departments between December 9 2014 and September 2019. A within -trial cost -effectiveness analysis comparing the three sedatives 10 was conducted , from the A&E perspective and a within -trial time horizon, using a decision -analytic 11 model . Sensitivity analyses were also undertaken. 12 Results 13 In the base -case analys is, median total management cost associated with intramuscu lar midazolam, 14 haloperidol and olanzapine were HKD 1958. (USD HKD 2504.5 (USD 321. 1), and HKD 15 2467.6 (USD 316. 4) respectively. Agitation management labour cost was the main cost driver , 16 whereas drug costs contributed the least . Midazolam dominated over haloperidol and olanzapine. 17 Probabilistic sensitivity analyses supported that midazolam remains dominant more than 95% of 18 the time and revealed no clear difference in the cost-effectiveness of intramuscular olanzapine 19 ). 21 Intramuscular m idazolam is the dominant cost-effective treatment for the management of acute 22 agitation in the A&E setting . Intramuscular olanzapine could be considered as an alternative to 23 intramuscular halope ridol as there is no clear difference in cost-effective ness, and their a dverse 24 effect profile should be considered when choosing between them . 25 2 Highlights 1 No studies had evaluated the cost -effectiveness of intramuscular sedatives for acute agitation in 2 the emergency setting. While previous studies had investigated the economics of sedative use 3 in psychiatric ward or chronic management of mental illnesses , the focus in these settings 4 commonly lies in prolonged sedation and long-term care and cost implications, which are less 5 applicable to the emergency setting. 6 We conducted a within -trial cost -effectiveness analysis comparing intramuscular midazolam, 7 olanz apine and haloperidol in the emergency setting using data from a multicentre RCT in six 8 A&E departments in Hong Kong. We found that l abour cost accounted for a significant portion 9 of total agitation management cost in the emergency setting whereas drug cos t is relatively 10 negligible. Intramuscular midazolam is the dominant treatment, whereas sensitivity analyses 11 revealed no clear difference in the cost -effectiveness of intramuscular olanzapine versus 12 haloperidol. 13 While i ntramuscular midazolam is the dominant treatment , in cases where benzodiazepines is 14 less desirable, intramuscular olanzapine is preferred over haloperidol , as there is no clear 15 difference in cost -effectiveness between them but intramuscular olanzapine has a more 16 favourable adverse effect profi le. These findings support formulary decisions on introducing or 17 broadening the use of intramuscular olanzapine for acute agitation in the emergency department , 18 particularly in the Hong Kong healthcare setting . 19 20 3 Introduction 1 Acute agitation, a state of \"e xcessive motor or verbal activity\", (1) is a commonly encountered 2 presentation in hospital accident and emergency (A&E) departments. The management of acutely 3 agitated patients is challenging (2) and uses a disproportionate amount of A&E resources. (3) When 4 verbal de -escalation, mechanical restraint techn iques and/or sedation using oral medication fail or 5 are not appropriate, rapid tranquilisation using intramuscular sedative drugs is advised. (4) Such 6 management aims to provide rapid control of symptoms with minimal side -effects, thereby 7 preventing symptom escalation and ensuring the safety of the patient and healthcare providers .(1, 8 2) 9 Commonly used drug classes admin istered via intramuscular route are benzodiazepines (e.g. 10 lorazepam, midazolam) and first - and second -generation antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, 11 olanzapine ).(2) Numerous agents are available for rapid tranquillisation in emergency settings , but 12 head -to-head comparison among these agents for acute agitation in randomized clinical trials (RCT) 13 are lacking, as a result no \"clea r superiority for any one agent\" in acutely agitated patients has been 14 demonstrated .(4) On the other hand, a meta -analysis of randomised controlled trials by Kishi et al. 15 conducted in predomi nantly psychiatric settings concluded that intramuscular olanzapine is 16 preferred over haloperidol in patients with chronic mental disorders as it is equally as effective and 17 associated with fewer side -effects. (5) Yet, a study looking at prescribing patterns in Hong Kong 18 A&E departments concluded intramuscular haloperidol was the most frequently used agent 19 (46.8%), followed by midazolam (33.9%).(6) While t he use of the newer, atypical antipsychotic 20 olanzapine was common in the United States, (7) its use remained relatively uncommon in Hong 21 Kong and other regions of the world . As such, a cost -effectiveness analysis comparing these 22 intramuscular sedatives in terms of healthcare resource utilisation and agitation management costs 23 4 involved will provide a useful financial comparison to inform the choice of sedative for 1 management of acute agitation in the A&E setting. 2 In Hong Kong, public hospitals are managed by the Hospital Authority (HA), a statutory body that 3 provides public health services to Hong Kong's citizens. The region's health economy is domin ated 4 by the public sector , with 90% of the public health expenditure, which is mainly subsidised by 5 the government through tax revenues, go ing towards the HA. (8) In recent years, the high and rising 6 demand for A&E services, as well as the rapidly growing and ageing population in Hong Kong 7 have led to increased pressure on healthcare resources. B etween 2008 and 2018 the number of A&E 8 presentations classified as \"urgent\", \"emergency\" or \"critical \" increased by 27%, (9) underlining 9 the importance of using the available A&E resources as efficiently as possible. A cost -effectiveness 10 analysi s comparing various treatment options for acute agitation , which is routinely managed in 11 A&E departments, may help inform the choice of sedative used and facilitate the allocation of A&E 12 resources. 13 5 Methods 1 This economic analysis took an A&E costing perspe ctive and within -trial time horizon, using data 2 from an RCT conducted in the Accident and Emergency ( A&E ) departments of six public hospitals 3 in Hong Kong (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT0230118). (10) The clinical outcomes , including 4 the time required to achieve adequate sedation and whether re -dosing of the sedative drug was 5 required, were obtained from the RCT. The RCT concluded that intramuscular olanzapine is 6 noninferior to haloperidol and midazolam, in terms of efficacy and safety a nd should be considered 7 when treating the acutely agitated patient , and is currently the only multicentre RCT comparing the 8 three intramuscular sedatives for acute agitation management in the emergency setting . The study 9 was approved by Institutional Revie w Board or Clinical Research Ethics Committee at each of the 10 study sites . Data on each patient's investigations were extracted from electronic patient records 11 retrospectively. A top -down costing approach was used, analysing the costs of expected individual 12 treatment components and services in order to determine the overall cost for each study arm of the 13 RCT. (11) Baseline characteristics of the study population were the same as that reported in the 14 RCT. (11) Reporting of this analysis followed the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation 15 Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. (12) 16 Model structure and outcome s 17 A within -trial cost -effectiveness analysis was implemented by constructing a decision -analytic 18 mode l using a decision tree, comparing the 3 alternative sedatives (IM midazolam 5mg, IM 19 haloperidol 5mg and IM olanzapine 5mg) simulating 11 possible outcomes for each drug, 20 depending on whether the patients achieved successful sedation by 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60 minutes 21 after administration of the sedative drug , and whether re -dosing with sedative drug was required at 22 any time during the sedation process (Figure 1 ). In line with the RCT, successful sedation was 23 6 defined as an agitation score of 2 on the 6 -point agitation scale. \"Not sedated\" patients were re - 1 evaluated at the subsequent time point. Agitation -free time gained was used as a metric for 2 effectiveness in the cost -effectiveness analyses , which was defi ned as 150 minutes minus the 3 recorded time to sedation, based on the observation that all agitated patients were managed within 4 150 minutes in the RCT. The decision tree and the probabilities of the occurrence of the individual 5 branch outcomes were calcula ted from the results of the RCT. Data on the clinical outcomes and 6 the probabilities of occurrence are summarised in Supplementary Table 1 . 7 Cost calculation 8 Expected costs for the individual treatment outcomes of the model were calculated and weighted 9 by the probability of the respective outcome occurring. The cumulative weighted costs of the three 10 respective treatment options were then compared in order to calculate the incremental cost and 11 identify the least costly treatment. (13) All costs were in Hong Kong Dollars (HKD) for the financial 12 year 2019 -2020. Main results were also presented in US Dollars (USD) at the linked exchange rate 13 of HKD 7.8 0 to 1 USD. (14) 14 Direct medical costs included drug costs, as well as any diagnostic and monitoring tests required. 15 In addition to the study drugs, drug costs also included open -label sedatives used. Direct non - 16 medical costs comprised the salaries of the staff required for the management of an acutely agitated 17 patient , as well as administrative overhead costs of HKD 200 per case. (15) The drug acquisition 18 costs were obtained from the Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) A&E department. Costs of diagnostic 19 and monitoring tests were obtained from the Hospital Authority (HA) Gazette (16). The labour costs 20 were calculated using HA hourly staff salaries. Staff costs were related to the management of the 21 agitation until the patient was adequately sedated. 22 7 The occurrence of adverse events was rare as reported in the RCT (4.8%, n=8, only one of which 1 was serious and unlikely to be related to the study drug) and the cost of their management was 2 deemed negligible, as staff attendance is already accounted for in the agitation man agement costs. 3 All costs were from the perspective of A&E departments. Costs obtained from QMH are 4 representative of the costs of all A&E departments of public hospitals in Hong Kong as drug 5 contracts are negotiated in a centralised manner . Given the short treatment duration, no discounting 6 was applied. 7 Assumptions 8 Several assumptions were made about the management of acute agitation in A&E departments. 9 Since the actual time of staff attendance was not recorded, the time to adequate sedation was used 10 to estimate the staffing required for each patient. In a small numb er of patients (n=6) the sedation 11 was not documented until the end. These patients were reviewed case by case and the time to 12 sedation was estimated from the given data, the A&E staff notes and the patient records, using a 13 method consistent to all cases af fected. (17) 14 Based on local practice of participating sites , it was assumed that on average one resident doctor, 15 three nurses, one of whom an advanced practice nurse, and one health care assistant were required 16 to attend an acutely agitated patient. This includes applying physical restraint and providing the 17 necessary sedatives. For patients enrolled in the trial who received the sedative on the emergency 18 ward rather than in the A&E department (n=11) or were transferred to an emergency ward 19 immediately after injection of the sedative (n=2 ), the staff required for the management was 20 assumed to be the same as in A&E and the data was processed in the same way as that of patients 21 treated within the A&E department. Staff costs were calculated per minute of agitation. An 22 additional analysis assuming fixed staff costs was also conducted (Supplementary Table 5). 23 8 All tests performed were ass umed to have been done as part of investigating the patient's presenting 1 agitation. Although some investigations included may not be related to the agitation itself or to the 2 sedatives used, all of them were included in order to ensure consistency of the d ata collection and 3 minimise bias. (18) Tests not directly indicated for acute agitation management are likely to be 4 evenly distributed across the three treatment groups. All patients were required to have an 12 -lead 5 electrocardiogram done as part of the RCT documentation, therefore this cost was not included in 6 the analysis as it applied to all patients. For olanzapine, the only cost data available was for a 10mg 7 dose. The drug acquisition cost for a 5mg dose was ass umed to be half the cost of a 10mg dose . An 8 additional analys is costing olanzapine as per 10mg vials was conducted as well (Supplementary 9 Table 5). 10 Cost-effectiveness analysis 11 A cost -effectiveness analyses comparing the three sedative regimens was condu cted. As cost data 12 distributions, especially for pathology and radiology costs were skewed, the analyses was 13 conducted using both median costs (reported in main analysis) and mean costs (reported in 14 supplementary analysis) . The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) , defined as the additional 15 cost of management in HKD per minute of agitation -free time gained, was calculated by dividing 16 the difference in the total cost of management by the difference in agitation -free time gained of the 17 drugs in comparison . 18 The median agitation -free time gained associated with each treatment was multiplied by the 19 agitation management labour cost per minute (HKD 29.3/min or USD 3.8/min) to determine the 20 economic benefits (resulted from reduction in agitation time) associate d with each treatment. The 21 benefit -cost ratios (ratio of economic benefits over total management cost) among treatments was 22 also reported . 23 9 Sensitivity analyses 1 One-way sensitivity analyses were carried out to investigate the impact of potential fluctuation in 2 drug price and healthcare costs , as well as uncertainty in sedation effects and need for redosing , on 3 cost-effectiveness of the investigated treatments. For the purpose of sensitivity analyses , pathology 4 and radiology costs were assumed to b e the same for all patients who under went these tests, and the 5 probability of patients requiring these tests depend on the treatment received. Probability of 6 requiring a redose of the sedative drug were considered at the treatment level rather than the 7 individual patient's level . Essential variables and the ir ranges of variation ( Supplementary Table 2) 8 were obtained from the RCT data and chosen based on consideration of practical relevance. 9 Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was also carried out to assess t he uncertainty in the cost - 10 effectiveness estimates, and to evaluate the robustness of conclusions. Monte Carlo simulation with 11 100,000 iterations was carried out using TreeAge Pro 2020 (TreeAge Software, Williamstown, MA, 12 USA). The type and parameters of t he distributions used in the model are detailed in Supplementary 13 Table 2. In this analysis, it is assumed that the time -to-sedation associated with each drug follows 14 a gamma distribution. The mean time -to-sedation is allowed to vary and follows a normal 15 distribution with mean and standard deviation derived from the RCT data. Subsequently, the 16 probabilities of being sedated at 10, 20, 30, 45, 60 minutes, as well as the expected agitation 17 management time and agitation -free time gained, were calculated accordi ngly from the time -to- 18 sedation distribution. Probability of redosing was assumed to be different for each drug, and follows 19 a beta -distribution with parameters derived from the RCT data. 20 21 10 Results 1 Overall costs 2 In the base case analysis, midazolam was associated with the lowest median total treatment 3 costs (HKD 1958.9, USD 251.1, Table 1). The low drug cost associated with midazolam (HKD 4 10.7, USD 1.3 vs. HKD 30.5, USD 3.9 for haloperidol and HKD 76.1, USD 9. 8 for olanzapine ) 5 contributed to this, as well as the costs for pathology and agitation management being lowest for 6 the midazolam group. The lower management costs resulted from the shorter median agitation 7 management time for midazolam patients compared to the two other d rugs (21 minutes for 8 midazolam vs. 33 minutes for haloperidol and olanzapine). Overall, midazolam was 28% less costly 9 than haloperidol and 2 6% less costly than olanzapine. The total and proportional median costs for 10 the three treatment groups are shown in Table 1. 11 Despite high drug acquisition costs of olanzapine (HKD 55, USD 7.1 per 5mg olanzapine vs. HKD 12 6.5, USD 0.8 and HKD 21, USD 2. 7 for 5 mg midazolam and 5mg haloperidol respectively), the 13 median total treatment cost with olanzapine was slightly lower than the cost of haloperidol treatment 14 (HKD 2467.6, USD 316. 4 vs. HKD 2504.5, USD 321. 1). 15 We observed that costs distributions were highly sk ewed especially for pathology and 16 investigational costs , since more than half of the patients did not undergo any laboratory tests and 17 thus had zero cost, whereas those who required laboratory tests could incur significant 18 pathology/radiology costs . As such, median treatment costs were reported as the main analyses. 19 Mean treatment costs were also reported in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4. 20 11 Cost of management 1 Labour costs that incurred during the management of the agitated patient and their sedation 2 contrib uted to a major proportion (~30-40% in the base case, >70% when excluding investigational 3 costs ) to the overall management cost, whereas sedative drug cost contributed only a minimal 4 proportion (~0.5-3% in the base case, <10% when excluding investigational costs ) (Figure 2). 5 Due to the fact that many of the investigational tests done may not be directly linked to the sedative 6 chosen and varied notably among the individual patients, a cost comparison excluding these 7 investigational costs may be of interest. When pathology and radiology costs are excluded , 8 midazolam remains as the least costly option with a cost saving of HKD 379.3 (USD 48.6) vs. 9 haloperidol and HKD 431.2 (USD 55.3) vs. olanzapine (Table 2). 10 Cost-effectiveness analysis 11 Considering the relative effectiveness of the three treatments, midazolam was more effective than 12 haloperidol and olanzapine, as reflected by an additional agitation -free time gained of 12.32 and 13 12.37 minutes when midazolam was used compared to haloperido l and olanzapine respectively. 14 This resulted in additional economic benefits (due to reduction in agitation time) of HKD 361.3 15 (USD 46.3) and HKD 362.8 (USD 46.5) respectively. The net benefit -cost ratios were 1.93:1 for 16 midazolam, 1.37:1 for haloperidol a nd 1.39:1 for olanzapine. 17 Midazolam was shown to be the most cost -effective among the three treatments . On the other hand, 18 the cost -effectiveness of haloperidol versus olanzapine was less clear . In the base case, the ICER of 19 with halop eridol was HKD . Haloperidol was associated with an 20 additional HKD 727. 7 (USD 93. 3) per minute of agitation -free time gained. Yet, when costs for 21 investigational tests were excluded, haloperidol dominated over olanzapine with a slightly lower 22 12 cost (HKD 1203.3 vs 1255.2, USD 154.3 vs 160.9) and slightly higher effectiveness (116.76 vs 1 116.70 minutes of agitation -free time gained ) than olanzapine . 2 In the case where only patients with underlying mental illness at the time of A&E admission were 3 included , midazolam remained the dominant treatment. Olanzapine had a lower median cost (HKD 4 2268.72 vs 2501.30, USD 290.9 vs 320.7) and slightly lower effectiveness (117.11 vs 117.35 5 minutes of agitation -free time gained ) compared to haloperidol . The ICER f 6 to haloperidol was HKD 982.52 (USD 126.0) per minute of agitation -free time gained. 7 Sensitivity analyses 8 Probabilistic sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of the results against variations in time 9 to sedation , probability of redosing or investigational tests, and costs . While midazolam remained 10 dominant among the three treatments in more than 95% of the iterations at various hypothetical 11 willingness -to-pay thresholds (Figure 3) , there was no considerable differe nce in the cost - 12 effectiveness between olanzapine and haloperidol (Table 3). Midazolam was associated with the 13 lowest management cost and highest effectiveness, while differences between olanzapine and 14 haloperidol were minimal (Table 3). 15 One-way sensitivit y analyses also reveal ed that m idazolam remains dominant , regardless of 16 variations in costs , time to sedation , and probability of redosing or investigational tests 17 (Supplementary Figure s 2A & B). On the other hand, cost-effectiveness of haloperidol versus 18 olanzapine varie d significantly as pathology and radiology costs fluctuate , such that neither were 19 consistently dominant . The probabilities of requiring pathology or radiology tests, pathology and 20 radiology costs and drug costs contributed to the greatest variation in ICER when haloperidol and 21 olanzapine were compared (Supplementary Figure 2C). 22 13 Discussion 1 To our knowledge, this is the first multi -centre pharmacoeconomic study evaluating sedative drugs 2 and the management of acute agitation specifically in the A&E setting . Similar economic 3 evaluations of agitation management have been conducted in A&E departments of Australian 4 hospitals , where they found that intravenous midazolam was 3.8% less costly than intravenous 5 droperidol for manag ing acute agitation in the emergency department. (19) Other studies looking 6 at the economics of sedative use have been conducted in the hospital ward and psychiatric 7 setting, (20) where the focus commonly lies on prolonged sedation, (21) the treatment of chronic 8 mental illnesses and long -term care and cost implications .(22) Due to the differences in measured 9 outcomes and perceived acceptable time to adequate sedation in different clinical contexts , the 10 results of these studies are less generalisable to the A&E setting. 11 Similar to previous studies, (13, 23) our analyses showed that drug acquisition costs only contribute 12 to a small part of the overall agitation management cost, whereby a major proportion is attributed 13 to labour costs , which is directly proportional to the time to sedation . Even for the most expensive 14 drug (i.e. olanzapine) in this study, labour cost was shown to be 10 times the drug cost incurred in 15 the overall agitation management proces s. In contrast, a drug with shorter time to sedation not only 16 reduce labour cost incurred, but also brings practical benefits by reduc ing patient's disturbances to 17 other patients and staff in the A&E departmen t, which could not be accounted for economically . As 18 such, when making decision s in the formulary management context regarding intramuscular 19 sedatives for agitation management in the A&E setting , the effectiv eness and adverse event profile 20 is considered a greater consideration, compared to additional drug acquisition costs, which is 21 considered relatively negligible . 22 14 Midazolam was the least costly treatment option , which can be mainly attributed to its faster average 1 time to sedation and thus a much lower agitation management labour cost compared to 2 antipsychotics . It was also the most effective sedative option as it was associated with the most 3 agitation -free time gained. As such, m idazolam was shown to be dominant strategy economically . 4 Despite this , previous studies reported that the use of midazolam and other benzodiazepines is 5 associated with undesirable adverse effects including over-sedation (24) and respiratory distress (25, 6 26), requiring additional monitoring of respiratory function and prolonging total length of hospital 7 stay. Indeed , particularly in patients with suspected underlying psychoses , the use of antipsychotics 8 for rapid sedation is generally preferred in practice over benzodiazepines to p revent over -sedating 9 the patient and preserve the opportunity for psychiatric follow up and assessment, following the 10 initial management. Furthermore, our previous randomised clinical trial had shown that 11 intravenous olanzapine as an adjunct to midazolam c an further reduce time to sedation compared 12 with midazolam alone. (27) Hence, despite midazolam being the dominant treatment economically, 13 it is still valuable to determine, from an e conomic point of view, whether olanzapine could be 14 recommended as an alternative to haloperidol . 15 While haloperidol was reported to be the most commonly used sedative for the management of 16 acute agitation in Hong Kong, (6) yet as a first -generation antipsychotic, it is associated with adverse 17 effects including QT prolongation, dystonia and extrapyramidal symptoms. Although the 18 occurrence of adverse events was relatively uncommon in the RCT (4.8%) , these adverse effects 19 would carry significant management cost when they do occur. Indeed, a meta -analysis of 20 randomised controlled trials (RCT) concluded that intramuscular olanzapine is preferred over 21 haloperidol as it is equally as effe ctive and associated with fewer side -effects. 22 15 In our base -case analyses, we showed that olanzapine was associated with a slightly lower total 1 management cost compared to haloperidol ( HKD 2467.6 , USD 316. 4 vs. , USD 321. 1). 2 However, s ensitivity analyses revealed that the cost -effectiveness of olanzapine compared to 3 haloperidol varied significantly as pathology and radiology costs varie d. Despite a higher drug cost 4 for olanzapine than haloperidol , there is no clear difference in cost -effectiveness of olanzapine 5 versus haloperidol after considering potential inter -patient variability in pathology and radiology 6 costs . Considering this and the more favourable adverse effect profile and convenient once -daily 7 dosing of olanzapine compared to haloperidol , there is potential for a more wide -spread use of 8 olanzapine in the management of acute agitation. 9 We acknowledge several limitations for t his economic evaluation. Firstly, the time horizon of this 10 study is limited to the duration of stay in t he A&E department due to the underlying RCT data. As 11 such, the economic evaluation focused on the A&E perspective and might not be generalisable to 12 the broader perspective of the public sector as a whole . Nevertheless, this study provided data on 13 cost-effectiveness of intramuscular sedatives in an emergency setting in which patients often 14 present with undifferentiated agitation , where evidence remains limited, and A &E resource 15 utilisation is an important consideration for formulary decisions especi ally in Hong Kong . Further 16 studies could evaluate the costs associated with not only the A&E stay but also the 17 inpatient/outpatient episodes following . Secondly , this study did not differentiate between patients 18 with or without underlying psychiatric disor der and/or substance abuse and their medication history, 19 which may potentially affect their agitation management time and hence the labour costs involved. 20 However, the baseline characteristics of the study population showed that these patients were 21 distrib uted equally across the study groups. Thirdly , the cost of management was estimated based 22 on a single RCT in the Hong Kong A&E setting. Results may be less generalizable to other settings 23 16 and further economic evaluations on the cost -effectiveness of differ ent sedative regimens in the 1 A&E setting may be needed . Fourth , adverse effects of the study drugs and the costs associated 2 with their management were not considered in this economic analysis. Yet, such costs was deemed 3 negligible in the general case since the occurrence of adverse events in the RCT was uncommon 4 (4.8%, n=8, only one of which was serious and unlikely to be related to the study drug), and related 5 costs for staff attendance was already accounted for in the agitation management labour costs. Fifth, 6 combination therapy of an antipsychotic followed by a benzodiazepine, which is also often used in 7 initial management of acutely psychotic patient, ha s not been investigated and can be further 8 studied. Sixth , results may not be generalizable to setting s where the A&E length of stay is much 9 longer as the A&E department in Hong Kong, where the patient turnover rate is high . 10 11 17 Conclusions 1 From an economic point of view, our analysis concludes that intramuscular midazolam is the 2 dominant strategy for the management of acute agitation of unknown aetiology in the A&E 3 department. Sedation using the currently rarely used intramuscular olanzapine could be considered 4 as an alternative to intramuscular haloperidol , especially when there is underlying psyc hoses , since 5 (i) there is no clear difference in cost-effective ness of intramuscular olanzapine compared to 6 haloperidol , (ii) olanzapine carries a more favourable adverse effect profile with more convenient 7 once -daily dosing , and (iii) drug costs only acco unts for a small portion of the overall management 8 costs compared to labour costs and the drug acquisition cost of generic intramuscular olanzapine 9 may continue to be more competitive in the future. 10 11 18 References 1 1.
