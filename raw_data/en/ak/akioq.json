To inform decision-making on HCV screening, we performed a systematic review of the accuracy of antibody tests, as compared to other immunoassays and RNA detection, for screening asymp tomatic adults for HCV infection. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 19 90-2016; resulting citations were uploaded into DistillerSR and independently screened by 2 re viewers. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS -2 tool; the quality of the 'body of evidence' was assessed using GRADE methodology. Results: Of 1,537 articles identified, 81 underwent full-te xt review, and 9 studies met inclusion criteria. Compared to RNA detection, the sensitivity of ELISA v3.0 was variable (61.0%-81.8%) and the specificit y was high (97.5%-99.7%). As expected, there were more fa lse-positive results when comparing antibody tests to RNA detection than to other immunoassays; in fact, there were more false-positives than true-positives . Our GRADE assessment suggested that there was a high co ncern for risk of bias, particularly verification b ias, and substantial inconsistency between studies in terms of their design. Interpretation: More research is needed to better characterize the accuracy of antibody tests used to screen for HCV infection in the general population. Jurisd ictions that recently adopted birth cohort screenin g for HCV infection are encouraged to evaluate and report on HCV screening test accuracy, and screening benefits and harms.

An estimated 21-44% of those Canadians with chronic HCV infection are u naware of their infection (1;2). In low-prevalence countri es like Canada and the United Kingdom, the approach to HCV prevention and control has focused on case-finding (4;5), i.e., testing persons with risk factors for HCV infection, such as intravenous drug users (IVDU) and refugees from endemic countries. The recent development of costly but effective treatment for c hronic hepatitis C (6) has led some to re-evaluate the evidence for/against population screening for HCV i nfection (7). In 2013, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) revised their 2004 recommendation against screening asymptomatic adults for HCV infection (8); it now recommends one-time screening for all adults born between 1945 and 1965 (7). The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC) is currently examining whether or not primary care physicians should screen asymptomatic adults for HC V infection (9). The World Health Organization (10;11) and the UK Na tional Screening Committee's (12) guidance on when screening should be performed emphasizes the fundam ental importance of having a 'safe, valid, and reli able' screening test. Screening for HCV infection typical ly relies on antibody testing. Because approximatel y 25% of HCV-infected persons spontaneously clear the infect ion (13) but antibodies may persist (14), antibody testing cannot discriminate current from resolved infection s, leading to false-positive results (15). False-po sitive results can also occur from other antibodies interacting no n-specifically with the test (16). False-positive r esults can cause harm (e.g., through labeling , anxiety ). Therefore, individuals who screen positive typic ally undergo further testing, which has resource implications an d may carry additional inherent risk. To inform dec ision- making on screening for chronic HCV infection, we p erformed a systematic review of the evidence on the accuracy of antibody tests used to screen asymptoma tic adults for HCV infection. METHODS Laboratory tests for HCV Laboratory tests for HCV can be divided into 3 cate gories based on what they detect: 1) antibodies to HCV, 2) antibodies to HCV and HCV core antigen (i.e., antig en-antibody tests), or 3) HCV RNA (16). Antibody te Page 4 of 136 For Peer Review Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Confidential 4 microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA). Each comme rcial kit uses slightly different sets of HCV antigens to bind and detect host antibodies (Ta ble 1). Antigen-antibody tests include fourth-gener ation ELISAs; because they detect antibodies to HCV, they would have the same issues with false-positives as 3 rd generation ELISAs, but higher sensitivity because t hey also detect HCV antigen. Molecular techniques t hat detect HCV RNA, such as polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) and nucleic acid testing (NAT), are recommende d as confirmatory tests (17), even though immunocompromi sed and hemodialysis patients may have false-negati ve results (16). RNA-based testing can detect HCV befo re antibodies are produced (early infection) and ca n differentiate between current and resolved infectio n (i.e., fewer false-positives). It is important to note that there is no perfect reference standard for HCV infe ction, and the U nited States Centers for Disease Control and PreventionS CDC has recommended a testing strategy where the initi al test is an antibody test, and the confirmatory test may be either RNA detection or se rological methods similar to the index test (17). Environmental scan of laboratory testing for HCV in Canada To scope our systematic review, we first performed an environmental scan of laboratory testing for HCV in Canada. Given that provincial/territorial (P/T) lab oratories generally perform the majority of HCV tes ting (18), one author (GC) searched the grey literature on P/T laboratory and CATIE websites, and contacted P/T laboratories by email in February 2016, on behalf o f the C anadian Task Force for Preventive Health Care , to inquire about HCV testing (Appendix A). In a majori ty of P/T labs, the initial test used was an antibo dy test, such as CLIA (British Columbia, Northwest Territory, Sas katchewan), CMIA (Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland & Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario), or MEIA (Quebec). Confirmatory testing was typically performed using another immunoassay, such as CMIA ( British Columbia, Saskatchewan), CLIA (Ontario), fo urth- generation ELISA (Alberta), or recombinant immunobl ot assay (RIBA) (Manitoba, Quebec), rather than PCR (New Brunswick, Newfoundland & Labrador, Nova Scoti a). Use of a different immunoassay to confirm HCV infection (19), rather than RNA detection, is also aligned with current US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations (17). Research question Our objective was to carry out a systematic review to estimate the accuracy of antibody tests used in Canada (i.e., CMIA, CLIA, ECLIA, MEIA, and ELISA version 3 .0) to screen for HCV infection among asymptomatic, non- pregnant, treatment-na\u00efve adults with unknown liver enzyme values. In the absence of a perfect referen ce standard , we used two different sets of reference tests: 1) i nferior serological RIBA) commonly use d as confirmatory tests in Canada, and 2) superior RNA- based reference tests (PCR, NAT), which are less co mmonly used. We also sought to assess the accuracy of the Page 5 of 136 For Peer Review Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Confidential 5 two-step HCV screening procedure (i.e., the combina tion of the initial and confirmatory tests) current ly used in Canada. The research protocol to answer this questi on was registered with PROSPERO (#CRD42016039710). Literature search strategy The literature search strategy was developed with t he help of a librarian at the University of Toronto Gerstein Science Information Centre (Appendix B). Ovid MEDLI NE\u00ae 1946 to present, Ovid MEDLINE\u00ae In-Process & Oth er Non-Indexed Citations, and Ovid EMBASE\u00ae were system atically searched using both controlled vocabulary and keywords. Because the oldest immunoassay of interes t (ELISA v3.0) was first marketed in 1993 (20), ret rieval was limited to articles published between January 1 , 1990 and May 6, 2016. Language was restricted to English or French. Conference abstracts were excluded from the search results. Selection criteria Original research studies, systematic reviews and m eta-analyses were eligible for inclusion. At least 80% of the study population had to be asymptomatic, non-pregna nt, treatment-na\u00efve adults with unknown liver enzym e values and unknown HCV status (e.g., general popula tion, blood donors); high-risk groups such as hemod transplant/transfusion recipients, IVDUsintravenous drug users , patients co-infected with other blood-borne infections were excluded, as well as bl ood bank specimens that previously tested negative for HCV and specimen panels. The index test had to be one o f CLIA, ECLIA, CMIA, MEIA, or ELISA v3.0; rapid tes ts, tests performed on specimens other than blood (e.g., sali va), and sero/genotyping tests were excluded. Withi n a given study, the reference test had to be different from the index test. In the absence of a perfect r eference standard, two different sets of reference tests wer e eligible for inclusion: inferior serological superior RNA-based reference tests (PCR, NAT). The reference test had to be applied to some subjects w ho tested positive on the index test as well as som e of those who tested negative on the index test, so tha t a 2x2 table could be filled and sensitivity and/o r specificity estimated. The setting had to resemble primary care (e.g., blood donation centre, population-based scr eening); hospital-based specialty clinics and inpatient hosp ital settings were excluded. Selection method Using DistillerSR software, both reviewers (GC, JC) independently screened all titles and abstracts us ing the pre-determined selection criteria above. Potentiall y relevant articles were retrieved, and both review ers (GC, JC) screened all full-text articles using the same selection criteria as above. Disagreements were res olved through discussion.

Raw data was abstracted to creat e 2x2 tables of index test(s) compared to reference test(s) for each study. The second reviewer (JC) verified t he accuracy and completeness of the other's data ex traction. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Aut hors of one included study were contacted (21) to o btain additional data not reported in the published artic le (22). Risk of bias assessment One reviewer (GC), with previous experience conduct ing validation studies (23;24) and performing stati stical adjustment for verification bias (25), assessed the risk of bias and applicability of each included st udy using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies ( QUADAS-2) tool. QUADAS-2 focuses on four domains: patient selection, index test, reference test, as w ell as patient flow and timing of testing (26). The second reviewer (JC) verified the accuracy and completenes s of the other's assessment. Disagreements were res olved through discussion. Statistical analyses Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), false-posi tive (FP) rate, (CI) were estim ated using the raw data (2x2 tables) extracted from the included studies. For studies th at suffered from verification bias as a result of t he sampling strategy used, statistical adjustment of sensitivit y and specificity estimates (and therefore false-positiveFP and false-negativeFN rate) was performed (27). Given the small number o f included studies and the heterogeneity of index-reference test pairings between studies, q uantitative synthesis was not considered appropriat e. Assessment of the quality of the 'body of evidence' using GRADE Whereas studies using inferior serological referenc e tests reflect current laboratory practice in seve ral P/T, they likely underestimate the true number of false- positives. For this reason, we further restricted t he 'body of evidence' to studies where the index test was an an tibody test (reflecting current laboratory practice ) and the reference test detected RNA. Two reviewers (GC, JC) independently used GRADE methodology for diagnosti c testing accuracy (DTA) studies (28-31) to assess the body of evidence; dis agreements between reviewers were resolved through discussion. The GRADE criteria eva luate the evidence in terms of study design, risk o f bias, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias (31 ).

A list of all excluded studies and each study's reason for ex clusion is available in Appendix C. We did not ide ntify any eligible studies that evaluated the two-step HCV sc reening procedure. Included studies (Table 2) were conducted in countries with low (15;32;33), moderat e (34;35), and high (22;36-38) HCV prevalence (39). Only 2 studies involved routine HCV screening of the gener al population (21;31); the other 7 studies involved blood donor screening (14;32-37). The 9 included studies reported on 11 different index\u2014reference test pairi ngs: 5 studies compared antibody tests to other antibody t ests (14;21;31;32;35), 2 studies compared antigen- antibody tests to antibody tests (33;36), 3 studies compared antibody tests to RNA detection (20;21;35 ;37), and 1 study compared an antigen-antibody test to RN A detection (34). Seven studies applied the index and reference tests to all samples in parallel (14;31;32;34-37); 2 stu dies (21;33) suffered from verification bias as a result of appl ying the reference test to a larger proportion of s amples that had tested positive on the index test relative to t hose that had tested negative on the index test (Ap pendix D - QUADAS-2 assessment). Accuracy of immunoassays as compared to other immun oassays The sample size of studies comparing two immunoassa ys ranged from 106 to 5,208 (Table 3). For antibody tests compared to other antibody tests, sensitivity ranged from 70.4% to 99.5% and specificity ranged from 98.7% to 99.8%. For an antigen-antibody test compar ed to an antibody test, sensitivity ranged from 52. 4% to 95.6% and specificity was over 99%. Accuracy of immunoassays as compared to RNA detecti on The sample size of studies comparing an antibody te st to RNA detection ranged from 106 to 21,115 (Tabl e 4). For antibody tests compared to RNA detection, sensi tivity ranged from 61.0% to 81.8% and specificity r anged from 97.5% to 99.7%. As expected, the antigen-antib ody test performed better against RNA detection tha n the antibody tests did; its sensitivity was 90.2% and i ts specificity was 99.8%. Also as expected, the num ber of false- positive results was higher when comparing antibody tests to RNA detection than to other antibody test s; in fact, there were more false-positives than true-pos itives.

TThe 9 included studies reported on 11 different ind ex\u2014reference test pairings: 5 studies compared anti body tests to other antibody tests (15;22;32;33;36) , 2 studies compared antigen-antibody tests to anti body tests (34;37) , 3 studies compared antibody tests to RNA detectio n (21;22;36;38) , and 1 study compared an antigen- antibody test to RNA detection (35) . With respect to study flow and timing, 7 studies a pplied the index and reference tests to all samples in parallel (15;32;33;35-38) ; 2 studies (22;34) suffered from verification bias as a result of applying the reference test to a larger p roportion of samples that had tested positive on th e index test relative to those that had tested negative on the i ndex test. Assessment of the quality of the 'body of evidence' using GRADE Three studies comparing antibody tests to RNA detec tion were considered for inclusion in the 'body of evidence'. One study (22) was excluded because, as a result of there being zero false-negatives, the c orrection of the sensitivity estimate for verification bias w as overly conservative (40) and the uncorrected sen sitivity was too biased to be meaningful. Another study (36) wa s excluded because, based on its results, the study prevalence of HCV was 23.6%; this very high prevale nce suggests that either the study population was n ot reflective of the general population or a case-cont rol design was used (in either case, it did not mee t our inclusion criteria). Findings from the remaining st udy (38) were assessed as 'very low' quality of evi dence using GRADE (Table 5) ; this study reported a sensitivity of 81.8%, 95% C I (59.0-100%) and a specificity of CI (99.6-99.8%). Assuming an HCV seroprevalence of 0.96% as in the general Canadian population (2) , instead of the 0.1% prevalence among the 17,840 blood donor s in the study (38) , the PPV would be 72.7%, 95% CI (66.2-78.8%), CI (9 9.8-99.9%). . Applying this study's findings to 1,000 individuals drawn from the general Canadian populat ion (Table 5) , assuming a population HCV seroprevalence of 0.96% (0.61%-1.34%) (2), we would expect (6-10) 98 7, 2, 95% CI (0-4) false-negatives. INTERPRETATION We performed a systematic review of the evidence on the accuracy of antibody tests, as compared to oth er immunoassays and RNA detection, for screening asymp tomatic adults for HCV infection. We found that the sensitivity of antibody tests was highly variable ( 52.4%-99.5%) and the specificity was high (97.5%-99 .8%). The lack of a perfect reference test for HCV raises con cerns that these estimates are biased. In particula r, when an inferior serological reference test that shares the same risk of false-positives as the index test is used, the Field Code Changed Field Code Changed Field Code Changed Field Code Changed Field Code ChangedPage 9 of 136 For Peer Review Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Confidential 9 specificity could be overestimated. As expected, w e found that there were more false-positive results when comparing antibody tests to superior RNA-based refe rence tests, than to inferior serological reference tests; in fact, there were more false-positives than true-pos itives owing to the very low prevalence of HCV. Bia s correction of the specificity estimate could make t he difference even greater. This finding highlights a potential problem with using an inferior serological referenc e test as a confirmatory test (17;19) when screenin g the general population for HCV infection. Our assessmen t of the 'body of evidence' using GRADE methodology led us to focus on a single 'least biased' study (38), which reported the sensitivity of ELISA v3.0 compar ed to NAT as 81.8%, 95% CI (59.0%-100%), its specificity as 99.8 %, 95% (99.7%-99.8%), and its PPV as 13.8%, 95% CI (5.4- 22.2). The only other systematic review of HCV antibody te st accuracy was performed in the context of the U nited States Preventive Services Task Force 's 2004 recommendation on HCV screening. However, t he populations of the studies included in that review (i.e., hemodial ysis patients, patients with histologically-verifie d hepatitis, patients hospitalized with suspected acute/chronic hepatitis, blood donors with persistently elevated liver enzymes, and blood donors who previously screened p ositive for HCV) did not reflect the general popula tion, therefore those findings are not directly comparabl e to ours (8;20). When the U nited States Preventive Services Task Force revised its recommendation on HCV screening in 201 3, it did not re-assess HCV screening test accuracy, despite the introduction of new immu noassays (i.e., CLIA, ECLIA, CMIA, MEIA) since its 2004 systematic review (3). Similarly, when the WHO publ ished its HCV screening guideline in 2014 (41), it did not re-assess screening test accuracy, instead citing a 2001 report (42) on simple/rapid test accuracy and a 2002 report (43) on ELISA v3.0+ immunoassay accuracy, bo th involving blood panels not reflective of the gen eral population. Because antibody tests have not been ad equately evaluated for population-based HCV screen ing, and because the availability of a 'safe, valid, and reliable' screening test is a fundamental consider ation of any screening recommendation or program (10-12), this h ighlights a knowledge gap and brings into question the evidence basis for these recommendations. Our findings are limited by the paucity and the low quality of the available evidence published in English or French . In particular, we were unable to locate any studi es of the accuracy of CLIA, CMIA, or MEIA (the HCV screening tests most commonly used in Canada) as co mpared to RNA detection for HCV screening in the general population. The applicability of our findin gs to the general Canadian population is limited be cause a majority of included studies were conducted among b lood donors, and persons eligible to donate blood a re at lower risk of blood-borne infections like HCV than the general population. Rapid and point-of-care tes ts were beyond the scope of our review; whereas those tests are important for reaching some vulnerable populat ions, Page 10 of 136 For Peer Review Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Confidential 10 a majority of HCV testing in Canada is laboratory-b ased (18); also, a systematic review of the accurac y of rapid tests was recently published (44). In conclusion, the availability of a 'safe, valid, and reliable' s creening test is a primordial consideration for decision-making about screening (10-12), but our st udy has shown that more further research is needed to adequately characterize the accuracy of antibody te sts used to screen the general population for HCV i nfection . Whereas decision-making about screening involves mu ltiple considerations, such as the availability of safe and effective treatment, having a 'safe, valid, and rel iable' screening test is a primordial consideration (10-12) . Our study focused on the accuracy of HCV screening test s; however, several other important factors must be considered when making decisions about HCV screenin g, including: the benefits and harms of screening, the benefits and harms of treatment for screen-detected cases, the cost-effectiveness of screening, as wel l as patient preferences related to screening. A review of the evidence related to these considerations is beyond the scope of the present study, but such a review i s being performed by others in the context of the C anadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care's upcoming gui delines on HCV screening. To help inform decision-m aking about HCV screening, Ww e encourage jurisdictions that have already adopted population-based ( birth cohort ) HCV screening for HCV to carefully evaluate and report on the accuracy o f antibody tests, as well as screening benefits and harms ; these findings will help inform future HCV screen ing policies .

T o inform decision-making on HCV screening, we performed a sy stematic review of the accuracy of antibody tests, as compared to other immunoassays and RNA detection, f or screening asymptomatic adults for HCV infection. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched from 19 90-2016; resulting citations were uploaded into DistillerSR and independently screened by 2 re viewers. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS -2 tool; the quality of the 'body of evidence' was assessed using GRADE methodology. Results: Of 1,537 articles identified, 81 underwent full-te xt review, and 9 studies met inclusion criteria. Compared to RNA detection, the sensitivity of ELISA v3.0 was variable (61.0%-81.8%) and the specificit y was high (97.5%-99.7%). As expected, there were more fa lse-positive results when comparing antibody tests to RNA detection than to other immunoassays; in fact, there were more false-positives than true-positives . Our GRADE assessment suggested that there was a high co ncern for risk of bias, particularly verification b ias, and substantial inconsistency between studies in terms of their design. Interpretation: More research is needed to better characterize the accuracy of antibody tests used to screen for HCV infection in the general population. Jurisd ictions that recently adopted birth cohort screenin g for HCV infection are encouraged to evaluate and report on HCV screening test accuracy, and screening benefits and harms.

An estimated 21-44% of those Canadians with chronic HCV infection are u naware of their infection (1;2). In low-prevalence countri es like Canada and the United Kingdom, the approach to HCV prevention and control has focused on case-finding (4;5), i.e., testing persons with risk factors for HCV infection, such as intravenous drug users and refug ees from endemic countries. The recent development of costly but effective treatment for chronic hepatiti s C (6) has led some to re-evaluate the evidence fo r/against population screening for HCV infection (7). In 2013 , the United States Preventive Services Task Force revised their 2004 recommendation against screening asympto matic adults for HCV infection (8); it now recommen ds one-time screening for all adults born between 1945 and 1965 (7). The Canadian Task Force on Preventiv e Health Care is currently examining whether or not p rimary care physicians should screen asymptomatic a dults for HCV infection (9). The World Health Organization (10;11) and the UK Na tional Screening Committee's (12) guidance on when screening should be performed emphasizes the fundam ental importance of having a 'safe, valid, and reli able' screening test. Screening for HCV infection typical ly relies on antibody testing. Because approximatel y 25% of HCV-infected persons spontaneously clear the infect ion (13) but antibodies may persist (14), antibody testing cannot discriminate current from resolved infection s, leading to false-positive results (15). False-po sitive results can also occur from other antibodies interacting no n-specifically with the test (16). False-positive r esults can cause harm (e.g., through labeling, anxiety). There fore, individuals who screen positive typically und ergo further testing, which has resource implications an d may carry additional inherent risk. To inform dec ision- making on screening for chronic HCV infection, we p erformed a systematic review of the evidence on the accuracy of antibody tests used to screen asymptoma tic adults for HCV infection. METHODS Laboratory tests for HCV Laboratory tests for HCV can be divided into 3 cate gories based on what they detect: 1) antibodies to HCV, 2) antibodies to HCV and HCV core antigen (i.e., antig en-antibody tests), or 3) HCV RNA (16). Antibody te Page 18 of 136 For Peer Review Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Confidential 4 microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA). Each comme rcial kit uses slightly different sets of HCV antigens to bind and detect host antibodies (Ta ble 1). Antigen-antibody tests include fourth-gener ation ELISAs; because they detect antibodies to HCV, they would have the same issues with false-positives as 3 rd generation ELISAs, but higher sensitivity because t hey also detect HCV antigen. Molecular techniques t hat detect HCV RNA, such as polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) and nucleic acid testing (NAT), are recommende d as confirmatory tests (17), even though immunocompromi sed and hemodialysis patients may have false-negati ve results (16). RNA-based testing can detect HCV befo re antibodies are produced (early infection) and ca n differentiate between current and resolved infectio n (i.e., fewer false-positives). It is important to note that there is no perfect reference standard for HCV infe ction, and the United States Centers for Disease Co ntrol and Prevention has recommended a testing strategy where the initial test is an antibody test, and the conf irmatory test may be either RNA detection or serological met hods similar to the index test (17). Environmental scan of laboratory testing for HCV in Canada To scope our systematic review, we first performed an environmental scan of laboratory testing for HCV in Canada. Given that provincial/territorial (P/T) lab oratories generally perform the majority of HCV tes ting (18), one author (GC) searched the grey literature on P/T laboratory and CATIE websites, and contacted P/T laboratories by email in February 2016, on behalf o f the Canadian Task Force for Preventive Health Car e, to inquire about HCV testing (Appendix A). In a majori ty of P/T labs, the initial test used was an antibo dy test, such as CLIA (British Columbia, Northwest Territory, Sas katchewan), CMIA (Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland & Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario), or MEIA (Quebec). Confirmatory testing was typically performed using another immunoassay, such as CMIA ( British Columbia, Saskatchewan), CLIA (Ontario), fo urth- generation ELISA (Alberta), or recombinant immunobl ot assay (RIBA) (Manitoba, Quebec), rather than PCR (New Brunswick, Newfoundland & Labrador, Nova Scoti a). Use of a different immunoassay to confirm HCV infection (19), rather than RNA detection, is also aligned with current US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations (17). Research question Our objective was to carry out a systematic review to estimate the accuracy of antibody tests used in Canada (i.e., CMIA, CLIA, ECLIA, MEIA, and ELISA version 3 .0) to screen for HCV infection among asymptomatic, non- pregnant, treatment-na\u00efve adults with unknown liver enzyme values. In the absence of a perfect referen ce standard, we used two different sets of reference t ests: 1) inferior serological reference RIBA) commonly use d as confirmatory tests in Canada, and 2) superior RNA- based reference tests (PCR, NAT), which are less co mmonly used. We also sought to assess the accuracy of the Page 19 of 136 For Peer Review Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Confidential 5 two-step HCV screening procedure (i.e., the combina tion of the initial and confirmatory tests) current ly used in Canada. The research protocol to answer this questi on was registered with PROSPERO (#CRD42016039710). Literature search strategy The literature search strategy was developed with t he help of a librarian at the University of Toronto Gerstein Science Information Centre (Appendix B). Ovid MEDLI NE\u00ae 1946 to present, Ovid MEDLINE\u00ae In-Process & Oth er Non-Indexed Citations, and Ovid EMBASE\u00ae were system atically searched using both controlled vocabulary and keywords. Because the oldest immunoassay of interes t (ELISA v3.0) was first marketed in 1993 (20), ret rieval was limited to articles published between January 1 , 1990 and May 6, 2016. Language was restricted to English or French. Conference abstracts were excluded from the search results. Selection criteria Original research studies, systematic reviews and m eta-analyses were eligible for inclusion. At least 80% of the study population had to be asymptomatic, non-pregna nt, treatment-na\u00efve adults with unknown liver enzym e values and unknown HCV status (e.g., general popula tion, blood donors); high-risk as hemod transplant/transfusion recipients, intrav enous drug users, patients co-infected with other b lood- borne infections were excluded, as well as blood ba nk specimens that previously tested negative for HC V and specimen panels. The index test had to be one of CL IA, ECLIA, CMIA, MEIA, or ELISA v3.0; rapid tests, tests performed on specimens other than blood (e.g., sali va), and sero/genotyping tests were excluded. Withi n a given study, the reference test had to be different from the index test. In the absence of a perfect r eference standard, two different sets of reference tests wer e eligible for inclusion: inferior serological superior RNA-based reference tests (PCR, NAT). The reference test had to be applied to some subjects w ho tested positive on the index test as well as som e of those who tested negative on the index test, so tha t a 2x2 table could be filled and sensitivity and/o r specificity estimated. The setting had to resemble primary care (e.g., blood donation centre, population-based scr eening); hospital-based specialty clinics and inpatient hosp ital settings were excluded. Selection method Using DistillerSR software, both reviewers (GC, JC) independently screened all titles and abstracts us ing the pre-determined selection criteria above. Potentiall y relevant articles were retrieved, and both review ers (GC, JC) screened all full-text articles using the same selection criteria as above. Disagreements were res olved through discussion.

Raw data was abstracted to creat e 2x2 tables of index test(s) compared to reference test(s) for each study. The second reviewer (JC) verified t he accuracy and completeness of the other's data ex traction. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Aut hors of one included study were contacted (21) to o btain additional data not reported in the published artic le (22). Risk of bias assessment One reviewer (GC), with previous experience conduct ing validation studies (23;24) and performing stati stical adjustment for verification bias (25), assessed the risk of bias and applicability of each included st udy using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies ( QUADAS-2) tool. QUADAS-2 focuses on four domains: patient selection, index test, reference test, as w ell as patient flow and timing of testing (26). The second reviewer (JC) verified the accuracy and completenes s of the other's assessment. Disagreements were res olved through discussion. Statistical analyses Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), false-posi tive rate, false- negative rate, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) we re estimated using the raw data (2x2 tables) extrac ted from the included studies. For studies that suffered fro m verification bias as a result of the sampling str ategy used, statistical adjustment of sensitivity and specifici ty estimates (and therefore false-positive and fals e-negative rate) was performed (27). Given the small number of included studies and the heterogeneity of index- reference test pairings between studies, quantitati ve synthesis was not considered appropriate. Assessment of the quality of the 'body of evidence' using GRADE Whereas studies using inferior serological referenc e tests reflect current laboratory practice in seve ral P/T, they likely underestimate the true number of false- positives. For this reason, we further restricted t he 'body of evidence' to studies where the index test was an an tibody test (reflecting current laboratory practice ) and the reference test detected RNA. Two reviewers (GC, JC) independently used GRADE methodology for diagnosti c testing accuracy studies (28-31) to assess the body of evidence; disagreements between reviewers were resolved through discussion. The GRADE criteria eva luate the evidence in terms of study design, risk o f bias, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias (31 ).

Included studies (Table 2) were conducted in countries with low (15;32;33), moderat e (34;35), and high (22;36-38) HCV prevalence (39). Accuracy of immunoassays as compared to other immun oassays The sample size of studies comparing two immunoassa ys ranged from 106 to 5,208 (Table 3). For antibody tests compared to other antibody tests, sensitivity ranged from 70.4% to 99.5% and specificity ranged from 98.7% to 99.8%. For an antigen-antibody test compar ed to an antibody test, sensitivity ranged from 52. 4% to 95.6% and specificity was over 99%. Accuracy of immunoassays as compared to RNA detecti on The sample size of studies comparing an antibody te st to RNA detection ranged from 106 to 21,115 (Tabl e 4). For antibody tests compared to RNA detection, sensi tivity ranged from 61.0% to 81.8% and specificity r anged from 97.5% to 99.7%. As expected, the antigen-antib ody test performed better against RNA detection tha n the antibody tests did; its sensitivity was 90.2% and i ts specificity was 99.8%. Also as expected, the num ber of false- positive results was higher when comparing antibody tests to RNA detection than to other antibody test s; in fact, there were more false-positives than true-pos itives. Assessment of included studies' risk of bias using QUADAS-2 With respect to patient selection, only 2 studies i nvolved routine HCV screening of the general popula tion (22;32); the other 7 studies involved blood donor s creening (15;33-38) (Appendix D - QUADAS-2 assessme nt). The 9 included studies reported on 11 different ind ex\u2014reference test pairings: 5 studies compared anti body tests to other antibody tests (15;22;32;33;36), 2 s tudies compared antigen-antibody tests to antibody tests (34;37), 3 studies compared antibody tests to RNA d etection (21;22;36;38), and 1 study compared an ant igen- antibody test to RNA detection (35). With respect t o study flow and timing, 7 studies applied the inde x and reference tests to all samples in parallel (15;32;3 3;35-38); 2 studies (22;34) suffered from verificat ion bias as a result of applying the reference test to a larger p roportion of samples that had tested positive on th e index test relative to those that had tested negative on the i ndex test.

One study (22) was excluded because, as a result of there being zero false-negatives, the c orrection of the sensitivity estimate for verification bias w as overly conservative (40) and the uncorrected sen sitivity was too biased to be meaningful. Another study (36) wa s excluded because, based on its results, the study prevalence of HCV was 23.6%; this very high prevale nce suggests that either the study population was n ot reflective of the general population or a case-cont rol design was used (in either case, it did not mee t our inclusion criteria). Findings from the remaining st udy (38) were assessed as 'very low' quality of evi dence using GRADE (Table 5); this study reported a sensitivity of 81.8%, 95% CI (59.0-100%) and a specificity of 9 CI (99.6-99.8%). Assuming an HCV seroprevalence of 0.96% as in the general Canadian population (2), in stead of the 0.1% prevalence among the 17,840 blood donor s in the study (38), the PPV would be 72.7%, 95% CI (66.2-78.8%), and the NPV be 99.8%, 95% CI (9 9.8-99.9%). Applying this study's findings to 1,000 individuals drawn from the general Canadian populat ion (Table 5), we would expect 8, 95% CI (6-10) tru e- positives, 95% CI (0-4) false- negatives. INTERPRETATION We performed a systematic review of the evidence on the accuracy of antibody tests, as compared to oth er immunoassays and RNA detection, for screening asymp tomatic adults for HCV infection. We found that the sensitivity of antibody tests was highly variable ( 52.4%-99.5%) and the specificity was high (97.5%-99 .8%). The lack of a perfect reference test for HCV raises con cerns that these estimates are biased. In particula r, when an inferior serological reference test that shares the same risk of false-positives as the index test is used, the specificity could be overestimated. As expected, w e found that there were more false-positive results when comparing antibody tests to superior RNA-based refe rence tests, than to inferior serological reference tests; in fact, there were more false-positives than true-pos itives owing to the very low prevalence of HCV. Bia s correction of the specificity estimate could make t he difference even greater. This finding highlights a potential problem with using an inferior serological referenc e test as a confirmatory test (17;19) when screenin g the general population for HCV infection. Our assessmen t of the 'body of evidence' using GRADE methodology led us to focus on a single 'least biased' study (38), which reported the sensitivity of ELISA v3.0 compar ed to NAT as 81.8%, 95% CI (59.0%-100%), its specificity as 99.8 %, 95% (99.7%-99.8%), and its PPV as 13.8%, 95% CI (5.4- 22.2).

However, the populations of the studies included in that review (i.e., hemodial ysis patients, patients with histologically-verifie d hepatitis, patients hospitalized with suspected acute/chronic hepatitis, blood donors with persistently elevated liver enzymes, and blood donors who previously screened p ositive for HCV) did not reflect the general popula tion, therefore those findings are not directly comparabl e to ours (8;20). When the United States Preventive Services Task Force revised its recommendation on H CV screening in 2013, it did not re-assess HCV scre ening test accuracy, despite noassays (i.e., CLIA, ECLIA, CMIA, MEIA) since its 2004 systematic review (3). Similarly, when the WHO publ ished its HCV screening guideline in 2014 (41), it did not re-assess screening test accuracy, instead citing a 2001 report (42) on simple/rapid test accuracy and a 2002 report (43) on ELISA v3.0+ immunoassay accuracy, bo th involving blood panels not reflective of the gen eral population. Because antibody tests have not been ad equately evaluated for population-based HCV screen ing, and because the availability of a 'safe, valid, and reliable' screening test is a fundamental consider ation of any screening recommendation or program (10-12), this h ighlights a knowledge gap and brings into question the evidence basis for these recommendations. Our findings are limited by the paucity and the low quality of the available evidence published in Eng lish or French. In particular, we were unable to locate any studies of the accuracy of CLIA, CMIA, or MEIA (th e HCV screening tests most commonly used in Canada) as co mpared to RNA detection for HCV screening in the general population. The applicability of our findin gs to the general Canadian population is limited be cause a majority of included studies were conducted among b lood donors, and persons eligible to donate blood a re at lower risk of blood-borne infections like HCV than the general population. Rapid and point-of-care tes ts were beyond the scope of our review; whereas those tests are important for reaching some vulnerable populat ions, a majority of HCV testing in Canada is laboratory-b ased (18); also, a systematic review of the accurac y of rapid tests was recently published (44). In conclusion, the availability of a 'safe, valid, and reliable' screening test is a primordial consid eration for decision-making about screening (10-12), but our st udy has shown that further research is needed to adequately characterize the accuracy of antibody te sts used to screen the general population for HCV i nfection. Our study focused on the accuracy of HCV screening tests; however, several other important factors mus t be considered when making decisions about HCV screenin g, including: the benefits and harms of screening, the benefits and harms of treatment for screen-detected cases, the cost-effectiveness of screening, as wel l as Page 24 of 136 For Peer Review Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Confidential 10 patient preferences related to screening. A review of the evidence related to these considerations is beyond the scope of the present study, but such a review i s being performed by others in the context of the C anadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care's upcoming gui delines on HCV screening. To help inform decision-m aking about HCV screening, we encourage jurisdictions tha t have already adopted population-based (birth coho rt) screening for HCV to carefully evaluate and report on the accuracy of antibody tests, as well as scree ning benefits and harms.

METHODS Given that provincial and territorial (P/T) laborat ories would be expected to perform a majority of HC V testing (and nearly all HCV genotyping), I focused on HCV testing performed by the P/T laboratories. I first performed a grey literature search of all P/T laboratory websites, as well as websites from repu table HCV-related non-profit organization such as CATIE. Next, to supplement the grey literature search, I c ontacted each P/T laboratory by email and/or telephone and asked to speak to the person most dir ectly responsible for HCV testing. I asked the following 6 questions for each P/T laboratory: The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care ( CTFPHC) is currently working on a guideline re: screening for hepatitis C in primary care. To h elp with this process, we would like more information about how each of the provincial labs c onducts testing for hepatitis C. Could you please provide us with the following info rmation: 1) What is the initial test for hepatitis C used by yo ur laboratory (e.g., ELISA)? 2) What is the confirmatory test for hepatitis C used by your laboratory (e.g., PCR)? 3) Are other tests done routinely (other than viral lo ad)? 4) Is the confirmatory test applied to all specimens t hat are positive on the initial test automatically? 5) Is additional specimen collection required in order to apply the confirmatory test? 6) When is the ordering physician notified of the test result (i.e., after the initial test, or only after the confirmatory test)? For ambiguous answers, I obtained clarification by email or telephone as needed. Data collection for t his environmental scan took place from February 25 to M arch 2, 2016. RESULTS The grey literature search identified useful but po tentially outdated information about each province' s HCV testing on the CATIE website ( http://www.catie.ca/en/practical-guides/hepc-in- depth/testing/testing-your-region ). A search of individual P/T laboratory websites s imilarly identified some useful but potentially outdated information (T able 1). Information identified through the grey literature search was verified and supplemented by surveying each P/T laboratory (Table 1). Page 38 of 136 For Peer Review Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Confidential 2 Initial screening test 9 provinces and 1 territory performed the initial s creening test for HCV locally; 3 referred it to oth er P/T labs (NU, PE, YT). For the initial HCV screening te st, 6/10 laboratories used a CMIA (AB, MB, NB, NL, NS, ON), 3/10 used a CLIA (BC, NT, SK), and 1/10 used a n MEIA (QC). Confirmatory testing 9 provinces performed confirmatory testing for HCV locally; 4 referred it to other P/T laboratories (N T, NU, PE, YT). For the confirmatory HCV test, 6/9 lab oratories used an immunoassay (AB, ON, QC, SK), and 3/9 used PCR (NB, NL, NS). Testing sequence In all P/T laboratories, the confirmatory test is u sually performed on the same blood specimen as the initial test, provided that the specimen is suffici ent; the patient is not typically required to provi de an additional blood specimen for the confirmatory test to be applied. Some laboratories release the resul ts of the initial test to the ordering physician immed iately, whereas others wait until the confirmatory test result is available. DISCUSSION This rapid environmental scan revealed that a large majority of P/T laboratories use immunoassays for both their initial screening test and their confirm atory test for HCV. The initial screening tests for HCV included CMIA, CLIA, and MEIA; ELISA was not used b y any P/T laboratory as an initial screening test. Only a small minority of P/T laboratories use PCR a s their confirmatory test for HCV. A limitation of this study is that not all testing for HCV is done by the P/T laboratories; this study did not ascertain the tests used by non-P/T (typically, com mercial) laboratories. This study does not account for the use of 'rapid tests' (based on finger prick blo od) that may be conducted in some healthcare settin gs; however, in Canada, 'rapid tests' would typically b e used to reach high-risk and/or vulnerable populations, and not the general population targete d by the CTFPHC clinical practice guideline.
