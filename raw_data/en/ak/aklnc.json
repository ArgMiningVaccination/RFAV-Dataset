The business, which opened recently at 1176 Farmington Ave., offers an array of services - counseling, nutrition, therapy, yoga, Reiki energy healing - and welcomes people of all ages and with various symptoms and diagnoses. \"The idea is to bring to life all the treatment planning and work I've been doing with clients for the past 20 years,\" Mind, Body & Soul owner Melissa Kelly said. \"To reach your optimum mental health, you need to address issues with your mind, trauma, childhood, body, fitness and spirituality, whatever that means for you. My dream was to have a place where we could do that all in one place.\" A licensed marriage and family therapist, Kelly has been in practice since 2004. Before moving into its 2,000-plus square-foot Berlin location this fall, Mind, Body & Soul was located in a smaller space on the Silas Deane Highway. A mother of two, Kelly has lived in Berlin for 17 years. She founded Mind, Body & Soul in 2007 and has dedicated herself full-time to the enterprise since 2011. Kelly graduated from Eastern Connecticut State University with a degree in psychology and earned a master's in Marriage and Family Therapy from Central Connecticut State University. From there, she took a position at the Children's Home of Cromwell. \"I've wanted to do this since I was 19. I was in college, going through some stuff, and I was on the treadmill one day, and I had this moment. I was like, 'I need to have a strong mind, body, and soul to be healthy,'\" Kelly said. \"I really believe in this philosophy. And we all come from a nonjudgmental, really caring place, and we really want to help the community, and we want to be a place for healing, and I'm honored to help people and help them unburden themselves.\" Stacy King works alongside Kelly at Mind, Body & Soul, which celebrated its ribbon-cutting on Oct. 13. \"I call myself the real-life coach and strategist,\" King said. \"I want to help young girls, mostly girls, that maybe come from trauma or have low self-esteem or don't have the confidence that they need to go out and do things, or on the sports team. So I like those younger kids. But we're paid professional best friends; that's what a life coach is. And we're going to move you forward to whatever it is you need.\" The Mind, Body & Soul staff also includes marriage and family therapists Priyal Bomova and Nicole Tierney; counselor and yoga instructor Melissa Urrunaga; nutritionist and yoga instructor Ellissa Woods; and Caroline Johnson, a life coach and cancer advocate.
