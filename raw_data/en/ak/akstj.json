Effective treatments against COVID-19 remain urgently in need although vaccination significantly reduces the incidence, hospitalization, and mortality. At present, antiviral drugs including Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid <sup>TM</sup>), Remdesivir, and Molnupiravir have been authorized to treat COVID-19 and become more globally available. On the other hand, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for the treatment of epidemic diseases for a long history. Currently, various TCM formulae against COVID-19 such as Qingfei Paidu decoction, Xuanfei Baidu granule, Huashi Baidu granule, Jinhua Qinggan granule, Lianhua Qingwen capsule, and Xuebijing injection have been widely used in clinical practice in China, which may cause potential herb-drug interactions (HDIs) in patients under treatment with antiviral drugs and affect the efficacy and safety of medicines. However, information on potential HDIs between the above anti-COVID-19 drugs and TCM formulae is lacking, and thus this work seeks to summarize and highlight potential HDIs between antiviral drugs and TCM formulae against COVID-19, and especially pharmacokinetic HDIs mediated by metabolizing enzymes and/or transporters. These well-characterized HDIs could provide useful information on clinical concomitant medicine use to maximize clinical outcomes and minimize adverse and toxic effects. </p><p xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" id=\"d7542348e248\">Potential herbdrug interactions between traditional Chinese medicines and anti-COVID-19 drugs against COVID-19. <div class=\"fig panel\" id=\"undfig1\"> <a class=\"named-anchor\" id=\"undfig1\"> <!-- named anchor --> </a> <div class=\"figure-container so-text-align-c\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"figure\" src=\"/document_file/2d8effc3-4f0a-4fd0-8157-8d7939f9225e/PubMedCentral/image/ga1_lrg\"/> </div> <div class=\"panel-content\"/> </div> </p>", "sitename": "ScienceOpen", "date": "2023-06-05", "cleaned_text": "by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread worldwide.
