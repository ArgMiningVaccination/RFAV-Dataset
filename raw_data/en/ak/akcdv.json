An evidence-based and trauma-informed listening therapy, the SSP helps shift the nervous system to be more present and regulated while improving client capacity for connection and receptivity to other therapies. Regulates physical state so clients feel calmer and more present, improving receptivity to other therapies. Reduces stress and auditory sensitivity while enhancing social engagement and resilience. Applicable for children and adults with anxiety, ASD, ADHD, trauma history and other diagnoses. Access more useful resources [here](https://integratedlistening.com/resources-2/).
