While knowledge and skill are essential to success, resiliency is critical to coping with the immense demands of the profession while meeting the demands of everyday life. In a particularly timely and inspirational keynote address, modern-day renaissance man ronan Tynan will discuss resiliency through the lens of his own perseverance through numerous challenges, which he accomplished with enor- mous passion and determination. Introduced to international audiences as a member of the Irish Tenors, Tynan did not seriously consider formal voice study until age 33, while well into his residency as a physician. Born with a lower limb disability, Tynan learned how to ride horses and began competing in point-to-point races by 16. an auto accident at 20 led to amputation of his legs below the knee. Within a year, he was winning international track and field competitions; he represented Ireland in the 1984 and 1988 summer Paralympics, winning four gold medals, two silvers and one bronze. The determination instilled by his parents soon propelled Tynan to conquer a whole new field. he became the first disabled person ever admitted to the National College of Physical education and, later, became a full-fledged medical doctor specializing in orthopedic sports injuries, with a degree from prestigious Trinity College.

Hubbell DVM, MS, DACVAA Chief of Anesthesiology, Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital Professor Emeritus, Veterinary Clinical Sciences, The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine since dawn of the modern era of equine anesthesia and an- algesia in the 1960s, significant advances have been driven by the development of complex surgical procedures and advanced imaging modalities that require extended periods of general anesthesia. Despite the many advances, however, anesthesia of the horse remains more perilous than anesthe- sia of the other domestic species.During his lecture, acclaimed veterinary anesthesiologist Dr. John hubbell will trace the development of modern anesthetic methods, identify current best practices and areas of needed improvement, and postulate pathways for enhancing the safety of equine anesthesia in the future. Dr. hubbell received his veterinary degree in 1977 from Ohio state, where he served on faculty from 1982 until 2015, when he joined rood & riddle. he is author of numer- ous articles on veterinary anesthesia and co-author of two textbooks: Handbook of Veterinary Anesthesia and Equine Anesthesia Monitoring 7/30/20 1:38 PM8 AAEP | Las VegasMorning Early Riser Session Pre-Purchase Examinations: Ethical Dilemmas and Best Practices Moderator: Kenton Morgan Sponsored by Merck Animal Health.

The aaeP is working with host hotel Mandalay Bay (an MGM resorts property) and with conference partners to create a detailed plan for COVID-19 mitigation throughout all areas of the hotel and meeting space. Convention health and safety protocols will be updated frequently to reflect the most current recommendations. at a minimum, the aaeP will follow the safety guidance provided by MGM resorts and the state of Nevada. MGM resorts has implemented at all its properties a \" seven Point safety Plan,\" a multi-layered approach to guest health and safety developed with guidance from public health experts. Following is a synopsis of the plan; view the full plan at https://tinyurl.com/spspmgm.health and safety 1. Screening, Temperature Checks, & Employee Training extensive employee screening measures and training programs have been implemented. Medical and trained security personnel on staff will be able to assist should a guest develop symptoms on-site. 2. Mandatory Masks & Personal Protective Equipment Masks are required for all guests inside public spaces. employees are required to wear an approved mask while working. 3. Physical Distancing six-foot physical distancing policies have been implemented throughout, with floor guides to assist and remind guests. 4. Handwashing & Enhanced Sanitation Guests will have easy access to handwashing stations and hand sanitizer throughout. The amount of routine cleaning has been increased, with an emphasis on high-touch surfaces and common areas. 5. HVAC Controls & Air Quality rigorous measures have been taken to provide as much outside air circulation throughout buildings and guest rooms, with air filters that meet or exceed published standards. 6. Incident Response Protocols should a guest or employee test positive for the virus, protocols will be activated, and trained staff will respond quickly so that exposed areas are thoroughly sanitized. 7. Digital Innovations Technology has transitioned current processes into contactless options. Guests can complete the entire check-in process themselves and will no longer need to wait in line if they choose. a digital room key will be available via a mobile app for those who prefer not to use a traditional key card.

Eight healthy adult Standardbred horses had a full- thickness skin wound created using a custom made, 2 cm diameter circular punch on both sides of their neck under sedation and local anaesthesia. The wounds were left uncovered to heal by secondary intention. One wound per horse was randomly allocated to receive light-emitting diode (LED) treatment on Days 0 -4, 7-11, 14 -18 and 21 -25, with the wound on the opposite side of the neck acting as an untreated control. Treatment was conducted using a handheld device (BCD 650 Animal, Biolight AB) using a pre- set programme with a duration of 4 min and 40 s (red light was emitted for 95 s and NIR light for 185 s). The wounds were evaluated ultrasonographically for swelling and photographed daily. Wounds were considered to be healed when an epithelial layer covered the entire wound surface. None of the wounds showed clinical signs of infection over the study period. Wound area and degree of swelling did not differ between the treated and control groups on any day. There was a signi cant difference in healing time between control and treated wounds, with LED light-treated wounds taking longer to heal than control wounds. No positive effect of LEDs on experimental wound healing was found. Faecal sand clearance In this randomised, placebo-controlled, blinded clinical trial Diana Hassel and colleagues from Colorado State University evaluated the ef cacy of a product containing probiotics, prebiotics and psyllium in the clearance of colonic sand in horses with naturally acquired sand accumulation. Sand accumulation, determined by both auscultation and abdominal radiography, was identi ed in 10 horses. Changes in colonic sand content was quantitatively assessed in response to management changes combined with treatment with the probiotic/psyllium product or no treatment. Faecal sand output was monitored in both groups via sand sedimentation analysis of faecal samples every 3 days for 35 days and with pre- and post-treatment abdominal radiography. There was a signi cant reduction in sand accumulation in both treatment and control groups, but there were no signi cant differences between treatment and control groups in clearance of colonic sand as measured by both faecal sand sedimentation and quantitative radiography. Care of geriatric horses The aim of this study by Megan Ballou and colleagues in the USA was to understand the experience of caring for a geriatric horse with a chronic condition. An anonymous, online questionnaire was distributed to investigate the burden of caregivers from the perspective ofowners of geriatric horses. Traumatic events and veterinary care decisions were also explored. Findings from the study supported the hypothesis that owners of geriatric horses with a chronic condition experienced higher levels of physical and emotional care burden, regardless of the age of the geriatric horse. Attachment levels reported by the 1448 participants were high, regardless of the health status of the horse. A chronic condition in their horse was reported by 68.8% (n =996) of owners of geriatric horses. This study provides the equine practitioner with a greater understanding of the care burden experienced by owners of geriatric horses, particularly horses with a chronic condition, who rely on their veterinarian to guide their management and health care decisions. Veterinarians can help prepare and support clients as they navigate the complexities of caring for an older horse with a chronic condition. Cardiology This study by Lisse Vera and colleagues in Belgium investigated whether arterial wall stiffness increases with age in horses, as it does with humans. Cardiovascular ultrasound and non-invasive blood pressure measurement were performed simultaneously on 50 young (3 -7 years) and 50 old ( >18 years) healthy Warmblood horses. Arterial diameters, cross-sectional areas, and arterial wall thickness were measured. Arterial wall stiffness of the aorta and common carotid artery were assessed using pulse wave velocity. Lumen area/diameter change, strain, compliance, and distensibility were also calculated to assess local arterial wall stiffness. No difference in blood pressure was found between age groups. All systolic and diastolic arterial diameters and the thickness of the common carotid artery were signi cantly greater in the old horses. The aorta and caudal common carotid artery local arterial wall stiffness and pulse wave velocities were signi cantly higher in the old horses. Arterial stiffness and wall thickness increase with age in horses. Distal limb immobilisation This study, by Holly Stewart and colleagues at Colorado State University, described the effects of distal limb immobilisation and remobilisation in the equine metacarpophalangeal joint. One forelimb of each of eight healthy, skeletally mature horses was immobilised in a breglass cast for 8 weeks, followed by 12 weeks of treadmill-based training after the cast had been removed. Clinical examinations, radiography, computed tomography (CT), nuclear scintigraphy, MRI, and histomorphometry the third metacarpal bone (McIII), proximal phalanx, proximal sesamoid bones, and associated soft tissues in each horse. Serum and synovial fluid were collected for biomarker analyses. Distal limb immobilisation resulted in persistent lameness, effusion, and a decreased range of motion as well as radiographically visible fragments in the cast forelimb. Bone density was decreased in McIII according to CT, and trabecular bone fluid was increased according to MRI in the \u00a92020 EVJ Ltd394 forelimb. The cast forelimbs had a change in the appearance of the deep digital flexor tendon according to MRI immediately after removal of the cast. Numerous clinical, radiographic, CT, and MR abnormalities were visible at the end of the study period. The authors concluded that 8 weeks of cast immobilisation induced changes in bone, cartilage, and periarticular soft tissues that were not reversed after 12 weeks of remobilisation. Cast application should be used judiciously in horses with musculoskeletal injuries, balancing appropriate stabilisation with potential morbidity secondary to cast placement. New antifungal drugs for equine keratitis This study by Darby Roberts and colleagues at North Carolina State University determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of four fungal species isolated from horses with equine keratitis to previously untested azole, echinocandin, and carboxamide antifungal drugs. In vitro assays were performed to determine susceptibility of Aspergillus drugs three modes of action. Luliconazole exhibited increased growth inhibition against both Aspergillus and Fusarium compared to commonly used, standard antifungal drugs. MIC values for luliconazole at 0.001 -0.002 \u00b5g/mL were at least 25-fold lower than all other antifungal drugs tested, including voriconazole. The increased antifungal activity of luliconazole observed in this study warrants further investigation for its potential as an antifungal drug for equine fungal keratitis. Liver fluke infection In this study Aoife Quigley and colleagues in Ireland, Spain and the UK aimed to determine the susceptibility of horses to oral challenge infection with Fasciola hepatica metacercariae. The authors attempted an experimental infection of 10 horses with F. hepatica . Four were given 1000 metacercariae, four 500 metacercariae and two were sham-infected. Blood and faecal samples were taken at intervals up to 18 weeks post-infection. ELISA assays were used to assess sero- conversion in the experimental horses and also in a panel of sera from horses of known fluke status. No flukes were recovered from any of the livers, and no lesions that could be attributed to F. hepatica infection were observed. Coproantigen ELISA was negative throughout for all horses. Three antibody detection ELISAs, used to diagnose fasciolosis in other species, had limitations as diagnostic aids as determined using a panel of sera from horses of known F. hepatica infection status. Failure to establish infection after oral challenge raises fundamental questions on the pathophysiology and epidemiology of equine fasciolosis. Medial condylar fracture repair This study by Sophie Boorman and colleagues in the USA reports the performance of Thoroughbred racehorses aftersurgical repair of a medial condylar fracture of the third metacarpal/metatarsal bone. Forty-three horses surgically treated for medial condylar fractures, 30 with previous racing experience, 13 without previous racing experience (nonexperienced) were studied. Medical records were reviewed for signalment, radiographic fracture characteristics, repair technique, and post-operative morbidity and mortality. Each experienced horse was matched with two horses randomly selected from its most recent race to serve as healthy controls. Racing performance parameters (race rating, competitive level, speed rating, performance index) and career racing statistics were compared with multiple regression models between injured experienced horses and controls. The career racing statistics for nonexperienced horses were evaluated. Reasons for nonreturn to racing were obtained. The median duration of follow-up was 6 years (minimum 2, maximum 10). Twenty-one of 43 (49%) horses raced again including 18/30 (60%) experienced horses and 3/13 (23%) nonexperienced horses. Higher preoperative racing performance parameters were associated with return to racing. Experienced horses were ve times more likely to return to racing after medial condylar fracture repair, although their performance was generally lower than that of comparably uninjured horses. S.

J. ahead of 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / AUGUST Editorial Keeping on top of the literature Equine Veterinary Education 's mission is to provide clinically relevant information and practical educational articles to equine veterinary clinicians around the globe. Veterinary practitioners need constant access to the published literature and current concepts of equine diseases to aid their problem-solving and clinical decision-making processes, particularly with the increasing emphasis on evidence-based veterinary medicine. Unfortunately, there is no single, freely available source of all current information for equine veterinarians, and with the ever-increasing volume of clinical research, it is becoming more and more challenging for journals such as EVE to meet the needs of all of our readers, even in the relatively small elds of equine medicine and surgery. Of course there are many other equine clinical and research journals being published, and these are important sources of new information. However, apart from the open- access journals, much of the published research has limited availability to practitioners in the eld, who often have neither the time nor the ability to access multiple journals through personal or institutional libraries. Through EVE, we have therefore attempted to update practitioners with current, relevant research ndings and evidence through the publication of Review Articles, Critically Appraised Topics, Clinical Commentaries and Highlights of articles published in other journals. One of the major problems that our journal faces is the restriction on page numbers that we can regularly publish, and the resulting limits on the numbers and types of articles that can be accepted for publication. In 2018, we initiated a change in the way that the Case Reports are presented by publishing a one-page summary of the report in the print issue and having the full report available online. This change has allowed us to ease the backlog of Case Reports waitingin Early View to be published in print and has freed up space in the print issue to allow us to commission and publish more of the other article types. Despite some veterinary journals moving completely onto digital platforms, surveys of our readers have consistently indicated their desire to have EVE available in both online and printed versions. For the foreseeable future, therefore, we will continue to publish the journal both online and in print format. Despite the changes that we have initiated with the publication of Case Reports (which we still consider to be an important element of EVE 's mission), the pressure on space in the journal continues to mount. Whilst it is not our aim to be a primary research journal, Original Articles that contain novel information with direct clinical applicability to equine veterinarians are an appropriate and welcome component of the journal. In order to encourage the publication of these types of articles, whilst at the same time promoting the publication of other types of clinically relevant articles, we are now changing the way we publish Original Articles to a similar format to Case Reports - that is we will publish a one-page summary of the Original Article in the print version of the journal with the full manuscript published online. The one-page summary will include a structured abstract summarising the study aims, methodology and ndings, and an explanation of the clinical relevance of the ndings to equine practice.

Editorial From barn res to hurricanes: Helping animals in times of crisis My initial disaster response involved a two-barn re at a racetrack just 4 years into my career in 1974. When I arrived as the only veterinarian on the scene, the local re stations were heading in with sirens blaring as horsemen attempted to manage approximately 900 horses. Few horses were injured from the re but the onrush of a well-meaning re department led to serious injury of three frightened horses, two of which never raced again. My baptism into large-scale disasters occurred in 2005 with Hurricane Katrina, which was predicted to make landfall in west Houston and Galveston Island, Texas. Texas A&M University College of Veterinary Medicine 's Large Animal Hospital was selected to shelter/manage at-risk human evacuees. Despite being given just 48 h to prepare, we were able to move most hospitalised horses to other facilities. Dr P.K. Carlton and I were co-commanders in the Incident Command System (ICS) and, by the third day, we were thought to have received more human patients than any hospital in the country. We managed the rst 3 days with two MDs, one registered nurse, veterinary clinicians and technicians, students and local volunteers before the US Public Health Service arrived with over 100 professionals. My learning curve regarding the essential ICS had begun. Following that successful effort, our Large Animal Clinical Sciences Department began setting up and managing horse evacuations in subsequent disasters. This eventually led to creation of the Texas A&M University Veterinary Emergency Team (TAMU VET), which often responds with Texas Task Force I (search and rescue). My deployment with a small team from Texas A&M to Iraq in 2008 under military security to rebuild what had been an active agricultural entity further taught us how to perform daily amidst chaos. Ultimately, TAMU VET convinced the College of Veterinary Medicine to create a required 2-week rotation in emergency medicine and management. Our team has responded to scores of disasters since. My appreciation and concern for the complexity and difculty of providing veterinary care has been renewed and reinforced with each experience. However, the provision of reasonably immediate assessment and care is still inadequate. Clearly, addressing human concerns like providing needed services (power, water, food, shelter, medical care, etc.) is a priority; animal welfare is secondary. The AAEP and its charitable arm, recently rebranded as The Foundation for the Horse, have been helping such efforts since 2005. The Foundation, for example, provided the rstdonation for a medically equipped trailer for the TAMU VET in 2010 and, ever since, has been organising a system to contact jurisdictions in harm 's way for needs and resources. AAEP members should be proud of the Association 's past, present and future endeavours to help horses, other animals and devastated owners. Here is how you can help animals in future disasters: \u0081Acquire training and learn how to effectively get involved with local, regional, state and national efforts. The 2020 AAEP Convention will provide unique and essential training. Sign up ! \u0081Contact local emergency services regarding your interest in aiding in their individual plans to protect, save and return horses/animals to owners. Such engagement is overwhelmingly welcomed and accepted. \u0081Understand that emergency medicine is one animal at a time whereas disaster medicine/management can easily be multiple animals. Therefore, it is important to know triage based on multiple factors such as safe access to those injured; availability of useful resources (medical supplies, shelters, transport, etc.); personnel security; and access to supporting veterinarians and technicians. \u0081Encourage your respective College of Veterinary Medicine to include disaster medicine/management into its curriculum. \u0081Realise that every disaster begins locally -you are the only expert in managing animal injury. You know what resources exist in your community; thus, you are awesome. Being a rst responder is not always possible as one 's availability varies from day to day; however, knowing how such responses are constructed means that all of us can be involved. This might be as a responder, a resource provider, a place to stay for responders, a medical expert via cell phone, an expert on horse handling and transport, temporary shelter provider and nancial contributor -the list goes on as each disaster has its own needs. With training and understanding, we -the AAEP and the veterinary medical profession -can upscale our collective ability to help. W. MOYER Billings, Montana, USA Dr Moyer, 2011 AAEP president, lives in Billings, Mont. He retired from Texas A&M University College of Veterinary Medicine in 2015 after 22 years with the university. \u00a92020 EVJ Ltd397 post-partum mare due to two mesenteric avulsions Vilaregut* ,C 'Shea, Couto and M. Misheff Sharjah Arabian maiden mare gave birth after 365 days of gestation. Parturition was assisted due to ventro-sacral presentation of the foal. After delivery the mare was referred to the hospital due to eversion of the bladder, which was corrected without complication. Flunixin meglumine and trimethoprim sulfadimidine were administered to reduce inflammation and prevent infection. For the rst 24 h post- partum the mare was alert and vital signs were within normal limits. On the second day the heart rate and the haematocrit increased and the mare started to re flux. Transabdominal ultrasound revealed nonmotile small intestinal loops and an increased amount and echogenicity of the peritoneal fluid. Differential diagnoses at this time included haemoperitoneum due to arterial rupture, uroperitoneum due to bladder tear or peritonitis due to intestinal or uterine injury. Peritonitis was suspected but only con rmed on day 3 by abdominocentesis which yielded haemorrhagic peritoneal fluid (red blood cell count 5.76 91012/L) with an increased WBC count (1.9 9108/L, 85% neutrophils). Unremarkable bladder cystoscopy ruled out leakage from the traumatised bladder. Due to the lack of behavioural signs of colic, a uterine tear was considered likely. Hysteroscopy could not con rm the tear and medical treatment was attempted. The mare was placed on maintenance i.v. fluids supplemented with calcium gluconate, dimethyl sulfoxide and lidocaine CRI. The antibiotic therapy was changed from trimethoprim sulfadimidine to potassium penicillin and gentamicin. On the morning of the fourth day post-partum, in view of worsening clinical parameters, but in spite of continued absence of behavioural signs of colic, an exploratory laparotomy was performed. A 2-m segment of necrotic jejunum with avulsion of the corresponding mesentery that completely transected the mesenteric vessels was resected. The line of demarcation between normal and devitalised bowel was consistent with ischaemic necrosis and no evidence of a previous strangulation could be identi ed. A second mesenteric avulsion transecting the mesenteric resulting in a of necrotic jejunum, was located in the proximal jejunum adjacent to the duodenum ( Fig 1 ). Due to the distance of several metres from the larger avulsion, a second resection and hand sewn end-to-end jejunojejunostomy were performed. Unfortunately, the mare collapsed and died in recovery after several coordinated attempts to stand. In hindsight, this mare would have had a higher chance of survival if abdominocentesis and exploratory laparotomy had been undertaken earlier in thecourse of the treatment. Peritonitis in a post-partum mare is often associated with a uterine tear. However, as this case illustrates, this is not always the underlying cause. Hence, we present this report as a reminder of the important diagnostic value of exploratory laparotomy, and to highlight an unusual differential diagnosis of mesenteric avulsion of the jejunum in a post-partum mare. Key points \u0081Mesenteric avulsion should be considered in cases of post-partum peritonitis even when there are no behavioural signs of colic. \u0081Exploratory laparotomy as a diagnostic procedure is recommended sooner rather than later in cases of peritonitis of an unknown origin. Fig 1: Segmental ischaemic necrosis of a distal portion of the jejunum, which was separated from its mesentery by a tear to the latter. \u00a92019 EVJ closure of a caudally located bladder neck tear in a standing mare M. D. Hall* and D. H. Rodgerson Department of Large Animal Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia; and Hagyard Equine Medical Institute, Keywords: horse; surgery; urinary case report describes a minimally invasive transurethral approach to repair a caudally located, ventral tear in the neck of the bladder in a standing mare. The mare was diagnosed with a ruptured bladder 16 h post partum based on clinical signs, transabdominal ultrasonography, peritoneal fluid and serum biochemistry and cystoscopy. Surgery was performed 19 h after admission. The mare was restrained in standing stocks and sedated with detomidine as mL xylazine (100 mg/mL), 0.3 mL mepiva- caine hydrochloride (20 mg/mL) diluted to 9 mL with sterile water. Faeces were manually evacuated from the rectum and the mare 's tail was restrained dorsally using a rope. The vulva, perineal region and anus were prepared preoperatively with Iodine scrub solution (Betadine/C226). The operating surgeon was positioned behind the mare. A sterile disposable foil large animal vaginal speculum (Henry Schein/C226) was introduced into the urethra. A 10 mm diameter, 31 cm in length laparascope (Hopkins/C226forward-oblique telescope 30 \u00b0) was introduced through the vaginal speculum and each positioned such that the defect in the region of the neck of the bladder could be visualised ( Fig 1 ). A surgical assistant stood to the right and another to the left of the operating surgeon to aid in manipulation of the vaginal speculum and laparoscope. The operating surgeon introduced a Karl Storz Macro needle holder grasping a cutting needle with0 Polyglactin 910 (Vicryl/C226)(Fig 2 ). Beginning at the cranial aspect of the tear, the needle was passed through both wound edges and grasped with a second Karl Storz Macro needle holder. The needle was then passed through a small preformed loop in the opposite end of the suture. The edges of the wound were apposed in a cranial to caudal direction using 0 Polyglactin 910 (Vicryl/C226) in a simple continuous pattern. The Karl Storz Macro needle holders were removed and the wound closure evaluated. A 30 French Foley urinary catheter was placed transurethrally into the bladder immediately post- operatively. The surgical time was 30 min and no complications were encountered. The mare has shown no signs of urine pooling, urine dribbling or cystitis since the operation. She is alive at the time of submission (130 days post-operatively). Key points \u0081Advantages of this technique include the avoidance of general anaesthesia, the absence of any incision into the peritoneal cavity, and excellent surgical access to bladder tears which may otherwise have been challenging to reach. \u0081For lesions in the caudal area of the bladder, this standing transurethral technique provides a viable surgical approach with excellent visualisation and accessibility in mares.

Fig 2: Karl Storz Macro needle holder grasping a cutting needle with 0 910 Report Trans-nasal endoscopic treatment of equine disease 14 clinical Bode /C19a/C20ckov Equine Clinic, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical was used in four horses diagnosed with primary sinusitis and 10 horses with dental sinusitis. Pre-existing (n =5) or surgically created (n =9) sinonasal stulae were used as portals for trans-nasal endoscopic and lavage of the in flamed sinus cavities. Necrotic purulent material adjacent to ( Fig 1 ) was debrided under endoscopic control to make them patent for the endoscope. Surgical endoscopic sinonasal stulation ( Fig 2 ) was performed using either a trans-endoscopic diode laser bre (four cases) or an electrocautery instrument under endoscopic control ( ve cases). All procedures were performed on standing sedated horses with the use of local anaesthesia. In six cases, the ventral concha was fenestrated in order to enter the sinus. Intwo access the caudal group of the paranasal sinuses. One case required fenestration the ventral conchal bulla due to its empyema. Post-operative bleeding was controlled with a nasal cavity tamponade for 24 h. Endoscopic lavage of the in flamed sinuses (via the working channel of the endoscope or using a separate rigid lavage catheter) was performed every 2 -3d a y s .M e d i c a l treatment consisted of antibiotic and anti-in flammatory drugs. In cases of dental sinusitis, the underlying dental pathology was addressed. Median hospitalisation time was 10 days (range 5 - 25 days) and the median number of endoscopic procedures (including the initial procedure) was 4 (range 3 -7). Cases were followed up by telephone consultations with the owners. Median follow-up time was 9.5 months (range 4 -22 months). A complete resolution of clinical signs was reported in 7/10 cases of dental sinusitis ( ve with surgically created and two with pre-existing sinonasal stulae); a clinical improvement (occasional nonpurulent nasal discharge) was reported in two cases with pre-existing sinonasal stulae. Complete resolution of clinical signs was observed in 3/4 cases of primary sinusitis (all had surgically created stulae). Two cases (one primary and one dental sinusitis) showed recurrence of the purulent nasal discharge. Recurrence of the primary sinusitis was caused by inspissated purulent exudate in the ventral conchal sinus, which was not noticed during the initial treatment of the caudal sinus group empyema. In the second case, recurrence was caused by inaccessible dental fragments in the rostral maxillary sinus with severely hyperplastic mucosal lining. Both cases underwent trephination of the affected sinuses and made a full recovery after removal of the remaining pathological sinus content. Key points \u0081Trans-nasal endoscopic paranasal sinus treatment using sinonasal stulae can be successfully used in selected cases of primary and dental sinusitis. \u0081Effective surgical endoscopic sinonasal stulation requires correct assessment of location, extent and character of the in flammatory process and adequate space in the nasal cavities. \u0081Effect of the trans-nasal endoscopic treatment is limited in cases of sinus disease with masses growing inside the sinus cavity; in cases showing severe chronic mucosal hyperplasia inside the sinus and in cases with severely distorted anatomy of nasal and paranasal cavities -presence of these factors makes sinusotomy preferable over the trans-nasal endoscopic approach.

Zenni, C. E. Camargo and P. V. Michelotto* Department of Animal Science, School of Life Sciences, Pontif /C19cia Universidade Cat /C19olica Summary Four horses in the city of Curitiba located in the Paran /C19a state of southern Brazil were examined for a history of chronic coughing. Case 1 was a male Thoroughbred yearling. Case 2 was a 10-year-old Appaloosa mare. Case 3 was another Appaloosa horse, a 20-year-old gelding and Case 4 was a 5- year-old male Crioulo horse. All animals had free access to the native pasture and had a history of persistent coughing of several months duration. The animals also had a fetid nasal discharge and exercise intolerance. They were examined by different practitioners and had a history of treatment with antibiotics and anti-in flammatory drugs that did not resolve the clinical signs.Airway endoscopic examinations were performed under sedation complemented with administration tracheobronchial diluted in saline (1:4). The endoscope was introduced into the right bronchus, and in each case a branch of Araucaria angustifolia was identi ed near the third to fth division bronchi ( Fig 1 ). Treatment involved retrieval of the A. angustifolia branches from the airways to resolve the in flammation and infection. However, different results were obtained using wire polypectomy loops and biopsy forceps that were passed through the endoscope 's working channel. In Case 1, only a part of the pine branch could be removed, while in Case 2, there were two unsuccessful attempts, prior to the horse being lost to follow-up. In Case 3, the branch was removed in two segments, with a total length of 30 cm. The animal was treated with penicillin (20,000 IU/kg bwt s.i.d. i.m.) and metronidazole (20 mg/kg bwt b.i.d. per os) for 10 days. After one year, the horse is clinically well and being used for pleasure rides, as before. In Case 4, the pine branch was surrounded by thick pus, and was rmly lodged in the bronchus. This resulted in numerous unsuccessful attempts at removal of the branch during the 1- year period. It was decided to keep the horse resting under pasture management; however, occasional coughing persisted. We suggest that other cases of aspiration of foreign bodies, caused by similar plant types in the tracheobronchial region of horses might be overlooked. Successful treatment necessitated more than one extraction attempt, and the use of appropriate equipment. However, the A. angustifolia branch can adhere to swollen mucosa, which can make the extraction dif cult. Key points \u0081Foreign bodies must be included in the differential diagnoses of horses presenting with recurrent chronic cough and malodorous breath. Endoscopic examination must be performed distal to the tracheal bifurcation after instilling topical anaesthesia. \u0081The extraction of A. angustifolia branches is especially difcult due to their shape, which adheres them to the mucosa and creates resistance for their exit from the bronchus. \u0081Surgical access provides a possible treatment option, but it is in fluenced by the bronchial location, that is, the distance from the branch to the site of the tracheotomy. Moreover, it depends on the availability of suitable equipment and trained professionals. a) b) Fig 1: Bronchoscopic examination of horses. a) Carina region of a 5-year-old male Crioulo horse showing severe local in flammation; b) The foreign body in the same horse, as shown in 1a, distal to carina A. the laparoscopic approach for removal of cystic intra-abdominal testicles in the standing colt. A 3-year-old Tobiano and a 2-year-old Warmblood colt were referred for abdominal cryptorchidectomy. The horses were clinically and ultrasonographically examined and a presumptive diagnosis of unilateral abdominal cryptorchidism was made. A laparoscopic approach via the flank was used to localise each abdominal testicle ( Fig 1 ). In both colts the abdominal testicle was enlarged and cystic ( Fig 2 ). Each spermatic cord was ligated and fluid was aspirated from the testicle. By reducing the size of the mass minimally invasive removal through an enlarged instrumental portal was possible. Histopathology revealed a cysti c rete testis in the Tobiano and a teratoma in the Warmblood. Enlarged abdominal testicles can complicate routine castration, certainly when performed by conventional surgery. Laparoscopy offers the chance to localise the abdominal testicle and when the testicle is abnormal in size it can be physically reduced by aspiration of fluid in the case of a cystic lesion, using a morcellator in case ofrm tissue or simply removed via an enlarged incision. In these cases the cystic enlarged testicles were nonpainful and were incidental ndings. A cystic testicle might be developmental (Tobiano case) or arise due to neoplastic transformation (Warmblood case). The laparoscopic approach for enlarged cyst-like testicles in the standing horse offers a secure minimally invasive method for removal. Key points \u0081The laparoscopic approach for enlarged cystic testicles in the standing horse offers a secure minimally invasive method for removal. \u0081An abnormally sized testicle (developmental or pathological) itself might be the primary cause of the cryptorchism. \u0081A cystic testicle might be developmental or arise due to neoplastic transformation ( Figs 1 and 2). a) b) Fig 2: Macroscopic view of the retrieved mass. a) Warmblood horse. b) Tobiano horse.

Coomer Cotts Equine Hospital, Pembrokeshire, Wales, UK Corresponding author email: richcoomer@hotmail.com In the accompanying paper, Rijkenhuizen and co-workers (2020) describe the presentation and subsequent successful laparoscopic surgical castration of two unusual abdominal cryptorchid horses. Both horses had hormonally active unilateral enlarged cystic intra-abdominal testicles. Their article raises important discussion points with regards to occurrence and technique when dealing with enlarged abdominal testicles and teratomas in horses. Abdominally retained testicles are infertile due to the higher temperatures, inhibiting the development of seminiferous tubules and hence limiting spermatogenesis (Bergin et al. 1970). It is generally accepted that abdominal testes are infertile, though spermatozoa can sometimes be identi ed (Hobday 1914). The testicular tissue in the Tobiano horse was inactive, but it is unclear whether it was possible to differentiate temperature- and pressure-related atrophy. In the other horse a cystic teratoma was present, with no grossly visible testicular tissue. The features of this horse follow a common pattern seen in monorchid horses, whereby most other secondary structures form normally, vis- /C18a-vis vaginal process, ductus deferens, epididymis, proper ligament, testicular vessels (e.g. 1952; Parks et al. 1989; Santschi et al. 1989; Strong et al. 1997; Brommer et al. 2011). It supports the theory that two gonads always form embryologically with subsequent loss or aberrant development occurring to the testis. The previous hemicastration of the Warmblood teratoma horse warrants attention (Rijkenhuizen et al. 2020). The fallacious myth that castration of the descended testis in a cryptorchid horse would aid the descent of the missing testicle has no evidence to support it (Cox 1987). It probably gained traction from pony populations af flicted by delayed testicular descent, where the delayed gonad 'appeared 'a few years after the previous one was removed, as it would have done anyway. A hormonal basis for testicular descent has been shown in man (Hagberg and Westphal 1982), leading to the recommendation for medication with hCG to stimulate descent in cryptorchid colts (Brendemuehl 2006). This may have some merit for inguinal retention and delayed descent, but the vaginal rings contract within the rst few weeks, reducing the likelihood of descent of an abdominal testis (Bergin et al. 1970). A pathologically enlarged testicle would be even less likely to be able to pass the inguinal rings. Unilateral castration of a descended testicle in a cryptorchid horse could allow hormonally entire males to be mis-sold as geldings. For this reason, it could be legally construed as fraud and doing so a potential offence (Cox 1987). As well as the negative effects on the welfare of the horse, it may also increase the cost and morbidity of subsequent castration (Marshall et al. 2007), though more recent ultrasonographic methods offset this by allowing location to be determined before surgery (Schambourg et al. 2006; Coomer et al. 2016). When castrating a cryptorchid horse, the missing testicle should be removed rst and if this is not possible, thedescended testicle should be left in place regardless. Cryptorchid horses undergoing hemicastration should not occur. The authors of the accompanying article successfully removed comparatively large structures through small incisions by rst decompressing the cystic cavities via needle aspiration. This technique has been around for a while, for example Hickes (1905) aspirated 39 fluid ounces (1.15 L) from a cystic abdominal testicle to facilitate its removal. The horse described by Rijkenhuizen et al. (2020) had close similarities with that described by Cribb and Bour /C19e (2010), which also contained low viscosity liquid and was removed during standing laparoscopy. In managing decompression in this way, these authors were somewhat lucky in nding themselves presented with a liquid amenable to needle aspiration. Teratomas come in many forms and may be composed of any or all three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm and only skin, whilst dermoid cysts contain in addition, hair follicles, hair, sweat glands and their accumulated secretions. Other teratomas contain bone and cartilage ( Fig 1a,b, Supplementary item 1 ) (Cox 1987). Teratomas in both mares and stallions are frequently cystic but because many are dermoid cysts, the contents may be of a viscous oily consistency and/or contain hair. Decompressing such cysts directly into the abdomen by tearing them open to allow the contents to drain into the peritoneum before removal was once practiced routinely with no ill effects (Hobday 1914). I recall one occasion when such a cyst wall tore during traction of what appeared, from pre-operative workup, to have been a moderately enlarged ovarian granulosa cell tumour. Liberal quantities of dark brown oily tenacious liquid admixed with hair spilled throughout the layers of the laparotomy incision ( Fig 2 ). After lavage, no adverse effects occurred. Interested readers are directed to the beautifully illustrated descriptions of different types of testicular teratoma contained in Hobday (1914). Removing enlarged retained testicles is not as well referenced as ovaries in horses, probably because they are encountered less frequently. The use of retrieval bags (e.g. Lloyd et al. 2007; Bont et al. 2010; Cribb and Bour /C19e 2010) prevents seeding of the laparotomy surgical site, or abdomen, with tumour cells. This is a small problem because most are benign. A more tangible bene t to bags is that they provide a convenient way to provide traction without the need for hands that can slip or grasping instruments that can tear ( Fig 3 ). Physical maceration may also be carried out inside the bag to further ease removal (Bont et al. 2010). Morcellators may reduce morbidity further by allowing removal via incisions no larger than the original laparoscopy ports (Kummer et al. 2010; Lund et al. 2014). It may be dif cult to avoid peritoneal contamination if using a morcellator on a large cystic teratoma, or 10.1111/eve.13047sometimes occur, with Dr Beeker of Cologne describing one such measuring 79 cm by 69 cm and weighing 45 kg (Hobday 1914). The teratoma depicted in Figure 4 contained predominantly bone, weighing 22 kg and measuring 50 cm in diameter. The progressive in flammation, adhesions and damage caused by such a heavy mass eventually caused acute colic that proved inoperable. a) b) Fig 2: The contents of teratomas are frequently ill-suited to needle aspiration. The ovarian teratoma shown here was predominantly dermoid cyst (a). It ruptured during passage of the abdominal wall, spilling liberal quantities of brown viscous hairy fluid (b) throughout the laparotomy wound. No ill effects occurred for the horse.

Carbon dioxide is preferred over oxygen, nitrous oxide and room air thanks to not supporting combustion and its rapid blood solubility allowing clearance through the lungs (Safran and Orlando 1994). Peritoneal acidosis induced by CO 2absorption also causes mild inflammatory peritonitis (Latimer et al. 2003) that may be associated with increased early post-operative pain. In a 2013 Cochrane review (Cheng et al. 2013) post-operative pain scores were higher in elective human laparoscopy patients undergoing insuf flation with carbon dioxide compared to nitrous oxide. Many surgeons including the author do not use it routinely in standing horses for laparoscopy (e.g. Lloyd et al. 2007; Lund et al. 2014). With adequate starvation to reduce gut ll, the potential space achieved by passive aspiration of room air gives good visibility and working area, whilst the use of modern vessel sealing devices minimises the risk of combustion. The need for a'sterile operating medium ', as opposed to passive room air with its attendant dust particles, may be a concern for some, but carbon dioxide is made industrially and various studieshave shown it to be a source of bacteria and other undesirable contaminants. Using a lter method, Ott (1997) cultured multiple strains of bacteria including: Staphylococcus spp. from 12 of counting insuf flators, inward and outward connectors and tubing, whilst similar results were obtained by Couper et al. (1997) who also found metallic dust in 100% of the 10 insuf flators they tested. Frankel et al. (1998) was unable to replicate these results but were unable to conclude whether their negative results were because their lters failed to trap contaminants, or whether none were present to start. Whether or not there is a clinically relevant difference between the contamination obtained by passive air aspiration from a regular operating room, versus a commercial gas tank and insuf flator, is debatable. Having the means to supply positive pressure insuf flation with carbon dioxide is a wise precaution in case of limited working space. Routinely using it in standing horses is not a necessity. The accompanying article illustrates well the need for quick thinking and improvisation of surgical technique, even when rigorous workup regimes are followed. Although testicular teratomas are rare, with suf cient volume they occur with regularity and little warning. Having a technique available to remove an abdominal cryptorchid testicle much larger than its descended counterpart should be available. The potential for viscous or solid contents ill-suited to needle aspiration or morcellation should be anticipated. Author 's declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

D. Hall* and D. H. Rodgerson Hagyard Equine Three Thoroughbred mares ranging in age from 5 to 9 years, that had undergone previous colopexy following surgical correction of a large colon volvulus, presented for colic signs unresponsive to medical management. Exploratory laparotomy was elected and a midline celiotomy was performed in the caudal aspect of the ventral abdomen in each mare, due to the fact that a colopexy had been performed previously. Examination of the cranial abdomen revealed the large colon was not adhered to the ventral body wall, indicating dehiscence of the previous colopexy. Further examination of the abdomen in each mare revealed a 360- degree large colon volvulus. The previous colopexy site appeared as a linear haemorrhagic area of brosis in one mare ( Figs 1 and 2 ) and a pale area of brosis in two other mares. The large colon volvulus was corrected and a second colopexy was then performed at the same site and using the same technique as the rst colopexy -by incorporating 10 - 12 cm of the lateral free band of the left ventral colon into the midline linea alba closure using number 3 polyglactin 910 (Vicryl/C226). In this technique, the colopexy is placed in the cranial 10-15 cm of the incision, at a site on the lateral free band of the left ventral colon at least 40 cm from the Caecocolic ligament. The remainder of the linea alba incision is closed using the same suture pattern but without incorporating the tenia from the colon. The skin is then closed in a routine fashion.The time elapsed between the rst and second colopexy in each mare was 48, 1496 and 616 days. The mares each recovered uneventfully from anaesthesia and were discharged 2 -10 days later. Two of the mares are still alive at the time of manuscript submission, 593 and 907 days post-operatively. The third mare survived 4 years post- operatively, following which she was lost to follow-up. Data available from our clinic indicate an incidence rate of 0.79% for colopexy dehiscence followed by a repeat episode of large colon volvulus. This phenomenon should be considered as a differential diagnosis when a mare that previously underwent a colopexy presents with severe signs of colic. Key points \u0081If a colopexy has been performed previously by incorporating the left ventral colon into the midline linea alba closure, any future midline celiotomy should be performed in the caudal aspect of the ventral abdomen. \u0081In each case, the second colopexy was performed in the same location on the lateral free band of the left ventral colon as the rst colopexy. \u0081Colopexy dehiscence followed by large colon volvulus should be considered as a differential diagnosis when a mare that previously underwent a colopexy presents with severe signs of colic.

Gardner Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA *Corresponding author techniques vary according to surgeon preference and there is no clear evidence of the superiority of any one technique. Complications secondary to colopexy are varied, but dehiscence of the colopexy site is rare, with less than 1% of horses reported to have a repeat large colon volvulus after dehiscence of the colopexy. Considerations of how and when to perform a surgical xation of the colon to the body wall include position of the colon, length of the colopexy, and suture material and pattern. Little evidence exists regarding best practice outside of experimental studies and retrospective studies of Thoroughbred broodmares. Therefore, more work must be done to standardise a colopexy technique to apply to a broad spectrum of horses suffering from large colon volvulus and displacement. Several methods of colopexy have been described in the literature, including incorporation of the lateral free band of the colon in the ventral midline or left paramedian celiotomy closure, and left paramedian colopexy not incorporated into the celiotomy incision. Complications arising directly from colopexy include catastrophic rupture of the colon, enterocutaneous stula, dehiscence of the colopexy without accompanying rupture of colon, and incisional hernia. In their recent publication, Hall and Rodgerson (2020) describe the complication of colopexy dehiscence with subsequent large colon volvulus and also provide an estimate of the overall risk of this complication in a population of Thoroughbred broodmares. This complication risk appears to be quite low, with less than 1% of horses reported to have a repeat large colon volvulus after dehiscence of the colopexy. However, there may be opportunities to optimise or standardise the colopexy technique to minimise complications and promote adhesion of the colon to the body wall. Hall and Rodgerson point out the likely factors that may contribute to colopexy dehiscence, including insuf cient incorporation of the body wall, shallow suture bites of lateral band of the ventral colon, intestinal compromise and excessive weight of the colon. Whether to perform a colopexy and how to perform a colopexy have typically been questions of surgeon 's preference within a framework of common-sense guidelines. There are several technical and biomechanical factors to consider if a 'standard 'colopexy technique were to be promoted. For example, does the position of the colopexy matter? Does the length of colopexy matter? Is the choice of suture material or suture pattern important? Based on the available literature, the post-volvulus broodmare has been the most likely candidate for colopexy; however, there may also be considerations speci c to the sport horse whendecision-making after surgical correction of a large colon volvulus or displacement. After some initial poor outcomes with experimental colopexy, there have been a number of successful techniques reported. Hance and Embertson (1992) described a technique of colopexy of both the right and left ventral colons to right and left body walls, respectively. This technique involved elevation of the body wall with suture placement at an angle to the internal rectus bres to help prevent suture pullout. They reported a 4.5% rate of colon rupture (2/44) and a 6.8% rate of colopexy dehiscence (3/44), with two horses having recurrence of large colon volvulus or displacement. The authors described a modi cation of the colopexy technique, in which they abandoned the right colopexy and incorporated the external and internal rectus fascia in the left colopexy. The authors stated that the 'modi cations to the colopexy technique used on mares subsequent to this study have seemingly prevented dehiscence of a colopexy site ' (Hance and Embertson 1992). The left paramedian colopexy was recently described in a larger number of cases, with the technique of making an initial left paramedian celiotomy approach and incorporating the lateral free band of the ventral colon in part of the closure of the celiotomy (Broyles et al. 2018). There were no instances of colopexy dehiscence speci cally described in any of the 156 Thoroughbred broodmares in this retrospective report, although they reported recurrence of large colon volvulus or displacement in 1.2% of cases and recurrent colic in 17%. Incorporation of the lateral free band of the ventral colon in the ventral midline celiotomy closure was initially reported by Hunt and Spirito (1995), and this same technique was used in the cases reported by Hall and Rodgerson (2020). The position (midline vs. left paramedian) and length (10 cm vs. 20 cm) of the colopexy differ, and although the outcomes appear to be positive with either technique, the biomechanics of the position and length of the colopexy are unknown. Experimental colopexy constructs demonstrated that manual creation of a twist at the base of the colon was possible with a short colonic adhesion (8 cm) but not possible with a long adhesion (35 cm) (Markel et al. 1988a). Despite this experimental evidence, there have not been clinical cases of large colon volvulus at the base reported with an intact, short (10-15 cm) colopexy. The authors of the accompanying case series point out potential disadvantages of incorporating the colopexy in the ventral midline celiotomy closure. Weakness in the closure could lead to incisional hernia or incisional dehiscence. However, the incision in the body wall may promote adhesion at the colopexy site, much in the way that the incisional gastropexy technique in dogs has been successful. The canine gastropexy technique involves an incision in the \u00a92019 EVJ doi: 10.1111/eve.13066seromuscular layer of the stomach and an incision through the peritoneum and transversus abdominus muscle. The incisions are then sutured together. An incision in the seromuscular layer of the equine colon appears to be unnecessary and would likely be risky in a compromised colon. Based on the success of laparoscopic colopexy in horses, in which the peritoneum is not incised, a body wall or peritoneal incision is not crucial to the success of the colopexy adhesion, although we are not aware of any clinical retrospective studies of laparoscopic colopexy (Trostle et al. 1998). The authors of this commentary do not routinely make a body wall incision or dissection of the subcutaneous space in their left paramedian colopexy procedures ( Fig 1 ), which has not resulted in any instances of dehiscence, to our knowledge. This procedure has led to mature adhesions con rmed on necropsy in cases subjected to euthanasia for reasons unrelated to colopexy dehiscence ( Fig 2 ). A variety of suture materials and suture patterns have been described for equine colopexy. An experimental colopexy technique using surgical gut suture did not result in long-term adhesions between the right and left colons, whereas the technique using polypropylene suture resulted in colopexy adhesions that remained at one year (Markel et al. 1986). Polypropylene suture was also used in the report by Hance and Embertson (1992), and nylon suture has beendescribed for use in laparoscopic colopexy, mainly due to the needle size which allows penetration through the body wall (Trostle et al. 1998; Wilson 2012). The use of braided absorbable suture (polyglycolic acid and polyglactin 910) has been described more recently with the technique of incorporating the lateral free band in the celiotomy incision closure (Hunt and Spirito 1995; Broyles et al. 2018). Absorbable and nonabsorbable suture been reported for bovine omentopexy (Fubini et al. 1992; Baird et al. 2017). Incorporation of the visceral wall in the surgical xation appears to mitigate risk of future left displaced abomasum (LDA) in cattle, with recurrence of LDA in 14% of cows with omentopexies versus 0% of cows with pyloro-omentopexies (Baird et al. 2017). To the authors 'knowledge, catastrophic incisional dehiscence of the celiotomy incision has not been reported with colopexy at either ventral midline or left paramedian sites. This lack of body wall failure may lend support to the theory that the most common cause of colopexy dehiscence is failure at the seromuscular layer of the colon, similar to the mode of failure of gastropexies in dogs. Ex vivo biomechanical analysis of gastropexy techniques has been performed in canine cadavers (Imhoff et al. 2015; Culp et al. 2016). The primary mode of failure with axial tension to failure was gastric seromuscular tissue tearing at the gastropexy site. Pilot data from our laboratory demonstrated that failure of an equine ex vivo colopexy construct occurred most commonly with pull-though at the colonic band, which lends support to the recommendation for adequate bites of the lateral band (Fig 3 ). The effect of suture pattern and needle/suture size on colopexy strength has not been evaluated but may play a role in the strength of the colopexy and quality of the adhesion. Based on the large retrospective studies out of central Kentucky, a colopexy technique incorporating the ventral midline or left paramedian celiotomy incision is an effective prevention of large colon volvulus and displacement in Thoroughbred broodmares. There is limited information about outcomes in sport horses. Authors of retrospective studies of diverse populations of horses with large colon volvulus propose large colon resection to prevent future volvulus (Driscoll et al. 2008; Pezzanite and Hackett 2017), a procedure more technically dif cult and requiring a lengthier surgical time than colopexy. A case report by Markel et al. (1988b) documents three horses that returned to athletic work after colopexy surgery without complications, and show horses having received colopexy at the authors 'institution are currently in athletic work. Further work must be done to evaluate what restrictions, if any, should be safely recommended for return to performance following colopexy. An additional factor in the decision to perform colopexy versus resection is the duration of volvulus and severity of compromise to the colon, with colon resection preferred for compromised colons. Horses with frequent, chronic colic referable to the large colon may also bene t from large colon resection, although colic episodes have also been reported after large colon resection (Driscoll et al. 2008; Pezzanite and Hackett 2017). Current published data are not suf cient to recommend a standardised colopexy technique. The authors in the accompanying case series chose to repeat the colopexy procedure in horses with repeat colon volvulus after dehiscence, with successful outcomes. The authors could Fig 1: Interrupted horizontal mattress colopexy performed with elevation of left body wall. Fig 2: Post-mortem image of colon to body wall adhesions 24 months after colopexy. \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd409 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / AUGUST have chosen colon resection or a different colopexy technique, but incorporation of the colon into the ventral midline is almost certainly the fastest technique. Randomised clinical trials to compare colopexy techniques would be challenging due to surgeon preference, individual case considerations, and limited large colon volvulus cases at many hospitals. However, biomechanical analysis and retrospective data on colopexy in larger populations of non- broodmare horses would be valuable contributions to decision-making in equine large colon volvulus cases.Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Bauck*, A. S. Graham, A. Smith, H. J. Rappand D. E. Freeman Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA; andTier\u20acarztliche Praxis the clinical signs, pathological ndings and outcome in four horses with mesenteric strangulation by pedunculated lipomas. In each case, there was no intestinal strangulation. These horses were presented with no speci c preoperative evidence of intestinal obstruction or a strangulating lesion other than degree of pain (no nasogastric re flux, no dilated loops of intestine on rectal examination/ultrasound). The small intestinal mesentery was involved in three horses and the small colon mesentery in the fourth horse but the associated intestine was not strangulated, haemorrhagic, nor obviously obstructed in any horse. In all horses, a patch of haemorrhagic mesentery of variable size was evident around the origin of a mesentericlipoma and a major mesenteric vessel ( Fig 1 ). One horse was subjected to euthanasia for nancial reasons and the remaining three had surgery from which they made a complete recovery after removal of the lipoma. Intestinal resection was not performed in any of the three horses undergoing surgery, although a mesenteric defect had to be closed in the small colon mesentery. Traction on the mesenteric vessels as they were drawn into the mesenteric strangulation by the lipoma caused pain and mesenteric haemorrhage. The equine small intestine and small colon both have extensive collateral circulation so that arcuate blood vessels from major mesenteric branches outside the strangulated region could provide adequate blood flow to the intestine. Furthermore, the thick-walled arteries could remain patent and continue to perfuse the intestinal segment during this process so that intestinal viability was preserved. In the three cases that underwent surgery, the excellent post-operative outcome indicated that resection is not required in cases of mesenteric strangulation. Key points \u0081This report describes management of an unusual but important form of colic caused by strangulation of the mesentery by a pedunculated lipoma, without intestinal strangulation. \u0081Surgical treatment involved removal of the lipoma and repair of any mesenteric defects, but not resection of the intestines. \u0081In the three horses that underwent surgery, all survived to discharge with no episodes of post-operative colic or re flux.

Kilcoyne and J. Nieto* Department of Surgical and Radiological Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California at Davis, Davis, California, USA *Corresponding author smooth walled and encapsulated fat tumours that are formed by a hyperplastic growth of adipocytes originating from the mesenteric tissues of the small intestine and small colon in older horses (Archer 2007). Lipomas can occur as solitary masses, or alternatively multiple tumours can be found in the same horse. The small intestine has been reported to be involved in 89% and approximately 10% are associated with the small colon (Garcia-Seco et al. 2005). These lesions may be discovered as an incidental nding at laparotomy or at necropsy examination, but often are implicated as a cause of colic due to their propensity to develop on a stalk associated with the intestinal mesentery of the small intestine or small colon. Strangulation of intestinal segments occurs when the stalk wraps around a segment of bowel resulting in luminal and vascular occlusion ( Fig 1 ). Why some lipomas tend to lie dormant and some lead to severe intestinal incidents is not completely known or understood. Additionally, the length of the intestine that becomes entrapped by the lipoma can vary extensively. Factors such as the weight of the lipoma, length of the stalk and potential motility of the associated intestine could all be implicated (Edwards and Proudman 1994). Occasionally lipomas are found to be calci ed or necrotic ( Fig 2 ). Intestinal strangulation by a mesenteric lipoma is a commonly encountered surgical lesion and it has been reported that pedunculated lipomas are responsible for up to 30% of all small intestinal strangulating lesions requiring surgery (Garcia-Seco et al. 2005). Lipomas are more commonly reported in older horses, with horses >15 years at increased risk (Edwards and Proudman 1994; Freeman and Schaeffer 2001; Garcia-Seco et al. 2005; Archer 2007). Garcia-Seco et al. (2005) reported a signi cant predisposition for Saddlebreds and Arabians to present with strangulating lipomas compared to other breeds. Other studies have reported Quarter Horses, Arabians, Morgans and ponies to be predisposed (Dart et al. 1992; Edwards and Proudman 1994). In the literature, it would appear that castrated males are over-represented compared to females or intact stallions (Blikslager et al. 1992; Garcia-Seco et al. 2005). It has been shown in small animals that neutering predisposes both dogs and cats to obesity and that this effect is due to behavioural changes such as reduced activity and increased food intake (Nguyen et al. 2004; German 2010). It is possible that a similar effect is seen in castrated male horses and it has been previously speculated that increased body weight may be a risk factor for the development of pedunculated lipomas (Edwards and Proudman 1994) in horses; however, to date this has not been con rmed. A recent study (Newkirk et al. 2014) looking at pituitary lesions, obesity and mesentericlipomas in insulin resistant horses did have signi cantly more lipomas and higher lipoma area compared to insulin sensitive horses, although there was no correlation between body condition score (BCS) and lipoma frequency or total lipoma area. It is interesting to note that similar breed predispositions (Arabians, Saddlebred, Morgan and pony breeds) are afliated with equine metabolic syndrome (Frank et al. 2010) and those presenting with lipomas. Although intestinal strangulation is the most common surgical consequence of a pedunculated lipoma, the case report by Bauck et al. (2020) in this issue describes another manifestation of how a lipoma can induce colic. In the four cases (all greater than 20 years of age) described in this report, the mesentery appeared to have been strangulated by a lipoma, with the associated intestinal segment Fig 1: Strangulating lipoma of the distal jejunum resulting in vascular and of a of jejunum. \u00a92019 doi: 10.1111/eve.13070unaffected. All three cases that underwent surgery had a good outcome without the necessity of requiring a resection and anastomosis of the associated intestinal segment, which would indicate that although there was variable venous occlusion, the mesenteric arterial supply was patent to maintain perfusion and intestinal viability. The authors speculated that the small intestine supplied by the affected mesentery could also have had suf cient collateral circulation from adjacent vessels. Although an exact manner by which the lipoma had injured the mesentery could not be determined, suf cient damage to the affected mesentery and mesenteric vessels resulted in venous occlusion and/or congestion similar to that seen with mesenteric haematomas (Van Hoogmoed and Snyder 1996). Van Hoogmoed and Snyder (1996) described acute small intestinal injury associated with haematomas in the mesentery of four horses. In two of these horses, haematomas in the mesentery were secondary to tears that disrupted the integrity of the mesenteric vessels; the result of a pedunculated lipoma in one horse and as a complication of parturition in the other horse. In the other two horses, the predisposing cause of the mesenteric haematomas causing ischaemic necrosis of the small intestine could not be identi ed. All horses in this case series had evidence of intestinal ischaemia associated with the mesenteric haematomas necessitating resection.Other unusual manifestations of lipomas include a case report (Verwilghen et al. 2013) that describes a very large (41 kg) mesenteric lipoma as a cause of recurrent colic in one horse. The author speculated the broad and short mesenteric base found in the massive lipoma was less likely to create strangulation as typically seen with pedunculated lipomas. However, due to the weight and size of the mass, partial occlusion of the adjacent intestine by compression or tension, was hypothesised to be the cause of recurrent colic. Other forms of adipocyte accumulation causing colic, such as lipomatosis (Archer 2007) have also been described. Lipomatosis, in contrast to lipoma, is a nonencapsulated benign form of fat accumulation that is not limited by tissue planes (Archer 2007). Histologically it appears benign but can cause massive tissue in ltration. Two cases of lipomatosis have been reported to cause recurrent colic in horses (Henry and Yamini 1995; Riley et al. 2007). One report (Riley et al. 2007) described a case of colonic lipomatosis that resulted in simple nonstrangulating obstruction of the small colon and a previous report (Henry and Yamini 1995) was the rst to describe in ltrative lipomatosis which led to the development of colic in a horse due to compromise of the muscular and neural structures of the colonic wall. An additional case of atypical diffuse in ltrative lipomatosis of the mesojejunum was reported in a mare that had experienced episodes of recurrent colic (Linnenkohl et al. 2013). In conclusion, intestinal strangulation by a mesenteric lipoma remains the most common cause of colic due to fatty accumulations in the abdomen, particularly in older horses. However, readers should be aware that other manifestations, such as mesenteric strangulation, as described in the current case report, chronic colic due to larger lipomas or lipomatosis can also be implicated and should be considered as potential causes of colic.

E. O 'Grady Virginia Therapeutic Farriery, Virginia, wooden shoe provides the clinician with an alternative option to conventional farriery when treating a variety of foot problems such as acute/chronic laminitis, white line disease, distal phalanx fractures and poor-quality hoof capsules. The wooden shoe provides a simpli ed method to apply many of the principles of therapeutic farriery which include redistributing the load or forces on the foot, repositioning breakover and providing heel elevation when necessary. Understanding the biomechanics of the wooden shoe along with understanding good basic farriery which include the appropriate foot trim, proper size, t and placement of the wooden shoe on the foot combined with the appropriate application are essential for consistent success. This paper outlines what is considered to be the proper application of the wooden shoe. Introduction There are many practical farriery options available to the clinician when an alternative to a horseshoe may be necessary or preferred. The wooden shoe has become a simple, practical and very effective farriery option for treating not only chronic laminitis but a variety of other foot problems (Steward 2003; O 'Grady et al. 2007; O 'Grady and Parks 2008; O'Grady Steward 2009; and O 'Grady 2009, 2015; O'Grady 2010, 2011) ( Fig 1 ). Among those problems that may bene t from the wooden shoe are acute/chronic laminitis, extensive white line disease, fractures of the distal phalanx/navicular bone and horses that have feet with thin deformable soles. The wooden shoe should only be used as a transitional device to stabilise the hoof capsule, promote hoof wall growth at the coronet and increase sole depth. Once the structures of the hoof capsule have improved with sufcient mass to achieve stability and realignment of the distal phalanx within the hoof capsule in the case of chronic laminitis, conventional farriery is used or the horse can be left barefoot. The wooden shoe is simple to apply but, as with any procedure, there is a learning curve such that it is essential to follow a procedural model. Understanding the biomechanics of the wooden shoe coupled with understanding good basic farriery which include the appropriate foot trim, proper size, t and placement of the wooden shoe on the foot along with its proper application are essential. It must be stated from the onset, that the application of the wooden shoe must be combined with the appropriate foot trim for the clinician to achieve consistent effective results from this modality. Chronic laminitis is the disease most often treated with the wooden shoe, so its use here will be stressed when describing the overall procedure.Advantages The wooden shoe has all the mechanical aspects that can be incorporated in other farriery systems previously described yet it may possess some additional advantages over previous methods. A major advantage of the wooden shoe, coupled with the trim, is its ability to redistribute the load (weight) evenly over a speci ed section of the foot due to its flat solid construction (O 'Grady and Steward 2009; Parks and O 'Grady 2009; O 'Grady 2010, 2011). Silastic material added to the solar surface of the foot further increases the surface area of the foot enhancing the effects of placing one flat surface against another (Parks and O 'Grady 2015). Another advantage is its nontraumatic application that eliminates the necessity to use local anaesthesia in the case of chronic laminitis or other painful foot problems (O 'Grady and Steward 2009; Parks and O 'Grady 2015). The wooden shoe is constructed from readily accessible materials (wood) or can be purchased commercially.1Breakover and heel elevation can be fabricated into the shoe and the beveled perimeter of the shoe decreases the torque on the lamellae at breakover by moving the ground reaction force axially. The beveled perimeter of the shoe also appears to concentrate the load (weight) under the distal phalanx due to the solid base of the shoe. Heel elevation, when necessary, can be applied in a uniform manner by altering the shape of the wooden shoe or by attaching a degree pad to the foot surface of the shoe. The shoe can be easily adjusted using radiographic guidelines and the biomechanical or structural requirements of the individual foot conformation. Mechanism The wooden shoe addresses three of the principles used in applying therapeutic farriery. The rst is to redistribute the load (weight of the horse) or unload the forces on a section of the ground surface of the foot. Secondly, to reposition breakover and lastly, to provide heel elevation when necessary to decrease the tension in the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) (O 'Grady 2006, 2011; Parks 2011, 2012; Parks and O 'Grady 2015). These three principles are especially relevant when treating chronic laminitis. To understand these principles, it is necessary to brie fly consider foot biomechanics and the moments about the distal interphalangeal joint (Eliashar 2007; Parks 2011, 2012; Parks and O 'Grady 2015). In a standing horse, the weight of the horse borne by the limb exerts a force on the ground which is opposed by an equal and opposite force, the ground reaction force (GRF). The GRF acts on any point of the foot touching the ground. The summation of these forces can be calculated to have a central point of action which is termed the centre of pressure \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd415 doi: 10.1111/eve.13031(COP). The position of the centre of pressure varies depending on foot conformation and trimming but will be located dorsal to the centre of rotation (COR) of the distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ). The GRF being dorsal to the COR creates a moment about the distal interphalangeal joint termed the extensor moment. The extensor moment must be opposed by an equal and opposite moment, which is termed the flexor moment. A moment is the product of a force and its distance from a reference point to cause a body to rotate about an axis which in this case, is the centre of rotation of the distal interphalangeal joint. At rest, the extensor moment is the product of the weight borne by the limb (a force) and the horizontal distance from the point at which the ground reaction force acts on the foot (COP) and the centre of rotation of the distal interphalangeal joint. The flexor moment opposes the extensor moment and is the product of the force (tension) in the tendon and the shortest distance of the DDFT from the centre of rotation ( Fig 2a ). The GRF determines the subsequent compressive and tensile stresses that are placed on the dorsal section of the foot. If a horse is standing on its limb, the weight of the horse acts on the foot through the COR and is relatively constant, but the position of the GRF where it acts on the ground surface of the foot can be shifted away from the affected area or redistributed. At breakover, the flexor moment begins to exceed the extensor moment such that the GRF moves dorsally to the toe at which point the heels lift off the ground (Fig 2b ). As the COP moves dorsally, it places greater force at the toe; a force that can potentially be disruptive. The thickness of the wooden shoe allows breakover to be placed in the shoe further palmarly than conventional shoes. Thisreduces the extensor moment arm, brings the GRF closer to the centre of rotation and reduces tension in the DDFT (Fig 3a ). This concept of changing the point of breakover can be clearly demonstrated by creating a bevel in two pieces of wood that are of different thickness ( Fig 3b ). Furthermore, the bevel created around the perimeter of the wooden shoe will reduce the moment which decreases the force required to breakover in a medial or lateral direction with less stress on the tissues ( Fig 4 ). Finally, combined with the appropriate trim and impression material placed in the frog sulci, one rm flat surface (the foot) is created and now placed against the wooden shoe; the distribution of force becomes larger and more uniform because weight bearing is widely distributed across the palmar section of the foot. Construction of the shoe The author prefers wood due to its accessibility, light weight, the ease with which it can be constructed/shaped (both before and after application), malleability and its ability to dissipate energy at impact while remaining rigid (Reid 1994). There are shoes available commercially that have an ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) pad substituted for the thicker \u00beinch section of plywood that is beveled. EVA is an extremely elastic material that can be sintered to form a porous material similar to rubber yet has resilience. The compressibility of this material distributes the load across the surface of the foot, however, it does wear and compress unevenly relative to the load placed on the limb causing the angle and the forces on the foot to change. Although more time consuming, the author prefers to use wood which can a) b) Extensor MomentFlexor Moment Fig 2: a) The biomechanical forces exerted on the foot and the moments about the DIPJ. b) The GRF moving dorsally in the toe during mid-stance and breakover (Image courtesy of Andrew Parks). a) b) Fig 1: a) Ground surface and b) side view of the wooden shoe.

The wooden shoe can be constructed using any steel or aluminum shoewith a broad toe that is available in sizes 00 -5 as a template.2 The basic shoe is made from two pieces of plywood. One piece of plywood is 6.3 -9.5 mm (1/4 -3/8 in) thick (depending on the thickness of the shoe required) and the second piece is 19 mm (3/4 in) thick. Using the aluminum shoe as a template, the thinner piece of plywood is cut out with a vertical border while the thicker piece is cut out with the border straight or beveled at a 30-degree angle across the palmar or heel section and a 45-degree angle around the perimeter of the block using an angle saw3(Fig 5a ). The straight or decreased angle across the palmar section of the shoe prevents rocking backwards during landing. The two pieces of plywood are glued together with the thinner portion proximal and then two 1-inch drywall screws or wood screws are inserted on the ground surface of the shoe for additional security. A wood rasp or belt sander is used to blend the cut angles into a uniform smooth slope. Plywood can also be purchased in a solid 45 mm (1.8 in) thickness which eliminates the necessity to cut two pieces. Alternatively, the wooden shoe is available commercially and can be easily modi ed with a belt sander or a hoof rasp to match the wooden shoe that was described above3(Fig 5b ). Shoe height is dictated by the conformation of the hoof and the amount of displacement of the distal phalanx present, that is, the greater the rotation of the distal phalanx, the more shoe height is necessary in order to achieve the appropriate palmar placement of breakover. If the sole is prolapsed or the distal phalanx has penetrated the sole, a recess can be created in the dorsal foot surface of the shoe by cutting a half moon shape in the thinner piece of plywood using a router or a hand grinder to create a trough a) b) Fig 3: a) The extensor moment about the DIPJ can be moved further palmarly in a wooden shoe when compared with a conventional horseshoe (Image courtesy of Andrew Parks). b) This Illustrates how the tilt (breakover) can be increased when a bevel is created in two pieces of wood of different thicknesses. Note the increased breakover in the thicker block.

Black line istheCOR that correlates thewidest part EDUCATION / AE / AUGUST Orthopaedic felt or impression material is placed across the bulbs of the heels and 2-inch casting tape5is applied around the perimeter of the foot forming an attachment between the hoof wall, screws and wooden shoe. The casting tape provides circumferential stability that when attached to the screws not only adds security but may decrease flaring of the hoof wall during weight bearing that appears to pull the sole distally (Thomason 2007; O 'Grady 2010; Parks and O 'Grady 2015). Following application of the wooden shoes, horses are allowed brief periods of controlled exercise according to their comfort level. The exercise can be in the form of hand walking or turn out in a small paddock. Horses are radiographed at 4 -5 weeks to assess improvement of the soft tissue structures and the wooden shoes left in place until the desired results are achieved, reset if necessary or transferred to conventional shoes ( Fig 11 ). Unilateral displacement of the distal phalanx Unilateral displacement of the distal phalanx in a mediolateral direction commonly occurs because of overloading one side of the foot or from laminitis. Unilateral displacement can occur in two clinical scenarios. The rst context is less recognised where one side of the foot is overloaded and the distal phalanx descends. Here, the limb conformation of the horse leads to an asymmetric landing which causes disproportionate loading on one side of the foot. Hoof characteristics would include an offset foot, a sheared heel, compressed growth rings and decreased growth at the coronet above the displaced heel ( Fig 12a ). In the second scenario, the horse will have clinical signs of laminitis, radiographic evidence of not only displacement or rotation in the dorsal section of the foot but also unilateral displacement of the distal phalanx as noted on the DP radiographic view. The hoof wall on the displaced side of the foot will be thickened compared with the contralateral side due to the diseased lamellae (Sherlock and Parks 2013; Parks and O 'Grady 2015) ( Fig 12b ). Based on the apparent asymmetry of the distal phalanx within the hoof capsule visible on radiographs, a clinician 'srst response might intuitively be to try and restore the asymmetry of the distal interphalangeal joint and the position of the distal phalanx in relation to the ground. This would most readily be accomplished by raising the side of the hoof on which the distal phalanx is displaced. However, this practice will increase the weight bearing on the affected side and causethe distal phalanx to displace further in relation to the hoof capsule, along with increased discomfort. Horses with unilateral displacement show an increased distance between the distal phalanx and the hoof wall on the affected side which indicates weight bearing by the wall on the displaced side would have increased leverage on the hoof capsule, thus potentially shifting the centre of pressure towards the affected side. Theoretically, the hoof capsule can be stabilised in relation to the distal phalanx by increasing weight bearing on the contralateral side and reducing weight bearing on the affected side. Biomechanically, the weight of the horse is opposed by the GRF which is exerted on the foot at every point of contact. The GRF acts on the foot through the COP, therefore, changing the placement of the shoe should effectively change the centre of pressure. The COP is important because it determines the distribution of stresses within the hoof; therefore, changing the position of the wooden shoe will cause an asymmetrical redistribution of pressure on the ground surface of the foot that will change the COP (Fig 13a ). The author has been successful in controlling mediolateral displacement by setting the wooden shoe wide on the unaffected side (O 'Grady et al. 2007; O 'Grady 2010; Parks and O 'Grady 2015). The foot is trimmed as described above making sure the hoof wall and frog are on the same plane and that either the lateral or medial hoof wall is not lowered more than the other. Any signi cant flare on the affected side of the foot is reduced with a rasp from the outer hoof wall and impression material is placed in the palmar section of the foot to make it load sharing. The wooden shoe is tted to the foot such that it is flush or tight on the affected side and then forms a 6.3 -9.5 mm (1/4 -3/8-in) extension beyond the perimeter of the wall on the unaffected side of the foot (O'Grady et al. 2007; O 'Grady 2010; Parks and O 'Grady 2015) ( Fig 13b ). Conclusions The wooden shoe provides an alternative farriery option when treating a variety of foot problems. Treating many of these foot problems is subjective due to the variations in each case such as chronicity, instability, integrity of the structures of the hoof capsule and hoof conformation.

The magnitude ofthe bevel ofthe wooden shoe decreases the stress onthe entire circumference ofthe lamellae and soft tissues atbreakover, aneffect which is often difcult toproduce with traditional shoes. Cutting the perimeter ofthewooden shoe angle orbevel shoe, combined with theimpression material inthepalmar section ofthefoot, allows load sharing across theground surface of thefoot which further decreases theload borne bythedorsal hoof wall. This concept ofload sharing isvery helpful ina horse with compromised foot conformation that has limited viable hoof structures inagiven section ofthe foot. Furthermore, therapeutic shoes are often decient in providing sufcient breakover and heel elevation due tothephysical limits oftheparticular shoe, whereas increasing the height thedesired biomechanics tobefabricated into theshoe. effective farriery option fortreating a variety ofconditions. Given that the principles behind the application ofany shoeing technique are more important than thetechnique itself, clearly there ismore than one way toaccomplish many oftheintended goals.

The study is a retrospective case series which included 29 equids (28 horses and one donkey). Medical records of cases diagnosed with FB obstruction of the large or small colon between the years 2004 and 2016 that underwent surgery were reviewed. Data regarding signalment, clinical signs, surgical ndings and post-operative variables were recorded. Short- (survival to hospital discharge) and long- (1 year after surgery) term survival rates were obtained. Cases had a mean age of 4.2 years, with both females and Arabian horses being overrepresented. Abdominal distention was the most common observation on presentation and the FB could be palpated in 20% of the cases during rectal examination. The most common reason to go into surgery was severe pain with abdominal distention. Signi cantly more FBs were found in the small colon during surgery (P<0.0001) and most were removed by small colon enterotomy. Complications rate post-operatively was relatively high (41%) with fever and diarrhoea being most common. Twenty-three cases (79%) were released from the hospital and all cases that were available for long-term follow-up were alive and returned to previous activity. No correlation between the chosen method of surgical removal of the FB and survival or complications post-operatively was noted. These data re flect favourable prognosis for surgical removal of colonic FBs. Few techniques are available to improve the safety of removal and the preferred method depends on the FB location, appearance and mobility. As FB obstruction resembles 'noncomplicated 'colonic impaction, it is essential to try and recognise FB cases since deterioration can be rapid and surgery is the only suf cient treatment. Introduction Small colon impaction is the most common disorder of the small colon in horses, accounting for 34 -78% of all cases of small colon disease (Dart et al. 1992; Rhoads et al. 1999; de Bont et al. 2013). Most small colon impactions consist of feed material, however foreign body (FB) ingestion can also cause small colon impaction and may include nylon bres, hay nets, twine, plastic material, cotton bres and even metal (Boles and Kohn 1977; 1979; de Oliveira Dearo et al. 2009). Theingestion occurs most commonly in young horses probably because they are less discriminatory in their eating habits (Dart et al. 1992; Schumacher and Mair 2002), however it may also occur in adult horses kept under unsanitary conditions (de Oliveira Dearo et al. 2009). Once ingested by the horse, the foreign object serves as a nidus for deposition of mineral elements over it, which increases its size. As a result, an irregular intestinal concretion is formed, often containing projections which can generate intestinal wall pressure necrosis (Edwards 1997; Schumacher and Mair 2002). Affected horses typically remain unresponsive to medical treatment. Surgical intervention is therefore recom- mended prior to initiation of irreversible intestinal damage (Schumacher and Mair 2002; Pierce 2009). During surgery, the FB can be manipulated using fluid distention to move it to a safe area where enterotomy can be performed (Pierce 2009). If the obstructed segment cannot be exteriorised, an alternative approach, such as a paramedian celiotomy, can be performed to facilitate safe removal of the obstruction (de Oliveira Dearo et al. 2009). In some cases, a FB trapped in the small colon can be removed by a high enema and external massage of the intestine to break up the surrounding obstruction and evacuate it through the rectum (Pierce 2009). Resection and anastomosis of the small colon may be indicated in severe cases where the obstruction has resulted in intestinal necrosis, provided the segment of intestine can be exteriorised (Schumacher and Mair 2002; Pierce 2009). There are few descriptions of the clinical presentation, short- and long-term prognosis due to the low frequency with which these cases have been recognised in horses. Short- term prognosis for FB obstruction mentioned in the literature varies considerably and ranges from 0% to 100% (Boles and Kohn 1984; de Oliveira Dearo et al. 2009). Previous publications have described relatively low case numbers, thereby making data interpretation more challenging. The largest case series was reported by Boles and Kohn (1977) presenting 10 cases with a success rate of 50%. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical presentation, surgical ndings, complications and outcome of a case series of small and large colon obstruction by FBs in equids. We hypothesised that surgical management of colonic FBs would be associated with good short- and long-term survival rates. \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd424 doi: 10.1111/eve.13036Materials and methods Case selection Medical records from January 2004 to December 2016 from the Koret School of Veterinary Medicine were searched for cases which were diagnosed with FB obstruction of the large or small colon. Equids were included in the study if a denitive diagnosis of FB was made during exploratory laparotomy or necropsy. Keywords used during the search included colic, foreign body and twine. Medical records review Data obtained from the records included age, breed, sex, pregnancy status, duration of colic prior to admission and season of the year when the horse was admitted. Season was de ned as follows: autumn (September -November), winter (December -February), spring (March -May) and summer (June -August). Additional information obtained included physical examination ndings, haematological biochemical analysis, nasogastric intubation and rectal palpation ndings. Data regarding surgery included the interval from admission to surgery, location of the FB (large or small colon), composition of the FB, surgery technique used to remove the FB, additional pathologies identi ed in surgery, performance of a pelvic flexure enterotomy, duration of surgery and the surgeon performing the surgery. Additionally, information regarding post-operative complications, hospitalisation time and outcome was obtained. Outcome Short-term survival was de ned as survival to the time of discharge and long-term survival was de ned as alive 1 year after surgery. Long-term follow-up was obtained by telephone interview with the owner. Procedure Intravenous fluid therapy was initiated before surgical preparation and was continued during surgery. Flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg bwt, (6.6 mg/kg bwt, i.v.) were given before surgery. The surgical approach in the vast majority of the cases was a standard ventral midline incision under general anaesthesia, however, one case was operated under standing sedation through the left flank. Horses were sedated with xylazine bwt, i.v.) and diazepam (0.05 i.v.) and maintained with iso flurane in 100% oxygen. The horse operated under standing sedation was restrained in stocks and sedated with a constant rate infusion of 10 mg of butorphanol tartrate and 10 mg of detomidine HCl in 1 L isotonic saline solution. The rate of infusion was varied according to the horse 's responses to the surgical stimuli. In addition, local anaesthesia using 2% lidocaine applied as a line block was administered at the intended incision site for the horse treated under sedation. The techniques employed to facilitate removal of the FB depended on the location of the obstruction. For FBs lodged within the small colon, in areas that could be exteriorised, removal was achieved by means of: 1) high enema combined with external massage to break the impactionaround the FB and evacuate it via the anus; 2) enterotomy through the antimesenteric taenia. Closure of the enterotomy site was performed using 2-0 polydioxanone in a full thickness simple continuous pattern, followed by a Cushing continuous pattern. 3) small colon resection and anastomosis of the damaged segment including the FB. Anastomosis was performed using closed, one-stage, stapled, functional, end- to-end resection and anastomosis as described previously (Anderson et al. 2012). Foreign bodies located in the large colon or oral small colon were removed using one of the following techniques: 1) fluid distention using high enema or pelvic flexure enterotomy to manipulate the FB so it could be extracted through a pelvic flexure enterotomy; 2) Enterotomy at the location of the FB. The latter was performed in cases where the FB was adhered to the mucosa and fluid distention failed to allow manipulation of the foreign body, or when the FB was too large to evacuate via a pelvic flexure enterotomy. Closure of enterotomy sites was achieved by suturing the wall of the intestine in two layers as described earlier. Prior to performing small colon or large colon enterotomy (excluding the pelvic flexure), the planned enterotomy site was isolated from the abdomen using saline-soaked sterile laparotomy sponges and a nylon drape was sutured around the incision site using a size 3-0 polydioxanone suture material ( Fig 1 ). Data analysis Statistical analyses were performed by using analytic computerised software- CI; proportions, etc., as applicable) were calculated for all relevant parameters. Comparison was done between survivors and nonsurvivors, and between horses with FB in the small colon and the large colon. Fisher exact test was used to compare proportional data, whereas continuous data were analysed with nonparametric tests; either Wilcoxon rank sum test (for two categories) or with Kruskal-Wallis One-Way ANOVA (for 3 categories). Differences were considered signi cant at a value of P 0.05. Fig 1: The enterotomy site chosen to remove the foreign body (excluding the pelvic flexure) was isolated from the abdomen and a nylon drape was sutured around the incision site using a / AE / AUGUST Results Twenty-nine cases (24 females, one gelding and four intact males) met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. Females were overrepresented compared to the surgical colic population in the hospital in which females represent 66% (P =0.003). Nine mares were pregnant at the time of presentation, with a mean pregnancy duration of 7.6 months. The study population had a mean age of 4.2 years (median, 4 years; range, 4 months to 12 years). The predominant breed was Arabian (n =22), followed by Quarter Horses (n =2), mixed breed (n =2) and one each of Paint Pony, Tennessee Walking Horse and a donkey. Arabians were overrepresented in the current study compared to the surgical colic population in which the Arabians represent 39% (P<0.001). The age distribution for the study population reflected that for horses undergoing colic surgery at the hospital. Mean time between onset of clinical signs of colic and admission was 1.8 days (median, 1 day; range, 2 h - 10 days). Most animals (n =20) were admitted to the hospital with less than 48 h of colic signs. No signi cant difference was seen regarding season of referral which distributed as follows: Winter -eight cases, Spring -eight cases, Summer -ve cases and Autumn -eight cases. Seventeen horses had a mention in the medical les regarding manure passage during the colic episode prior to referral and the majority of them had not passed any faeces (n =12) or passed a very small amount of hard faecal balls (n =5). Seven horses were housed in a small paddock or at pasture and were given free access to hay, six horses were housed solely in a stall with measured amounts of feed and the remaining horses had unknown housing and feeding habits due to missing data. Only two horses had known access to foreign material in the diet (baling twine). On physical examination, most cases were tachycardic (mean, 62 beats/min; range, 40 -96 beats/min) and afebrile (mean, 37.7 \u00b0C; range, 37 -39.2\u00b0C), however, six horses exhibited temperatures outside of the normal parameters, with those temperatures ranging from 38.5 to 39.2 \u00b0C. Mucous membranes were discoloured in 13 cases, of which 10 cases had hyperaemic mucous membranes. Abdominal distention was present in 27 cases, of which 22 were subjectively considered to suffer from moderate-severe distention. On rectal palpation, 17 cases were diagnosed with a large colon distention, two horses were diagnosed with a large colon impaction and two cases did not undergo a rectal examination. The FB was felt in only six cases and in three horses no abnormalities were recognised during rectal palpation. Nasogastric intubation yielded gastric re flux in 11 cases with a mean re flux volume on arrival of 1.5 L (range 0 -7 L). Twenty-two cases underwent exploratory celiotomy on the day of admission. The reasons to go to surgery were as follows -insuf cient response to medical treatment for at least 12 h hospitalisation (n =9), severe pain on arrival combined with moderate or severe abdominal distention (n=13), severe pain on arrival with signs of endotoxaemia (hyperaemic mucous membranes with or without a heart rate >60 beats/min, temperature >38.5\u00b0C) (n=5). Two cases were referred for surgery after intensive treatment at home for more than 2 days without success. Overall, 33 FBs were discovered during surgery and found to be the cause for the colic. In surgery, 25 cases had asingle FB which was found in the small colon (n =15), transverse colon (n =9) or right dorsal colon (n =1). Four cases were found to have two FBs located in both the small and large colons. Foreign bodies were signi cantly more common in the small colon in comparison to the large colon (P<0.0001). There was no signi cant difference between cases suffering from a FB in the small colon compared with the large colon regarding the signalment, clinical signs, laboratory ndings, post-operative complications and survival. In all the cases where the obstruction site of the FB was visible, the serosa appeared hyperaemic and oedematous to varying degrees. Removal of the FBs was accomplished mainly by small colon enterotomy (n =14), followed by pelvic flexure resection and anastomosis (n =1). The FBs consisted predominantly of pieces of twine in 22 cases (P <0.0001). Fragments of nylon were seen in six cases and a hair pin was found in one horse. In 27 cases, the FB was embedded in an irregular, soft, partially mineralised mass surrounded with faecal material (Fig 2 ). Two horses had FBs which had undergone a uniform hardening with mineral deposition, which gave the FBs the appearance and texture of an irregular enterolith ( Fig 3 ). Additional ndings during surgery included large colon impaction (n =14) and right dorsal displacement of the large colon (n =1). Pelvic flexure enterotomy was performed in 27 horses as a means to remove the FB or evacuate the large colon. Mean surgical time was 199 min (median: 180 min, range: 120 - 320 min). Time of surgery did not differ signi cantly between the different techniques used to remove the FBs. Two mares were subjected to euthanasia during surgery. One was euthanised due to gross contamination of the abdomen during attempts to remove the FB from the aboral right dorsal colon. The second mare was subjected to euthanasia during surgery due to severe and extensive damage to the small colon as a result of the FB. Post-operatively, horses were continued with i.v. fluid therapy for a mean duration of 2.5 days. Penicillin G sodium (22,000 U/kg bwt, i.v., every 6 h) and gentamicin (6.6 mg/ kg bwt, i.v., once a day) were given for a mean duration of Fig 2: Representative image of the foreign body found in most cases.

Additionally, 17 horses received metronidazole (15 mg/kg bwt, orally, every 8 h), 14 horses were treated with polymyxin B (6000 U/kg bwt, i.v., twice a day), 12 horses were treated with low-molecular weight heparin (0.3 mg/kg bwt, subcutaneously, once a day) and 10 horses were administered 2 L of fresh frozen plasma. Cryotherapy for the distal limbs was applied to all horses for 1 -7 days and food was gradually introduced following surgery in all horses. Post-operative complications were noted in 11/27 (41%) of animals recovered from surgery. Complications included: fever =6), diarrhoea (n =5), incisional infection (n =4), laminitis (n abortion 1 week after the surgery (n =1), peritonitis (n =1) and pulmonary oedema (n =1). Mean time was 9.4 days (median: 7 days, range: 5-30 days). Twenty-three cases survived to discharge (79%). There was no signi cant difference between survivors and nonsurvivors (short or long term) regarding the signalment, clinical signs, laboratory ndings, surgical ndings, methods to remove the FB and post-operative variables. Four horses were subjected to euthanasia during hospitalisation. The rst case was an 8-month pregnant mare in which the FB was not discovered in surgery. The mare suffered from severe post-operative colic, peritonitis and endotoxaemia and was eventually euthanised. At necropsy examination, a FB was found in the transverse colon with necrotic intestinal wall surrounding it. Three cases were subjected to euthanasia 2, 3 and 17 days after surgery due to post-operative complications -two suffered from colitis and the third from peritonitis. Twenty horses were available for long-term follow-up and were alive and had returned to their previous level of activity (time range for follow-up after surgery: 1 -13 years). Three horses were lost to follow-up. Discussion The current study presents the clinical management of 29 cases diagnosed with intestinal FBs, which were treatedsurgically and resulted in a favourable outcome. Previous literature gives wide ranging prognoses following surgical FB removal, making comparisons with our investigation dif cult. In the present study, 79% of the horses were released from the hospital and all the horses which were available for long- term follow-up were still alive and back to their intended use. The prognosis in the current study resembles the outcome of most reports on surgical resolution of small colon impactions (Dart et al. 1992; Rhoads et al. 1999; Frederico et al. 2006; Prange et al. 2010; de Bont et al. 2013). It is ill-advised to make a direct statistical comparison between the studies due to innate differences between them, thus we cannot ascertain if our results are truly inferior to previous studies. In previous studies it was evident that FB obstruction usually occurs in horses younger than 4 years of age, presumably due to their less selective eating behaviour (Boles and Kohn 1977; Dart et al. 1992; Pierce 2009). In the current study, the mean age of the horses was 4.2 years, however older animals were seen as well and four horses were over 8 years of age. This broad age distribution suggests that horses may be affected at any age if the environmental conditions are suitable. It is reasonable to assume that horses kept in a stall with a strict feeding regimen were less likely to be affected than horses in a pasture or paddock with unlimited exposure to hay and presumably with less sanitary conditions. However, due to missing data regarding the husbandry practices, such a prior statement could not be con rmed from our data. Only two horses in the current study, which were kept at pasture, had a known access to foreign material in the diet. In most horses, the FBs were comprised of twine made from plastic bres. The twine seen in the FBs is used to bind hay bales, meaning it could be found in all environments as long as it is not removed from the hay before feeding. It has been mentioned in a previous publication that seasonality may have an effect on FB presentation with a higher incidence in warm climates (Gay et al. 1979). Another study showed a higher rate of small colon impactions in cold weather (Rhoads et al. 1999). However, in the present study, the cases were spread during the entire year with no evidence of preferred season. Fig 3: Representative image of the foreign body found in two cases. The mass was uniformly hardened with mineral deposition, giving it the appearance and the feel of an irregular enterolith. The mass was cut into two halves.

In previous studies, no breed or sex predisposition was found regarding FBs; however, females and Arabians, miniature horses and ponies were found to be affected more commonly by small colon impactions (Dart et al. 1992). Arabian horses may be predisposed to FB obstruction due to their small stature, and they were dominant in this study possibly since in Israel miniature horses and ponies do not represent a signi cant part of the population. Mean time between onset of clinical signs of colic and admission was 1.8 days. This represents typical signs of small colon or aboral large colon obstruction with gradual progress of clinical signs (Dart et al. 1992; Schumacher and Mair 2002). It is interesting to note that in spite of the relatively elongated time for admission, most horses underwent surgery on the same day as arrival. Reasons to go to surgery were mainly related to severe pain and inadequate response to conservative treatment, however there were a few cases that showed signs of endotoxaemia development. Moreover, all the cases in which the obstruction was visible, suffered already from injured serosa. Although the clinical presentation of FB obstruction may appear at rst as a 'non-complicated ' impaction, the pressure of the FB on the intestine may result in necrosis and quick deterioration of the animal 's health state. As such, it is our impression that any case suspected to suffer from FB obstruction should be considered as a surgical case more rapidly. The main clinical sign upon presentation was abdominal distention seen in the majority of cases and decreased or no faecal passage. Moreover, detection of large colon distention was the most common nding during rectal palpation in the current study. The abdominal distention, produced by gas accumulation oral to the FB, is the probable cause for the gastric re flux evident in 38% of the horses. Abdominal distention and the presence of re flux are not an uncommon nding in small colon obstruction or previous reports of FB obstruction (Gay et al. 1979; Ruggles and Ross 1991; Rhoads et al. 1999; Frederico et al. 2006). Recognition of the FB during rectal palpation was evident in only six horses. There may be several reasons for the low FB detection rate during rectal palpation, seen in other studies as well (Boles and Kohn 1977; Gay et al. 1979). One reason is that the high incidence of gas distention could obscure the location of the FB and prevent its detection. The other reason is that the common location of the FB in the oral small colon or aboral large colon is dif cult to reach during the examination. The most common location of the FBs was the small colon followed by the aboral part of the large colon (mainly transverse colon), similar to previous studies (Boles and Kohn 1977; Gay et al. 1979; van Wuijckhuise-Sjouke 1984). The ingested foreign material may remain within the large colon for a signi cant period of time before obstructing the small colon or tunnel-like structure of the transverse colon (Schumacher and Mair 2002). The surgical inaccessibility of those intestinal segments complicates the removal process and therefore several techniques were developed to prevent contamination while removing the FB (Schumacher and Mair 2002; de Oliveira Dearo et al. 2009; Pierce 2009), as mentioned earlier. When feasible, our rst choice of treatment for small colon FBs is high enema which is the least invasive technique since it does notinclude enterotomy or resection. This technique was used in cases when the impacted mass around the foreign material could be dissolved to some extent, decreasing the size of the impaction, eliminating the sharp protrusions and enabling it to be massaged to the anus. High enema was not performed in cases where the FB was well adhered to the intestine wall, the intestine around the FB was compromised or the FB contained rigid projections which could potentially damage the intestine during the manipulation. In those cases, a small colon enterotomy was performed. Due to the less invasive nature of the technique, it will presumably involve less complications post- operatively. However, owing to the small number of horses, this statement could not be con rmed. It has been stated previously that a high enema during surgery may result in inflammation, vascular compromise, peritonitis, adhesions and intestinal rupture (Ruggles and Ross 1991). As such, it has been recommended that a high enema should be performed with extreme caution and an antimicrobial treatment post-operatively against anaerobic bacteria should be initiated (Ruggles and Ross 1991). A high enema can also be advantageous when the FB is located in the transverse colon or oral small colon. Here, the high enema is performed to distend the bowel with fluid and as a consequence the FB can detach from the intestine and move in a retrograde manner to a safe site for enterotomy in the large colon. When applicable, the FB was manipulated in that manner to the pelvic flexure and removed by pelvic flexure enterotomy. If the body was too large, a right dorsal colon enterotomy was performed. In the vast majority of the cases, a pelvic flexure enterotomy was performed as well, to evacuate the large colon. This process presumably enables healing of the segment involved with the FB post-operatively and minimises contamination at the forthcoming enterotomy site (Pierce 2009). An additional bene t of evacuating the large colon in that manner is the removal of smaller FBs, such as twine fragments, which could cause obstructions in the future. Historically, complications following small colon surgeries are common with an incidence rate reaching up to 80% (Boles and Kohn 1977; Rhoads et al. 1999; Frederico et al. 2006). Diarrhoea and fever are the two most common complications associated with small colon surgery (Rhoads et al. 1999; Frederico et al. 2006; Prange et al. 2010). In the current study, the complication rate was 41% with fever, diarrhoea and incisional infection being most common. Incisional infection is a well-known complication following abdominal surgery and accounted typically for 20 -40% of cases, however higher incidence such as 70% was reported in speci c circumstances such as repeated surgery (Tnibar et al. 2013; Dunkel et al. 2015; Isgren et al. 2017). The prevalence of incisional site infection in the present study (15%) compares favourably with these studies, particularly when considering the high risk for faecal contamination in FB surgeries which is considered to be a risk factor for incisional infection (Darnaud et al. 2016). Diarrhoea and fever, in cases suffering from small colon pathologies, are common with an incidence of up to 80% (Rhoads et al. 1999; Frederico et al. 2006; de Bont et al. 2013). Some evidence suggests that high enema and pelvic flexure enterotomy may cause diarrhoea due to irritation of the mucosa, however the influence is usually transient (Pierce 2009). In our study, performing a high enema did not increase the incidence of post-operative diarrhoea. \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd428 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / AUGUST One mare in the current study suffered from a FB located in the aboral right dorsal colon, rmly adhered to the intestine wall. As a result of the location, the FB could not be removed in a safe manner and the mare was eventually euthanised due to gross contamination. It was reported previously that cases with FB located in unreachable locations may be subjected to euthanasia during surgery, due to intestinal spillage or inability to safely perform enterotomy (Boles and Kohn 1977). Proper draping with suturing of a nylon drape to the enterotomy site can considerably aid in preventing faecal contamination during removal of the FB, especially in regions which cannot be safely exteriorised. Thus, the location of the FB, with the ability to mobilise it as necessary, is critical for the success of the surgery. Another mare suffered from a FB located in the transverse colon which was not detected during surgery. Due to the mare 's advanced pregnancy, the transverse colon was not properly palpated during the exploration. As a result, the mare developed post-operative colic, peritonitis, endotoxaemia and eventually subjected to euthanasia. It is the author 's impression that detection of FBs in the transverse colon can be dif cult, as also shown in a previous report (Boles and Kohn 1977). Thus, special attention should be given during exploratory celiotomy to verify that the transverse colon is thoroughly palpated in order to avoid such a disappointing result. One mare had surgery under standing sedation through the left paralumbar fossa. This approach has been previously described and has inherent bene ts such as avoidance of anaesthesia and reduced costs (Graham and Freeman 2014; Krueger and Klohnen 2015; Coomer et al. 2016). In the current case, the decision to perform the surgery standing was based on the owner 'snancial limitations and the presumptive diagnosis of a FB in the small colon by rectal examination. The mare had no intra- or post-operative complications, and the case supports the notion that in certain suitable cases, performing standing colic surgery through the flank offers an appropriate alternative to the traditional ventral midline laparotomy under general anaesthesia. In summary, FB obstruction occurs more frequently in Arabian horses and females and most commonly affects the small colon. The FB may be palpable on rectal examination however it is possible only in the minority of cases. The clinical signs are not speci c and resemble other colon impactions, yet any suspicion of FB presence should be treated more cautiously since deterioration may be rapid. Few techniques are available for removal of the FB during surgery and the preferred method depends on the FB location, appearance and mobility. Surgical removal of colonic FBs in horses is recommended and carries fair to good prognosis for survival and return to function.

E. Clements*, R. P. C. Coomer, S. A. McKane, D. Gorvy, the complete absence of one testis and is rare in horses. This study reports the clinical ndings in 10 horses diagnosed as monorchids by standing laparoscopy or exploratory laparotomy. Hospital records for all horses undergoing cryptorchidectomy (2000 -2016) in four centres were reviewed from which horses diagnosed with monorchidism were identi ed. Surgery was by either standing flank laparoscopy or an inguinal exploration and subsequent exploratory laparotomy under general anaesthesia. Ten horses were diagnosed as monorchids, ve by laparoscopy (one bilateral laparoscopy) and ve by laparotomy. Nine horses had a normally descended scrotal testicle, which was also removed at surgery. The right testicle was absent in three horses, and the left testicle was absent in seven horses. Anatomical ndings were recorded in each case; the vaginal process was present in all horses, ductus deferens and epididymis were present in 80% of horses and the ligament of the tail of the epididymis and testicular vessels were present in 50% of horses. Laparoscopy allowed easy identi cation of spermatic structures enabling a prompt diagnosis of monorchidism. In conclusion, when monorchidism occurs, most other associated spermatic structures are likely to be present. A diagnosis of true monorchidism is reliant on hormonal testing and absence of testicular tissue on histopathology and so some of these horses may strictly be somewhere on the spectrum of testicular degeneration. This information is particularly useful in the surgical situation when it is not clear whether the testicle is present or not. Introduction Monorchidism is the term used to describe the complete absence of one testis and is rare in horses (Cox 1987). There are a limited number of previously published single case reports (Garlick 1952; Koppang 1957; Adams 1964; Johnson et al. 1976; Petrizzi et al. 2004) and small case series of horses diagnosed with monorchidism after exploratory surgery using various laparotomy approaches (Parks et al. 1989; Santschi et al. 1989). These studies however predate the use of laparoscopy. The advantages of laparoscopy have been well published in the literature over the last 20 years (Hendrickson 2001), which includes assisting in the diagnosis of a monorchid or an anomalous abdominal cryptorchid (Kelmer et al. 2006; Smith and Perkins 2009; Brommer et al. 2011). Monorchidism can be due to agenesis, but most are attributed to testicular degeneration (Parks et al. 1989; Santschi et al. 1989; evidence that testicular ischaemia may accompany cryptorchidism in the horse (Gardner et al. 2017) and so progression of testicular ischaemia could lead to complete testicular necrosis and a monorchid appearance. The presence of remnants of testicular tissue has been given the term anomalous abdominal cryptorchid (Brommer et al. 2011). A comprehensive recording of the presence or absence of spermatic structures from a series of monorchid horses is lacking. There are three attachments of the spermatic tissues: the testicular vessels from the aorta, the vas deferens leading to the bladder and the ligament of the tail of the epididymis running to the apex of the vaginal process. Understanding which spermatic structures are present in these horses would be useful clinically particularly during surgery when it may be unclear whether a testicle is present or not. Identi cation of anatomical structures also aids attempts to locate an undescended testicle if present (Ortved et al. 2014). The aim of this study was to report the clinical ndings in 10 horses diagnosed as monorchids by laparoscopy or laparotomy. Materials and methods The hospital records for all horses undergoing cryptorchid castration between 2000 and 2016 in four centres were reviewed retrospectively, from which horses diagnosed with monorchidism were identi ed. Inclusion criteria Horses presenting as cryptorchids based on a known history of no previous surgery and surgical ndings consistent with monorchidism were included in this study. During surgery, the three attachments of the spermatic tissues were identi ed as well as an absence of testicular tissue on the one side. Information obtained from the records included signalment, pre-surgery evaluation, surgical technique, structures identi ed at surgery, post-operative complications and results of hormone assays and histopathology. Pre-surgical evaluation involved external palpation in all horses, with additional percutaneous inguinal ultrasonography inve, as described by Coomer et al. (2016). Rectal palpation was not performed in any horse. All horses received perioperative antibiotics (intramuscular procaine penicillin 22,000 iu/kg bwt) administered 60 min prior to the rst skin incision. Surgery was performed in each horse by one of four board-certi ed equine surgeons using two methods: either laparoscopy under standing sedation (Kummer 2012) or exploration via an inguinal approach made directly over the \u00a92019 EVJ under general anaesthesia (GA) (Kummer 2012). Laparoscopy Horses were restrained in stocks and sedated with a combination of an a 2-adrenoreceptor agonist and an opioid. Standard laparoscopic techniques were used to gain visualisation of the ipsilateral deep inguinal area (Kummer 2012), with additional instruments used to facilitate this by moving bowel and allowing traction on the mesorchium if needed ( Fig 1 ). mesorchium was in ltrated with local anaesthetic (2% mepivacaine) then divided with a vessel- sealing device (LigasureTM), before being removed via an ipsilateral flank laparotomy (Hendrickson 2007). Standing open castration was then performed on the contralateral side (Searle et al. 1999). General anaesthetic technique With horses anaesthetised in dorsal recumbency, the inguinal canal was explored using an inguinal approach rst. When the vaginal process could not be identi ed in the inguinal canal, the surgeon converted to a laparotomy approach. The approach to laparotomy differed between surgeons (parainguinal, suprapubic paramedian or ventral midline (Kummer 2012)). Regardless of approach, the abdomen was explored manually and any spermatic tissue present was extracted and resected. The normally descended scrotal testicle was removed using a closed castration technique. Spermatic structures were resected at surgery to avoid the possibility of functional testicular tissue being left behind. The resected tissue was then examined grossly for the presence of testicular tissue and/or sent for histopathology. Results Ten horses were found to be monorchids during castration, one of which had a teratoma on the contralateral side ( Fig 2 ). Age range was 1 -12 years (median 3 years and mean 4.2 years). Breeds are listed in Table 1 . It is clear from the detailed clinical records, that these horses had been in their owner 's possession from birth. Five horses had standing laparoscopy (four unilateral and one bilateral), whilst ve horses had laparotomy using suprapubic paramedian (n = 2), parainguinal (n = 2) and ventral midline approaches (n = 1). The right testicle was absent in three horses, and the left testicle was absent in seven horses. The surgical ndings are summarised in Table 1 . The vaginal process was present in all horses; the ductus deferensand epididymis were present in eight horses ( Figs 3 and 4) and the ligament of the tail of the epididymis and testicular vessels were identi ed in ve. There were no signi cant post-operative complications recorded in any of the cases. Hormone tests were performed in eight horses within 2-4 weeks of surgery. Post-hCG administration (reference range: gelding <0.05 nmol/L). in four horses, with the results for two horses lost to follow-up. The serum oestrone sulphate concentration in gelding <0.02 ng/mL). The serum <0.14 the lack of testosterone-producing tissue in six of ten horses consistent with them being geldings. There were no complaints from clients concerning persistent stallion-like behaviour post-surgery suggesting there was no residual functional testicular tissue having removed the normally descended testicle. Histopathology results were available for three horses (Horses 1, 8 and 9). Histology of tissue samples from Horse 1 revealed ciliated columnar epithelium associated with the vas deferens, a but no testicular tissue ( Fig 5 ). In Horse 8, a small nodule of dense brous tissue with pigment- laden macrophages representing the remnants of markedly atrophic testicular tissue, skeletal muscle assumed to be cremator muscle, and ciliated columnar epithelium of the epididymis were identi ed. In Horse 9, the proper ligament of the testis and aplastic testicular tissue were present. Discussion In these monorchid horses, associated accessory spermatic structures were always present despite the absence of true testicular tissue on the ipsilateral side. The vaginal process was identi ed in all horses, which is similar to previous reports (Parks et al. 1989; Strong et al. 1997; Kelmer et al. 2006; Brommer et al. 2011). The presence of the vaginal process implies that at some point, gubernacular, and probably testicular tissue, had been present (Parks et al. 1989), suggesting a degenerative process is more likely than testicular agenesis. The gubernaculum, a mesenchymal column of tissue, develops during testicular development and extends from the caudal pole of the mesonephros and testis to the inguinal region. An invagination of peritoneum, the vaginal process, grows into the extra-abdominal part of the gubernaculum in horses at 48 days (McGeady et al. 2006). The cause of acquired monorchidism has been proposed to be ischaemic injury of the developing testis in utero (Parks a) b) Fig 1: a) Laparoscopic view showing spermatic tissues entering the right internal inguinal ring. b) Gentle traction was applied on the mesorchium to bring it back into the abdomen but no testicular tissue was identi able. The elongated mesorchium was subsequently resected and sent for histopathology absence of testicular tissue. \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd432 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / AUGUST et al. 1989; Santschi et al. 1989) or after birth in an abdominal testis (Parker and Rakestraw 1997), resulting in degeneration (Parks et al. 1989; Santschi et al. 1989) or complete testicular necrosis (Gardner et al. 2017). The morphological changes of brous connective tissue, haemosiderophages and mineralisation of necrotic cells seen in the microscopic histopathology of Horse 8 are similar to those previously described in monorchid horses (Kelmer et al. 2006; Brommer et al. 2011; Gardner et al. 2017). This is very similar to the pathology of testicular regression in man (Lamesch 1994; Spires et al. 2000) and calci cation or haemosiderin pigmentation have been noted in almost 90% of cases, which is characteristic, if not speci c, for atrophy resulting from ischaemia. Performing histopathology in more cases would have been bene cial for clarifying the nature of the abnormal tissue and for further implicating ischaemic injury as the cause of equine monorchidism ( Fig 5 ). In light of the study by Brommer et al. (2011) ,one could argue that the cases, which relied on histopathology for identi cation of necrotic testicular tissue, should be more accurately described as 'anomalous cryptorchids '. It was decided to term them as monorchids for this study because of the absence of an obvious testicular structure during surgery. Their inclusion is clinically useful when trying to understand and explain how the surgical appearance of these horses can vary so much. As Brommer et al. (2011) suggests, it may be associated with the testicle being somewhere along the spectrum of ischaemic testicular degeneration. In equine fetal development, the tail of the epididymis, proper ligament of the testis, vas deferens and ligament of the tail of the epididymis are in close proximity at the caudal aspect of the testicle (Noden and De Lahunta 1985). Brommer et al. (2011) hypothesised that varying degrees ofischaemia can lead to these structures becoming disrupted and degenerative, and their ends can adhere together, end separately, or regress altogether. This theory would explain why the presence and gross appearance of the epididymis, vas deferens and testicular vessels varied amongst cases within this study and also between studies. The presence of a teratoma in Horse 5 was an anomaly. Although teratomas tend to occur in the gonads, they are nonfunctional and do not produce hormones so one could argue that this horse was actually an anorchid. The most important weakness in our case selection is that the history since birth for each horse was taken on trust. Although owner assurances were given, there remains the possibility that the owners may not have declared the horse having undergone previous surgery and been incompletely hemi-castrated whereby some residual epididymis or other spermatic tissue was left behind. This may be more likely to occur if carried out illegally by persons without using sufcient restraint or without veterinary quali cation/expertise. Incomplete previous castration may complicate the diagnosis of monorchidism and should be considered a differential diagnosis, although arguably academic rather than clinically relevant. The signalment and history of these cases did not indicate any reason to suspect previous unilateral castration, due to trauma, inguinal herniation or for any other reason. It is important to recognise that in the cases of incomplete hemicastration however, the veterinarian would tend to inadvertently remove just the epididymis and part of the proper ligament, leaving the testis in the abdomen. As a result, it is unlikely that previous incomplete castration would result in a monorchid appearance. Horses in this study were successfully castrated using either laparoscopy or laparotomy without complications. The choice of surgical approach was attributed to surgeon preference and also to the availability of laparoscopic equipment. The advantages of laparoscopy over traditional laparotomy techniques have been described (Searle et al. 1999; Kelmer et al. 2006; Joyce 2008). Laparoscopy enables good visualisation when searching for an intra-abdominal testis, which was evident in Horse 3 and Horse 4 which underwent previously unsuccessful laparotomy and inguinal exploration respectively. Laparoscopy can also help with identifying testicular remnants or adhesions from previous attempts at surgery, uses smaller and less invasive incisions, reduces manual tissue handling and does not disrupt the deep and super cial inguinal rings. This is in direct contrast to the complications associated with traditional laparotomy techniques, which include dif culty in identifying infection and adhesions and peritonitis (French et al. 2002). Laparotomy also has the added risks associated with general anaesth esia (Wagner 2008) but standing open- flank laparotomy can be performed under sedation and local anaesthesia (Kelmer et al. 2013). As a result, surgical morbidity and post-operative complications are reduced and recovery is quicker with laparoscopy (Hendrickson 2006, 2007; Graham and Freeman 2014). Cribb et al. (2015) however, documented more post- operative complications with laparoscopy when compared to conventional inguinal and parainguinal approaches for cryptorchidectomy. There must also be consideration given in these laparoscopy cases to the 20% prevalence of post-operative complications associated with standing castration of the Fig 2: Horse 8. Presumed to be a bilateral abdominal cryptorchid was diagnosed with monorchidism after standing laparoscopy. A 15 cm teratoma was identi ed on the right side and all structures associated with spermatic tissue except for testicular tissue were identi ed on the left side. \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd433 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / AUGUST TABLE 1: Summary processLigament of the tail of the epididymisEpididymis Ductus deferensTesticular vessels Head Tail 1 Arab X 3 Yes Unilateral laparoscopy+ /C0/C0 /C0 + /C0 Serum hCG stim test <0.05 nmol/L laparoscopy*++ + + ++ hCG stim test Result lost to follow-up 4 Welsh pony 7 Left Yes Unilateral laparoscopy*+ U ++ U /C0 Not done - 5 Cob X 3 Left Yes Bilateral laparoscopy++ + + ++ Not done - 6 ++ Serum laparoscopy++ + + ++ hCG stim test Result lost to follow-up * Exploratory / AE / AUGUST normal scrotal testicle (Mason et al. 2005). However, a reduction in surgical site infections has been shown when combining a laparoscopic and conventional castration technique to remove the descended testis in abdominal cryptorchids (Rijkenhuizen and van der Harst 2017). Three different hormonal assays were used in this study, most commonly the hCG stimulation test. Historically both hCG stimulation tests and measurement of serum oestrone sulphate concentrations have been shown to be accurate (Cox et al. 1986) but there is more recent evidence to suggest preferred testing for functional testicular tissue in cryptorchids by measuring serum anti-M \u20acullerian hormone (Ball et al. 2008; Claes et al. 2013; Parker 2016). An accurate diagnosis is important because of the behavioural differences between geldings and horses with functional testicular tissue. Hormone assays would have con rmed either the presence or absence of residual testicular tissue in the four horses for which results were not available. It has been stated that a diagnosis of monorchidism can only be made after surgical exploration, removal of the normal testis and hormonal testing (Searle et al. 1999). Theretrospective collection of data for our study meant that it was not possible to follow the inclusion criteria set out by Searle et al. (1999) as post-operative hormone testing had not always been performed. The diagnosis in these horses was based primarily on surgical ndings, but with additional information provided by inguinal percutaneous ultrasound, which has been shown to be an accurate diagnostic tool for locating inguinal cryptorchid testes (Coomer et al. 2016). Identifying the three spermatic tissue attachments (Parks et al. 1989), as well as an absence of testicular tissue at surgery supported the diagnosis of monorchidism. In conclusion, systematic exploratory surgery requires good knowledge of anatomy to ensure that monorchidism is identi ed. Understanding the possible variations in appearance of the associated spermatic structures in monorchid horses is clinically useful particularly during surgery when a testicle cannot be found. Laparoscopy assists with the easy identi cation of the spermatic structures and the absence of testicle enabling a prompt diagnosis at surgery whilst hormonal assays and histopathology are useful post-operatively to con rm the complete absence of testicular tissue. Histopathology may also provide additional evidence for implicating ischaemic injury as the cause of acquired monorchidism in horses and may allow us to more accurately differentiate between true monorchids and anomalous abdominal cryptorchids. a) b) Fig 3: a) Laparoscopic view of the ductus deferens crossing the suspensory ligament of the bladder (arrow). b) The tail of the epididymis within the abdomen -this is signi cant because the tail of the epididymis descends before the testis. * E Fig 4: Horse 4: This spermatic tissue was removed via unilateral standing laparoscopy.

Dyson*, V. Busoniand A. Salciccia Centre for Equine Studies, Animal Health Trust, Newmarket, Suffolk, UK; andEquine Clinic, disc disease in the cervical and cranial thoracic vertebrae is unusual in horses and the majority of documented cases have been associated with infection and resulted in ataxia. The current retrospective study documents the clinical and imaging features, and outcome in eight Equidae with neck stiffness /C6forelimb lameness (n =3) or ataxia (n =2) assessed during a 10-year period at two clinics. The Equidae (one donkey and seven horses) ranged in age from 1.5 to 12 years (median 5.5 years). The duration of clinical signs ranged from 1 to 6 months (median 1.5 months). The donkey had a depressed demeanour. All Equidae had reduced range of neck movement. The donkey and one horse showed mild and severe ataxia respectively. Two horses showed a propensity to stumble on each forelimb, one of which exhibited forelimb lameness on the lunge or ridden. Two additional horses showed lameness in hand. One horse experienced 'neck locking 'during grazing. Radiological abnormalities were identi ed involving the intervertebral symphysis between the sixth cervical vertebra (C6) and C7 in four Equidae; in two horses articulation between C7 and the rst thoracic vertebra (T1) was involved. One horse had abnormalities of the intervertebral symphyses of both C7 and T1, and T1 and T2. In one horse the articulation between C2 and 3 was affected. The donkey was treated with a prolonged course of doxycycline and improved. An advanced dressage horse returned to full-function after surgical fusion of the affected intervertebral symphysis. Intervertebral disc disease is a rare cause of neck stiffness /C6lameness or ataxia. Introduction Discospondylitis is an in flammatory condition involving the bodies adjacent to the intervertebral symphysis (Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria 2005) and their in the cervical and cranial thoracic vertebral column is an unusual condition, to which there is only limited reference in the equine literature (Adams et al . 1985; Garcia et al . 2015). Most reports describe the condition in adult horses and clinical signs have included neck stiffness, neck pain, a stiff or short- stepping forelimb gait and forelimb lameness. Ataxia is also reported as a clinical sign, associated with protrusion of disc material into the vertebral canal (Foss et al . 1983; Nixon et al . 2015). Infection has been recognised as the cause in the majority of horses (Foss et al . 1983; Nixon et al . Garcia et al . 2015) but attempts to identify the aetiological agent were largely unsuccessful. The aetiology of intervertebral disc disease in other reported cases remains unclear, although trauma has been reported (Adams et al . 1985; Speltz et al . 2006; Denoix 2007). Previous surveys of 17 horses from 3 months to 19 years of age (Yovich et al . 1985) and 103 horses from birth to 23 years of age (Bollwein and Hanichen 1989), had indicated that the cervical intervertebral discs consist of brocartilage, with no nucleus pulposus. Age-related degenerative changes were identi ed, but even with severe disintegration of the discs, no related clinical signs had been recognised. However, a recent gross and histological study of the intervertebral discs of 33 Warmblood horses demonstrated that there was a nucleus pulposus and annulus brosus which were similar in structure to dogs and people, although the distinction between the regions was much less clear (Bergmann et al . 2018). Grade 4 and 5 degenerative changes (on a scale of 0-5) were found in 36% of horses in the segment between the fth cervical (C5) and rst thoracic (T1) vertebrae, which was a considerably higher frequency of occurrence than elsewhere in the vertebral column. It has been suggested that disc degeneration may increase intervertebral mobility, and associated dorsal bulging of the dorsal longitudinal ligament could potentially contribute to spinal nerve root compression at the entrance to the intervertebral foramen (K. Whitwell, personal communication, cited by Dyson 2011). The purpose of this report was to describe the history, clinical and imaging features of intervertebral disc disease in eight Equidae, in six of which ataxia was not observed. Materials and methods Case records from the University of Li /C18ege and the Animal Health Trust (AHT) from 2008 to 2018 were interrogated to identify Equidae (D1 and H2 -8,Table 1 ) with a diagnosis of cervical intervertebral disc disease. All animals underwent comprehensive static and dynamic physical examinations, repeated on several occasions. Horses 5 -8 were evaluated moving on the lunge and ridden. Horse 6 underwent diagnostic analgesia of the lame forelimb (Bassage and Ross 2011). 10.1111/eve.13125analgesia of the left articular process joint between the seventh cervical (C7) and T1 vertebrae was performed in Horse 7. Blood samples were collected for measurement of white blood cell count, brinogen and serum haptoglobin (D1), or serum amyloid A (H4) Lateral -lateral radiographs of the cervical and cranial thoracic vertebrae were acquired (Butler et al . 2017). Images were interpreted by a Diplomate (V.B.) or an Associate (S.D.) of the European College of Veterinary Diagnostic Imaging. Results There were one donkey (D1, Table 1 ) and seven horses (H2 - 8), which ranged in age from 1.5 to 12 years (mean 6.3 years; median 5.5 years). There were ve geldings, two stallions and one mare, used for general purpose riding (n =2, including unaf liated competition), dressage (n =2), eventing (1), endurance (1) and driving (1); one horse was unbroken. Breeds included three Warmbloods and one each of Thoroughbred cross, Highland Pony, Akhal T /C19ek/C19e and a pony. Height ranged from 142 to 167 cm (n =4), Cases 5 -8; mean 154.8 cm. Bodyweight ranged from 328 to 575 kg (median 480 kg, mean 455 kg). Clinical features The duration of clinical signs ranged from 1 to 6 months (mean 2.4 months, median 1.5 months). The donkey had a depressed demeanour and low head posture. All horses had a normal neck posture at rest, but when passive neck flexion was assessed using baited stretch exercises, flexion was limited. Neck muscle development was generally poor in ve horses (H 3,4,5,7,8), but no focal muscle atrophy was observed. There was no patchy sweating, hyperaesthesia or allodynia, but Horse 5 showed a marked pain response when the caudal aspect of the left side of the neck was palpated when the horse exhibited neck 'locking '. All Equidae experienced dif culties in lowering the neck to graze, exhibiting a straddled stance with both forelimbs widely separated (D1, H2 -4 and 6 -8). Horse 3 would not eat from the ground and Horse 7 could not reach the ground to eat. Horse 5, after grazing for several minutes, developed neck 'locking ': the neck became xed in a lowered position, sometimes with the neck bent to the right ( Fig 1a ). He tended to cross the forelimbs while grazing, or had the left front fetlock knuckled forwards. The horse walked forwardswith the neck xed in a low position. This persisted for up to 10 minutes and would then resolve spontaneously. When evaluated moving in hand in straight lines, ve horses (H 2,5,6,7,8) had a stiff neck posture. When turned in small circle these horses, in addition to Horse 4, had reduced range of motion of the neck. Two Equidae showed mild (D1, grade 1 -forelimbs) and severe (H2, grade 3 -hindlimbs > forelimbs) ataxia respectively (using a 0 [Reed 2003; Olsen et al . 2014]). No other animal showed evidence of ataxia or weakness. However, Horses 2 and 6 had a propensity to stumble on each forelimb. For Horse 6 this was most evident when ridden. Horses 4, 6 and 7 exhibited forelimb lameness. Forelimb lameness was evident in hand for Horses 4 and 7, but was only apparent on the lunge or ridden in Horse 6. Horses 5 and 8 had reduced range of motion of the neck on the lunge. Horse 6 was consistently more reluctant to trot willingly on the right rein on the lunge, although paradoxically right forelimb lameness was more obvious on the left rein compared with the right rein. Hopping-type forelimb lameness was not observed. When ridden two horses (H 5,6) tilted the head and neck, with the nose to the right and to the left respectively. Horse 5 had unrelated bilateral hindlimb lameness. The right forelimb lameness in Horse 6 was not improved by any local analgesic technique and showed deterioration after palmar metacarpal (subcarpal) nerve blocks. The left forelimb lameness in Horse 7 was improved after intra- articular analgesia of the left Ce7-T1 articular process joint, and the horse could then easily lower the head and neck to eat from the ground. Diagnostic analgesia was not performed in Horse 4. Haematological and serum biochemistry results were within the normal range in all horses. The donkey had mild neutrophilia and an increased serum haptoglobin concentration, but the total blood leucocyte count and brinogen concentration were within the normal range. Radiological ndings The radiological features are summarised in Table 2 (Figs 1 - 4b-). Three Equidae (D1 and H2,6) had intervertebral the symphysis between C6 and 7; in three horses (H3,4,7) the articulation between C7 and T1 was involved. One horse (H5) had abnormalities of the intervertebral symphyses of both C7-T1 and T1 -T2. In one horse (H8) the articulation between C2 and 3 was affected.

There was a rim of new bone around the articular margins of the intervertebral symphyses and extensive new bone on the ventral aspects of the vertebral bodies of C7, T1 and T2, the extent of which had not been appreciated radiologically ( Fig 1b ). The facets for the articulations of the rst and second ribs on both the left and right sides had periarticular modelling. Discussion In the majority of Equidae in the current report it seems likely that the underlying cause of intervertebral disc disease was not infection. However, in small animals discospondylitis is dened as bacterial, or less commonly fungal or algal, spinal infection, usually haematogenous, beginning as an infection of end plates of the vertebral bodies through the highly vascular and slow- flowing metaphyseal and epiphyseal capillary beds involvement the intervertebral disc (Kerwin 2015; Ruoff et al . 2018). The mean and median ages of the Equidae in this case series was lower than the mean age of the majority of horses presented for lameness or poor performance to both clinics (Parkes et al . 2013). It is also lower than the reported age of horses with discospondylitis (Foss et al . 1983; Nixon Garcia et al . 2015). The advanced nature of the radiological abnormalities at the time of diagnosis, despite clinical signs having been recognised in six Equidae for 2 months, suggests that radiological changes probably predated clinical signs. No horse had a history of known trauma. The cause of intervertebral disc disease therefore remains open to speculation. It was suggested that such radiological abnormalities may re flect the end-stage of cervical vertebral stenosis, based on a horse which presented with ataxia (Speltz et al . 2006). However, in the current series only three of the horses had concurrent enlargement of the articular process joints at the same level as the intervertebral disc disease and narrowing of the dorsoventral height of the vertebral canal was not a major feature. It is notable that in four cases there was subtle to severe subluxation of the affected vertebrae. Vertebral malalignment may be due to angular deformation, which is potentially reducible, although contributing to segmental instability, or a translational defect, more correctly referred to as spondylolisthesis, based on the human literature (Jiang et al . 2011). Spondylolisthesis is reported in humans as a consequence of trauma or disc degeneration in the cervical spine. In cervical degenerative spondylolisthesis in human patients, degeneration of the disc and the articular process joints occurs rst, in association with neck pain, which is considered to be the initial symptom. a) b) c) Fig 5: Osseous specimens from Horse 5 (see Fig 1). a) Lateral oblique image of the seventh cervical (C7) to second thoracic (T2) vertebrae. b) The caudal aspect of C7. c) The cranial aspect of T2. There is very extensive modelling on the ventral aspects of C7 to T2. There is major destruction of the caudal end plate of C7 and the cranial aspect of T2. There are severe bilateral costovertebral joint osteophytes of the rst and second ribs. \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd441 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / AUGUST Myelopathy and radiculopathy are also reported in association with spondylolisthesis. In the current case series, it is not known whether spondylolisthesis was primary, or developed secondarily to disc degeneration and joint instability. The high frequency of occurrence of degenerative changes in the intervertebral discs in the caudal cervical and cranial thoracic region (Bergmann et al . 2018) suggests that disc degeneration is primary. Neck stiffness and an abnormal posture to graze were the most common clinical features. Dif culties in lowering the head to graze have been associated with congenital malformation of the occiput, atlas and axis (Dyson 2011) and with severe osteoarthritis of the articular process joints in the caudal neck region (Dyson 2011). One horse in the current series had concurrent osteoarthritis of the articular process joints of C7-T1 and both the ability to lower the head and forelimb lameness were markedly improved by intra-articular analgesia. To what extent intervertebral disc disease contributed to the clinical signs is dif cult to determine. Lowering the neck to graze was a trigger for 'neck locking 'in one horse (H5). It has previously been speculated that transient cervical nerve root compression may be a cause of 'neck locking '(Dyson 2011). This horse (H5) showed a pain response on the caudal aspect of the left side of the neck only when the neck was 'locked '. In a previous study of horses with postulated nerve root compression, one horse with unexplained forelimb lameness showed focal hyperaesthesia ipsilateral to the lame limb, and a horse with episodic root signature posture had ipsilateral focal allodynia only when standing in this posture (Dyson 2020). Focal hyperaesthesia was reported in 48% of 91 horses with cervical vertebral compressive myelopathy (Levine et al . 2010). Hyperaesthesia may be related to compression of a nerve root, dura or dorsal horn lesions. Two horses showed a propensity to stumble, which has been documented previously in association with lameness postulated to relate to cervical nerve root impingement (Dyson 2020). Three horses showed forelimb lameness, in one of which deterioration in lameness was seen after distal limb nerve blocks, a feature that has previously been recognised in horses with possible cervical radiculopathy (Dyson 2020). Head tilt was observed in two of the four horses assessed ridden, a clinical feature also observed in some horses with forelimb lameness, possibly related to cervical radiculopathy (Dyson 2020). One of these horses also exhibited a tilt of the neck and head when the horse walked with the neck 'locked '. Post-mortem examination of Horse 5 revealed how radiography underestimated the degree of pathological abnormality of the affected vertebrae and rib articulations. The osseous changes of the vertebrae were similar to those described by Speltz et al . (2006). In the majority of horses, the owners were reluctant to consider surgical fusion of the affected joints and for those with lesions caudal to C6 -7 this would be logistically challenging. However, in one horse with lesions involving the C6 -7 intervertebral symphysis surgical fusion was successful, allowing the horse to return to full athletic function as a dressage horse at Prix St Georges level. More horses require surgical treatment before the ef cacy of this treatment could be assessed. In conclusion, cervical intervertebral disc disease is an unusual cause of neck stiffness and an abnormal posture to graze and may be associated with forelimb lameness.Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

J. Scott Rossdales Veterinary Surgeons, Beaufort Cottage Stables, a relatively rare cause of infertility in the mare, accounting for only 1 -5% of all cases of endometritis. However, it remains a challenge to the clinician due to difculties in diagnosing and effectively treating affected mares, resulting in a high rate of recurrence and a guarded prognosis for ongoing fertility. Often occurring as an opportunistic infection, the most common causes of fungal endometritis in the mare are the causative agent are vital when choosing appropriate treatment as sensitivities to commonly used antifungals vary signi cantly. Assessing in vitro sensitivity for each isolate is accordingly recommended. Treatment of mares with fungal endometritis is multifaceted and includes; correction of any anatomical defects, uterine lavage and systemic and/or intrauterine infusion of antifungals. Concurrent bacterial infection is common so anticipation and subsequent treatment of bacterial endometritis is also often required. Introduction Endometritis is a leading cause of infertility in the mare and a major cause of economic loss to the equine breeding industry (Riddle et al. 2007). Whilst fungal infections only account for 1 -5% of all cases of endometritis (Dascanio et al. 2001), due to dif culties in accurately identifying the causative agent and a lack of controlled studies and pharmacokinetic data on antifungals, effective treatment can be a challenge. In addition, with a high incidence of recurrence and a guarded prognosis for future fertility, fungal endometritis becomes an important consideration in the problem mare. Fungal organisms consist of both yeasts, that are single- celled organisms, and moulds/hyphae, which are long, branching, lamentous structures. Certain fungal organisms such as Candida spp. are dimorphic and have the ability to exist in both forms under speci cc o n d i t i o n s .T h em o s tc o m m o n causes of fungal endometritis following the culture of 102 fungal isolates, (Beltaire al. 2012). Distinction between the different forms of fungal organisms is vital when considering treatment and assessing in vitro sensitivity for each isolate is recommended, as sensitivities to commonly used antifungals vary signi cantly. Aetiology Fungal endometritis in the mare is typically thought to occur as an opportunistic infection, with the primary reservoir being the caudal reproductive tract, including the vagina andclitoral fossa. Risk factors for infection include; poor perineal conformation, compromised uterine defenses, necrotic foci (such as retained fetal membranes, abortion and trauma following dystocia) and endocrine/immune disorders resulting in immunosuppression. Fungal endometritis is often identi ed following the repeated use of intrauterine antimicrobials. Whilst the exact mechanisms are still unknown, the combination of a disrupted vaginal flora caused by the antimicrobial treatment and potential iatrogenic introduction of pathogens into the uterus has been suggested (Hinrichs et al. 1992). Progesterone supplementation may also increase the risk of mycotic infection due to decreased neutrophil function, reduced uterine contractility and increased cervical tone (Evans et al. 1986; Watson 1988). In 152 mares presented to Utrecht University, the incidence of fungal endometritis was highest in barren (74%), followed by maiden (16%) and foaling (9%) mares. Risk factors in this study included previous intrauterine antibiotic treatment (87%), pneumovagina/urovagina (39%), excessive intrauterine fluid (33%) and a history of dystocia/retained fetal membranes (18%) (Stout 2008). Concerns have been raised about the risk of venereal transmission as samples taken from the reproductive tract of healthy stallions have been shown to be positive for lamentous fungi and/or yeasts; however, there are no current studies to con rm semen as a source of infection in mares (Malmgren et al. 1998; Rota et al. 2011). Diagnosis Horses presenting with fungal endometritis are often older, multiparous mares with a history of chronic infertility. Clinical signs may include a purulent vaginal discharge and excessive amounts of flocculent fluid within the uterine lumen on palpation and ultrasound examination ( Fig 1 ), whereas other cases may be subclinical. Ad e nitive diagnosis is made based on endometrial cytology, culture or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Endometrial cytology should be performed using a double-guarded uterine swab, cytobrush or following centrifugation of the ef fluent from a low volume uterine lavage ( Fig 2 ). An endometrial brush will yield higher number of cells, whilst a low volume lavage is likely to produce a more representative sample of the entire uterus when compared with a standard swab technique (Cocchia et al. 2012). Positive smears provide a quick and reliable diagnosis and will often show evidence of in flammation in addition to fungal elements. Various stains can be used to identify fungal organisms including; trichrome, periodic acid-schiff (PAS), Gram stain, Romanovsky and modi ed Wright 's (Diff-Quick/C226).1 Yeast will be visualised on cytology as single-celled organisms, size, with a characteristic clear 'halo 'around the organism due to the lack of stain uptake. Moulds in contrast are long, branching, lamentous organisms ( Fig 3 ). Endometrial culture requires prolonged incubation (up to 4 weeks) in a specialist medium (e.g. Sabouraud 's dextrose agar) and a level of expertise for accurate identi cation. Candida spp. will typically grow as white to clear coloured colonies with a smooth appearance ( Fig 4 ) and Aspergillus spp. as blue -green/grey -green colonies with white borders and a velvet-like texture ( Fig 5 ). Beltaire et al. (2012) found 73% of samples positive for fungal growth on Sabouraud 's dextrose agar to be negative on aerobic culture, highlighting the importance of speci c fungal media for accurate diagnosis. Concurrent aerobic culture is however recommended as the same study revealed 51% of samples to have additional bacterial growth ( Streptococcus zooepidemicus 32% and E. coli 21%). Obtaining an endometrial biopsy using an aseptic technique and subsequently smearing the tissue sample onto an appropriate agar plate has been shown to be more sensitive at detecting bacterial growth than a surface endometrial swab (Nielsen 2005). This method may aid in the diagnosis of fungal endometritis by detecting mycotic elements deeper within the endometrium. Concurrent culture of the vagina and external genitalia is also recommended to determine any reservoirs of infection.Being a nonculture dependent test, quantitative PCR has the bene t of a potentially increased sensitivity and more rapid turn-around than that of standard culture but is not readily available in all areas and cannot provide antimicrobial sensitivity data (Ferris et al. 2013). An endometrial biopsy stained with Gomon 's methamine silver stain will reveal a black/grey colouration to fungal TABLE 3: Nonspeci c uterine lavage treatments Compound Dose Administration Frequency Acetic acid 2% (white vinegar) 20 -100 ml Diluted in 1 L sterile saline for infusion Q 24 h for 5 -7 days Dimethylsuphoxide 20% (DMSO) 50 ml Diluted in 1 L sterile saline for infusion followed by lavage with saline/LRS in 24 hQ2 4h Hydrogen peroxide 3% 60 -120 ml Infusion, followed by sterile saline/LRS lavage in 24 h Q 24 h Lactated Ringers 's Solution (LRS) 1 -4 L Lavage Q 24 h until ef fluent is clear N-acetylcysteine 20% solution 6 g (30 ml) 30 ml diluted in 150 ml sterile saline for infusion, followed by sterile saline/LRS lavage in 24 hQ 24 h until ef fluent is clear Sterile saline 0.9% 1 -4 L Lavage Q 24 h until ef fluent is clear Tris-EDTA 250 -500 ml Infusion followed by lavage with LRS Q 24 h for 5 -7 days A Fig 1: Intrauterine fluid accumulation on ultrasound examination of a mare with fungal endometritis.TABLE 1: Intrauterine antifungal treatment (Brinsko et al. 2010, Hess et al. 2002) Antifungal Dose Administration Frequency Polyene Amphotericin B 100 -200 mg Reconstituted in 50 -100 ml sterile water for infusion Q 24 h for 5 -7 days Nystatin 0.5 -2.5 million units or 5 g Reconstituted in 50 -100 ml sterile water for infusion Q 24 h for 5 -7 days Azole Clotrimazole 500 -700 mg Reconstituted in 50 -100 ml sterile water for infusion Q 24 h for 5 -7 days Fluconazole 100 -500 mg Reconstituted in 50 -100 ml sterile water for infusion Q 24 h for 5 -7 days Miconazole 1,200 mg insert 1,200 mg insert deposited into the uterus Once Chitin synthesis inhibitor Lufenuron (Program/C2262) 540 mg Reconstituted in 50 -100 ml sterile saline for infusion Once TABLE 2: Systemic antifungals Antifungal Dose Administration Frequency Fluconazole (200 mg tablets)10 mg/kg loading dose, then 5 mg/kgPO Q 24 h for 2-3 weeks \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd445 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / AUGUST elements, whereas PAS will stain the polysaccharide-laden walls of mycotic elements magenta ( Fig 6 ). Fungal organisms are usually located either within the uterine lumen or within the super cial layers of the stratum compactum, however more invasive forms may be found embedded deep within the glandular lumina. In addition to the location of the fungal organisms, an endometrial biopsy will also determine the severity of in flammation and the extent of endometrial damage, and can be used to assess the response to treatment (Coutinho da Silva et al. 2000).Focal fungal infections may remain unidenti ed by standard diagnostic methods, in which case hysteroscopy may be useful to identify a nidus of infection. Underlying endocrine disorders such as pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction and insulin resistance should be ruled out as potentiating causes of immune suppression, as altered neutrophil function and an inadequate cellular immune response may result in an increased incidence of secondary infections (McFarlane 2014; McFarlane et al. 2015). Particular attention should be paid to the conformation of the vulva, perineum and anus. A recessed anus, deviation of the long axis of the vulva from vertical and compromise to the vulvar, vestibulovaginal or cervical seals will predispose to pneumovagina/pneumouterus, urine pooling and faecal contamination of the reproductive tract. These anatomical defects are known risk factors for the development of fungal endometritis and must be addressed. Treatment Treatment of mares with fungal endometritis is multifaceted and includes correction of any anatomical defects, uterine lavage and systemic and/or intrauterine infusion of antifungals. Topical antifungal treatment of the vagina and clitoris is also advisable since fungal colonisation of the vagina and clitoral fossa and sinuses is a potential reservoir of infection. Uterine lavages should be performed to aid uterine clearance, decrease fungal load and to remove excessive mucus and potential bio lms. Suggested uterine lavage therapies include 20% N-Acetylcysteine solution, 20% 1967), 3% peroxide, Tris-EDTA, 2% acetic acid in combination with 0.9% sterile saline/lactated Ringer 's solution. Due to the risk of brosis and adhesion formation, dilute povidine-iodine should be used with great care. Anecdotally, nonspeci c uterine lavage therapies have been shown to be very effective in treating cases of fungal endometritis in the mare and should be considered as a rst- line treatment option whilst awaiting culture and sensitivity results ( Table 1 ). Fig 2: Ef fluent from a uterine lavage of a mare diagnosed fungal / AUGUST Ideally speci c antifungal sensitivity patterns should be determined prior to treatment, but due to limited availability and prolonged testing times, many cases are treated empirically whilst awaiting culture results. The two major classes of antifungals used are azoles and polyenes; their mechanism of action is to interfere with the cytoplasmic membrane of fungi. Polyenes bind to ergosterol and destabilise the membrane whereas azoles inhibit ergosterol are thought to be fungicidal and azoles fungistatic which may in part account for the increased resistance seen to azoles (Campoy and Adrio2017). Unfortunately, there is a lack of controlled studies in the literature regarding appropriate dose and duration of therapy required to treat fungal endometritis in the mare (Table 2 ). In an aim to improve treatment ef cacy, Beltaire et al. (2012) cultured 102 fungal isolates, from 92 uterine samples taken from mares with reproductive problems and determined in vitro susceptibility to commonly used antifungals. Yeast isolates were 100% sensitive to polyenes, were polyenes, but the susceptibility to azoles was signi cantly lower compared with the yeast isolates, with 54% of moulds showing resistance or intermediate susceptibility to itraconazole and 100% showing resistance to fluconazole. Hess et al. (2002) successfully treated four mares diagnosed with fungal endometritis caused by either Candida spp.orAspergillus spp. with a single intrauterine administration of 540 mg Lufenuron (Program/C2262). Lufenuron is thought to inhibit fungal growth by interfering with chitin biosynthesis. However, since not all fungal organisms have chitin in their cell walls, Lufenuron may not be effective in all cases. Scotty et al. (2005) failed to demonstrate in vitro antifungal activity against Aspergillus spp. and Hector et al. (2005) tested in vitro antifungal properties of lufenuron against isolates of Coccidioides immitis and Aspergillus fumigatus and found no evidence of inhibition, under experimental conditions. Weinstein et al. (2006) found the third-generation buffered chelator TricideTM,3to potentiate the antimicrobial effects in vitro of antifungal agents against isolates obtained from clinical cases of equine fungal keratitis. Whilst the use of chelating agents in fungal endometritis has not been studied to date, there is in vitro evidence to support their use in bacterial endometritis (Ferris et al. 2016). Oral administration of fluconazole (15 mg/kg bwt per os loading dose followed by 5 mg/kg bwt per os q. 24 h) has been shown to achieve endometrial concentrations near or above MIC for Candida albicans (Sco eldet al. 2011) and is well tolerated in the horse ( Table 3 ). Systemic treatment is recommended based on sensitivity patterns and may help with invasive forms that are not exposed to luminal therapies and reduce the risk of iatrogenic infection associated with Fig 5: a) Aspergillus spp. with Trichome stain. Fig 6: Endometrial biopsy stained with PAS showing Candida spp. lumen over uterine EVJ Ltd447 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / AUGUST intrauterine therapy. However, due to the widespread use of fluconazole, resistance is common and it is not recommended for treatment of fungal endometritis caused by moulds with septated hyphae, which have been shown to be 100% resistant (Beltaire et al. 2012). Chronic or recurrent cases of fungal endometritis often require multi-modal and repeated treatment and since concurrent bacterial infection is common, anticipation and subsequent management of bacterial endometritis is often indicated. Conclusion The prognosis for future fertility following fungal endometritis is guarded. Stout (2008) reported a resolution rate of approximately 20% per treatment cycle. Treatment failure and recurrence of the fungal organism are common, as is recontamination and concurrent bacterial endometritis. Unsuccessful treatment may result following inappropriate dose/duration and selection of antifungal agent, failure to treat reservoirs of infection and failure to correct predisposing conditions. Experience would suggest that early detection and treatment when the fungal organisms are still actively dividing increases the chance of treatment success. Attempts should be made following the resolution of infection to correct any anatomical defects, instigate minimal contamination breeding techniques, to reduce the risk of iatrogenic infection and to limit pre/post-mating antibiotic treatment to prevent altering the normal vaginal flora. In the event of treatment failure, a prolonged period of sexual rest may allow re-colonisation of the caudal reproductive tract with commensal flora and spontaneous resolution.
