I was just wondering if anyone has heard of the herbal medication for seizures called Epistill? I currently take 5 different medications and have had epilepsy since age 5. I absolutely dispise taking pills, even tylenol and would love to just quit my meds all together but of course that would not be wise. I'm just wondering if there are other ulternatives available that the doctors(neurologists) aren't tellings us. I don't want to end up taking meds for eternity which I'm afraid will happen anyway. Any thoughts or answers let me know.

Has anyone been taking it for more then a few months with sustained improvement? Does anyone know if it can be obtained in Europe, Britain or Ireland? I'm having some trouble finding it anywhere but on American websites, Thank you in advance. Does anyone have any updates or more information on Epistill?

Have you talked to the doctor about dietary therapies such as Atkins diet or ketogenic diet, devices? or surgery? Thanks for writing in and hope you find something to help! Have you talked to the doctor about dietary therapies such as Atkins diet or ketogenic diet, devices? or surgery? Re: on Thu, 2013-01-03 - 22:09 REALLY! Having an FDA approval does not mean something is safe or effective. I wish people would stop throwing those words around. The ingredients in Epi still are derived from natural sources and those ingredients are more time tested historically for easing the effects of seizures. There are FDA drugs for seizure control that have been found to contain aspertame (a known neurotoxin). The ketogenic diet has a formula called ketocal that contains APARTAME. I just found out the soy formula my daughter is on for her keto shakes is made from Genetically Modified Soy that we will all come to discover is no substitute for all natural organic soy that should be in her only food source. I contacted the company myself and asked directly if they used GM Soy and they said they use BIOTECH soy. I really wish people would stop insulting the intelligence of others. I also made it clear to them that sensitive individuals depend on their product as their sole nutrition and until there is absolute proof that GM soy is better than organicly grown I will continue to hold true that using BIOTECH soy is irresponsible. I know you mean well with what you said but I hope other folks will just employ their common sense and think outside of the pill case. These blog sites are a testiment to the growing discontent epilepsy sufferers have with taking multiple medications and no relief in sight. REALLY!

Re: Epistill Submitted by swdesu on Thu, 2009-06-18 - 17:10 north2ak, Thanks a lot for the info! I've been searching online and found Epi-Still as well. I didn't get much info out of and it seems not many people using it. I am glad it works for your daughter. is there any side-effect at all? My 8-year-old son has absence seizure and we haven't put him on medications yet after reading all the side-effects of those medicines. I'd like to try the Epi-Still too since it claims to be all natural. Thanks again for sharing your experience! north2ak, Thanks a lot for the info!

Re: Epistill Submitted by north2ak Submitted by myamelia on Thu, 2009-10-15 - 16:34 I just received my shipment of Epi-Still and was just wondering how much you give your child to start. The bottle says 1 drop per year of age, is that what you went by? Also how did you administer it? How long was your child on it, when you started to see some changes?

I applaud you for that comment! You just recited the exact conversation I had with my daughter`s first neurologist. When her father and I focused on nutrition and keeping our little girl healthy her seizures improved and with every dose decrease of useless medication they were reduced further which leads me to thing that seizures are a threshhold issue and that illness, parasites, viruses and bacteria and toxic build up in the body all lead to the root cause of idopathic epilepsy. I get it! I wish you continued progress. Wow! I applaud you for that comment! You just recited the exact conversation I had with my daughter`s first neurologist.
