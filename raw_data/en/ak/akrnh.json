Both ideals cause about finding the root cause of an issue so that a patient can be treated on a fundamental level. However, both schools of thought have different philosophies and steps they take to go about the process of treating a patient. Homeopathy and naturopathy reflect one another in a lot of ways but knowing the differences between homeopathy vs naturopathy creates a more holistic approach to life. Homeopathy vs Naturopathy While both homeopathy and naturopathy believe in providing non-invasive treatment for their patients there is one major difference. Homeopathy only uses its principles to treat the sick, while naturopathy uses homeopathy as one of its many tools to treat patients. Some naturopathic practitioners may use homeopathy more or less than one another, but overall homeopathy is a common tool used. Because naturopathic practitioner may use other forms of treatment besides homeopathy the ways of naturopathic doctor goes about their work changes from doctor to doctor. Here are some other more specific differences between homeopathy vs naturopathy that will help you make more informed health choices. Method of treatment Homeopathic treatments vary drastically from the treatment decisions made by naturopathic doctors; unless those naturopathic doctors use homeopathy themselves. Homeopathic practitioners intake procedures include discussing a patient's health history and the health history of their family. They also discuss lifestyle choices and how they've dealt with illness in the past. After these discussions, a homeopathic practitioner or a naturopathic practitioner who uses homeopathy will make a decision for treatment based on their patient's responses and symptoms. After diagnosing a person suffering from illness, homeopathy will treat these symptoms with a simple remedy. Acquiring plants and minerals naturally and diluting them to become micro-doses is how homeopathic remedies are made. Naturopathic doctors may start treatments with the same line of questioning but they can start treatment the same as any general physician. Their procedures will all vary. Naturopathy doesn't just consist of simple diluted remedies, it can also include all sorts of alternative and general medical tools as well. These methods include but are not limited too botanical medicine, physical medicine, hydrotherapy, diet and nutrition, therapy, exercise and lifestyle counseling. All naturopathy doctors will treat their patients differently and some will use more natural methods than others, so its best to do your research before consulting. Clinical degree Homeopathic practitioners in most states [need to be certified by a board](https://homeopathlasvegas.com/how-to-become-a-homeopathic-practitioner/), however, the laws change from state to state. Naturopathic doctors must first be trained in standard primary care in order to be certified however not all states require the same certifications. Homeopathic practitioners do not have to get their start in medicine but most states with homeopathic boards require some sort of medical training. In order to be complete training as a naturopathic physician, you must complete training similar to traditional medical school. However, you may also choose to study homeopathy while training to be a doctor as one of your choice forms of treatment. It's important to note that some states do not have a licensing process for naturopathic medical doctors, thus anyone can claim to be a naturopathic doctor. Philosophy Both homeopathy and naturopathy believe in preventative care, however, the stem of their philosophies are in different foundations. [ Homeopathy was founded](https://homeopathyusa.org/about-aih-2/our-heritage-our-future.html) in the mid-1800s on the foundation of treating symptoms. Naturopathy was founded in the 19th century on the foundation of combining many healthcare approaches to created on approach. Homeopathy believes in \"like cures like\" and do so by fighting the symptoms of an illness. Practitioners of homeopathy assert that symptoms are your body's way of explaining the steps needed to cure what's ailing you. Homeopathy believes that in treating the symptoms you can directly help your body fight diseases. Naturopathy follows 6 basic principles and uses whatever medical means they deem necessary to achieve these goals: - Primum Non Nocere (Do not harm) - This is the philosophy of using non-invasive and the least toxic treatments they can - Vis Medicatric Naturae (The healing power of science) - Like homeopaths, naturopathic doctors believe in the body's ability to heal itself - Tolle Causam (Identify and treat the cause) - Also similar to homeopathy, they find the underlying cause of the disease to address and remove it - Docere (Doctor as teacher) - The heavy believe that you should educate your patients so they can take responsibility of their own body while treating their issues - Tolle Totum (Treat the whole person) - This is the holistic principle that recognizes the effect of lifestyle, family history, mental and emotional factors affect the patient - Prevenic (Prevention) - A strong emphasis on overall healthcare to prevent future disease Both homeopathy and naturopathy practitioners believe in holistic lifestyles. Naturopathic ideals are very much founded in the same foundation as homeopathic methods of practice. This is why many naturopath doctors use homeopathy as one of their many tools.
