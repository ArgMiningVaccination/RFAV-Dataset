Your 5-day meal plan is filled with whole, unprocessed foods that are rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Here are some of the featured ingredients and their benefits for your body: - Plenty of fresh water - water helps flush out toxins from the body and is critical for helping the liver filter waste for the body. Also, your body uses water for all of its excretion functions. We'll begin each morning by drinking a glass of lemon water to aid digestion. - Fresh veggies - the fiber in vegetables supports healthy digestion, helping the body eliminate toxins. - Fruit - these foods that are high in antioxidants that fight free radicals and other toxins, therefore helping your body fight disease. - Garlic - besides being delicious (and my husband's favorite flavoring), garlic activates liver detoxifying enzymes and has antibacterial properties. - Olive oil - this healthy fat helps the body reduce harmful toxins and decreases levels of fat in the liver.

You can make the decision whether to add a protein-based on factors such as your calorie needs, grocery costs, whether you want more of a \"cleanse\" experience, and whether you're exercising during the detox.

As provided to you, this meal plan is free of the following: - Processed food - Refined sugar - Refined carbs - Meat - Dairy - Eggs - Alcohol - Caffeine However, you can and should customize this plan based on what you decide to focus on during your 5-day detox.

How To Successfully Complete A Detox Please remember that this detox is designed to be gentle! Be patient and kind with yourself and don't go to extremes with your meal plan. Here are a few tips for your comfort and success: - Drink plenty of pure, clean water throughout the 5 days (and beyond!). A good guideline to follow is to drink half your weight in ounces every day. So if you weigh 160 pounds, drink 80 ounces of water a day. That's the equivalent of 10 8-oz glasses of water. During the detox, you may find that you need even more water. - For tips on how to meet your daily water intake goals, see [7 Health Reasons to Drink More Water](https://gf-veg.com/why-drink-more-water/). - For tips on how to meet your daily water intake goals, see - If you choose to opt out of food and drink such as caffeine and sugar during the detox, try to gradually reduce your intake of these items in the days leading up to your 5-day meal plan. This will help reduce withdrawal symptoms such as headaches. - If you do experience headaches, drinking more water and resting may help alleviate your discomfort. - Are you feeling hunger pangs, even after eating all your allotted food for the day? Here are a few things to try: - Drink more water. - Add a healthy snack between morning and lunch. - Increase the portion of veggies in one of your meals. - Consult your doctor or nutritionist with questions or concerns. Post Detox Plan When you've completed the 5-day meal plan, take some time to reflect. What changes are you experiencing? Does your body feel different? Is there anything that you're craving less? Is there anything that you're craving more? The last time I practiced a short-term gentle detox diet, by the end of the third day, I felt lighter and leaner in my body. I had fewer cravings for sugar or snacks between meals, and I had more cravings for water and fresh veggies. These are all positive changes from my perspective. I hope you'll experience positive changes as well! As you transition back to a \"regular\" routine, think about any changes you want to incorporate from your gentle detox. For example, you might decide to cut down on processed foods or refined sugar on a long-term basis. Changes like these can help you achieve your health goals and feel better physically and mentally.
