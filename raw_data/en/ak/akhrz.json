Let's start with the good news, because that news is very good. Across the United States, vaccine hesitancy is going down, and it's going down relatively fast. For example, according to a recently released Pew Research Center survey, [69 percent of Americans](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/03/05/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-plan-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine--or-already-have/) have indicated that they've either already taken the vaccine or will definitely or probably take it in the future.

The bad news is that vaccine hesitancy breaks down sharply along partisan and religious lines, and that hesitancy is so profound in white Evangelical communities that it could disrupt the quest for herd immunity. On a partisan basis, white Republicans are among those least likely to take the vaccine. For example, here's a rather jolting "}
