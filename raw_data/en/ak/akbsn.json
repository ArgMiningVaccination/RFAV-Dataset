Hospitalization and death data are those displayed on the Alaska Cases Dashboard . Vaccine breakthrough infections and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children statistics are produced with additional data collected by the Section of Epidemiology (SOE) . This report is not designed t o track the burden of COVID -19 on hospitals; other data sources, such as HHS Protect or facility -level statistics may be more appropriate for those questions. It is likely that some hospitalizations are missing from these data, particularly more recent eve nts. Data included are not final ; efforts to increase completion and ensure data quality are ongoing and these numbers will change. Additional ly, more detailed summaries and reports will be produced in the future. Data are for cases from March 2020 through July 2021. Hospitalizations As a matter of process, SOE removes hospitalizations that are not due to COVID -19; for example, asymptomatic behavioral health patients or laboring mothers tested on admission are excluded. A total of 1712 hospitalizatio ns with a known admission date among Alaska residents were included in this analysis (Figure 1) . For people with multiple admissions, the most severe/longer admission was counted. Regions were assigned by each patient 's home region, not hospital location. Figure 1. COVID -19 hospital admissions among Alaska residents by month of admission \u2014 March 2020 through July 2021 Demographics During March 2020 through July 2021, t he mean age of hospitalized persons was 61 years (range : 1 month to 98 years ). For patients admitted in 2020, the mean age was 62 years (range: 1 month to 98 years). For patients admitted in 2021, the mean age was 59 years (range: 1 month to 98 years). Hospitalizations by sex and race are shown in Table 1. 050100150200250300350Number of Hospitalizations 2 Table 1.

Severity Indicators This summary includes 1388 hospitalizations among Alaska residents . Only hospitalization records for which both admi ssion and discharge date had been entered are included . This restriction allows severity indicators and length of stay to be more adequately described but results in an undercount of total hospitalizations, especially those that occurred more recently. Tables 2 and 3 show severity indicators by all hospitalizations and hospitalizations with a fatality. Table 2.

This analysis is restricted to 1388 patients for whom both an admission and discharge date have been entered. Patients who were admitted and discharged on the same day were counted as one day of hospitalization. Similarly, patients who were intubated and extubated on the same day were counted as one day of ventilation. Data for 2021 are likely missing patients who have been admitted for a long time, as they do not yet have a discharge date. Table 4.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children Twelve children hospitalized with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS -C) have been reported to the Alaska Section of Epidemiology since the beginning of the pandemic . MIS -C is defined by fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and evidence of clinically severe illness req uiring hospitalization with multisystem organ involvement . The definition requires that the patient is <21 years of age with current or recent SARS -CoV-2 infection or exposure to a suspected or confirmed COVID -19 case within the 4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms and n o alternative plausible diagnoses . Four of the 12 children met the MIS-C case definition because of a positive antibody test, so they are not included in the above desciption of SARS -CoV-2 positive hospitalized patients; the other eight were included in analysis of that patient population provided above. Six of the 12 children were female. Seven were aged 0 -4 years at the time of admission , three were aged 5 -10 years, and two were aged 11 -20 years. Three children had a pre -existing condition. All children were admitted to the hospital , and seven were admitted to an intensive care unit. No ne of the children have died. Deaths Methods Deaths are counted as COVID -19-related in accordance with national standards. This process includes auditing death certificates to verify that COVID -19 was included as a primary or contributory cause of death, medical records review, or provider determinat ion that the cause of death was COVID -19 based on laboratory testing and a consistent clinical presentation (e.g., respiratory signs and symptoms, fever or chills, and fatigue). Underlying conditions were determined by contact tracers and data analysts dur ing interviews and records reviews. Rates were calculated using Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Developm ent population estimates and are listed per 100,000 person -years . Cases are attributed geographically to their permanent residence, which may o r may not correlate to location of exposure, illness, or death. All data are preliminary , subject to change, and were congruent with public state data displays as of August 25, 2021 . 4 Results From January 1 , 2020 through July 31 , 2021, Alaska recorded 399 COVID -19-related deaths for a statewide death rate of 34.7 per 100,000 person -years (Figure 2) . For this same period, the US death rate was 185 per 100,000 person -years . Of these 3 92 deaths, 316 (79.2%) were known to have been hospitalized and 169 (42.3%) had been admitted to an intensive care unit. Figure 2. COVID -19 deaths and cases by month among Alaska residents - January 2020 through July 31, 2021 Note: Data are shown beginning in March, which was the first month in which there was a death in an Alaskan resident that was attributed to COVID -19.

Most COVID -19 hospitalizations in Alaska could have been prevented by vaccination. COVID -19 cases have become more common among fully vaccinated persons than the y were in the initial months after vaccine roll -out. CDC recommends that fully vaccinated persons wear masks in public indoor settings in areas with substantial to high community transmission. Introduction COVID -19 vaccines were first administered in Alas ka in mid -December 2020. In March 2021, all persons who lived or worked in Alaska and were 16 years old became eligible for vaccination. After the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was authorized for persons aged 12 years, eligibility was expanded accordingly in M ay 2021 to anyone aged 12 years. Randomized clinical trials showed conclusively that COVID -19 vaccines provide strong protection against symptomatic COVID -19. Subsequent observational studies have confirmed this finding in numerous real -world settings and have further demonstrated that COVID -19 vaccines reduce the risk of infection with SARS -CoV-2 and prevent COVID -19 hospitalizations and deaths.1 Methods A vaccine recipient is considered fully vaccinated 14 days after receiving the second dose in a two -dose series (e.g., Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna) or a single dose in a one -dose series (e.g., Johnson & Johnson / Janssen). Cases of COVID - 19 that occur in fully vaccinated persons are classified as \"vaccine breakthrough\" (VB) cases. All case and hospitalizati ons data were obtained from the Section of Epidemiology's case -based surveillance system. COVID -19 vaccination status of each reported case was determined by queries of VacTrAK, Alaska's immunization information system, and supplemented by reports from cas e investigators. Hospitalizations were reported by case investigators and hospitals. Medical records were reviewed to determine if COVID -19 was a cause of the hospitalization or if COVID -19 was an incidental finding (e.g., a patient was admitted for labor and delivery or a traumatic injury). Only the former hospitalizations are included in this analysis. This analysis is limited to data on Alaska residents; vaccination 6 status of non -residents diagnosed in Alaska cannot be consistently ascertained. All data and analyses are preliminary and subject to change. Both cases and hospitalizations were attributed to date of specimen collection in all analyses. This date was used because it corresponds most closely to the definition of vaccine breakthrough. For example, if a person tested positive 12 days after completing the vaccination series, that would not be counted as a vaccine breakthrough case and, consequently, neither would a subsequent hospitalization due to COVID -19, even if the hosp italization itself occurred 14 or more days after series completion. When specimen collection date was unknown, confirmation date (the date the case was counted) was used instead. To calculate COVID -19 case and hospitalization incidence rates for fully vac cinated and for not fully vaccinated persons, VacTrAK data and 2020 Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development population estimates were used to infer the number of fully vaccinated (both overall and by specific vaccine manufacturer) and not full y vaccinated residents by age group for each day from January 16, 2021, through July 31, 2021. Age -adjustment was performed via direct standardization to the Alaska resident population age 12 years and older using the following age categories: 12 - 19, 20 -24, 25-29, ... 85 -89, and 90 years.2 Ninety -five percent confidence intervals were calculated using gamma distributions.3 Results Vaccine breakthrough cases over time Through the end of July 2021, a total of 18 90 vaccine breakthrough COVID -19 cases were docu mented among Alaska residents (Table 8). Table 8.

January 16, 2021 was the first date that any Alaska residents were fully vaccinated. The incidence of COVID -19 among vaccinated persons has been consistently lower than among persons who were not fully vaccinated (Figure 2). 7 Figure 3. Weekly age -adjusted per capita incidence of COVID -19 among Alaska residence 12 years -old by vaccination status (fully vaccinated versus not fully vaccinated). Data are shown beginning the week of February 28, 2021, which was the first week in which at le ast 20 vaccine breakthrough cases were documented. Incidence rate estimates from weeks with very few or no VB cases are imprecise. Vaccine breakthrough cases by age Vaccine breakthrough cases occurred during July 2021 among Alaskans of all ages (Table 9). Table 9.

Vaccine breakthrough cases , by manufacturer Among Alaska residents aged 20 -59 years, the incidence of COVID -19 during July 2021 was lower among persons who were fully vaccinated with each of the th ree FDA -authorized vaccines compared to persons who were not fully vaccinated. The incidence rate ratio adjusted for age, calendar day, and region was largest when comparing not fully vaccinated persons to persons fully vaccinated with the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine (IRR: 3.9; 95% CI: CI: 1.8 1 2.7) vaccines . 8 Vaccine breakthrough hospitalizations Among vaccine breakthrough cases with specimen collection date on or prior to July 31, 2021, 4 9 hospitalizations due to COVID -19 were documented (Table 10). While both the number and proportion of hospitalizations among fully vaccinated persons was higher in July than any previous month, fully vaccinated persons were still much less likely to be hospitalized due to COVID -19 than persons who were not fully vaccinated (Figure 4). Adjusted for age, region, and calendar day, the incidence of hospitalization among persons who were not fully vaccinated was 8.8 (95% CI: 5.7, 13. 6) times higher than the incidence among fully vaccinated persons, based on COVID -19 cases with specimen collection date in July and hospitalizations documented as of August 23, 2021. For hospitalizations with specimen collection date between January 16 and J une 30, 2021, the adjusted incidence rate ratio was 19.0 (95% CI: 11.0, 33.0 ). Among Alaska residents 12 years -old with specimen collection dates in July who were hospitalized due to COVID -19, the median age among those who were fully vaccinated was 71.7 years, and the median age of those who were not fully vaccinated was 57.7 years .

Age-adjusted incidence of hospitalization due to COVID -19 among Alaska residents aged 12 years by vaccination status (f ully vaccinated versus not fully vaccinated), stratified by hospitalizations among COVID -19 cases with first positive specimen collected from January 16 through June 3 0 or during July 2021. 9 Vaccine breakthrough deaths Of the 1 7 COVID -19 deaths that occurre d during July 2021 and were documented as of August 24, 2021, 4 occurred in fully vaccinated person s. Death data are delayed and incomplete due to technical limitations in processing vital records. Death data will be further analyzed in future reports. Discussion COVID -19 vaccines continue to be our most important tool to prevent COVID -19 cases and severe outcomes such as hospitalizations and deaths. The proportion of COVID -19 cases that occurred in fully vaccinated persons was larger in July 2021 than in previous months. Multiple factors determine the proportion of documented COVID -19 cases among fully vaccinated persons. When the proportion of the population that is fully vaccinated is higher, the expected proportion of cases among fully vaccinated per sons is also larger. Also, as more cases of COVID occur among unvaccinated persons, the proportion of the unvaccinated population that is susceptible to infection goes down , and the expected proportion of cases in this group goes down . Another important fa ctor is that waning immunity occur s over time. Waning immunity tends to occur more quickly in o lder people , which might contribute to increasing VB hospitalization rates because older people are known to be at increased risk for COVID hospitalization . Moreover , moderately or severely immunocompromised people don't always build the same level of immunity after vaccination the way non -immunocompromised people do , and they are now advised to receive an additional dose to ensure adequate protection against COVID -19. These individuals might also disproportionately contribute to higher VB hospitalizations in recent months. Finally, declines in vaccine effectiveness can lead to a n increasing proportion of COVID -19 cases among fully vaccinated persons. The Delta variant rapidly became the dominant SARS -CoV-2 variant in Alaska during June and July and reductions in vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant likely also contribu ted to the increased proportion of vaccine breakthrough cases. The data presented here were collected for public health surveillance purposes and may be subject to unmeasured confounding and bias. For example, persons who were fully vaccinated and not ful ly vaccinated may differ in their adherence to COVID -19 mitigation measures (e.g., mask wearing and avoiding indoor crowded spaces). Moreover, the magnitude of these differences may vary over time. Additionally, COVID -19 cases among fully vaccinated person s may be more likely to be detected than COVID -19 cases among persons who are not fully vaccinated (e.g., health care workers are more likely to be vaccinated than the general population and may be more likely to get tested) , which would artificially incre ase the proportion of detected cases among fully vaccinated persons. Finally, as mentioned above, infection -induced immunity may build up in the unvaccinated population faster than in the vaccinated population, thereby making vaccination appear less effect ive.5 The magnitude of bias and confounding may differ across settings and consequently direct comparisons to data from other jurisdictions or to prospective evaluations of vaccine effectiveness are difficult. Additionally, this analysis is not a formal ev aluation of vaccine effectiveness in that it compares fully vaccinated persons versus not fully vaccinated persons, a category which includes both unvaccinated and partially vaccinated persons , and it does not account for differential testing rates that mi ght occur between vaccinated and unvaccinated people . It is biologically implausible that COVID -19 vaccines would perform differently in Alaska compared to other parts of the United States. Interpreting differences in COVID -19 incidence by vaccine manufact urer is challenging because persons who received one type of COVID -19 vaccine may systematically differ from persons who received a different type. For example, the Pfizer vaccine was available before the Moderna vaccine and so health care workers and pers ons in long -term care facilities may have been more likely to have receive d it. However, restricting the comparison of manufacturers to persons age d 20-59 years should limit the extent to which bias may reflect the use of a particular vaccine in long -term care facilities. Further research is needed to better understand the long -term effectiveness of each COVID -19 vaccine. 10 COVID -19 vaccines in Alaska remain very protective against COVID -19 illness and tremendously protective against hospitalization and death . The level of protection of vaccination against hospitalization observed among Alaskans in July is similar to recent estimates from a large national COVID -19 hospitalization case control study.6 The vast majority of COVID -19 hospitalizations that occurred among persons who tested positive in Alaska could have been prevented through vaccination. Considering emerging evidence on vaccine breakthrough cases and the potential for onward transmission from breakthrough infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended on July 27, 2021, that all persons, including fully vaccinated persons, wear a mask when in public indoor settings in locations experiencing substantial or high levels of community transmission.7 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and CDC recommend that persons wh o are moderately or severely immunocompromised receive a third dose of an mRNA vaccine at least 28 days after receiving the second dose.8 Additionally, the US government has announced a plan to offer booster doses beginning 6 months after receiving the pri mary vaccine series starting on September 20, 2021.9 References 1.
