Methods: The information of patients of COVID-19 infectious pneumonia in the hospital were collected and analyzed, including the admission time, the discharge time, therapeutic method, and therapeutic effect after treatment. Results: A total of 10 cases patients of COVID-19 infectious pneumonia were collected, there were 5 male patients and 5 female patients, the age ranged from 16-54 years old and the average age was 34.2 years old; the body temperature of 6 cases patients were higher than 37\u00b0C when they were admitted to hospital; CT results showed that all the patients had infectious lesions of both lungs, and the results of nucleic acid test were positive. 5 million (aerosol inhalation) recombinant interferon (Lopinavir/Ritonavir or Lopinavir/Ritonavir/Abidol) combined with traditional Chinese medicine could alleviate effectively symptoms of COVID-19 infectious pneumonia within a month, the body temperature of patients returned to normal, respiratory symptoms improved significantly, COVID-19 nucleic acid test was negative, and results of lung imaging was also normal. Conclusion: Lopinavir/Ritonavir or Lopinavir/Ritonavir/Abidol combined with Traditional Chinese medicine has a good effect on relieving the symptoms of COVID-19 infected pneumonia and has significance for clinical treatment or clinic remission of COVID-19 infectious pneumonia. </p>", "sitename": "ScienceOpen", "date": "2022-01-18", "cleaned_text": "analyze the basic information, symptoms, therapeutic method and therapeutic effect of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infected pneumonia patients in the hospital in northern Henan Province from January 2020 to April 2020, to provide evidences for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infectious pneumonia.
