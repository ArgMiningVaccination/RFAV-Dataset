Promensil is created out of isoflavones found in red clovers. Isoflavones are a class of organic compounds that act as both hormones and antioxidants when introduced to your body. Promensil combines the isoflavones extracted from red clover leaves with other vitamins and minerals, such as calcium and vitamin D-3, to create a supplement that may help relieve menopause symptoms including hot flashes, night sweats and anxiety. Several side effects of Promensil use have been reported. Consult your physician before using Promensil to treat menopausal symptoms. Digestive Side Effects Women may have trouble digesting some of the chemical compounds found inside the Promensil capsule, resulting in nausea, upset stomach and diarrhea [1](#). Women may have difficulty absorbing the active ingredients in Promensil, specifically the isoflavones extracted from red clovers. Certain women may also have difficulty absorbing calcium, which can increase the symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. If you experience diarrhea while taking Promensil, consult your physician immediately. Hormonal Side Effects Promensil may have hormonal effects on your body, primarily due to the vitamin D-3 within this medication [1](#). Vitamin D is fat-soluble, meaning if you ingest too much, you may experience toxicity, typically observed by an imbalance of your body's hormones. Vitamin D-3 helps regulate the production of neurotransmitters in your brain, which may be off balance due to a high vitamin D intake [1](#). This may increase the symptoms of depression, anxiety, nervousness and confusion. Taking Promensil with an additional vitamin D supplement is not recommended because of the risk of vitamin D overdose [1](#). Physical Side Effects The isoflavones contained within Promensil may have physical side effects which, while not fatal, may have an effect on your physical appearance [1](#). The isoflavones may cause signs of jaundice, or the occurrence of a yellowish pigmentation of your skin or your eyes. You may also experience a darkening of your urine associated with a decreased urine output, which is another symptom of jaundice. This may be due to the excess stress that isoflavones may place on your liver. If you have liver disease, taking Promensil is not recommended, as you may increase the risk of jaundice or further liver damage. Allergic Reaction Although a rare occurrence, some women supplementing with Promensil may experience an allergic reaction, which constitutes a medical emergency. An allergic reaction to Promensil is typically a result of hypersensitivity to the isoflavones in the red clover leaf extract [1](#). Symptoms of an allergic reaction include, but are not limited to, the appearance of a rash, hives, itching or swelling of your face and mouth, difficulty breathing or swelling of your tongue [1](#). If you experience any of these symptoms while supplementing with Promensil, seek medical care immediately.
