Let us give your immune system the best opportunity for success! Our IV blends contain vitamins, antioxidants, and nutrients that are designed to target specific areas of the body while they hydrate, energize and help recover your body's cells from the inside out. The immune system is a network of intricate pathways that protects the body by recognizing foreign invaders like bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Making sure this organ system is as strong as possible promises you the best fighting chance to ward off harmful microbes and diseases! Benefits: IV Ingredients: Recommended Add-On: Amino Acids Your body relies on minerals and nutrients to function at its best. IV therapy is the most efficient way to receive the vitamins you need, because once they're transported into your bloodstream, they are absorbed immediately. Iowa IV provides fluids and nutrients through a catheter, which rapidly replenishes fluids, electrolytes, and vitamins from an arm vein. Unlike the average supplement, our catheters deliver 100% of the ingredients directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract, which can slow absorption and diminish the potency of ingredients. IV DURATION: A typical liter IV takes around 30-45 minutes. However, the exact duration varies depending on you and your unique goals.
