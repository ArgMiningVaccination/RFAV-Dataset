Alternative medicines rely solely on non-traditional treatments, while integrative medicines use traditional treatments (such as pharmaceuticals) and non-traditional methods (such as acupuncture). In addition to different treatments for various ailments, alternative medicines focus on treating specific symptoms. In contrast, integrative medicines treat the whole person\u2014mind, body, and spirit\u2014to achieve optimal health outcomes. Complementary Versus Alternative Therapies More than a third of adults and nearly a twelfth of children in the United States use healthcare practices that are generally not part of mainstream medical care or that may have origins outside of usual Western practice, according to a national poll conducted in 2012. People sometimes use the terms \"alternative\" and \"complementary\" interchangeably when describing these methods. However, they actually refer to different ideas: It is called \"complementary\" when an alternative method is employed in addition to mainstream medicine. An \"alternative\" medical practice employs methods outside the mainstream in place of conventional treatment. It's not uncommon for those who choose alternative treatments to rely on mainstream medicine simultaneously. You may have heard the term \"functional medicine\" thrown around in addition to \"complementary and alternative medicine.\" The phrase occasionally indicates an approach to healthcare synonymous with \"integrative health\" (described below). However, it could also mean something more like naturopathy (a 19th-century European medical system that has evolved from a combination of traditional practices and healthcare approaches ). Difference Between Functional Medicine & Integrative Medicine Two of the most rapidly developing forms of medical treatment include functional and integrative medicine, which strive to meet your physical, emotional, and mental requirements. While functional medicine focuses on generating personalized therapies designed to treat underlying causes of illness, integrative medicine strives to understand the individual. It employs multiple forms of therapy to achieve wellness. While both functional and integrative medicine is similar, they offer unique differences that can help you toward healthy living.
