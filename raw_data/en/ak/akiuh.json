What Are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) And Autism? ASD and autism are both general terms for the group of complex disorders of brain development that make up the autism spectrum. The disorders themselves are characterized, in many varying degrees, by difficulties in things such as: - Social interaction; - Verbal communication; - Nonverbal communication; - Repetitive behavior. Autism Spectrum Disorder can be more commonly associated with intellectual disabilities, difficulties in motor coordination and attention, and physical health issues (I.e. sleep and gastrointestinal disturbances), and may excel in certain visual skills, such as music or art. Autism, however, appears to occur in early development of the brain, with the most obvious signs emerging between 2 and 3 years of age. It's important to remember that each person with autism is unique; many of the individuals on the autism spectrum have exceptional abilities in visual skills, and about 40% have average to above average intellectual abilities, and some on the spectrum have a significant disability and may be unable to live independently. How Essential Oils Can Help With the awareness of autism becoming more and more of a priority, so too increases the number of essential oils aimed at improving mental and physical health, and they are quickly becoming popular for use in the treatment of children and individuals with autism. To do this, you must first identify the oils that help maintain accuracy and focus, and the ones which allow the mind to react positively and maintain contact with its surroundings. Certain essential oils can also help to ground and unite the body, mind, and spirit with reality, while simultaneously encouraging positive energy in times of restlessness, stress, or unease. I can't stress enough, again, how each person on the autism spectrum is unique in their own way and how their disorder works. Because of this, not all essential oils may work with a certain person, so everyone should be treated on an individual basis. So - what are the [essential oils](https://organicaromas.com/collections/pure-essential-oils-for-aromatherapy) that may help with autism? - Cedarwood: This essential oil works to help stimulate the pituitary and pineal glands, and can also aid in the natural raising of melatonin levels.
