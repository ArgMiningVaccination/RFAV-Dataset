Respecting the healing power of nature and recognizing that body, mind and spirit are intrinsically inseparable, Bastyr University models an integrated approach to education, research and clinical service.Mission Vision Accreditation Bastyr University offers a multitude of internships, research projects, and opportunities for clinical training, travel and multidisciplinary electives. Our students don't just read about mind, body, spirit connection \u2014 they live it. As the world's leading academic center for advancing and integrating knowledge in the natural health arts and sciences, Bastyr University will transform the health and well-being of the human community. Bastyr University is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, an institutional accrediting body recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. In addition, all of Bastyr University's professional degree programs are accredited by their respective accrediting bodies. Honoring a Legacy: THe JoHn Bas Tyr cenT enniaL ceLeBra TionEducation Bastyr University offers 18 baccalaureate, master's and doctoral degree programs, along with two certificate programs, in the following areas of study: Acupuncture and Oriental medicine Ayurvedic sciences Counseling psychology Exercise science Health psychology Herbal sciences Holistic landscape design Integrated human biology Midwifery Naturopathic medicine Nutrition In 2012, Bastyr University engaged in a yearlong celebration of the 100th anniversary of Dr. Bastyr's birth, commemorating his impact on the modern natural health movement. The festivities culminated in the unveiling of the John Bastyr Legacy Wall, which details his life commitment to naturopathic medicine.3As record numbers of students flock to natural medicine schools and the ranks of holistic health care providers grow, we at Bastyr University look back fondly, appreciate the present and focus on the future. HUMBLE BEGINNINGS Those new to natural medicine may not remember our early struggles to gain mainstream understanding, credibility and acceptance. However, in a short time we have dispelled myths and converted skeptics. Within just the past decade, we have seen a substantial shift in the growth and following of integrative medicine. In that time, Bastyr University has nearly doubled its core faculty, grown student enrollment to more than 1,000, added five new degree programs and opened a new campus and clinic in San Diego. Other natural medicine schools across the country are experiencing similar growth. This expansion highlights how much has changed and how quickly it has happened. It signals our acceptance by the larger medical community and serves as an exclamation point that we are here to stay. POSITIVE MOMENTUM A preventive health movement is afoot, focusing on living longer and better lives by returning to basics when it comes to the lifestyle elements of food, fitness, sleep and stress. We are seeing more people learn to take control of their well-being. Major corporations, health insurance companies and the government are all witnessing the financial benefits of disease prevention. With about 4,300 licensed naturopathic doctors (NDs) in the United States and more states considering licensure every month, NDs are now a more accessible patient option than ever before. The number of registered dietitians, licensed acupuncturists, midwives and mental health counselors is also growing, and health insurance companies increasingly cover \"integrative\" treatments. The people have spoken, and what they want is integrative care. A BRIGHT FUTURE We are living in a new era, when the tenets of natural medicine are synonymous with the wants and needs of patients. The Affordable Care Act is likely to expand the role of licensed natural health providers to one that works collaboratively with the allopathic medical community. Concurrently, schools for the natural health arts and sciences \u2014 like Bastyr University \u2014 will continue to grow. We have a bright future ahead \u2014 thanks to our two campuses, strong research institute, highly ranked clinical services, ever-expanding academic programs, expert faculty and dedicated students. It is remarkable to observe how much has occurred so quickly. We value all that has happened and is happening still, and we look forward to the developments yet to unfold in the coming months and years. Daniel K. Church, PhD Samuel L. Anderson, JD President, Bastyr University Chair, Bastyr University Board of Trustees researc H To date, more than 100 integrative research studies have been completed or are under way, many of which garner funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).Bastyr University is the world's leading academic center for natural health arts and sciences. The first regionally accredited school of its kind, the University was founded in 1978 as a college of naturopathic medicine. In 201 2, Bastyr University California opened in San Diego, becoming the state's only accredited school of naturopathic medicine. Bastyr University combines an integrative curriculum with leading-edge research and clinical training to educate future leaders in a multitude of natural health professions. A DIVERSE COMMUNIT y OF SCHOLARS Bastyr University students vary widely in age, culture and experience, yet all share a commitment to improving people's health. The student body hails from all 50 U.S. states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and 34 additional countries. With more than 1,000 motivated students, dedicated faculty members and two impressive campuses, there is no better place to become a leader in the field of natural health.

Students are taught to con- sider whole-person health and embrace interdisciplinary collaboration. Bastyr University's faculty members are natural health experts; many are nationally and internationally recognized. They publish in peer-reviewed journals; provide expert health advice to the media; conduct evidence-based natural medicine research; train future researchers; and prepare students to work alongside a wide variety of practitioners. Visit www.Bastyr.edu/Academics RESEARCH IN THE NATURAL HEALTH ARTS AND SCIENCES The Bastyr University Research Institute's clinical and laboratory investigations develop the principles and practices of natural, integrated and complementary medicine. Bastyr University was the first natural medicine institution to establish a research laboratory, was the first naturopathic school to re- ceive funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and currently hosts a number of multimillion-dollar NIH studies. The Bastyr Integrative Oncology Research Center investigates in- tegrative cancer treatments through evidence-based studies with part - ners at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington. Students benefit from the Center for Student Research (CSR), which fosters student research opportunities and related funding. Every year many Bastyr University students take advantage of the services offered by the CSR, presenting research posters to other professionals in the field at conferences. Several students go on to publish their research findings, with a select few featured in peer-reviewed publications. Visit www.Bastyr.edu/ResearchCLINICAL TRAINING AND COMMUNIT y HEALTH Because Bastyr University places effective clinical train- ing at the core of health education, graduate and first-professional students train at the University's teaching clinics: Bastyr University Clinic in San Diego and Bastyr Center for Natural Health in Seattle, where clinical faculty members emphasize an integrative approach to healing. The University also works with local organizations to offer health care at rural and urban community care sites, where clinical students work with a broad spectrum of patients and health concerns, further preparing them to be successful health care providers. Some naturopathic students also go on to complete post-graduate residencies at sites around the country, including Bastyr Center. Students from all disciplines have multiple opportunities to take their classroom learning into the real world. Internships, preceptorships, study-abroad opportunities, observation hours and volunteer activities in a range of settings help round out their education and guide them to becoming confident and competent health and wellness leaders. Visit www.BastyrCenter.org and www.BastyrClinic.org INTERDISCIPLINAR y INTEGRATION Effective education spans boundaries. The University's approach to wellness integrates body, mind, spirit and nature. Its academic programs integrate classroom learning, clinical training and service learning. Its faculty members serve as teachers, practitioners and researchers. Its students learn a multi-disciplinary approach to patient treatment. And its alumni collaborate in clinical settings every day, manifesting the integration of natural medicine with conventional medicine. In support of Bastyr University's commitment to multidisciplinary explo- ration and scientific inquiry, the Center for Mind, Body, Spirit and Nature* offers academic electives and public events on such topics as contemplative practices in medicine, leadership and compassionate social activism. *Formerly the Center for Spirituality, Science and MedicineCore Themes 5\"I'm proud of our students and their academic achievements. Graduates of both our clinical and professional practice programs frequently outrank national averages in exam passage rates.\" \u2014 Susan L. Weider VP and Dean of Student Services \"The Center for Student Research made it possible for me to work on my research as a medical student. I've presented my research at conferences, where I've won awards and connected with researchers outside of Bastyr University. CSR provided opportunities for me to solidify my research education and gain confidence.\" \u2014 Renee Y. Choi, ND ('13) Natural Supplements Research Competition award recipient, 2013 NIH training award grant recipient, 2010 \"Bastyr University plays a significant role in the evolution of a fully integrative health care system, one with a focus on prevention and wellness; it offers its students innovative areas of study in the field of natural health, delivered with academic excellence and sensitivity to the health and well-being of each student.\" \u2014 Leonard A. Wisneski, MD, FACP Clinical Professor of Medicine, George Washington University Medical Center Faculty, Georgetown University and University of Colorado \"My daughter is here today because of the fertility care I received at Bastyr Center.\" \u2014 Danielle, acupuncture patient Bastyr Center for Natural Health 6Tomorrow's Health Care Leaders Nearly 5,000 Bastyr University graduates have gone on to serve locally, nationally and internationally. More than 40 percent of the University's alumni live and work in the Puget Sound area, where they have created hundreds of business enterprises ranging from natural medicine practices to products such as the very popular, nutritious and successful Zing\u00ae bars. More than 500 naturopathic physicians, over 300 acupuncturists and over 100 nutritionists practice in the Seattle area. Bastyr University's naturopathic doctoral (ND) students are highly competitive. In 201 2, ND students from the California campus won the coveted Judge's Pick prize in an ND student video contest sponsored by the Association of Accredited Naturopathic Medical Colleges. In 2013, the ND student team from the Wash-ington campus took home the ZRT Cup grand prize from a fast and furious collegiate bowl competition. Bastyr's University nutrition students also dis- tinguish themselves: One recent graduate became the first nutrition professional to be named a University of Washington Leader - ship Education in Adolescent Health (LEAH) Fellow, another won a Fulbright Scholarship, and a third was named the Washington State Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics 201 2 Out - standing Student in a Didactic Program.Enrollment Growth Bastyr University sustains steady and healthy year-over-year growth; over the past five years total student enrollment has grown by 10 percent, and new student enrollment by 34 percent. These students not only choose to enroll at Bastyr University \u2014 they choose to stay. The University maintains a five-year running 81-83 percent retention rate, significantly higher than the national average. Academic Growth Dedicated to providing a spec-trum of academic programs to meet the evolving needs of health care practitioners, Bastyr University has more than doubled its degree programs in the past decade. In 2013, the University estab-lished the school of Traditional World Medi-cines, and in the past two years alone it has laid the groundwork for new academic pro-grams in four distinct areas of study: Master of Science in Ayurvedic Sciences Master of Arts in Counseling Psychology Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (San Diego campus) Master of Science in Nutrition for Wellness (San Diego campus) Local Impact: Building a Healthy and Sustainable CommunityThe individuals of the Bastyr community \u2014 graduates, students, faculty and staff \u2014 are always looking for ways to make an impact in their own back yard. The Bastyr University Kenmore campus works hand in hand with city officials to nurture a community where natural health resources can thrive. The clinics in both San Diego and Seattle engage in community outreach, offering free health screenings, lectures and events, giving many people their first experience with natural medicine. Bastyr University's community education programs provide a valuable resource for its neighbors, teaching life skills that enhance their well-being. Topics range from aromather - apy and yoga to whole-food cooking and how to treat diabetes naturally. Expanding a Geographic FootprintBastyr University's San Diego campus has marked a significant advancement \u2014 not only for the University, but for the naturopathic educational com-munity. Bastyr University California is drawing passionate and highly qualified students: After less than two years in operation it has become necessary to expand the campus. The recent expansion included additional clinic space, a nutrition teaching kitchen and a botanical medicine laboratory.Impact Students at Bastyr University are driven by the need to help their fellow human beings. That drive takes countless forms, from community outreach programs and local clinics, to international aid efforts and multi-modality collaborations. \"As Kenmore's largest employer, Bastyr University represents a tremendous asset and a springboard for natural health-related businesses that we want to encourage and grow. The City and the region benefit from the University's leadership and commitment to the community, and we are proud of our partnership.\" \u2014 Rob Karlinsey, City Manager City of Kenmore, Washington The s an Diego campus offers Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine and Master of Science in Nutrition for Wellness pro- grams, along with childbirth education and doula training through the Bastyr University Simkin Center for Allied Birth Vocations. Additional degree programs will be developed in the coming years.

Learning adventures include: Spa Medicine in Germany Herbal Medicine in Italy Botanical Studies in Costa Rica Natural Doctors International in Nicaragua In keeping with its core values, Bastyr Univer - sity has become a member of United Nations Academic Impact (UNAI), a global initiative that aligns institutions of higher education with the United Nations in actively supporting 10 universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, literacy, sustainability and con- flict resolution. 2013 commencement speaker, professor of public health Jorge Jim\u00e9nez de la Jara, MD, MPH, returned from his Bastyr University visit to Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile de- termined to share what he had learned. Now, having developed a Chilean national task force on natural medicine, he is on sabbatical at Ba-styr University. As former chairman of World Health Organization's (WHO) Executive Board, Professor Jim\u00e9nez is no stranger to affecting global health policy, and his strong interest in Bastyr University will likely lead to exciting de- velopments. Social Justice and Cultural CompetenceBastyr University recognizes that effective clinicians must also be culturally aware clinicians. The University offers courses in multiculturalism and social justice for its students, intensive diversity training for its faculty, and culture-specific events for commu-nity members \u2014 resulting in a campus culture which prides itself on the acceptance of diver - sity and the promotion of equity. Natural Health AdvocacyLaunched in 201 1, the Bastyr University Center for Health Policy and Leadership advances the understanding and development of key health care initiatives through policy educa-tion, evidence-based research, effective lead-ership building and advocacy training. Through engagement in health policy and public af - fairs, the Center encourages and educates future leaders to become active and effective in improving the health and well-being of the human community. Students and faculty members from both cam - puses join health care reform advocates for an annual trip to Washington, DC, to participate in the DC Federal Legislative Initiative (FLI). As a Partner for Health member, Bastyr Uni- versity actively contributes to the Integrated Healthcare Policy Consortium (IHPC), which advocates for an integrative health care system comprising the full range of health-oriented, person-centered, regulated health care profes-sionals, a goal in keeping with the University's own vision.Environmental ImpactBastyr University holds that the health of the environment and the human community are con- joined. Its LEED Platinum-certified student housing was one of the first such housing projects in the U.S. From its innovative student transportation solutions to its 99-percent lo-cally sourced Dining Commons menu, the Ba-styr University community remains committed to environmental stewardship in every area of campus and clinic operations. Visit www.Bastyr.edu/Sustainable Healthy Partnerships Bastyr University faculty mem-bers helped to formulate a line of Choice Organic Wellness Teas, which are FDA-approved as herbal di-etary supplements. Choice Organic Teas gives a portion of the proceeds from the sale of each box of Wellness Teas to the Bastyr Uni-versity Student Scholarship Fund. As part of an academic partnership, students who earn an associate in integrated studies degree from either Cascadia Community Col-lege or Lake Washington Technical College qualify for direct entry into a Bastyr University bachelor's degree program. This offers a clear path to success for nearby students, at the same time fostering the growth of the Univer - sity's undergraduate programs. The Health of Our Human CommunityClinical services provided by Bastyr University help to create a healthier society. Student clinicians assist pa-tients in taking ownership of their own health, providing insight into areas such as lifestyle, his- tory and diet. Over the last two years, Seattle's Bastyr Center for Natural Health has conducted more than 64,000 patient visits. Nearly 650 oncology patients have participated in Bastyr University's integrative oncology re-search studies since 2009. Preliminary results suggest that integrative oncology care may ex - tend the lives of patients with advanced cancers. Bastyr c enter's annual Human Library event invites volunteers, known as \"books,\" to represent diverse patient groups. The resulting dialogues challenge student clinicians to explore prejudices and dispel stereotypes around disability, race, religion, language and sexual orientation. In 2011 Bastyr Center hosted its first event, modeled after a global program originating in Denmark with a mission to combat racism and promote cultural sensitivity worldwide. The Puget s ound Health alliance honored Bastyr Center with its highly distinguished Patient Satisfaction Award in 2012, a testament to the priority Bastyr Center places on communication and patient care. The china externship at Chengdu and Shanghai Universities of Traditional Chinese Medicine affords Bastyr University acupuncture and Oriental medicine students the opportunity to shadow senior doctors in the hospitals of two of China's top traditional medicine universities.Consolidated Statement of Activities Year ended June 30.

Bastyr University's Kenmore campus \u2014 situated on 51 acres of forest just north of Seattle.STUDENT SCHOLARSHIPS All Bastyr University students wish to improve people's health, but many need financial assistance in order to complete their education and training. The University strives to give its students every opportunity, which often means providing scholarships for those students with the drive and acumen, but not the financial resources, to succeed. Bastyr University relies on the generosity of donors to help defray the costs of educating these future health care providers. Over the past two years, Bastyr University has awarded more than $1.3 million in student scholarships. The University's goal is to increase this achievement through the support and philanthropy of generous donors who have come to know and appreciate that Bastyr University is training leaders who will go on to become agents of change in our communities. UNCOMPENSATED C ARE All people, regardless of financial limitations, deserve quality health care. As testament to the University's ongoing commitment to the health of the human community, Bastyr Center for Natural Health has provided $3.8 million in uncompensated care over the past two years, helping countless patients from underserved areas. To reach beyond its own teaching clinics, Bastyr University is proud to collaborate with local organizations to offer care at 19 community clinics in the Seattle and San Diego areas. This valuable community service would not be possible without support from Bastyr University's generous donors, who recognize the importance of providing quality health care to people in all financial situations. With the assistance of current and new donors, Bastyr University seeks to help even more patients in need in the years to come.
