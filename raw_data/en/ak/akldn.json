[Go to Health Professional Version](https://www.cancer.gov/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-prevention-pdq) [Cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [prevention](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is action taken to lower the chance of getting cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower the number of deaths caused by cancer. To prevent new cancers from starting, [scientists](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44724&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) look at [risk factors](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [protective factors](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439422&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Anything that increases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer protective factor. Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. For example, both smoking and inheriting certain [genes](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy [diet](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be protective factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may lower your risk, but it does not mean that you will not get cancer. Different ways to prevent cancer are being studied, including: - Changing lifestyle or eating habits. - Avoiding things known to cause cancer. - Taking [medicines](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to treat a [precancerous](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46220&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [condition](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or to keep cancer from starting. General Information About Colorectal Cancer Key Points - Colorectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum. - Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. Colorectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum. The [colon](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is part of the body's [digestive [minerals](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [carbohydrates](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285960&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), fats, [proteins](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and water) from foods and helps pass waste material out of the body. The digestive system is made up of the mouth, [throat](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439429&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [esophagus](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46408&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [stomach](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the [small](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46582&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [large intestines](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45097&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The colon (large [bowel](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46500&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) is the first part of the large intestine and is about 5 feet long. Together, the [rectum](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [anal](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44185&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) canal make up the last part of the large intestine and are 6 to 8 inches long. The anal canal ends at the [anus](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the opening of the large intestine to the outside of the body). [Cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that begins in the colon is called [colon cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44237&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and cancer that begins in the rectum is called [rectal cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=529764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer that affects either of these [organs](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may also be called [colorectal cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444983&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). See the following [PDQ](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44271&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) summaries for more Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. The number of new colorectal cancer cases and the number of deaths from colorectal cancer are both decreasing a little bit each year in adults aged 55 and older. However, in adults younger than 55 years, the number of new colorectal cancer cases has slowly increased in recent years. The number of new colorectal cancers and deaths from colorectal cancer are higher in African Americans than in other races. Finding and treating colorectal cancer early may prevent death from colorectal cancer. [Screening](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46171&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tests may be used to help find colorectal cancer. Colorectal Cancer Prevention Key Points - Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer. - The following risk factors increase the risk of colorectal cancer: - Age - Family history of colorectal cancer - Personal history - Inherited risk - Alcohol - Cigarette smoking - Race - Obesity - The following protective factors decrease the risk of colorectal cancer: - Physical activity - Aspirin - Combination hormone replacement therapy - Polyp removal - It is not clear if the following affect the risk of colorectal cancer: - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) other than aspirin - Calcium - Diet - The following factors do not affect the risk of colorectal cancer: - Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen only - Statins - Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. - New ways to prevent colorectal cancer are being studied in clinical trials. Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer. Avoiding [cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [risk factors](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may help [prevent](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, being [overweight](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and not getting enough exercise. Increasing [protective factors](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439422&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer. The following risk factors increase the risk of colorectal cancer: Age The risk of [colorectal cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444983&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) increases after age 50. Most cases of colorectal cancer are [diagnosed](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) after age 50. Family history of colorectal cancer Having a parent, brother, sister, or child with colorectal cancer doubles a person's risk of colorectal cancer. Personal history Having a [personal history](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642021&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the following [conditions](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) increases the risk of colorectal cancer: - Previous colorectal cancer. - High-risk [adenomas](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46217&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(colorectal [polyps](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45844&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)that are 1 [centimeter](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354457&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or larger in size or that have cells that look [abnormal](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)under a risk The risk of colorectal cancer is increased when certain [gene](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) changes linked Syndrome) are [inherited](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45098&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Alcohol Drinking 3 or more [alcoholic](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463134&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) beverages per day increases the risk of colorectal cancer. Drinking alcohol is also linked to the risk of forming large colorectal [adenomas](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46217&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (benign tumors). Cigarette smoking Cigarette smoking is linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer. Smoking cigarettes is also linked to an increased risk of forming colorectal adenomas. Cigarette smokers who have had [surgery](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to remove colorectal adenomas are at an increased risk for the adenomas to [recur](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (come back). Race African Americans have an increased risk of colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer compared to other races. Obesity [Obesity](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=527371&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer. The following protective factors decrease the risk of colorectal cancer: Physical activity A lifestyle that includes regular physical activity is linked to a decreased risk of colorectal cancer. Aspirin Studies have shown that taking aspirin lowers the risk of colorectal cancer and the risk of death from colorectal cancer. The decrease in risk begins 10 to 20 years after patients start taking aspirin. The possible harms of aspirin use (100 mg or less) daily or every other day include an increased risk of stroke and bleeding in the [stomach](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [intestines](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46335&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These risks may be greater among the elderly, men, and those with conditions linked to a higher than normal risk of bleeding. Combination hormone replacement therapy [Studies](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have shown that combination [hormone replacement therapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46127&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (HRT) that includes both [estrogen](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46076&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the risk of [invasive](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45741&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [colorectal cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44237&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in [postmenopausal](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45269&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) women. However, in women who take combination HRT and do develop colorectal cancer, the [cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is more likely to be [advanced](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) when it is diagnosed and the risk of dying from colorectal cancer is not decreased. The possible harms of combination HRT include an increased risk of having: [Breast cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Heart disease. [Blood clots](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476017&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Polyp removal Most colorectal polyps are adenomas, which may develop into cancer. Removing colorectal polyps that are larger than 1 [centimeter](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354457&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (pea-sized) may lower the risk of colorectal cancer. It is not known if removing smaller polyps lowers the risk of colorectal cancer. The possible harms of polyp removal during [colonoscopy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45648&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [sigmoidoscopy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45880&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) include a tear in the wall of the [colon](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and bleeding. It is not clear if the following affect the risk of colorectal cancer: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) other than aspirin It is not known if the use of [nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44481&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or NSAIDs (such as [ibuprofen](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=613511&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) lowers the risk of colorectal cancer. Studies have shown that taking the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib reduces the risk of colorectal adenomas (benign tumors) coming back after they have been removed. It is not clear if this results in a lower risk of colorectal cancer. Taking sulindac or celecoxib has been shown to reduce the number and size of polyps that form in the colon and [rectum](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of people with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). It is not clear if this results in a lower risk of colorectal cancer. The possible harms of NSAIDs include: [Kidney](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)problems. - Bleeding in the stomach, intestines, or brain. - Heart problems such as heart attack and [congestive heart failure](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45143&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Calcium It is not known if taking [calcium](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45632&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [supplements](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441266&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) lowers the risk of colorectal cancer. Diet It is not known if a [diet](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) low in fat and meat and high in [fiber](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46401&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), fruits, and vegetables lowers the risk of colorectal cancer. Some studies have shown that a diet high in fat, [proteins](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [calories](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44651&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and meat increases the risk of colorectal cancer, but other studies have not. The following factors do not affect the risk of colorectal cancer: Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen only Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen only does not lower the risk of having invasive colorectal cancer or the risk of dying from colorectal cancer. Statins Studies have shown that taking [statins](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390255&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ( [drugs](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that lower [cholesterol](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407756&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) does not increase or decrease the risk of colorectal cancer. Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. Cancer prevention [clinical trials](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer. The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include exercising more or quitting smoking or taking certain [medicines](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [vitamins](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44744&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [minerals](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or food [supplements](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45916&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). New ways to prevent colorectal cancer are being studied in clinical trials. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI's [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search) webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) website. About This PDQ Summary About PDQ Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq). PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government's center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. Purpose of This Summary This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about colorectal cancer prevention. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Reviewers and Updates Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/screening-prevention). Clinical Trial Information A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials).
