System Alignment for VaccinE Delivery (SAVED) : Improving rates of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination through patient outreach, improved medical record accuracy and targeted physician alerts. B. Goal. To improve the rates of appropriate influenza and pneumococcal vaccination among 140,000 adults in central Massachusetts . C. Objectives I. To improve rates of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in eligible po pulations via patient -directed messages targeted at unvaccinated patients. II. To improve the capture of vaccinations administered to Reliant Medical Group ( RMG ) patients in the community, hospitals and nursing facilities via electronic Health Information Exchange (HIE). III. To improve rates of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in eligible populations via provider and staff- directed educational interventions and system support. D. Assessment of Need. Reliant Medical Group (RMG) , a large multispecialty group practice with an electronic health record (EH R) cares for approximately 140,000 adults age 18 and older at more than 20 clinical locations throughout Central Massachusetts ; approximately 30,000 are aged 65 or older. For the 2011 -2012 influenza season , 55% of these adults had EHR documentation of influenza vaccination . Assuming similar rates of vaccination in 2013, there will be just over 63,000 undocumented or unvaccinated adults who could benefit from targeted influenza vaccine interventions. Similarly, 76% of RMG patients aged 65 or older have EHR documentation of pneumococcal vaccination . Even m ore notable is that only 31% of RMG patients between the ages of 18 and 64 who have conditions qualifying them for a pneumococcal vaccination had EHR documentation of having received one. This gap exists despite EHR alerts reminding providers and clinical staff that these immunizations are due at the time of visits. Approximately 29,000 adults age 18 and older could benefit from our targeted pneumococcal vaccine interventions to patients, providers and their staff. E. Intervention Design and Methods. We propose a multi faceted intervention with patient- provider- and system -level components . In Year 1, we will interview patients , providers and clinical staff to elicit barriers and elucidate optimal messaging (Birmingham 2011, Chen 2007, Koch 2012,) . Informed by these interviews and by RMG EHR data indicating that 25% of ignored EHR vaccination alerts are seen by providers, while 75% are seen by their support staff , we plan to develop targeted educational materials for physicians and their staff regarding the risks and benefits of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, by the middle of Y ear 1 . At the end of Year 1 (several months after the start of the 2014- 2015 influenza immunization season) we will implement patient outreach, providing tailored messages to address attitudinal, informational, and logistical barriers to vaccination . This outreach will take advantage of two cost-effective and generaliz able electronic technologies (e.g. MyChart, RMG's electronic patient portal , and ELIZA, an Interactive Voice Recognition (IVR) system ) to deliver targeted pneumococcal and influenza education as well as information on times and locations of RMG influenza vaccination clinics and in -office immunization opportunities . These two modes will also include components that will enable patients to automatically update their own EHR records to reflect vaccination receipt at external locations (e.g. pharmacies and senior centers ), allowing for system -level improvement in vaccination record accuracy . 2 In Year 2, after the 2014 -2015 flu season, we will evaluate and refine our Y ear 1 interventions by interview ing patients who failed to respond to our electronic outreach, and providers and staff who most frequently continue to ignore alerts. Based on this feedback, we will modify our Year 1 interventions and redeploy them , with repeat provider and staff education in the middle of Year 2 and the electronic patient outreach towards the end of Year 2 for the 2015- 2016 influenza immunization sea son. In Year 2 we will also implement a system -level intervention, centralizing and updating vaccination records so that providers will have greater confidence in patient records and reduce inappropriate alerts . Building on existing state -wide HIE initiatives, we will implement electronic transmission of vaccination administration histories from 3 central Massachusetts hospitals and 8 skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) directly into the RMG EHR. F. Innovation. This proposal builds upon innovative technologies already implemented at RMG and the unique strengths of our multidisciplinary research team to create and test patient, provider and system -level interventions that will be generalizable to practices across the country. RMG won the prestigious 2011 HIMSS Davies Award for exemplary implementation of their EHR. Through work done by Dr. Fisher, RMG's EHR currently alerts providers, their staff, and the 30% of their patients who use MyChart when they are overdue for immunizations. Dr. Garber led the implementation of an interface from a payer that automatically loads immunization claims on 60% of our patients back into the EHR. However despite these efforts and the ability to manually enter immunization history into our EHR, RMG still suffers from a significant gap in immunization completion and documentation. Our propos al to combine tailored messages with access -enhancing information, delivered via electronic patient portals and two -way Interactive Voice Recognition systems that automatically update the EHR involves technologies that are becoming more common, but using them in innovative ways that efficiently fit into the busy healthcare system. Similarly, HIEs are rapidly being deployed around the country, but the ability to automatically load immunization data and resolve potential duplicate entries based on RMG's prior work with claims data will make immunization data conveyed by these HIEs more useful. We also recognize the importance of effective evidence -based messaging in the success of our interventions. A clinician -researcher, Dr. Cutrona, is well positioned to lead this team, building on her previous work exploring adherence both to medications and to preventive behaviors including cancer screening. Dr. Mazor is a nationally -recognized expert in patient - provider communication and brings her wisdom to support this project. And Dr. Goff's previous work exploring HPV vaccines using qualitative methods will contribute important vaccine - specific expertise to the succ ess of this project. G. Design of Outcomes Eval uation. We will test the effectiveness of physician and clinical staff education and system support comparing the response rates to EHR alerts for the 12 months prior to the Year 1 intervention to the 12 months after the Year 1 intervention and the 12 months after the Year 2 intervention. We will break these into monthly analyses for comparison to both the prior month and prior year to look for seasonal variations as well as to identify any decay in the interventions' effectiveness. In Years 1 and 2 we will test the effectiveness of electronic patient outreach efforts through a non -blinded randomized design. We will test two modes of outreach: (1) the electronic patient portal (MyChart) and (2) phone calls via IVR. For the 2014 -15 flu season and 3 again for the 2015 -16 flu season, we expect ~90,000 adults will have no evidence for appropriate influenza or pneumococcal immunizations, with ~30,000 of them being MyChart users. The ~60,000 potentially unvaccinated patients who do not use MyChart will be randomized into 2 groups of ~30,000 adults each for either usual care vs. IVR outreach. The ~30,000 potentially u nvaccinated adults who do use MyCha rt will be randomized to 3 groups of ~10,000: Usual care vs. IVR outreach vs. MyChart outreach. Use of these randomized control groups will allow us to identify the impact of each intervention. We will track and conduct secondary analyses stratifying by source of vaccination information (e.g. administered by RMG vs. administered outside clinic and either manually entered by RMG, loaded from payer claims, loaded via MyChart, loaded via IVR outreach, or loaded from hospital or nursing facility via HIE) (Rolnick 2013, Zimmerman 2009) , and all comparisons will be conducted using an intent- to-treat analysis. All messages, texts for alerts and algorithms will be made freely available through presentations, publications and posting on the Meyers Primary Care Institute website. H.

Three institutions will support and facilitate the proposed study: the Meyers Primary Care Institute (MPCI), University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) and Reliant Medical Group (RMG). MPCI is a joint endeavor of UMMS, RMG and Fallon Community Health Plan. MPCI's mission is to improve the health and healthcare of populations through innovative research and educational endeavors. Direct linkages with major clinical systems enable MPCI's investigators to track treatment and outcomes in defined populations, assess the effectiveness of changes in the health care system, and develop and test innovations in care delivery. Drs. Cutrona and Mazor are MPCI investigators and UMMS faculty members. UMMS is the only public academic health sciences center in Massachusetts and is dedicated to advancing the health and well -being of the population through pioneering education, research, and health care de livery. UMMS is consistently ranked as a national leader in primary care research and education in the U.S. News & World Report . RMG (formerly Fallon Clinic) was founded in 1929 as the first group medical practice in Central Massachusetts. RMG offers a full range of primary and specialty care with over 260 physicians, 1,700 employees and 20+ clinical locations throughout Central Massachusetts. In 2012 RMG served a pproximately 200,000 patients in approximately 2,000,000 encounters. RMG's collaborative group practice model encourages primary care physicians and specialists to work together to deliver the highest level of care to each patient. RMG has played a leadi ng role in health information technology utilizing Epic Care, a comprehensive electronic health record, and MyChart, a secure online portal that provides patients electronic access to their healthcare team and to portions of their medical record. RMG has had a long standing commitment to medical education and research, serving as a site for training of medical students and residents and as the location of large population- based studies with the potential to make an impact on the health care of the nation. Dr. Sarah L. Cutrona will lead the multidisciplinary research team. Dr. Cutrona is a general internist whose research has examined the influence of providers and caregivers on patient adherence to medications and preventive behaviors. She is currently investigating the role of social networks and e -messaging in encouraging preventive health behaviors. Dr. Lloyd D. Fisher is a general pediatrician and a pediatric site chief. He has built complex decision support algorithms into the Epic EHR to guide providers' administration of vaccines. Dr. Fisher is on RMG immunization committees, is a member of the Epic optimization team and Assistant Medical Director for Informatics at RMG. Dr. Lawrence Garber is a general internist and Medical Director for Info rmatics at RMG.

Overall Goals and Objectives The goal of the SAVED study is to improve the rates of appropriate influenza and pneumococcal vaccination among adults enrolled in a large multispecialty group practice in central Massachusetts. C1a. Key Objectives. I. To improve rates of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in eligible patient populations via: a. Patientlevel messages targeted at unvaccinated patients; b. Provider and stafflevel educational interventions and system support. II. To improve the capture of vaccinations administered to Reliant Medical Group (RMG) patients in the community, hospitals and nursing facilities via systemlevel electronic Health Information Exchange (HIE). C1b. Overview. Influen za and pneumococcal vaccines are beneficial but underutilized15. Working with a large multispecialty group practice in central Massachusetts, we propose to develop, implement, and evaluate a multifaceted vaccine promotion program with patient , provider, and systemlevel components . Patientlevel components will include tailored outreach to patients who are not uptodate on either their influenza or on both influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. We will evaluate the relative effectiveness of two generalizable electronic technologies MyChart, RMG's electronic patient portal with secure email, and Eliza, an Interactive Voice Recognition (IVR) system - for providing tailored messages for patients that address local barriers68 to vaccination. Both systems will also allow patients to provide data, for instance to indicate that they have been vaccinated at another location, or to report reasons for not receiving a vaccination. Providerlevel components will include targeted and recurring educational materials for providers and their staff regarding the indications, risks and benefits of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, and suggesting strategies for overcoming local barriers to vaccination. Beginning in year 2, providers will also receive individualized report cards providing feedback on their immunization rates. Inaccuracy of vaccine records is a commonly cited reason for failure of provider reminder systems916. System level components will include both the capability to capture patient reported vaccinations, and automatic updating of EHR vaccination records with pneumococcal and influenza immunizations given at local hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. These systemlevel components will reduce inappropriate alerts and improve provider confidence in patient records916. Figure 1. Study Overview Page 4 of 67 The project will have 2 outreach cycles with an interim period for evaluation and refinement , so that lessons learned during the first cycle can be used to enhance the educational materials and messaging, and optimize effectiveness of the most costly components during the second cycle . These outreach cycles will address the 20142015 flu season (Cycle 1) and the 20152016 flu season (Cycle 2). After Cycle 1, quantitative data collection and analysis will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, and determine whether one or more components are differentially effective in increasing vaccination rates in certain patient groups. We will: 1) identify any patient factors68 which moderate the impact of the patient outreach in order to increase the cost effectiveness of the outreach; 2) identify patients who received the electronic outreach, but did not subsequently receive the vaccinations which they were eligible for; and 3) identify providers and staff who frequently ignored electronic alerts10,16. Qualitative interviews with patients, staff, and providers will inform initial development during Cycle 1 and later refinement of educational materials and messages. After our evaluation and refinement period, we will initiate Outreach Cycle 2. In the last 46 months of the study we will evaluate the impact of our multifaceted intervention on vaccination rates across the RMG population. C2. Technical Approach C2a. Current Assessment of Need in Target Area. C2ai. Baseline data, methods of collecti on and analysis. Baseline data collection has been conducted at Reliant Medical Group (RMG), the clinical setting for the intervention and evaluation. RMG is a large multispecialty group which employs 217 outpatient physicians at more than 15 clinical locations throughout Central Massachusetts. RMG physicians and providers care for approximately 140,000 adults age 18 and older of whom approximately 30,000 are aged 65 or older. Of those RMG patients for whom information on race was available in 2012, whites represented 73.3%, blacks represented 3.7% and other races repres ented 23.1%. Reliant Medical Group's EHR: All RMG providers and staff use an electronic health record system (EHR) made by Epic Systems Corporation. Epic EHRs store information on more than half of all US patients. Epic is highly configurable to meet the specific needs of local clinical sites and has a customer portal to encourage sharing of local adaptations to numerous clinical sites across the nation. We will take advantage of this customer portal to disseminate our vaccine related adaptations at the close of this project. RMG's EHR is designed to record vaccine administrations performed at RMG as well as outside of RMG. The EHR also displays if the patient refuses an immunization or is allergic to an immunization. Consistent with studies showing that Clinical Decision Support can improve rates of indicated vaccines1719, the RMG EHR is configured to flag a patient's record when they are due or overdue for an immunization based on the patient's age, immunization history, medical history, surgical history, and social history. When patients call or are seen at RMG, physicians and staff accessing the patient's record are alerted to immunizations that are due or overdue. Using a Microsoft SQL Server database which is updated nightly with data from all of the EHRs, we are able to ide ntify patients who are eligible and in need of immunizations, identify users (e.g., physicians or staff) alerted to immunization deficiencies, and understand whether immunizations were given. Baseline Vaccination Data: We used EHR derived data to calculate the percent of RMG patients aged 18 and older who received vaccination for influenza between August 1, 2011 and Page 5 of 67 March 30, 2012 (i.e. the 20112012 flu season). Similarly, we used EHR derived data to examine percent completion of pneumococcal vaccination among eligible adults. To be considered eligible for the pneumococcal vaccine, an RMG patient needed to be either (a) aged 65 or older or (b) between the ages of 18 and 64 years with a qualifying chronic condition. We found that vaccination rates for RMG patients were suboptimal . During the 20112012 influenza season, 55% of RMG's adults over age 18 had EHR documentation of influenza vaccination. Similarly, 76% of RMG patients aged 65 or older had EHR documentation of pneumococcal vaccination. Even more notable, only 31% of RMG patients between the ages of 18 and 64 who have conditions qualifying them for a pneumococcal vaccination had EHR documentation of having received one. This gap in vaccination rates exists despite EHR alerts already in place at RMG reminding providers and clinical staff that these immunizations are indicated and due at the time of patient encounters. We found that 25% of ignored EHR al erts were seen by providers, while 75% were seen by their support staff, highlighting the importance of targeting an intervention to both providers and staff. C2aii. Primary audience and expected beneficiaries of intervention. The re are two primary audiences for our interventions. The primary audience for our patient level outreach will be RMG patients eligible for the influenza vaccine, the pneumococcal vaccine or both. The primary audience for our provider and system level interventions will be RMG providers and staff who interact with these eligible patients. RMG has multiple points of clinical interaction with patients. Pa tients who call or send secure messages through MyChart are triaged by secretaries, medical assistants or nurses. Patients who come for office visits are roomed by medical assistants and may have visits with nurses, nurse practitioners, nurse midwifes, physician assistants, or physicians. All of these providers and clinical staff have the opportunity to discuss immunizations with the patient and so will be targeted in this intervention. Overall, we anticipate that approxim ately 63,000 RMG adult patients could benefit from targeted interventions focused on influenza vaccination, and approximately 29,000 could benefit from targeted interventions focused on pneumococcal vaccination. C2b. Intervention Design and Methods. Our multifaceted approach will address the gap between current and optimal vaccination rates via patient , provider and systemlevel interventions intended to target local barriers. We will conduct qualitative interviews with patients, providers and staff, design targeted messages and educational materials, then implement these in a health care system in Central Massachusetts. C2bi. The Communication Human Information Processing Mode l: Theoretical Framework. The Communication Human Information Processing (CHIP) model2021 will provide the overarching framework for the design and implementation of the intervention components. Growing out of extensive research on effective communication of safety information, this model includes the core concepts of communication theory (i.e., message source, channel and receiver) while highlighting the need to enhance effective information processing. Effective information processing requires attention to and comprehension of the message (e.g., that a vaccine is needed); th ese processes are influenced by attitudes and beliefs, and motivation. In the context of vaccination, beliefs about susceptibility, severity, disease likelihood and vaccine effectiveness are likely to be important22. All of these processes in turn influence behavior (i.e, Page 6 of 67 vaccination). Therefore we will develop interventions that garner attention, are easily understood, address critical beliefs, and motivate vaccination. C2bii. RMG patient & provider/staff interviews: Understanding barriers to vaccination. Our first step in intervention design will be to interview patients, providers and staff in order to tailor intervention components to target local barriers, and inform message design. Patient and Provider/Staff Sample. A total of 20 RMG patients will be recruited to participate in interviews. Using electronic medical records at RMG, we will identify patients aged 18 who are not upto date on influenza vaccination, pneumococcal vaccination or both (i.e., per RMG EHR data, were eligible but were not vaccinated against influenza during the most recent flu season and/or were eligible but never vaccinated for pneumococcal vaccine). Candidates will be sent a letter of invitation to participate in interviews; those who express interest will be screened to confirm unvaccinated status. Sampling will be purposeful to ensure that interviewees are diverse in terms of age, gender5, which vaccination(s) is/are needed, and personal risk factors (e.g. underlying respiratory disease)23. Providers and staff (10 total) will be selected in order to represent a range of clinic sites, provider types (e.g. family practice, internal medicine, geriatrics), and role (e.g. physician, nurse practitioner; nurse, medical assistant). Interviews will be offered inperson and via telephone, to minimize barriers such as transportation constraints, frailty or busy clinical schedules. Interview Procedures. All interviews will be conducted by a tra ined interviewer, supervised by Dr. Mazor. The interviewer will explore possible barriers to vaccination68, 2425, first using open ended questions, then probing for specific barriers using the CHIP framework (e.g., understanding of vaccine indications, risks and benefits, lack of information regarding access, motivational factors, etc.). The interviewer will present sample patient or provider/staff messages intended to address the barriers raised by the interviewee, and will solicit his/her reactions to those messages and recommendations for mo difications to increase effectiveness. Interviewees will be asked to paraphrase the main points of the messages to assess comprehension. They will also be asked whether they found the messages persuasive and motivating; patients will be asked whether they would be likely to get vaccinated after hearing the messages. All interviewees will be asked to listen and respond to IVR messages; those with portal access will also be asked to respond to sample portal messages. Informed consent will be confirmed prior to the start of the interview. Interviews will be audiorecorded and professionally transcribed. Analysis of Interview Data. Interview data will be analyz ed using qualitative methods which Drs. Mazor, Cutrona and Goff have used in prior studies. Using an iterative process, Drs. Mazor and Goff will each read 2 transcripts and together will generate a preliminary list of content Figure 2. The Communication Human Information Processing Model Page 7 of 67 codes that capture the themes and subthemes identified in those transcripts. They will then apply the coding scheme to 2 additional transcripts, adding codes if needed to ensure that all relevant content is captured. When they are satisfied that the coding scheme captures all relevant themes and subthemes, Dr. Mazor will train the Research Assistant to apply the coding scheme to the full set of transcripts. Drs. Mazor and Goff will prepare a su mmary for the full investigative team to inform design of the final patient messages and educational materials. C2biii. Development of Messages and Educational Material. C2biii(1) Creation of patient outreach messages. As noted above, patients will be asked to react to draft messages during the interviews. Content for these initial drafts will be drawn from 1) existing sample scripts used by Eliza corporation; 2) the CDC website (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccin es/); 3) existing RMG Epic alerts developed by Dr. Fisher; as well as the clinical and communication expertise of the study team. Using the CHIP model as our guide (see figure), we will take into account (1) a patient's expected level of attention to information delivered via various channels (e.g. inperson from a provider, or via IVR or eportal), (2) likely level of comprehension and (3) preexisting attitudes and beliefs and we will seek to develop a message that (4) maximizes patient motivation and leads to vaccine co mpletion. We will also include information on upcoming RMG flu clinics in order to provide accessenhancing information to facilitate completion of the desired behavior . C2biii(2) Designing provider/staff educational material. Usin g the same techniques described above for patient interviews, we will identify and interview 10 RMG providers and staff (6 providers; 4 staff members). Information gained through our interviews will inform educational material targeted to providers and staff. We will again be guided by the CHIP model, considering the impact of available channels of communication with providers (in person and e messages and alerts) as well as accounting for expected lev el of attention and comprehension. We will use interview results to identify effective ways to motivate providers to attend to alerts and encourage vaccination. C2biv. Provider/Staff Outreach. C2biv(1) Education. Educational Focus and Content. Ninetytwo percent of RMG providers and clinical staff received an influenza vaccine in the 20122013 flu season, reflecting widespread personal acceptance of its benefits. We therefore anticipate that focusing our provider and staff education efforts on the pneumococcal vaccine will provide the highest yield. Our educational material will review in detail the patient populations for whom this vaccine is recommended before age 65 and will also highlight select populations requiring more complex pneumococcal vaccination regimens. If our provider and staff interviews indicate a need for influenza vaccination education we will expand our focus to include this as well. Possible topics for influenza vaccine education would include information on options for people who don't like needles and options for eggallergic individuals. Education Format/Venue. Providers and staff at each RMG site meet monthly for lunch to discuss clinical and administrative updates. These meetings are well attended and are an important communication venue for RMG. We will design 10 minute presentations to be delivered by Drs. Fisher and Garber, respected practicing clinicians within RMG. These Page 8 of 67 presentations will be delivered at all of the 15 physician sites during year 1. Subsequently, bi monthly reminder emails will be sent to providers and clinical staff, reinforcing the educational message presented at the lunch meetings. In year 2, Drs. Fisher and Garber will repeat their 10 minute lunchtime presentations to providers and staff at the 15 clinical sites. C2biv(2) Provider report cards. An important component of the provider and staff education will be \"report cards\" distributed to userspecific Epic \"dashboards\" which are visible when logging into the Epic EHR. Report cards will provide individualized feedback with comparative data on pneumococcal and influenza vaccination completion rates. We will begin distribution in June of Year 2; these will continue monthly throughout the remainder of the study period. C2bv. Patient outreach via electronic portal with secure email and Interactive Voice Recognition (IVR). We will test the effectiveness of electronic patient outreach efforts through a nonblinded randomized design. We will test two outreach channels: (1) the electronic patient portal (MyChart) with secure email and (2) phone calls via IVR. Use of randomized control groups will allow us to identify the impact of each intervention. Messages will have 2 goals: (1) vaccine promotion and (2) improve the accuracy of the patient record. C2bv(1) Outr each via electronic patient portal with secure email. Current Eportal use in RMG. All RMG patients are given the option to sign up for MyChart, an electronic patient portal with secure email that is offered to patients free of cost. Over 30% of RMG patients use MyChart. MyChart provides patients personalized, secure online access to portions of their medical record. They can view their immunization history as well as alerts for immunizations that are due or overdue. Patients can securely send and receive messages with their RMG provide rs, and complete questionnaires sent to them by their providers. Description of eportal intervention. We will design an outgoing secure email message to be sent via MyChart to patients who are due or overdue for influenza according to the RMG EHR (among these patients, those due or overdue for pneumococcal vaccination will receive additional messaging addressing this vaccine). Messages will include information on upcoming flu clinics as well as opportunities to receive immunizations at RMG offices or pharmacies. Patients will also receive an attached online questionnaire enabling online selfreporting26 of vaccine completion if they were vaccinated outside of RMG, as well as reporting other barriers to vaccination (e.g., misconceptions related to need or eligibility, beliefs about vulnerability, etc.). Receipt of completed online questionnaires will trigger automated updating of immunization types and dates in the Epic EHR by a process that extracts questionnaire responses each night and resubmits them through Epic's Inbound Immunization interface. Also, all of the questionnaire data, including information on patient barriers, will automatically be stored and available to the project team for analysis. C2bv(2) IVR outreach. Current IVR use in RMG. RMG currently uses IVR to notify patients of upcoming scheduled appointments. Three days in advance of a scheduled appointment, RMG's Epic EHR automatically sends a list of patients and their phone numbers to Eliza which tries calling each patient up to 3 times in the evening to make a successful connection. Patients respond to the IVR calls by voice, affirming that they will keep their appointment, or cancelling the Page 9 of 67 appointment. Each night, Eliza automatically sends a file back to the EHR which cancels any appointment that was so indicated by the patient. Description of IVR intervention. Using information gained through our interviews and building on the expertise of the Eliza interactive design team, we will develop a script similar to the message used in the eportal intervention but uniquely suited for telephone communication. The IVR message will promote completion of influenza vaccines by providing education as well as information on upcoming flu clinics. In addition, the IVR call will gather information on potential barriers and will provide patients the opportunity to report the date they had already completed their vaccinations outside of the RMG system26, or to provide their reason for not being uptodate with vaccinations (i.e. patients will be invited to identify barriers or to report reasons for not wanting to be immunized). Having completed just over 1 billion outreaches, the Eliza interactive voice recognition system has extensive experience working with health systems and has developed effective approaches to validation of phone numbers, identification of optimal times for reaching patients and patient centered scripts that are able to keep patients engaged an d achieve stated goals. Patient entered immunization type (mapped to \"Codes for Vaccine Administered\" (CVX code)) and date, and reasons for not being immunized will be sent nightly by Eliza to the Epic EHR where the patient's immunization history will automatically be updated via Epic's Inbound Immunization interface, and all IVR responses will be stored for analysis by the project team. C2bv(3)Programming. An established RMG Application Development Team will be responsible for programming the components of the intervention. Each team member has extensive experience developing and introducing technology to the clinical environment and has close working relationships with key stakeholders within the organization (see Organizational Details for further information). All of the described interfaces will have audit trails that will allow the project team to understand where each record of immunization came from (see Table 1. Data Sources for EHRdocumented Vaccinations) as well as assisting in debugging any errors. Healthcare Information Technology Standards: Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP) approved standards will be used in the development of the proposed intervention. Vaccine information received from Eliza will use CVX codes. Patient summaries containing administered immunization history from other facilities will use CVX codes within HL7 Consolidated CDA documents. Privacy and security related to the exchange of protected health information (PHI): RMG information technology policies will serve as the basis for the privacy and security procedures governing the use of sensitive health information in the development of the proposed intervention. These policies have been vetted within the RMG enterprise, were prepared by their HIPAA Security Officer, issued by their IT Business Office, and approved by their Chief Informatio n Officer. These policies comply with good information security practice and regulations set forth by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) Act of 1996. C2bv(4) Implementation of patient outreach. Outreach Cycle 1: Nonblinded Randomized Controlled Trial. Page 10 of 67 In Outreach Cycle 1, we will randomize 20,000 eportal users and 10,000 non e portal users who are identified in the RMG EHR as not being upto date on their influenza vaccines (Figure 3). The RCT approach was chosen because it minimizes selection bias and confounding that might limit interpretation of the study findings. As a group, patients who take initiative to sign up for E portals may differ from people who do not, possibly demonstrating more healthconscious or adherent behaviors. For this reason, we will treat eportal and noneportal users separately. We will randomize eportal (1) Eportal message message call; (3) eportal message with IVR call; or (4) No Eportal message with no IVR call. Non eportal users will be randomized to either (1) IVR call or (2) no IVR call. We will conduct analyses stratified by eportal use and examine the effect of IVR calls in both users and nonusers of eportals. Evaluation & Interventi on Refinement. In addition to the quantitative analyses of Cycle 1 data, we will conduct a second round of qualitative interviews in order to identify areas where the messaging and educational materials can be improved. We will use the methods described under C2bii above; but will focus recruitment on \"unresponsive\" patients, providers and staff. We will define as unresponsive those patients who received a message (via IVR, eportal or both) but did not subsequently receive a vaccination or report having receiv ed one elsewhere. We will define as unresponsive those providers and staff who have high rates of ignoring alerts. The interview content will specifically explore reactions to the messaging and educational materials, and will seek to identify specific areas of resistance and continuing barriers. Outreach Cycle 2. Costconscious Targeted Intervention. In order to implement our cost conscious targeted intervention, we will carry out stratified analyses (detailed below) of patients' responses to the Cycle 1 IVR intervention and will identify those patients most likely to benefit from the IVR intervention. We will then implement a costefficient outreach effort in which vaccination messages are sent to all eportal users (because Figure 3. Outreach Cycle 1 Design Figure 4. Outreach Cycle 2 Design Page 11 of 67 eportal messages are free once developed) and IVR messages are sent to those patients identified as most likely to benefit from targeted IVR calls (i.e. most likely to get vaccinated). As in Outreach Cycle 1, we will make a total of 15,000 IVR calls in Cycle 2. The important difference is that in Cycle 2 those IVR calls will be allocated to those patients who our analyses suggest will be most likely to respond positively to the IVR intervention (i.e., to get vaccinated). C2bvi. Electronic import of vaccine completion reports from hospitals & nursing facilities. We will address incomplete adult vaccination histories through electronic import of influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations performed at 3 Worcester hospitals and 8 skilled nursing facilities into the RMG EHR. Every hospital in the country is developing the ability to transmit electronic summary documents, such as an HL7 Consolidated CDA Continuity of Care Document (CCD), at time of discharge to the primary care physician in order to satisfy \"Meaningful Use\" of EHRs27. To support this, each state is building a Health Information Exchange (HIE) to support transmissions. Within 2 years, transmission of e summary documents is expected to be implemented nationally; the target date for central Massachusetts is 2014. RMG is leading an ONCsponsored project known as IMPACT: Improving Massachusetts PostAcute Care Transfers. This project is interconnecting 2 hospitals, 8 nursing facilities, 2 home health agencies, and 2 large group practices; connection to a third hospital is also underway. For the SAVED project, starting in June of 2015, RMG will take the immunization history received from these facilities and automatically load them into the Epic EHR via Epic's Inbound Immunization Interface. Patient matching will be performed using a technique currently in place at RMG, where the received patient demo graphics (i.e. name, date of birth, and gender) are first loaded using Epic's Inbound Registration Interface along with the sending facility's Medical Record Number (MRN) so that Epic's \"Bridges\" Master Patient Index will attach that MRN to the correct patient. Subsequently, when the MRNlinked immunization is pa ssed through Epic's Inbound Immunization Interface, it will be added to the correct patient's record. C2c. Evaluation Design In our initial needs assessment we described the percent of eligible RMG patients who had EHR documentation of completed influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. In our evaluation, we will determine whether our multifaceted intervention effectively closed the gap between patient eligibility for vaccination and documented vaccine completion. We will systematically analyze each intervention component to determine its value, both to increase external capture rates as well as to promote vaccination rates at RMG. C2ci. Data sources and data collection for year 1 RCT analysis. We will draw on data from EHR records, brought into the EHR via several pathways that are clearly traceable via audit trails (see Table 1). Determining which intervention resulted in the greatest capture of extern al immunizations will be relatively straightforward. However, determining which intervention caused the greatest increase in immunizations rates is more complex. Since the control groups will not be given the opportunity to selfreport, immunizations recorded via the MyChart questionnaire or the Eliza IVR will be excluded from the immunization rate analysis. Similarly, only a subset of patients will be hospitalized or require skilled nursing facility stays during the Page 12 of 67 study period and the electronic import of these records may be somewhat erratic, so these will be excluded as well. Thus, when assessing the impact of our Outreach Cycle 1 Randomized Controlled Trial (analysis described below) we will include only vaccines directly administered or documented in an RMG facility for our primary analysis. Separately, we will calculate (a) the percent of patients selfreporting vaccine completion at the end of Outreach Cycle 1 and at the end of Outreach Cycle 2; (b) the percent of patients for whom documentation of vaccination in a hospital or skilled nursing facility is electronically imported by the end of the 20152016 influenza season. Table 1. Data Sources for EHRdocumented Vaccinations (influenza and pneumococcus) Directly Documented by RMG Staff Patient Selfreported Electronically Imported Vaccinated at RMG or report entered manually into the Epic EHR by staff or provider. Vaccinated outside of RMG with report received from a MyChart questionnaire or received via the Eliza IVR. Vaccinated at hospital or long term care facility with report received from a Health Information Exchange. C2cii. Determination of intervention impact on vaccination rates: Outreach Cycle 1 RCT. To determine the impact of our Cycle 1 Randomized Controlled Trial on RMG vaccination rates for the 201415 flu season, we will perform unadjusted and adjusted analyses of the overall group of randomized patients (30,000 patients) and will also carry out several stratified analyses. Unadjusted Analyses Overall Group. With the goal of understanding whether IVR call receipt increased likelihood of vaccine completion across both eportal users and nonusers, we will conduct an intentiontotreat(ITT) analysis using a Chisquare test to compare vaccine completion rates among those randomized to receiving IVR calls vs. those randomized to not receive calls. In order to isolate the effect of the IVR call, the denominator for this analysis will exclude the 10,000 eportal users randomized to receipt of an eportal message (either alone or in combination with IVR call) but will include all other randomized patients (final N=20,000). Eportal Users. Using a factorial design, we will conduct unadjusted Chisquare tests focused only on eportal users, again using an ITT approach. Our goal will be to understand (a) whether eportal message receipt increased likelihood of vaccine completion compared to control; (b) whether an IVR call increased likelihood of vaccine completion compared to control; and (c) whether receiving an IVR call plus eportal message improved likelihood of vaccine completion compared to eportal message alone. Table 2. Year 1 RCT: Patients in Need of Influenza Vaccine (Subset Will Also Need Pneumococcal Vaccine) Page 13 of 67 NonEportal Users. In an analysis focused only on those who do not have an eportal, we will assess whether those receiving IVR calls displayed increased vaccination rates. Through these analyses, we will determine whether eportal messages and IVR calls are effective and, for eportal users, whether there is incremental value attained through the added expense of the IVR call (in addition to or in place of an eportal message). Amount of Change Expected. With our proposed sample size and using a factorial design as described, we will be powered to detect a 23% difference in vaccination rates between any two randomized groups. Based on previous studies28,29, we expect a 1020% improvement in vaccination rates for either intervention compared to control. Adjusted Analyses Overall Group and Stratified by Eportal Use. We will examine the adequacy of randomization in the overall group and separately among eportal users and non eportal users by assessing whether there was differential representation in intervention vs. control groups by (a) age group; (b) race/ethnicity; (c) gender; (d) influenza vaccination in previous year; and (e) level of healthcare utilization; if differences are found we will carry out adjusted analyses using logistic regression to control for significant differences, modeling od ds of receiving (a) influenza vaccine and (b) pneumococcal vaccine. Stratified Analyses: Identifying Subgroups for Whom Intervention Was Effective. Our large sample size will allow us to stratify by 5 patient characteristics (listed above) readily identifiable in the EHR. These analyses will help us carefully target the more costly IVR intervention in Cycle 2. We will carry out analyses stratified by these five patient characteristics, using (a) the overall group excluding eportal message recipients, and (b) eportal users only. As above, we will seek to understand the incremental value attained for a given subgroup through the added expens e of the IVR call, and will target those subgroups for whom the IVR yields the greatest benefit. Through these analyses, we will identify optimal targets for IVR calls in Cycle 2, both for e portal users (all of whom will also receive eportal messages) and for non eportal users. C2ciii. Determination of impact: Outreach Cycle 2 cost conscious targeted intervention. With the goal of understanding whether our multipronged intervention improved overall RMG vaccination rates by the end of the 20152016 influenza season, we will compare the overall percent of RMG patients with EHR documentation of vaccine completion at baseline and at the end of Flu seasons 20142015 and 20152016. In order to capture the impac t of provider education and system updates as well as the impact of the Cycle 2 targeted intervention, this analysis will include all RMG patients; those who were randomized and those who were not. We will examine both (a) the rate of direct documentation and (b) the ra te of combined documentation (e.g. direct, selfreport or eimport)30. Physician Response to Vaccine Alerts: Secondary Outcome. We will test the effectiveness of physician and staff education and system support comparing the response rates to EHR pneumococcal vaccine alerts for June 1 2013May 31 2014 (baseline) to rates for June 1 2014 May 31, 2015 (exposed to provider education alone) and for June 1, 2015May 31, 2016 (exposed to provider education plus report card and eimport from hospitals and nursing Page 14 of 67 homes). We will break these into monthly analyses for comparison to the prior month and to the same month in the prior year, assessing for seasonal variations and decay in effectiveness. Determination of Engagement by Target Audience. We will assess percent of patients reached in Outreach Cycles 1 and 2 (i.e. percent engaged with the IVR, percent opening and percent responding to eportal messages). We will measure attendance at provider/staff educational sessions, rates of response to vaccine alerts and of progress report opening among providers. Dissemination. We will publish findings through presentations at scientific meetings and in peer reviewed journals and will present them to RMG leadership for possible longterm implementation. Patient messages and educational materials will be available on our website. SmartTool adaptations to the Epic system will be published on the Epic UserWeb portal. C3. Detailed Workplan and Deliverables Schedule Year 1 will include four main steps: (1) preparation, (2) interviews, (3) message & educational material development , and (4) Outreach Cycle 1 to providers and patients . In the first 6 months, we will prepare for provider, staff and patient interviews; months 411 will be devoted to preparation and development of the IT architecture needed to (a) identify unvaccinated patients and send them outgoing messages (eportal and IVR calls) and (b) capture and upload into the EHR incoming patient reported data on vaccine completion barriers and preferences. Preparation for EHR capture of vaccinations from hospitals and longterm care facilities will be ongoing during this entire year. In months 4 9 we will recruit and interview patients, providers and staff regarding influenza and pneumococcal vaccine attitudes, beliefs, and comprehension of risks/benefits, as well as regarding perceived barriers to vaccine completion. Interview findings will inform development of messages & educational material for providers, staff and patients which will be completed by month 9 (provider/staff) and by month 11 (patient messages). Educational outreach to providers will take place between months 7 and 12; randomized outreach to patients via MyChart and IVR will take place in month 12 of year 1. Year 2 will include three main steps: (1) evaluation and refinement of Cycle 1 interventions, (2) Cycle 2 targeted outreach to providers and patients and (3) EHR import of vaccinati on reports originating from hospitals and nursing facilities. Months 13 through 19 will be spent evaluating the impact of the intervention and identifying patient subgroups who benefited most from the more costly IVR outreach. Included in this evaluation will be targeted interviews (months 16 18) with patients who received the outreach but did not get vaccinated. We will refine patient messages, outreach strategy and provider/staff education based on results from analyses and interviews. Targeted outreach to providers will begin in month 18 via provider provider immunization 'report cards' which will continue for the duration of the study, accompanied by additional educational presentations. Targeted patient outreach in month 24 will involve secure eportal messages to all eportal users and IVR calls to patients identified as standing to gain the greatest benefit. EHR import of vaccination reports from outside facilities will begin in month 18 and will be ongoing for the duration of the study. Year 3 will be devoted to (1) evaluation of impact and (2) dissemination . Evaluation will require retri eval, review and analysis of data on vaccination rates and on provider response to alerts. Dissemination will include manuscript preparation, presentation of findings at national meetings, communication of findings to RMG leadership, and website posting of ma terials. Page 15 of 67 C3.

Page 21 of 67 D. ORGANIZATIONAL DETAIL Three institutions will support and facilitate the proposed study: the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS), the Meyers Primary Care Institute (MPCI), and Reliant Medical Group (RMG). UMMS and MPCI Organizational Capacity: UMMS is the only public academic health sciences center in Massachusetts and is dedicated to advancing the health and well being of the population through pioneering education, research, and health care delivery. UMMS is consistently ranked as a national leader in primary care research and education in the U.S. News & World Report. Drs. Cutrona and Mazor are UMMS faculty members as well as MPCI investigators. MPCI is a joint endeavor of UMMS, RMG and Fallon Community Health Plan. MPCI's mission is to improve the health and healthcare of populations through innovative research and educational endeavors. Direct linkages with major clinical systems enable MPCI's investigators to track treatment and outcomes in defined populations, assess the effectiveness of changes in the health care system, and develop and test innovations in care delivery. UMMS and MPCI Leadership : Dr. Sarah L. Cutrona will lead the multidisciplinary research team. Dr. Cutrona is a general internist whose research has examined the influence of providers and caregivers on patient adherence to medications and preventive behaviors. She is currently investigating the role of social networks and emessaging in encouraging preventive health behaviors. Dr. Cutrona has collaborated successfully with numerous members of the proposed study team in the past on NIHfunded research projects. Drs. Cutrona and Mazor have both past and ongoing research collaborations, including shared work focused on health literacy and adherence to preventive screening. Dr. Cutrona has worked with Ms. Preusse and Dr. Garber along with MPCI staff members Hassan Fouayzi and Shawn Gagne on a study examining adverse events following hospital discharge, leading to publications both in print and in press. Dr. Cutrona's combined research and clinical expertise, as well as her close working relationship with the proposed study team, places her in an ideal position to successfully lead this project. Dr. Kathleen M. Mazor is Professor of Medicine at UMMS and a highly experienced researcher with expertise in developing and testing health related messages for patients and providers. She has led and collaborated on over 30 qualitative studies using indepth interview methods. UMMS and MPCI Staff Capacity: MPCI will provide primary staff support. Meera Sreedhara, MPH is an experienced Project Manager at the Meyers Primary Care Institute. Meera's Masters degree in public health, her experience assessing community and neighborhood health and assisting with educational sessions within the Worcester Division of Public Health and her seven years of project coordination both at UMMS and at other medical institutions have provided her with the skill set and knowledge base necessary to oversee this project. Hassan Fouayzi is an experienced programmer and Shawn Gagne is a highly skilled research assistant. Both Mr. Ga gne and Mr. Fouayzi have multiple years' experience collaborating with Dr. Cutrona and with the RMG team on study implementation, RMG data management and analysis. For further detail on the roles played by MPCI staff, please see the budget justification. From UMMS, the Quantitative Methods Core (QMC), in the Division of Biostatistics and Health Page 22 of 67 Sciences Research in the Department of Quantitative Health Sciences will provide clinical research support in biostatistics, experimental design, and data management. QMC is led by Director Bruce Barton, PhD who has contributed to this study design and who will personally provide input on the proposed project if funded. In addition, we will seek input throughout the study from our consultant, Dr. Sarah Goff, a health services researcher with clinical specialties in general pediatrics and internal medicine whose research focuses on health care quality and safety. Her work includes numerous applications of qualitative methods, including a mixed methods content analysis of patient provider discussions about human papilloma vaccine. RMG Organizational Capacity: The clinical site for this work will be RMG. RMG (formerly Fallon Clinic) was founded in 1929 as the first group medical practice in Central Massachusetts. RMG offers a full range of primary and specialty care with 217 outpatient physicians, 1,700 employees and over 15 clinical locations throughout Central Massachusetts. RMG's collaborative group practice model encourages primary care physicians, specialists and clinical staff to work together to deliver the highest level of care to each patient. RMG has played a leading role in health information technology utilizing Epic, a comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) , and MyChart, a secure online portal that provides patients electronic access to their healthcare team and to portions of their medical record. RMG has had a long standing commitment to medical education and research, serving as a site for training of medical students and residents and as the location of large population based studies with the potential to make an impact on the health care of the nation. Vaccination Promoting Practices Already in Place at RMG . We will build on several initiatives already in place at RMG. Epic records all vaccinations administered at RMG as well as those that are administered externally and manually entered by providers or staff. Epic also records patient refusals or contraindications for vaccination. A healthcare provider viewing the Epic record of an influenza vaccineeligible adult (i.e. anyone over 18 without contraindications who has not been vaccinated during the current season) sees a 'Health Maintenance alert' in the corner of his or her screen. This alert is a flag icon which, if clicked on, will provide information on all immunizations due and is turned on October through March for influenza. In provider routine physical order sets during flu season, if a patient has not yet received their flu vaccine, there is a notification in the Order Set that one is due and the order can be placed directly from this screen. Similar health maintenance alerts are also const antly available for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), taking into account patient specific risk factors. RMG has already created electronic architecture optimizing identification of patients in need of vaccine and has also allowed those patients who have set up online patient portals (MyChart) to view the Health Maintenance alerts as well. Thus, RMG has already investe d considerable resources into healthcare provider prompts and supporting electronic architecture in an effort to identify eligible unvaccinated patients and promote vaccination. In addition, RMG has taken the first steps toward activating patients by providing them with access to their own immunization records through eportals. RMG Leadership . Dr. Lawrence Garber will oversee all RMG activities, with the assistance of Peggy Preusse, RN, an experienced research nurse coordinator who has skillfully led health information exchange (HIE) and remote home blood pressure monitoring projects. Dr. Page 23 of 67 Lawrence Garber is Medical Director for Informatics at RMG and a general internist. He has extensive experience designing and implementing EHR based interventions and led the creation of electronic interfaces between RMG's EHR and 6 regional hospitals. Dr. Garber is Chair of the Massachusetts eHealth Collaborative's Executive Committee, a member of the Massachusetts State Health Information Technology Council and Health Information Exchange Advisory Committee, and a member of ONC Policy Committee's Health Information Exchange Workgroup and Privacy and Security Tiger Team. Dr. Garber has architected several HIEs (e.g. www.SAFEHealth.org ) and will lead the integration of immunizations received from HIEs into Epic's Inbound Immunization interface. Dr. Lloyd D. Fisher is a general pediatrician and a pediatric site chief. He has built complex decision support algorithms into the Epic EHR to guide providers' administration of vaccines. Dr. Fisher is on RMG immunization committees, is a member of the Epic optimization team and Assistant Medical Director for Informatics at RMG.

INSTITUTION AND LOCATION DEGREE (if applicable) MM/YY FIELD OF STUDY Yale University B.A. 1997 English Literature Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons M.D. 2001 Medicine Harvard School o f Public Health MPH 2007 Public Health A. Personal Statement My current research examines adherence to routine screening and preventive behavior , with a focus on the ways in which communication between members of a patient's social network can impact preventive screening decisions. I led a pilot study through the NCI -funded Cancer Research Network on this subject, building on the work done by Dr. Mazor and her team in their study of health literacy, cancer prevention and patient understanding of oral mes sages. I have also been awarded a K12 career development grant, through which I am exploring the characteristics of a message promoting colon cancer screening that would make it acceptable for email transmission between members of a social network. In 20 12, I was awarded an Early Career Investigator Award from the HMO Research Network. Through this work I have collaborated closely with Dr. Mazor and have worked extensively with staff members from the Meyers Primary Care Institute. As a practicing general internist, I am also acutely aware of the risks of poor communication at times of care transitions, such as when patients are discharged from the hospital into the community. I worked with Dr. Garber to study risks associated with adverse drug events post -hospital discharge and my work studying communication patterns at hospital discharge places me in an excellent position to lead our proposed study in which we facilitate communication between hospitals, nursing facilities and primary care EHRs regarding administered vaccines. My past research has examined the influence of physicians, pharmacists and caregivers on patient adherence to cardiovascular medications and has described distribution patterns and potential safety concerns for free pharmaceutical drug samples in adult and pediatric populations. I then focused further on interventions to improve medication adherence. I worked with the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, earning a nomination for the Milton W. Hamolsky Award for Outstanding Scientific Presentation (Junior Faculty) from the Society of General Internal Medicine for my work on the role of physicians in improving cardiovascular medication adherence. Health communication is a topic on which I have both expertise and great interest through my roles as a general internist, researcher, and teacher in an academic medical setting. Improving communication and outreach to support patients in efforts toward disease prevention activities can have a vital impact on the health of individuals as well as communities at -large. My research and clinical experience have aptly prepared me to lead a project such as the one we have proposed. B.

INSTITUTION AND LOCATION DEGREE (if applicable) YEAR FIELD OF STUDY University of Massachusetts Amherst Eastern Washington University University of Massachusetts Amherst B.A. M.S. Ed.D. 1979 1985 1993 Psychology Psychology Psychometrics A. Personal Statement My training and expertise as a psychometrician, and my skills and experience in qualitative data collection methods and coding, health literacy, communicating medical information to patients, instrument development and validity studies make me a n ideal collaborator on this project. My training in psychometrics provided me a strong foundation for test development and validation, and over the past 20 years I have continued to develop my expertise in this area. I have led and collaborated on numerous studies examining the psychometric properties of the items and scales used to measure knowledge, skills, beliefs and attitudes in a variety of stakeholder groups, including patients, medical students, residents, practicing physicians, nurses, and others. Examples of my research into psychometric issues include studies of differential item functioning, response bias, and generalizability. I have also led a number of validity studies; examples of my research in this area are studies examining missing values and score validity, and in using think aloud interviews to explore validity issues. I have led or collaborated on over 30 instrument development efforts, and have expertise in instrument conception and planning, item writing, validity and reliability studies. While I have a strong appreciation of the value of tests, scales and other quantitative measures, my research has also caused me to appreciate the value of qualitative methods. Such methods are often a necessary first step in understanding the phenomenon under study, and are essential to generating meaningful questions and testable hypotheses. This appreciation has led me to develop expertise in qualitative methods, and I have gained expertise in developing interview protocols, in training and supervising interviewers, and in qualitative data analysis. I have published over 30 studies reporting the results of qualitative interviews and focus groups, involving stakeholders from a variety of backgrounds. I have collaborated with Dr . Cutrona for the past 3 years, and I am confident that she will be a highly effective leader for this study. I am excited about working on this innovative project, and I look forward to working with this team of skilled, experienced researchers and clinicians should we receive funding. B.

Personal Statement The goal of this project is to increase immunization rates in adults, facilitated by an Electronic Health Record (EHR). I have extensive experience and expertise in designing and implementing such systems. Over the past several years I have led the implementation of our Electronic Health Record (EHR) from Epic, along with its \"MyChart\" Personal Health Record. During this process I became an Epic Certified Analyst. I have architected and led the implementation of an interface that loads immunizations into Epic from claims data, and loads home blood pressure readings via Microsoft HealthVault into the Epic EHR. I was also the PI and principal architect for SAFEHealth, an AHRQ -funded federated Health Information Exchange that is current ly live in central Massachusetts. As a practicing primary care physician, I am also keenly aware of the importance of immunizations, as well as the numerous obstacles in the way of their successful completion and documentation. I have led multiple patient -safety initiatives geared towards alerting patients and physicians of near -due or overdue Health Maintenance tests and procedures, appointment reminders, automated no -show letters to patients, and closed- loop order reports that look for orders that were never resulted back to the ordering physician. In summary, I have demonstrated that I possess the clinical, technical, and managerial skills necessary to ensure that Reliant Medical Group's participation in this project will be successful and fruitful.

Personal Statement This research project will investigate methods to improve compliance with influenza and pneumococcal vaccine administration through both provider education and patient outreach. I have extensive experience and expertise in designing, building, and implementing clinical decision supports within an Electronic Health Records (EHR) system of a large multispecialty medical group. As a primary care pediatrician and Assistant Medical Dire ctor for Informatics at Reliant Medical Group, I am responsible for creating alerts in our EHR. Through various projects we have managed to reduce the time providers must spend determining which vaccines are due and encourage them to order all needed vacc ines at each patient interaction. Point of care reminders have been employed to ensure accurate and on time administration of all appropriate immunizations for both children and adult patients. Through my involvement in local, state, and national committees and organizations I have disseminated our techniques to others and participated in work groups to share best practices widely among other medical groups and hospital systems. This proposed research will build upon the skills I have developed over the years and allow me to successfully build easy to use and understand clinical decision tools to facilitate appropriate and on time ordering and administration of both the influenza and pneumococcal vaccines in our adult population.

Personal Statement I am a pediatrician and internist trained as a health services researcher . My research focuses on health care quality and safety. I have led or participated in twelve s tudies (nine publications) using qualitative methods to date. In these studies, I have led in- depth interviews and focus groups with subsequent analysis of the data and have performed content analysis on transcripts of patient -provider conversations . I hav e used innovative qualitative data collection techniques such as photo- elicitation, in which participants take photographs of the subject at hand and use the photos to stimulate discussion during an in- depth interview. My previous work exploring HPV vaccines using qualitative methods will contribute important vaccine- specific expertise to the success of this project. Additionally, I bring experience in designing and implementing educational programs for healthcare providers. These skills make me well- suited to my role in this proposed study. B.
