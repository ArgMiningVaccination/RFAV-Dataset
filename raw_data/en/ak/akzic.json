A FERPA Consent to Release Student Information Form m ust be completed by the student before any protected information is released. A n MWHC MISR FERPA Consent to Release Student Information Form is included in the Appendix of this handbook or may be obtain ed from the Director of Radiology Education upon reques t. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom th e rights have transferred are \"eligible students.\" Eligible students have the right to inspect and review the student's education records maintained by the school. Schools are not required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great dist ance, it is impossible for eligible students to review the records. Schools may charge a fee for copies. Eligible students have the right to request that a school correct records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If the school decides not to amend the record, the eligible student then has the right to a formal hearing. After the hearing, if the school still decides not to amend the record, the eligible student has the right to place a statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested information. Eligible students must represent themselves in all student/faculty/administrative meetings, no attorney o r other advisors/counselors are allowed in due process/grievance meetings (hearings). Eligible students have the right to request a family member (parent , spouse or significant other) be present as a silent witness to any meeting. Third -party attendees are to direct any questions/answers to the eligible student who then has the right to direct that question/answer t o program faculty or the hospital administration. Generally, schools must have written permission from the eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, wit hout consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR \u00a7 99.31): o School officials with legitimate educational interest; o Other schools to which a student is transferring; o Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes; o Approp riate parties in connection with financial aid to a student; o Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school; o Accrediting organizations; o To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena; o Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and o State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law. Schools may disclose, without consent, \"directory\" information such as a student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance. However, schools must tell parents and eligible students about directory information and allow parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose dir ectory information about them. Schools must notify parents and eligible students annually of their rights under FERPA. The actual means of notification (special letter, inclusion in a PTA bulletin, student handbook, or newspaper article) is left to the dis cretion of each school.

Students entering MedStar Washington Hospital Center Medical Imaging School of Radiology must be aware that they may be exposed to various contagious diseas es during their clinical education and career. Precautions 34 to be taken are outlined in the introductory patient care courses. Additional information may be provided by each clinical facility. Students are required to use available protective devices and to use standard (universal) precautions. Students, upon diagnosis of communicable disease(s) (i.e., chickenpox, measles, flu, etc.), must contact the Occupational Health immediately. Based on current medical knowledge, the Occupational Health will make a judgment of communicability and advise the student regarding attendance. Students who give birth or experience an illness or injury which requires, but is not limited to, hospitalization, surgery, or more than one week's absence will be required to provide a physician's statement which verifies: 1. That returning to routine class, lab, and clinical activities do not pose undue risk or harm to the student or others with whom the student will come in contact. 2. Compliance with the Technical Standards established b y the MedStar Washington Hospital Center Medical Imaging School of Radiology . STUDENT HEALTH Health Assessment & Physical/Drug Screening Each student must complete the MWHC Occupational Health pre -employment physical by the first day of classes.

COMMUNICABLE DISEASES A communicable disease is defined as any disease which may be transmitted directly or indirectly from one individual to another. A student must notify the MedStar Washington Hospital Center Medical Imaging School of Radiology Director of Radiology Education if he/she contracts or comes in contact with a communicable 35 disease. If exposure occurs, the student will be referred to Occupational Health . At that time, it will be determined what action, if any, may b e necessary to protect the student, other students, staff, and patients. Time missed will be completed according to the attendance policy. COVID -19 All MedStar Health associates and other \"Covered Individuals\" identified below under \"Scope of Policy\" mus t be Fully Vaccinated against COVID -19 unless they request and receive approval for a medical contraindication or religious exemption. All Covered Individuals required to be vaccinated must show proof of receipt of the COVID -19 vaccination in a manner acce ptable and in accordance with the schedule required by MedStar Health. Scope of Policy The vaccine requirement in this policy applies to all MedStar Health Associates (including employed physicians and other credentialed individuals, employed residents and fellows), private medical staff members, other non - employed credentialed professionals , non -employed affiliated residents and fellows, board members, volunteers, students, contractors, and all vendors who work for, provide services to or otherwise do business with MedStar Health or any of its subsidiaries while on MedStar premises (collecti vely referred to as \"Covered Individuals\"). The vaccine requirement applies to all MedStar Health Associates, including those who may be currently designated as 100% remote. Professionals visiting MedStar Health premises for short -term events (e.g., consul tants to Administration, Grand Round presenters) are excluded from this policy. COVID -19 is a pandemic of respiratory disease that spreads from person -to-person. COVID -19 can cause mild to severe illness; most severe illness occurs in older adults. Nev ertheless, people of all ages are at risk of contracting COVID -19, and people with severe chronic medical conditions including, but not limited to, heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, are at a higher risk of developing serious COVID -19 illness. Addi tionally, healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID -19 have a higher risk of exposure. Students understand that the Clinical Facilities may have patients recovering from COVID -19. Symptoms of COVID -19 include, but are not limited to : o Fever (sub jective or 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit) or chills o Cough o Congestion o Sore throat o Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing o Diarrhea o Nausea or vomiting o Fatigue o Headache o Muscle or body aches o New loss of taste or smell o Or otherwise feeling unwell. Reported illnesses may range from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including death. If a student feels sick, the student agrees not to go to the Clinical Facilities and the student will stay home for the period recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Medstar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC) . 36 Additionally, while participating in the Program, students agree to take all necessary precautions recommended by the CDC and adopted by MWHC to prevent the spread of COVID -19, including but not limited to, washing hands thoroughly and often, avoiding gatherings of ten or more people, and wearing a mask to cover their mouth and nose. Current guidance includes universal masking, eye protection with all patient encounters, transmission -based precautions, frequent hand hygiene, physical distancing and other prevention strategies as needed. Guidance is subject to change without notice. All students are required to be vaccinated. Booster vaccines are highly suggested. Vaccinated students (at least 2-weeks after the documented second dose) are not permitted to perform any exam on a confirmed COVID -19 patient during the first two semesters but ARE permitted to perform an exam on a pa tient under investigation (PUI). Fully vaccinated students are permitted to perform exams on confirmed COVID -19 positive students during their third (Summer) semester. MedStar Washington Hospital Center strongly encourages COVID -19 vaccines to all student providers. Both vaccines have equal efficacy (94 -95%) and similar side effects and safety profiles. MWHC provides Pfizer and Moderna vaccines at no cost to student providers. Students are required to wear a Level 1 \"surgical mask\" during all classroom an d laboratory experiences and practice social distancing as much as possible as recommended by the CDC. Students are not permitted to wear cloth (homemade) masks during any class, laboratory, or clinical activity. The face mask must fit completely over the nose, under the chin, and snugly against the sides of his/her face. **subject to change based on current CDC recommendation and MSH guidance. Students are required to wear an N95 respirator and MWHC approved eye protection for any PUI patient interaction s. Students must wear a Level 1 \"surgical mask\" and face shield in clinic when interacting with a non-PUI patient. Any student who does not comply with the PPE face -covering requirement will be subjected to disciplinary action as a failure to comply with the MWHC MISR clinical dress code policy. Voluntary COVID -19 testing is available for asymptomatic students who request COVID -19 testing for any reason. It is important to note, voluntary student testing does not replace existing infection prevention prot ocols, including the need to continue universal masking and proper use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), physical distancing, and hand hygiene. Testing Process Please see the Clinical Coordinator or StarPort for the most recent testing process. MedStar Health associates, including providers, can now schedule COVID -19 testing online using the Integrated Digital Health Platform (IDHP) at Access.MedStarHealth.org or through the COVID -19 StarPort page here . Associates may create an account; log in using an existing IDHP account or their MedStar Health Patient Portal (myMedS tar) credentials; or continue as a guest (NOTE: Using the guest option will not allow associates to access, change, or cancel their appointment at a later time). The associate COVID -19 testing option can be found under \"Find Care.\" Associates can then select \"MedStar Associate COVID -19 Testing\" to see all associate testing options, which showcases the nearest location and earliest available appointment, OR search for a specific location by name. Additional locations will be added th is week, including eight sites dedicated to testing for asymptomatic associates, as part of the COVID -19 Testing Wellness Program. 37 IMPORTANT NOTE: Associates should be tested for COVID -19 within 48 hours of symptom onset, if possible. Hospital -based as sociates can access walk -in COVID -19 Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR) testing at their respective hospital. Associates using this option do NOT need to contact the Occupational Health Call Center in advance. Walk -in testing is only to be used for obtaining clearance to work \u2014NOT for personal needs or \"wellness\" testing (i.e., in advance of travel, visiting family or friends). The MedStar Washington Hospital Center return -to-work testing is the Physicians Office Building Conference Rooms A,B, and C. (\"Wellnes s testing\" is for associates with no symptoms , including those with a non-household exposure, with results within 48 hours. Call the COVID -19 Testing Wellness Program Call Center between 8 a.m. -5 p.m. at 877-384-3530. Our testing site is in the Main Hospit al, first floor, behind the B elevators. ) Non-hospital -based associates can schedule testing appointments online or call the Occupational Health Call Center at 844-354-3705 to schedule a COVID -19 test. Associates who test positive for COVID -19 at a testing location OUTSIDE of MedStar Health must either email their positive COVID -19 test results to Occupational Health at OHCOVID19@medstar.net or call the Occupa tional Health Call Center at 844-354-3705 and follow the provided instructions for submitting their positive test results. Associates who test positive for COVID -19 do NOT need clearance from Occupational Health if the return -to- work criteria is met. A n egative COVID -19 test is NOT required prior to returning to work. For the return -to- work criteria and additional guidance, see Instructions for Associ ates Following COVID -19 Testing on StarPort. Reporting of Test Results Test results will be provided to the student within 48 hours of test completion. Asymptomatic s tudents should continue their regular clinical/class schedule while they await their test results (applies only to wellness testing or asymptomatic testing) . Students with positive COVID -19 test results will be contacted by Occupational Health and provided guidance for the next steps, which include not reporting to class/clinic and additional testing. Those with negative results will be contacted by a text me ssaging chatbot tool. Results will also be available on the myMedStar Patient Portal at myMedStar.org . Importantly, all students should continuously self -monitor for COVID -19 symptoms and contact the Occupational Health Call Center at 844 -354-3705 should any symptoms present. Unvaccinated MWHC MISR students are NOT permitted to image any MedStar ER trauma patients (Code Yellow, burns, etc.) at this time. As we continue to monitor the COVID -19 pandemic, the Director of Radiology Education and the MWHC Sup ervisor of Diagnostic Radiology will decide at a later time when unvaccinated students can image MedStar ER patients who are not under any PUI/COVID -19 precautions. Students agree to abide by any and all specific requests by the School and the Clinical Fa cilities for their safety and the safety of others, as well as any and all of the School's and the Clinical Facilities' rules and policies applicable to all activities related to this Program. Students understand that the School and the Clinical Facilities reserve the right to exclude student participation in this Program if participation or behavior is deemed detrimental to the safety or welfare of others. 38 MWHC MISR students and faculty will complete the appropriate COVID -19 Attestation before attending any classroom, clinical, or laboratory activities. COVID -19 attestations must be completed within five (5) minutes upon arrival before doing any other activi ty according to DC HELC. Students who do not complete their COVID -19 attestation within the required time will be subject to disciplinary action as listed below. Disciplinary action will restart each semester Initial Warnings (1st occurrence) Progressive S uspension (1 -3 days [2nd through 4th occurrences]) Dismissal (5th occurrence) The MWHC COVID Attestatio ns includes the following steps : ASK Students, faculty, and staff should be asked about whether the student or staff member has experienced the foll owing symptoms consistent with COVID -19: o Fever (subjective or 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit) or chills o Cough o Congestion o Sore throat o Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing o Diarrhea o Nausea or vomiting o Fatigue o Headache o Muscle or body aches o New loss of taste or smell o Or otherwise feeling unwell. Students, faculty, and staff are asked if they have been in close contact with a person who has COVID - 19. LOOK: School staff should visually inspect each student, faculty, and staff member for signs of illness which could include flushed cheeks, rapid breathing or difficulty breathing (without recent physical activity), fatigue, or extreme fussiness. If a student, faculty, or staff member reports any of the above symptoms or is confirmed to have COVID -19, the student, faculty, or staff member must not return to school until: They complete the appropriate isolation period: o 72 hours after the fever has re solved without the use of fever -reducing medication (e.g., Motrin, Tylenol) and respiratory symptoms have improved; AND o Depending on severity of illness a t least ten to twenty days after symptoms first appeared, whichever is later; OR They have a negat ive COVID -19 test, and meet standard criteria to return to school after an illness; OR They have been cleared from isolation per MWHC Occupational Health, and/or their healthcare provider or DC Health instructions. If any student, faculty, or staff memb er has been in close contact with a person who is positive for COVID -19, then the student or staff member must not enter the facility until cleared by Occupational Health . 39 If any student, faculty, or staff member is awaiting a symptomatic COVID -19 test result, then the student, faculty, or staff member must not enter the facility cleared by MWHC Occupational Health . If they test positive, then they should immediately begin a self-quarantine and seek further guidance from their healthcare provider , MWHC Occupational Health and/or local Public Health Department . Dismissal Criteria: If a student, faculty, or staff member develops a fever or other signs of illness, the school m ust follow the above exclusion criteria regarding the exclusion and dismissal of students, faculty, and staff. The Director of Radiology Education will send the student/faculty/staff member home immediately or isolate until it is safe to go home, refer t he student to Occupational Health for guidance, and follow cleaning and disinfecting procedures for any area, materials, and equipment with which the student/faculty/staff member was in contact. EXPOSURE REPORTING, NOTIFICATIONS, & DISINFECTION Step 1: R eporting to DC Health MWHC Occupational Health reports any communicable disease exposure to the MWHC MISR Director of Radiology. MWHC Occupational Health will notify the Director of Radiology Education if the student, faculty, and/or staff is cleared to re turn to work or not cleared to return to work. Occupational Health will identify a student, faculty, or staff member who has tested COVID -19 positive to the Director or Radiology Education. the MWHC MISR established plan for COVID -19 exposures is as follo ws: 1. MWHC MISR will notify DC with the following information: \"COVID -19 Consult\" in the email subject line Name and direct phone number of the best point of contact for DC Health to return the call Short summary of incident/situation 2. An investigator from DC Health will follow -up within 24 hours to all appropriately submitted email notifications. Decisions on the timeline of exclusion and any other responses to a COVID -19 exposure will be determined by DC Health. Step 2: Communication to Students, Faculty, and Staff The Director of Radiology Education will communicate in a way that protects the privacy of individuals and alert the students, faculty, and staff to a COVID -19 case. Communication is to be completed, per DC Health directive and will include: Notification to those students/faculty and staff in close contact with the individual including the requirement to quarantine for 14 days, Notification to the entire prog ram that there was a COVID -19 positive case, those impacted have been told to quarantine, and steps that will be taken (e.g., cleaning and disinfection), Education about COVID -19, including the signs and symptoms, available at https://coronavirus.dc.gov ; Referral to the Guidance for Contacts of a Person Confirmed to have COVID -19, available at https://coronavirus.dc.gov ; and Information on options for COVID -19 testi ng in the District of Columbia, available at https://coronavirus.dc.gov/testing . DC Health will instruct schools on dismissals and other safety precautions in the event a known COVID -19 individual came in close contact with others at school. Step 3: Cleaning, Sanitization, and Disinfection of Affected Spaces 40 In the event of a confirmed COVID -19 case in a student, faculty, or staff member, the MWHC MISR follow all steps outlined by DC Health as well as the cleaning, disinfection, and sanitization guidance from the CDC, linked here: If seven days or fewer have passed since the person who is sick used the facility, follow these steps: 1) Close off areas used by the person who is sick. 2) Open outside doors a nd windows to increase air circulation in the areas. 3) Wait up to 24 hours or as long as possible before cleaning or disinfecting to allow respiratory droplets to settle. 4) Clean and disinfect all areas used by the person who is sick, such as classrooms, bathrooms, and common areas. If more than seven days have passed since the person who is sick used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary. Continue routine cleaning and disinfection. COVID -19 CONTINGENCY PLAN In the event, the DMV area is mandated to shelter in place the MWHC MISR contingencies for pandemic scenarios include: Halt all in -class lecture and switch to synchronous online course content delivered via Microsoft Teams to mitigate the transmission of COVID -19 Hybri d on-campus laboratory activities with no patient contact by appointment to practice and test for laboratory simulation. Pause all clinical -based learning activities and implement supplemental software during a shelter in place mandate MWHC MISR Faculty w ill work remotely during the shelter in place order to mitigate the transmission of COVID -19 MWHC OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH There are certain instances when a student may need to be evaluated by MWHC Occupational Health . These occasions may include situations regarding exposure to blood/body fluid/needle stick or if a student has an infectious disease. These visits would be to ensure that the health and safety of the student, patients, visitors , and Associates are considered. HANDWASHING Please refer to the MW HC Hand Hygiene policy in the Appendix. INFECTION CONTROL Students are to observe standard precautions with all patients whenever there is a possibility of exposure to blood and other body fluids. Summary of the Center for Disease Control Guidelines to Pre vent Transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Other Blood -Borne Infectious Agents in the Hospital: A. Needles and Other Sharps - avoid accidental injury; dispose of in sharps needle disposable boxes. B. Hand washing - before and after patient contact donning gloves; before and after donning gloves. C. Gowns - if soil ed with blood and body fluids is anticipated. D. Masks - for prolonged contact with coughing patients and when airborne or splattering is likely. E. Protective Eyewear - if splashing of infectious materials is likely. 41 F. Gloves - when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, mucous membranes, non -intact skin, or contaminated items. Standard precautions are required for all patients. Some patients also r equire additional precautions because of specific communicable infections or conditions. Some examples of these categories are strict isolation, contact isolation, drainage/secretion precautions, respiratory precautions, and enteric precautions. Students c oming in contact with these isolation situations must observe the appropriate isolation condition. Any Student having a question regarding infection control situations should contact the supervising radiologic tec hnologist, Clinical Coordinator, or Directo r of Radiology Education . Any student believing, they have received exposure to infectious material must contact the Clinical Coordinator, Director of Radiology Education and Occupational Health . Students may feel free to refer to MedStar Health Infection Prevention policies, procedures , and standards which are available online, through SharePoint , in the Policies Database. PREGNANCY POLICY Declaration of pregnancy is voluntary and at the discretion of the student. A student who bec omes pregnant has the following options: A. Voluntarily give written notice of declaration of pregnancy - A student who voluntarily makes a written declaration of pregnancy may take advantage of lower exposure limits (0.5 rem), and additional dose monitoring provisions. The stu dent must declare her pregnancy in writing to the Director of Radiology Education . The student will be referred to the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) for additional counseling in protective measures and will be assigned a prenatal radiation badge. B. Choose not to declare pregnancy - If the student elects not to declare pregnancy and to continue in the program , normal occ upational exposure limits will c ontinue to apply. The student must meet the academic requirements and clinical objectives with no accommodations made. C. Continue in the program with modification - The student would continue on a full-time or part -time status with reassignment of rotations** (as requested by the student) coordinated with the Clinical Coordinator. The student will be referred to the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) for additional counseling in protective measures and will be assigned a prenatal radiation badge . Any didactic or clinical requirements not completed as a result of pregnancy must be made up before graduation and before being permitted to take the registry. D. Continue in the program wit hout modification - The student would continue to attend both clinical and didactic classes as scheduled with no accommodations made. The student must be able to meet the academic requirements and clinical objectives to continue in the program. E. Withdraw declaration of p regnancy - If at any time the student decides to revoke her declaration of pregnancy, she may do so. This action requires written notification to the Radiation Safety Officer and the Director of Radiology Education . F. Request a leave of absence - Refer t o \"Leave of Absence Policy\" G. Withdraw from the program and apply for re -entry at a later time - Refer to the program Withdrawal and Re -Entry policy For the occupational dose limit for the whole body of 5 rem (50 mSv) per year, which applies to occupationally exposed individuals, the risk is believed to be very low. Radiology students over the age of 18 are considered occupationally exposed individuals for the purposes of radiation protection. The Nuclear Regu latory 42 Commission (NRC) has reviewed the relevant scientific literature and has concluded that exposure of 0.5 rem (5 mSv) provides an adequate margin of protection for the embryo/fetus. Through proper instruction, strict adherence to safety precautions an d through personnel monitoring, it is possible to limit occupational exposure to under 0.5 rem during the period of gestation. PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT To assure that the student conducts himself/herself in a manner appropriate to the dignity of the profession , the student will: Practice courtesy to all patients and their families, physicians, and hospital Associates in order to promote an environment conducive to quality patient care. Make every effort to protect the patients from unnecessary radiation. Pract ice ALARA. Protect the patient's right to privacy and shall maintain all patient information in the strictest confidence. Students are required to complete the MWHC Confidentiality form Protect the public from any and all misinformation or misrepresentatio n. Conduct themselves professionally at all times to include, but not limited to: o Never discussing personal problems and/or social activities in the presence of a patient. o Never speaking or laughing obnoxiously and/or boisterously in the presence of any patient. o Never eat, drink or chew gum in the presence of a patient. o Restrict telephone use for patient -related activities only, except in emergency personal situations. Main tain all facilities in a neat, clean, and safe manner. Place the care of the patient above all else. Remember students represent the school at all arranged events; therefore, any photograph s taken must be evaluated and approved by the faculty prior to publ ic display. Postings of photographs or video taken on MWHC property or at a n MWHC sponsored event must not be posted unless specifically authorized by MW HC Marketing and Communications. GENERAL PLAN FOR CLINICAL EDUCATION Each clinical education center has a Clinical Instructor responsible for supervision. The Clinical Instructor, or a designated technologist, supervises the student in the clinical education center. Supervision may be direct or indirect, depending on the progress of the student i n the program. Students are assigned to different clinical education centers. Clinical assignments will begin on the sixth week of the fall semester . Students will rotate through the different diagnostic areas to facilitate the transfer of knowledge fr om theory to application of skills by performing diagnostic radiographic procedures. During the five-week MWHC MISR orientation , students are oriented to fire safety, infection control, back safety, and CPR. Following orientation, students begin attendi ng clinical. At each site, students a re oriented to the department during orientation . At the end of each week, students are evaluated using the appropriate clinical progress evaluation in Trajecsys. During initial rotations, students will be primarily engaged in observation. Students will become proficient and gain competence through practice and experience. The clinical competencies that follow are designed to prepare the student for job entry -level competence upon graduation. Specific category comp etency requirements are listed in the respective clinical education course syllabus provided by the instructor as required by ARRT. Opportunities for attaining competence in pediatric, trauma, surgical, and bedside procedures are provided. Simulation is u tilized for infrequent or limited volume examinations and will comprise a minor component of 43 clinical education. Opportunities are provided for observation in computed tomography, echo, interventional radiology, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medici ne, mammography, radiation therapy, and ultrasonography, during the final semester provided the student is on track to complete his/her ARRT competency requirements. CLINICAL EXPERIENCE Clinical experience is gained by attending five clinical courses du ring the five semesters of the program. Required clinical days will vary and are subject to change as deemed necessary by the Clinical Coordinator. CLINICAL ROTATIONS Students will be assigned to clinical areas on a rotational basis. Schedules are given to students and the site clinical instructors at the beginning of each semester. Clinical start times may begin between 5:00 am and 10:00 am; occasionally variances may occur. Students are expected to stay in the clinical area assigned. Students may not \"swap\" assignments. CONTACTING STUDENTS DURING CLINICAL HOURS NO CELL PHONES are permitted during clinical hours . Messages may be replied to during lunch or after hours. If the student needs to be reached for whatever reason, it is advised to leave emergency telephone numbers for the clinical facility or to have the family contact the school. Clinical Supervision Policy The Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology (JRCERT) requires that prior to a student attaining competency; the student must function in a clinical setting under the DIRECT supervision of a qualified radiographer. The JRCERT defines a qualified radiographer as a technologist certified by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT). All radiologic procedures/examinations will be performed under the DIRECT supervision of a qualified radiographer until the student has obtain ed the required competency on a given procedure/examination. The level of supervision the student receives is determined by the student's level of competency. Students may only be tested for competency by an ARRT qualified radiographer. DIRECT SUPERVISIO N Until a student achieves and documents competency, clinical assignments shall be carried out under the direct supervision of qualified radiographers. A qualified radiographer is a staff technologist who is ARRT registered and approved by the MWHC MISR faculty. This means that a n ARRT registered technologist : Reviews the request for the examination and evaluates the readiness of the student to perform the examination. Evaluates the condition of the patient in relation to the student's knowledge. Is physica lly present in the exam room with the student to verify the patient, exam to be performed, patient position, anatomical marker placement, central ray, laterality, and technical factors. Reviews and approves the images. 44 **Students are never allowed to per form portables or operating room cases alone. **Students are never allowed to repeat an image alone. A n ARRT registered technologist must always be present when a student is repeating an image. ** An ARRT registered technologist must always be present wh en a student is repeating an image and students must document all repeated images in Trajecsys. **All images taken by students must be approved by an ARRT registered technologist prior to the images being sent to the PACS system. INDIRECT SUPERVISION After demonstrating competency, students may perform procedures under indirect supervision. For indirect supervision, a qualified radiographer is immediately available to assist students regardless of the level of student achievement. This means that the qualified radiographer is present in an area adjacent to the room or location where the radiographic procedure is being performed and is within calling distance without obstacles in the way. This applies to all areas where ionizing radiation equipment is in use. Example of inappropriate indirect supervision: If a technologist is in one room with a patient and a student is in another room with a patient this would not be considered indirect supervision because the technologist is not immediately availab le to the student. The technologist has a duty to provide care for the patient in their direct care and this presents an obstacle to providing indirect supervision to the student. Example of appropriate indirect supervision: If a student is in a room w ith a patient and the technologist is in the work core working on paperwork or other duties which could be stopped immediately and is within voice range of the student. REPEAT SUPERVISION In the event of an image must be repeated students must be under th e direct supervision of a qualified radiographer. This means that an ARRT registered technologist : Evaluates the previous image and discusses with the student how to correct the image. Is physically present in the exam room with the student to verify the p atient, exam to be performed, patient position, anatomical marker placement, central ray, laterality, and technical factors. Reviews and approves the required correction BEFORE another exposure is completed . Example of inappropriate indirect supervision: If a technologist is in one room with a patient and a student is in another room with a patient this would not be considered indirect supervision because the technologist is not immediately available to the student. The technologist has a duty to provi de care for the patient in their direct care and this presents an obstacle to providing indirect supervision to the student. Example of appropriate indirect supervision: If a student is in a room with a patient and the technologist is in the work core w orking on paperwork or other duties which could be stopped immediately and is within voice range of the student. ** Students are never allowed to perform portables or operating room cases alone. 45 ** Students are never allowed to repeat an image alone. A n ARRT registered technologist must always be present when a student is repeating an image **Students found in violation of the direct/indirect supervision policy will automatically drop one Clinical letter grade per occurrence and be placed on a step of di scipline. ** Additionally, any student found to be in violation of the MWHC MISR Supervision Policy will be subject to disciplinary action as listed below. Initial Warnings (1st occurrence) Written Warnings (2nd occurrence) Suspension (1 -3 days) (3rd occurrence) Dismissal (4th occurrence) COMPETENCY EXAMS Per ARRT standards, students must successfully complete: Ten (10) mandatory general patient care activities Thirty -Six (36) mandatory imaging procedures Fifteen elective (15) procedures of thirty -four available elective imaging procedures to be selected from a list of procedures One (1) elective imaging procedure from the head section; and Two (2) elective imaging procedures from the fluoroscopy studies section. The MWHC Medical Imaging Sch ool of Radiology requires a total of 43 mandatory competency exams , 10 elective competency exams, (to include one elective imaging procedure from the head section and two electives from the fluoroscopy section ), 10 terminal competency exams, and 10 patient care competency exams be successfully completed by each student prior to being recommended for graduation (73 total). A list of competencies will be provided to each student and an official record of the student's competencies will be validated by the Cli nical Coordinator in Trajecsys , however , it is the student's responsibility to keep track their own record s as well . The process for proving competency will be described later in this handbook. The following competencies are the general category clinical competencies required: Upper Extremity Lower Extremity Chest/Thorax Spine/Pelvis Geriatric/Pediatric Abdomen Fluoroscopy Mobile/Surgery Head Miscellaneous RAD 130 Clinical Education I 3 competencies RAD 132 Clinical Education II 15 competencies RAD 230 Clinical Education III 10 competencies RAD 232 Clinical Education IV 15 competencies RAD 234 Clinical Educ ation V 10 competencies 10 t erminal competencies TERMINAL COMPETENCY REQUIREMENTS Students must complete ten (10) terminal competency exams assigned by the clinical instructor or the clinical 46 coordinator. Students must have completed all ARRT require d competencies prior to completing terminal competencies. These competencies will include: 2 Portable studies 1 chest exam 1 Contrast study 1 abdomen exam 1 multiple stud ies with 3 or more exams 2 extremity exams 1 Spine/ Hip or Pelvis 1 C-Arm Terminal competencies may only be graded by the clinical instructors, clinical coordinator or by a technologist assigned by school faculty. Students may not select the exams for the terminal competency. Students must successfully complete all terminal co mpetencies with a grade of 90% or better to be eligible for graduation from the program. ACHIEVING CLINICAL COMPETENCY To achieve and document competency on an exam a student must: 1. Successfully achieve competency on the didactic exam and laboratory exam 2. Verbally request to test for competency on the exam prior to the start of the exam 3. Participate in any other X -ray exams that are ordered on the patient 4. Have previously documented in Trajecsys that they have observed one exam and have practiced the required number of exams under the direct supervision of a registered technologist before the exam begins. a. Observe - Student watches the technologist perform the exam, while in the room with the technologist (not standing behind a control panel). b. Assisted- Student assists the technologist in the performance of the exam by performing tasks such as placing or running cassettes, completing computer documentation, transporting or assisting the patient (this list is not all -inclusive). As students' progress in technical ability, an assist may serve as an observe as long as the student has participated in the entire exam. c. Practiced with major assistance Student performs the exam under direct supervision with major assistance. d. Practiced with minor assistance - Student performs the exam under direct supervision with minimal assistance. e. Perform - Student performs the exam under indirect supervision * Students a re required to use their personal markers when testing for competency 5. Must perform the exam without techno logist assistance (lifting assistance by staff is permitted) 6. Pass the competency with a minimum grade of 85% 7. Answer five questions at the discretion of the technologist on anatomy and positioning of the exam. All competency exams will be considered pendin g until the final approval from the Clinical Coordinator as indicated by being included on the student's master competency file. Following the update on the master clinical file, the student may perform that procedure under indirect supervision with the exception of portable and OR exams. The Clinical Coordinator reserves the right to revoke competencies based on clinical performan ce and to assign clinical remediation as necessary.

Wacker Drive, Suite www.jrcert.org Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology (JRCERT) is dedicated to excellence i n education and to the quality and safety of patient care through the accreditation of educational programs in the radiologic sciences. The JRCERT is the only agency recognized by the U nited States Department of Education (USDE) and the Council on Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) for the accreditation of traditional and distance delivery educational programs in radiography, radiation therapy, magnetic resonance, and medical dosimetry. The JRCERT awards accreditation to programs demonstrating substant ial compliance with these STANDARDS . Copyright \u00a9 2020 by the JRCERT 53 Introductory Statement The Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology (JRCERT) Standards for an Accredited Educational Program in Radiography are designed to promote academic excellence, patient safety, and quality healthcare. The STANDARDS require a program to articulate its purposes; to demonstrate that it has adequate human, physical, and financial resources effectively organized for the accomplishment of its purposes; to document its effectiveness in accomplishing these purposes; and to provide assurance that it can continue to meet accreditation standards. The JRCERT accreditation process offers a means of providing assurance to the public that a program meets specific quality standards. The process helps to maintain program quality and stimulates program improvement through program assessment . There are six (6) standards. Each standard is titled and includes a narrative statement supported by specific objectives. Each objective, in turn, includes the following clarifying element s: Explanation - provides clarification on the intent and key details of the objective. Required Program Response - requires the program to provide a brief narrative and/or documentation that demonstrates compliance with the objective. Possible Site V isitor Evaluation Methods - identifies additional materials that may be examined and personnel who may be interviewed by the site visitors at the time of the on -site evaluation to help determine if the program has met the particular objective. Review of a dditional materials and/or interviews with listed personnel is at the discretion of the site visit team. Regarding each standard, the program must: Identify strengths related to each standard Identify opportunities for improvement related to each standard Describe the program's plan for addressing each opportunity for improvement Describe any progress already achieved in addressing each opportunity for improvement Provide any additional comments in relation to each standard The self -study report, as well as the results of the on -site evaluation conducted by the site visit team, will determine the program's compliance with the Standards by the JRCERT Board of Directors. 54 Standards for an Accredited Educational Program in Radiography Table of Contents Standard One: Accountability, Fair Practices, and Public Information The sponsoring institution and program promote accountability and fair practices in relation to students, faculty, and the public.
