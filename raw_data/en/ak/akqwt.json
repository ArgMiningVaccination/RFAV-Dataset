A bruise is a form of injury in which blood vessels beneath the skin break, causing skin discoloration. Bruises are a common occurrence. Thankfully, there are many remedies for bruises. Since they start taking their first steps, children stumble and fall and get bruises. A majority of kids are quite proud of them, and they wear the blue-black bruises that turn yellow-purple like badges of pride. We are too busy as grownups to be cautious. Some bruises we get as adults are small, while others are not. Not all of them are harmful, and they can be eliminated quickly and easily. For the most part, there are straightforward solutions, which may simply require taking some rest and letting it heal on its own. It is unrealistic to rush to the pharmacy or the doctor for every bruise. The best thing you can do is look after them at home. But before we learn how to heal bruises and get into the best home treatments for bruise removal, let's talk about what bruises are. In This Article What Is A Bruise? Being the largest organ system in the body, the skin's primary function is protection. Often, it gets caught in the middle and experiences cuts, bumps, and blows. 'Bruise' is the term used to identify the effect of any traumatic incident on the skin. It is a common type of injury in which discoloration of the skin occurs. This discoloration is because the blood vessels beneath the skin burst and leak blood into the surrounding tissue. This blood collects near the surface of the skin, resulting in a black/blue mark ( [1](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007213.htm)). Home Remedies For Bruises The home remedies for bruises in this article are effective in treating subcutaneous bruises that affect the superficial layers of the skin. Hematoma and [inflammation](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/skin-inflammation/) are the two most common forms of subcutaneous bruising. Hematoma refers to the discoloration of the skin, wherein the capillaries in the underlying layers are injured, and the skin turns a range of colors from blue to red, yellow, and purple. Inflammation refers to swelling, which may or may not accompany a bruise ( [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072482/)). Some of the remedies that can be used for subcutaneous bruising are listed below. How To Get Rid Of Bruises Overnight 1. Ice Or Heat a. Treat Bruise With Ice You Will Need Ice pack or ice compress What You Have To Do - Apply the ice pack for 15 minutes. Repeat this thrice a day. - The best method of applying an ice pack is to move it continuously around the bruised area in a circular motion, so as not to freeze a vein or increase the pain. When You Need To Do This Do this for two to three days. How This Works If the skin is inflamed after injury, an ice pack can help reduce the swelling. An ice pack can also be made by wrapping an ice cube in a piece of soft cloth. Applying an ice cube on a bug sting or insect bite also aids healing, reduces irritation, and decreases the inflammation ( [3](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000033.htm)). [Dr. Sanul Corrielus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drcorrielus/), MD, MBA, FACC, says, \"Apply ice to the area immediately following the injury to stop the flow of blood there. The amount of blood that seeps into the tissue around it can be reduced by cooling the blood vessels. This can lessen swelling and make the bruise less obvious.\" b. Treat Bruise With Heat You Will Need - A hot pack - Hot water What You Have To Do - Pour hot water carefully into the hot pack. - Steadily move it over the area in a gentle manner while applying some pressure. You can also use a soft cloth dipped in hot water. Wring out the excess water and keep it over the bruise. When You Need To Do This Do this several times a day. How This Works A warm compress acts on a bruise by inducing blood flow to that area, speeding up the healing process. This heat therapy can be used on bruises after the inflammation subsides. The warm compression also releases shock and the pain of the injury ( [4](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=1sMt7DD6FZcC&pg=PA23&dq=warm+compress+bruise&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_6r3yqdHLAhWDUY4KHVDCA6kQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&q=warm%20compress%20bruise&f=false)). You can also rub a warm hard boiled egg on the bruise. Dr. Corrielus adds, \"Heat can improve blood flow and circulation by applying heat. After the bruise has already formed, this will aid in the removal of the blood that has become trapped. Heat can also help relax tight muscles and alleviate pain.\" 2. Essential Oils You Will Need A few drops of lavender oil or tea tree oil What You Have To Do Take one to three drops of the essential oil and gently massage it into the bruise.

These remedies are tested and tried, and will work wonders in getting rid of the bruise marks. Now, let's understand a little more about bruises by knowing about the underlying causes, signs and symptoms, how they are categorized, and a few FAQs to clear your common doubts. What Causes Bruising? The blood vessels present beneath the skin can burst or leak either because they have become weak or they are damaged. Some of the most common reasons which contribute to bruising are: - Blows to the body - Bumping on to hard surfaces like a chair, a post, etc. - Cuts while dealing with sharp objects - Bites (mostly animals or insects) - Falling, stumbling, tripping - Burns - Injuries while engaging in sports - Accidents on the road - Side effects of medicines - Viral infection or illness - Allergic reactions Another common cause of bruises is 'thinning' of the skin, which is a natural process that occurs when individuals age. Serious medical conditions like autoimmune disorders, leukemia, and septicemia can also result in bruising ( [29](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003235.htm)). Symptoms And Signs Of Bruising a. Discoloration Of Skin: Initially, a bruise appears red in color. Slowly, this transforms into a black and/or blue color. Other colors that have been observed are green, purple, brownish and yellowish ( [30](http://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/diseases-conditions/bruises.printerview.html)). b. Swelling: As a result of the damage the skin tissue has undergone, swelling can be seen at the bruise site. c. Pain: The high impact with which you bumped into something can lead to pain in the area. This can last for a few hours to a few days. d. Tenderness: The damaged tissue becomes highly sensitive to touch and tenderness can be observed. e. Severe Symptoms: These include persistent swelling and pain in the area of bruising or a bruise that doesn't heal even after four weeks. Please consult a doctor under such circumstances ( [31](http://www.healthline.com/health/bruise)). Some medications like blood thinners, as well as medical conditions like diabetes, may render some natural remedies for bruises ineffective. Besides, as bruises tend to heal themselves on a healthy body after a fortnight naturally and the entire home remedies act as catalysts to the healing process, it is important to seek medical and professional help, if pain or discomfort persists after some time. In some cases, prolonged inflammation may indicate internal injury or bruise too easily may indicate some pre-existing medical condition. Types Of Bruises A bruise can develop on any part of your body. We can categorize them into the following major groups: A. Bruise On Limbs: These include bruise on the leg, bruise on the thighs, bruise on an arm, bruised heels, bruise on the shin, bruised toes, and bruised finger. B. Bruise On Main Body: Commonly seen as hip bruise, bruises on the breast, bruises on stomach, and bruises on the back. C. Bruises On Face: Bruising around the eyes, bruised nose, bruise on the head, and bruise like spots on the cheeks are some common ones. D. Bruised Bone: Bruises can be internal and on the bones too. Knee bone bruise, ankle bone bruise, and bruised ribs are the most common complaints received by doctors. E. Bruised Internal Organs: When the physical impact is strong, it can form a bruise not only on the skin surface but also internally on the body organs. Some examples are bruised lungs, bruised liver, and bruised abdomen. These types of bruises can be dangerous as there are chances of internal bleeding. Stages Of Bruising A fresh bruise is swollen and appears red in color. After a day or two, the red color transforms into a blue/black color. This discoloration is one of the major signs of bruising. Every few days, a change in the bruise color can be seen, and this goes from blue/black to green to yellow, and finally, brown. After this, the bruise markings disappear ( [32](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003235.htm)). Additionally, bruises can be scored on a scale of zero to five by of how severe they are and how dangerous the injury is. Harm Score Severity Level Notes 0 Light bruise No damage 1 Mild bruise Little damage 2 Moderate bruise Some damage 3 Serious bruise Dangerous 4 Extremely serious bruise Dangerous 5 Critical bruise Risk of death How Long Does It Take For A Bruise To Go Away? On an average, it takes about 10 to 14 days for the bruise mark to go away, and also for the skin to heal completely. However, this time period depends from person to person, and can be shorter or slightly longer. What Would Happen If You Cut Open A Bruise? A bruise is a closed wound. Depending upon how intense and deep the wound is, cutting open a bruise can cause bleeding. Additionally, this makes it more prone to acquiring infections either from the instrument you used to cut it with or from the environment. It is highly inadvisable to cut open a bruise. Does Massaging Help In Quicker Healing Of A Bruise? Massage therapy helps in relieving pain from the body. Gently massage for a few minutes using chamomile oil, aloe vera gel, calendula solution or ( [34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6330525/#:~:text=Aloe%20vera%20gel%20can%20not,and%20thereby%20promote%20wound%20healing.&text=Scientific%20studies%20have%20shown%20that,of%20the%20gel%20is%20water.)), ( [35](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3270572/)). Please do not apply extreme pressure, as the tissue under your skin is damaged and this might aggravate the pain. You can also take zinc and magnesium supplements to fasten the healing process( [36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793244/#:~:text=Zinc%20is%20a%20micronutrient%20that,%2C%20to%20fibrosis%2Fscar%20formation.)), ( [37](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28540570/)). Each of the top 20 home remedies for bruises goes a long way in effectively treating inflammation and hematoma. Some of them even take care of minor cuts, stings, and bites. However, sometimes, the effects of an injury may go deeper than the surface inflammation and discoloration of the skin. When pain or swelling persist for too long, it is best to have a doctor take a look at the bruise.

Within 10-15 days, it should lighten to a light brown. How much pineapple should I eat to reduce bruising? You can eat 2 to 3 servings of pineapple a day to reduce bruising. Pineapple contains a group of enzymes called bromelain ( [1](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/bromelain#:~:text=Bromelain%20is%20a%20group%20of)) that can potentially reduce bruising and associated swelling and pain ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4998156/)). What do the colors of bruising mean? The color of the bruising indicates how much time has passed since the injury. Immediately after the injury, the bruise is red when oxygen-rich blood has gathered under the skin in the injured area. With time, the blood starts losing oxygen which leads to its discoloration. It turns dark red, maroon, or develops a greenish ring, indicating that the healing process has begun. A day or two later the bruise is bluish or dark purple as all the oxygen is gone and the red blood cells start breaking down.
