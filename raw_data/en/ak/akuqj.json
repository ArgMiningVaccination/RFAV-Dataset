It uses a combination of remedies and lifestyle modification to treat disease and maintain health. Ayurvedic medicines, known as bhasmas, commonly incorporate adjuvant heavy metals into primary herbal formulations, usually for their ascribed therapeutic properties and to enhance potency.[ [1](#1)] Heavy metals often found in Ayurvedic remedies include lead, arsenic, and mercury. Heavy metal toxicity following the use of Ayurvedic remedies is well documented in the literature.[ [1](#1)- [5](#5)] During the traditional preparation of bhasmas the metal is \"purified-out\" through multiple cooling and heating cycles and by addition of specific \"mineral herbs.\" In modern formulations, however, the concentration of heavy metals may be excessive because poor quality control allows for contamination, adulteration, or improper purification. Two recent British Columbia cases highlight the possible danger of taking Ayurvedic remedies. An adult male presented to hospital feeling very ill with vomiting and diarrhea. His blood work showed electrolyte abnormalities and anemia with basophilic stippling of his red blood cells. For some years he had been taking one tablet daily of an Ayurvedic medicine purchased in India to \"increase vigor\" ( [Figure 1](https://bcmj.org/sites/default/files/public/BCMJ_50Vol2_cdc_fig1.gif)). His blood lead \u00b5mol/L (threshold for action: 1.90 \u00b5mol/L).[ [6](#6)] Heavy metal analysis showed that each tablet contained approximately 28 mg of lead, 0.70 mg mercury, 0.11 mg arsenic, and negligible amounts of cadmium. He responded well to succimer chelation with no apparent sequelae. In the second case a young adult diabetic male presented to hospital with complaints of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain of three weeks' duration. His hemoglobin was 77 g/L (two months previously it was 160 g/L). He had no evidence of neuropathy or encephalopathy and his blood lead level was 3.7 \u00b5mol/L. For the previous six weeks the patient had been taking three teaspoonfuls twice daily of a \"herb\" to manage his diabetes. The compound was an unlabeled coarse grey-colored powder purchased at a temple in India ( [Figure 2](https://bcmj.org/sites/default/files/public/BCMJ_50Vol2_cdc_fig2.gif)). The patient's symptoms improved during a 19-day course of succimer chelation. Analysis of the powder showed that each 5 g (approximately 5 mL) contained 179.5 mg lead. The presence of other heavy metals was insignificant. Consumption of folk remedies or Ayruvedic products purchased from India may cause heavy metal intoxication. These compounds are available as liquids, capsules, tablets, or powders. Medical toxicologists at the BC Drug and Poison Information Centre may be consulted regarding assessment and management.

Above is the information needed to cite this article in your paper or presentation. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) recommends the following citation style, which is the now nearly universally accepted citation style for scientific papers: Halpern SD, Ubel PA, Caplan AL, Marion DW, Palmer AM, Schiding JK, et al. Solid-organ transplantation in HIV-infected patients. N Engl J Med. 2002;347:284-7. About the ICMJE and citation styles The ICMJE is small group of editors of general medical journals who first met informally in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1978 to establish guidelines for the format of manuscripts submitted to their journals. The group became known as the Vancouver Group. Its requirements for manuscripts, including formats for bibliographic references developed by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM), were first published in 1979. The Vancouver Group expanded and evolved into the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), which meets annually. The ICMJE created the [Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals ](http://www.icmje.org) to help authors and editors create and distribute accurate, clear, easily accessible reports of biomedical studies. An alternate version of ICMJE style is to additionally list the month an issue number, but since most journals use continuous pagination, the shorter form provides sufficient information to locate the reference. The NLM now lists all authors. BCMJ standard citation style is a slight modification of the ICMJE/NLM style, as follows: - Only the first three authors are listed, followed by \"et al.\" - There is no period after the journal name. - Page numbers are not abbreviated.
