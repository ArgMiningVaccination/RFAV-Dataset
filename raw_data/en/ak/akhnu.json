Mark Walport DirectorJanuary 2005 DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT 3 Highlights of the yearIt's been a year when working in partnership has delivered real benefits. Looking back on a busy year, I am delighted at the progress we have seen- the discoveries our researchers havemade, the accelerating application of research, and the changes we havemade within the Wellcome Trust itself.And I am also pleased that so muchhas been achieved in partnership withothers. I firmly believe that scientificopportunities will be exploited to besteffect, and medical needs met, whenpeople work together to harness theirenergies to common purpose. Our Major Overseas Research Programmes in de veloping countries, for example, have been based onpartnerships with local Governmentsand academic and health infrastructures.By dealing with local issues, they haveprovided genuine benefits to their hostcountries. Because of these strong links,their activities have quickly fed into localpolicy and practice. This year we report on the continuing success of artemisinin combinationtherapy for malaria, pioneered byProfessor Nick White and colleagues in South-east Asia, as well as a trial of steroid therapy in tuberculousmeningitis, which has significantly cut death rates, and has led to changesin government health policy. Recently, the Wellcome Trust was awarded a Merit Award from thePeople's Committee of Ho Chi MinhCity, which I had the honour of accepting for the Trust during a fascinating visit to see the work of our researchers in Thailand, Vietnam and Laos. Profe ssor White and Dr Jeremy Farrar were alsohonoured by the Committee. Thisrecognition is an endorsement of ourlong-standing collaborative approach in the region. UK science In the UK we have continued to workconstructively with the UK Government,which has consistently recognised theimportance of the country's researchbase. There is an outstanding communityof imaginative and productive researchersin the UK. We will continue to supportresearch in the UK whilst its excellentscience base is maintained. The additionalfunds for science provided in the 2004Spending Review, including moreresources as an explicit underpinning of charity-funded research, are signals that the Government is as committed as we are to the future of UK science. There are other areas in which we are working closely with the Government. A long-standing partnership, to constructthe UK's new synchrotron facility, receiveda further financial boost this year (\u00a3120million in total, with more than \u00a3100million extra from the Government). Although we are pleased to work in partnership with Government in support of research, our independence alsoenables us - and, indeed, requires us - to play an important role as a critic ofGovernment when it pursues policiesthat may have an adverse impact onbiomedical research for public good.We have worked very hard during theyear to gain acceptance of amendmentsof proposed legislation that could have serious adverse consequences for important medical research. Partnership also increases the effectiveness of our voice in this public policy work; we have worked closely withthe UK research funding and academiccommunity to produce joint responsesto, among other things, the draft HumanTissue Bill and Mental Capacity Bill. A single coherent voice has undoubtedlybenefited all parties and led to moreconsidered legislation. Two of the most important and challenging areas are clinical andinternational research. The creation of a new partnership, the UK ClinicalResearch Collaboration (UKCRC),is recognition that clinical research will only thrive if all the key protagonistswork together - funders, the healthservice and the higher educationcommunity. We look forward toannouncing new initiatives under theUKCRC umbrella in the very near future.

Dyskeratosis congenita is a devastating disease that leads to premature ageing, bone marrowfailure and cancer. Over the past few years, Professor Inderjeet Dokaland colleagues at Imperial College,London, have identified the geneticbasis of this rare inherited disorder.Most recently, they have clarified one of its most perplexing features -why symptoms appear earlier in successive generations. 1 Affecting one person per million, the mutations that cause dyskeratosiscongenita disrupt telomeres - the tips of chromosomes. When chromosomesare copied during cell division, telomerestend to get shorter. To compensate for this, actively dividing cells make an enzyme, telomerase, which repairstelomeres. Without it, cells tend to go through a certain number of divisions and then die. In dyskeratosis congenita, mutant genes (such as that coding for telomerase,TERC ) mean that chromosome repair is faulty, and telomeres erode at an accelerated rate. Tissues with activelyproliferating cells - gut, skin and bonemarrow - are the first to be affected.The earliest sign of accelerated wearand tear is usually abnormal skinpigmentation followed, years later, by cancer, premature ageing and bonemarrow failure, which often proves fatal. But why do children's symptoms appear at an earlier age than in theirparents? This phenomenon is alsoseen in some other genetic disorders,where a three-letter fragment of DNAmultiplies in successive generations.What Professor Dokal and colleaguesdiscovered was that the length of a patient's telomeres predicted when symptoms would first emerge -the shorter the telomere, the soonersymptoms appeared. As the telomeresget shorter in successive generations,so the disease strikes earlier. 1Vulliamy T et al. Disease anticipation is associated with progressive telomere shortening in familieswith dyskeratosis congenita Nat Genet 2004; 36(5): 447-9.Life would be much easier if we understood the genetic structure of the UK - and that is the goal of a new \u00a32.3 million Wellcome-funded project being led by Sir WalterBodmer, with Professor Donnelly and Professor Lon Cardon in Oxford.DNA will be collected from 3500people, in 30 rural locations, whoseparents and grandparents also lived in the same area. The data and DNA samples will become a national resource for researchers to use to match their disease samples, thus reducing the chances of spuriousassociations. The resource will beparticularly valuable with a number of very large population studies, such as the UK Biobank project, now underway. 1Marchini J, Cardon LR, Phillips MS, Donnelly P .

KNOWLEDGE 7 The International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium has publishedits scientific description of the finishedhuman genome sequence - the 'goldstandard' genome. The current genome sequence contains 2.85 b illion nucleotides and encompasses around 99 per cent of theeuchromatic (or gene-containing) portionof the human genome. All but 341 of the 150 000 gaps present in the 2001working draft sequence have beenfilled in, and the sequence is 99.99 per cent accurate - ten times moreaccurate than the original goal. The most surprising finding - and one that hit the headlines worldwide - wasthe tiny number of protein-codinggenes in the genome. The new analysispredicts that there are only 20-25 000protein-coding genes in the genome, far fewer than the 100 000 confidentlypredicted a decade ago, and even the 30-40 000 estimated in 2001. A further intriguing finding is the number of pseudogenes - genes that have lost their function and are graduallydecaying away. Indeed, recent studieshave already identified about 20 000pseudogenes, and there may even be more 'dead' genes in our genomethan 'live' ones. The largest single contribution to the human genome sequence was madeby the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.It is now trying to work out how so fewgenes can build something as complexas a human being. Finding that a particular genetic variantis more common in people with, say,diabetes than in those without is a cluethat the gene may be increasingsusceptibility to the disease. But is the association real, or are the differentgenetic make-ups of the peopleinvolved in the study - the populationstructure - clouding the results? The extent of the problem was highlighted in a study by ProfessorPeter Donnelly and colleagues in Oxfordand Montreal, which examined 15 000DNA variations across three populationgroups (European American, AfricanAmerican and Asian) and within theAsian group. 1Using statistical models, they found that the effects of populationstructure increase markedly with samplesize, leading to false positive results and missed real effects. This is a real headache for researchers searching for genetic factors that haveonly small effects on common diseases,who need to examine large numbers of people.

Faulty chromosome repair is the cause ofdyskeratosis congenita. L to R To consent to medical treatment, patients should be making voluntaryand informed choices, and have themental capacity to make a decision.Patients lack mental capacity whenthey cannot understand the information being given to them, or use it to decide on a course ofaction, or are unable to communicatetheir decision. Usually, mentalcapacity is taken as read unless thepatient's difficulties are very obvious.However, recent research suggeststhat the numbers of mentallyincapacitated patients may bebeing significantly underestimated. Professor Matthew Hotopf and colleagues at the Institute of Psychiatry,Preston and Yale tested the degree of cognitive impairment of patientsadmitted to a London hospital. Some 31 per cent of inpatients wereconsidered to lack mental capacity.However, when clinical teamsinterviewed inpatients, they rated just 8 per cent as lacking mental capacity. 1 Most patients probably rely on doctorsto make the most appropriate decisionfor them. A need to assess mentalcapacity in a medically pressing situationcould present significant difficulties to the medical profession. On the otherhand, there is clearly also a need toprotect vulnerable patients, particularlywhen major - and irreversible - medicaldecisions are being made. These kinds of issues are being considered in the UK's draft MentalCapacity Bill.

People with Alzheimer's disease may lack themental capacity to giveinformed consent.L to R To consent to medical treatment, patients should be making voluntaryand informed choices, and have themental capacity to make a decision.Patients lack mental capacity whenthey cannot understand the information being given to them, or use it to decide on a course ofaction, or are unable to communicatetheir decision. Usually, mentalcapacity is taken as read unless thepatient's difficulties are very obvious.However, recent research suggeststhat the numbers of mentallyincapacitated patients may bebeing significantly underestimated. Professor Matthew Hotopf and colleagues at the Institute of Psychiatry,Preston and Yale tested the degree of cognitive impairment of patientsadmitted to a London hospital. Some 31 per cent of inpatients wereconsidered to lack mental capacity.However, when clinical teamsinterviewed inpatients, they rated just 8 per cent as lacking mental capacity. 1 Most patients probably rely on doctorsto make the most appropriate decisionfor them. A need to assess mentalcapacity in a medically pressing situationcould present significant difficulties to the medical profession. On the otherhand, there is clearly also a need toprotect vulnerable patients, particularlywhen major - and irreversible - medicaldecisions are being made. These kinds of issues are being considered in the UK's draft MentalCapacity Bill.

KNOWLEDGE 11 Scientists co-funded by the Wellcome Trust and the US National Institutes of Health have uncovered evidencethat drug-resistant malaria in Africawas imported from South-east Asia. The boom in air travel has meant that malaria travels the globe too. Every year30 000 malaria cases are imported intoindustrialised countries. The figure forAfrica is unknown, but is likely to be substantial. Today pyrimethamine (coformulated with sulphadoxine) is a mainstay of malariatreatment. But mutations in a geneknown as dhfr(dihydrofolate reductase) allow the parasite to survive. Parasiteshave up to four mutations in the dhfr gene - the more they have, the hardierthey are; with the full complement offour, they are resistant to all drugstargeting this enzyme. By genotyping the dhfrgene and surrounding DNA, Dr Cally Roper,London School of Hygiene and TropicalMedicine, and collaborators have shownthat the most resistant parasites in Africadid not arise there, but originated inSouth-east Asia. 1The parasite with four mutations has not yet been seen in Africa, but if malaria parasites aretravelling from Asia to Africa, then thereis every chance it could be imported and become established. 1Roper C et al.

A bite from an infected sand fly is all it takes to catch the tropical diseaseleishmaniasis. Yet exactly how thesand fly delivers its lethal cargo has,until recently, remained a mystery.Now Wellcome-funded scientistshave discovered a key aspect oftransmission: a sticky gel secreted by the parasite and regurgitated bythe sand fly. Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease affecting about 12 million peopleworldwide, causing disfiguring ulcersand, in severe cases, death. Majorepidemics have occurred in India and Bangladesh, and it is a scourge of migrating populations, such as thoseaffected by civil war. Infection starts when a sand fly bite injects the single-celled parasiteLeishmania , along with sand fly saliva. However, a team led by Dr Paul Bates at the Liverpool School of TropicalMedicine has discovered thatLeishmania is not a passive passenger in this process. It produces a gelatinous secretion that forms a thick plug in the sand fly's gut. This 'hairball'stops the fly from feeding properly and, as a result, the insect bitesrepeatedly, and for longer, increasingthe likelihood of transmission. 1 As well as manipulating the behaviour of its insect vector, the parasitesecretion also affects its new humanhost. It includes a long, sugar-coated,phosphorylated protein (filamentousproteophosphoglycan, fPPG), which is regurgitated by the sand fly andinjected into the victim. The fPPGappears to promote parasite survivaland exacerbates disease. The research has important implications. It immediately suggests possible newstrategies for tackling transmission, by blocking the action of the gel. But italso highlights how interactions betweenall the key players - parasite, vector andhost - need to be studied to give a clearview of disease transmission. 1Rogers ME et al.

Malaria mortality in youngchildren almost doubled from the1980s to the 1990s. The disease nowcauses around 3000 deaths each day. To find out whether this resurgence could be linked to climate, Dr Hay'steam used a climate-driven biologicalmodel of malaria transmission to showthat changing patterns of temperatureand rainfall between 1911 and 1995had not made for a more hospitableclimate for mosquitoes and malaria. In a couple of regions, shifts in malariatransmission suitability were linked to changes in rainfall. Rather than global trends, the researchers emphasise that localfactors - migration, health serviceprovision and, particularly, the risein drug resistance - are likely to have a bigger impact on malaria transmission. 1Small J, Goetz SJ, Hay SI.

L to R The genetic make-up of patients with type 2 diabetes has been foundto affect their sensitivity to drugtreatments. The findings could lead to more tailored treatments, and isan early example of a pharmaco-genomic approach to medicine. Type 2 diabetes is an adult-onset form of diabetes that frequentlyrequires treatment with drugs. The most commonly used drugs aresulphonylureas or metformin, whichincrease insulin secretion or r educe insulin resistance, respectively.Treatment guidelines assume that allpatients respond similarly, even thoughthe underlying causes of the diabetesmay be quite different. Professor Andrew Hattersley, Ewan Pearson and colleagues at thePeninsula Medical School, Exeter,compared the drug responses of peoplewith a specific form of diabetes causedby mutations in the HNF-1 gene with those in other patients who haddiabetes of unknown cause. They found that people with HNF-1 diabetes responded differently to thetwo drugs: patients with HNF-1 diabetes had around a fivefold greaterresponse to sulphonylureas than tometformin, while patients in the othergroup responded similarly to the twotreatments. 1The difference arose because the response to sulphonylureasin HNF-1 patients was fourfold greater than in the second group, even thoughthe former used a lower drug dose to avoid hypoglycaemia. As the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes is untangled, it is likely that furtherdifferent forms of the disease will beidentified, each with a particular patternof responses to diabetes drugs. If so,drugs and the doses used could thenbe refined according to a patient'sgenetic background. 1Pearson ER et al. Genetic cause of hyperglycaemia and response to treatment in diabetes. Lancet 2003; 362: 1275-81. TAILORED TREATMENT Two forms of diabetes respond very differently to drugs - pointing the way to tailored drug treatments based on genetic make-up. KNOWLEDGE 13 BALANCING ACTS Permanent neonatal diabetes is a severe, but fortunately rare formof diabetes. The causes have beenlargely unknown, but researchershave now found that many cases are due to a genetic mutation thatdisrupts control of insulin-releasingbeta cells. 1The research also suggests that sulfonylurea drugstypically used by adults with type 2 diabetes may be a useful treatment. In neonatal diabetes, a lack of insulin becomes apparent in the first threemonths after birth. Insulin treatment is required for life. Insulin is produced by beta cells in the pancreas, which sense changes in the blood's glucose levels, and altertheir secretion of insulin accordingly.Crucial to this process is an ion channel- the ATP-sensitive potassium channel(K ATPchannel) - that spans the membrane of beta cells. If glucose levels go up, more ATP is made in the cell; this ATP binds to the channel and closes it, therebyreducing potassium loss and depolarising the beta-cell membrane.This causes an influx of calcium,which triggers the release of insulin. Professors Andrew Hattersley (Peninsula Medical School, Exeter) and Frances Ashcroft (University of Oxford) and colleagues foundmutations in the gene encoding Kir6.2, a key subunit of the potassiumchannel, in ten out of 29 infants withneonatal diabetes. The mutation stopsthe channel responding to ATP , so it never closes totally. The beta cellconstantly leaks potassium, and it cannot secrete insulin. Sulfonylurea drugs are known to act on the K ATPchannel, and some patients with mutant Kir6.2 did secrete insulinwhen given such drugs. Follow-upstudies have confirmed that children withKir6.2 mutations no longer need insulininjections when given sulfonylurea drugs. 1Gloyn AL et al. Activating mutations in the gene encoding the ATP-sensitive potassium-channelsubunit Kir6.2 THERAPYKNOWLEDGE 12 If the body's tissues become insensitive to the action of insulin,rising blood sugar levels have avariety of damaging effects - leading to the symptoms of type 2 diabetes. While most cases are thought to involve interactions between many genes andenvironmental risk factors, diabetes cansometimes be caused by a mutation in a single gene. Dr In\u00eas Barroso (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute), Professor Steve O'Rahilly(University of Cambridge) and colleaguesfound just such a mutation in a genecalled AKT2 . AKT2 protein is a crucial component of the cell's systems forregulating cell growth, survival andmetabolism. This study reveals its centralrole in cellular responses to insulin. 1 Mutations in AKT2 are unlikely to explain most cases of diabetes. A more likelyscenario is that other subtle variations in or around the AKT2 gene contribute to the common form of diabetes. The team is now hunting for variants in populations with type 2 diabetes to explore this possibility. 1George S et al. A family with severe insulin resistance and diabetes due to a mutation in AKT2. Science 2004; 304: 1325-8.DISSECTING DIABETES The mechanisms of type2 (adult-onset) diabetes arebeginning to be unravelled.Thanks to the discovery of the precise cause of infant diabetes, young children can be given medication rather than insulin injections. With fears of an 'obesity epidemic' growing, it is crucial we learn moreabout the metabolic processesunderlying our energy balance, and how they can trigger disease. The 'metabolic syndrome' (a combin- ation of high blood pressure, insulinresistance and impaired lipidmetabolism) is usually associatedwith obesity. An international teamincluding Professors John Mullinsand Jonathan Seckl in Edinburgh has shown that high levels of gluco-corticoid hormone regeneration in theliver can give rise to the metabolicsyndrome in the absence of obesity. 1 This could occur in people of normalweight who have symptoms ofmetabolic syndrome, such as thosewith 'fatty liver' disease. A mammalian enzyme known as PASK is related to a bacterial oxygensensor, FixL. A team led by ProfessorGuy Rutter in Bristol has discoveredthat PASK is also a sensor: inpancreatic beta cells, it responds to glucose concentrations, regulatingkey beta-cell genes. 2PASK thus appears to play a role in the body'sresponse to changing nutrient levels. CBS domains are tandemly repeated 60 amino acid domains found inmost living organisms. Althoughmutations in CBS gene sequencescause a range of inherited diseases,the role Grahame have nowshown that the domains bindadenosyl com pounds (such as AMP , ATP or S-adenosyl methionine). In many cases, including AMPK, a key energy sensor in the body, thedomains appear to link the protein'sactivity to the cell's energy status. 3 1Paterson 113: 274-84.

Professors Andrew Hattersley (Peninsula Medical School, Exeter) and Frances Ashcroft (University of Oxford) and colleagues foundmutations in the gene encoding Kir6.2, a key subunit of the potassiumchannel, in ten out of 29 infants withneonatal diabetes. The mutation stopsthe channel responding to ATP , so it never closes totally. The beta cellconstantly leaks potassium, and it cannot secrete insulin. Sulfonylurea drugs are known to act on the K ATPchannel, and some patients with mutant Kir6.2 did secrete insulinwhen given such drugs. Follow-upstudies have confirmed that children withKir6.2 mutations no longer need insulininjections when given sulfonylurea drugs. 1Gloyn AL et al. Activating mutations in the gene encoding the ATP-sensitive potassium-channelsubunit Kir6.2 THERAPYKNOWLEDGE 12 If the body's tissues become insensitive to the action of insulin,rising blood sugar levels have avariety of damaging effects - leading to the symptoms of type 2 diabetes. While most cases are thought to involve interactions between many genes andenvironmental risk factors, diabetes cansometimes be caused by a mutation in a single gene. Dr In\u00eas Barroso (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute), Professor Steve O'Rahilly(University of Cambridge) and colleaguesfound just such a mutation in a genecalled AKT2 . AKT2 protein is a crucial component of the cell's systems forregulating cell growth, survival andmetabolism. This study reveals its centralrole in cellular responses to insulin. 1 Mutations in AKT2 are unlikely to explain most cases of diabetes. A more likelyscenario is that other subtle variations in or around the AKT2 gene contribute to the common form of diabetes. The team is now hunting for variants in populations with type 2 diabetes to explore this possibility. 1George S et al. A family with severe insulin resistance and diabetes due to a mutation in AKT2. Science 2004; 304: 1325-8.DISSECTING DIABETES The mechanisms of type2 (adult-onset) diabetes arebeginning to be unravelled.Thanks to the discovery of the precise cause of infant diabetes, young children can be given medication rather than insulin injections. With fears of an 'obesity epidemic' growing, it is crucial we learn moreabout the metabolic processesunderlying our energy balance, and how they can trigger disease. The 'metabolic syndrome' (a combin- ation of high blood pressure, insulinresistance and impaired lipidmetabolism) is usually associatedwith obesity. An international teamincluding Professors John Mullinsand Jonathan Seckl in Edinburgh has shown that high levels of gluco-corticoid hormone regeneration in theliver can give rise to the metabolicsyndrome in the absence of obesity. 1 This could occur in people of normalweight who have symptoms ofmetabolic syndrome, such as thosewith 'fatty liver' disease. A mammalian enzyme known as PASK is related to a bacterial oxygensensor, FixL. A team led by ProfessorGuy Rutter in Bristol has discoveredthat PASK is also a sensor: inpancreatic beta cells, it responds to glucose concentrations, regulatingkey beta-cell genes. 2PASK thus appears to play a role in the body'sresponse to changing nutrient levels. CBS domains are tandemly repeated 60 amino acid domains found inmost living organisms. Althoughmutations in CBS gene sequencescause a range of inherited diseases,the role Grahame have nowshown that the domains bindadenosyl com pounds (such as AMP , ATP or S-adenosyl methionine). In many cases, including AMPK, a key energy sensor in the body, thedomains appear to link the protein'sactivity to the cell's energy status. 3 1Paterson 113: 274-84.

But for very small babies,rapid 'catch-up' growth may not be as healthy as it seems - a study of mice suggests it could actually be shortening their lifespan. 1 The startling results were obtained byDr Susan Ozanne, a Research CareerDevelopment Fellow,* and ProfessorNick Hales at the University ofCambridge. They monitored thelongevity of mice whose mothers werefed a poorly nutritious diet during theirfetal development or just after birth.They also tested the impact of a'cafeteria-style' diet after weaning. The pups that lived longest were those that were well fed in the womb and thensuckled by mothers on a relatively low-quality diet. Their lifespans were furtherenhanced if they were not given acafeteria-style diet, rich in sugar and fat,after weaning. At the other extreme, the pups that lived the shortest lives were those thatgrew poorly in the womb, but were subsequently suckled by mice on ahigh-quality diet. Their lifespans werecut further if they ate obesity-inducingfood after weaning. Low birth weight is already known to predispose to late-onset conditionssuch as high blood pressure anddiabetes. These results suggest thatthe normal reaction to low birth weights- a period of catch-up growth to bringinfants up to a normal size - maycontribute to these detrimental long-term effects. The results could have implications for babies born underweight, who areusually fed a rich diet to accelerategrowth. In view of the findings, theresearchers argue that more attentionneeds to be paid to the nutrition ofhuman infants in the early years. 1Ozanne SE, Hales CN. Lifespan: catch-up growth mice.

It is caused by a faulty gene that changes the huntingtin protein into a toxic product which accumulates inthe brain and interferes with brain cellfunction. There are genetic tests todetect the faulty Huntington's gene, butthere is no cure or effective treatment.The Cambridge researchers discovered that rapamycin may be able to protectthe brain by cranking up 'autophagy' -one of the ways in which the cell candispose of proteins. In their models,when used before too much toxicprotein accumulated, rapamycinfunnelled mutant huntingtin intocompartments of the cell that digest it. The researchers found that a rapamycin analogue, CCI- 779, slowed down neurodegeneration in a fly model of thedisease, while in the mouse, it improvedperformance on four differentbehavioural tasks. CCI-779 has the advantage that it is designed for long-term use.

Havingexcellent clinical and laboratoryfacilities in a country directly affectedby avian flu is an enormous benefitwith a disease that is so rapidly lethal and of such global publichealth importance. During late 2003 and early 2004, the avian influenza virus H5N1 sweptthrough poultry stocks across Asia.Most worryingly, it also spread to somepeople, causing a severe and often fatalrespiratory illness. There are constant fears that this strain will spread from birds to humans. An even greater worry is that the virusadapts to human hosts, and begins to be transmitted from person to person- in a manner similar to the 'Spanish flu'in 1918. It is vital, therefore, that we learn as much as possible about thevirus and its effects on people.

The Cancer Genome Project at theWellcome Trust Sanger Institute has,for the first time, identified mutationswithin the ERBB2 gene in human lung cancer. 1The mutations, found in 10 per cent of a specific type of lung cancer called adenocarcinoma,cause the ERBB2 protein to bepermanently active. These cancers may be treatable with an existing drug, trastuzumab. The Cancer Genome Project team is cataloguing the changes within thegenomes of cancer cells and identifyingthe mutant genes responsible for thedisease. Lung cancer is a particularlyimportant target, as it is the secondmost common form of cancer in theUK, after breast cancer. The ERBB2 gene (also known as HER2 or Neu) is present in multiple copies in 20 per cent of breast cancers and lessoften in other cancers. The discoverythat ERBB2 mutations can also cause lung cancer is significant as the drugtrastuzumab (marketed as Herceptin) targets ERBB2 and is very effective for the treatment of breast cancers with multiple copies of the ERBB2 gene. Previous trials of trastuzumab for lung cancer were not successful,but the Cancer Genome Project teamproposes that it, or another drug thattargets ERBB2, should be retested in cases of lung adenocarcinoma with ERBB2 mutations. This finding follows the team's discovery in 2002 that the BRAF gene is mutated in 70 per cent of cases of malignantmelanoma, a potentially lethal form of skin cancer. The mutations appear to produce a permanently activatedBRAF protein. With Wellcome TrustTechnology Transfer funding, the teamhas been searching for molecules thatcan switch off the mutant protein - andseveral promising leads have emerged. 1Stephens P et al.

This harbours the world'smost multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites. They found that resistance to mefloquine was associated with extra copies of a Plasmodium gene known as pfmdr1 . 1 The gene codes for a m olecular pump that ejects the drug from the parasitecell before it has a chance to do anyharm. Presumably, the more copies of the pfmdr1 gene that a parasite has, the more pump protein the parasitemakes - and the more likely it is to survive treatment with mefloquine. 1Price RN et al.

Pooling datafrom 16 studies and nearly 6000patients, they found that the addition of artesunate had significant benefits. 1 Since 2001 the World HealthOrganisation has increasingly promoted ACT, recommending that any countrychanging antimalarial treatment policyshould switch to ACT. Over 20 countrieshave switched, and many others havebegun to change. The latest studyreinforces how valuable the therapycould be in a continent in which malariais threatening to run away unchecked. 1International Artemisinin Study Group. Artesunate combinations for treatment of malaria: meta-analysis. Lancet 2004; 363: 9-17.The human immune system wages war against the malaria parasite as it tries to eradicate an infection.Having identified parasite proteins,the system ramps up production of antibodies that will help kill theparasite; the parasite's response isto change its proteins. But possiblynot too much, a new mathematicalmodel suggests. The models, produced by a collaboration between researchers in Oxford, Edinburgh and Kenya,examine the parasite's PfEMP1receptors, proteins that it inserts into the surface of red blood cells while it is reproducing inside. Thisprotein is a prime target for theimmune system, but with more than50 variants the parasite can switch to a new type, allowing it to prolongthe infection. The new model suggests that each variant elicits two types of immuneresponse: a long-lived response directedagainst that protein alone; and minor,short-lived responses that target partsof the protein shared by more than oneprotein. 1The latter responses delay the appearance of variants with similarshared portions. So the switchingoccurs sequentially, each new variantbeing the most immunologically distinctfrom its preceding types. As a result,the overall duration of infection isincreased; eventually, long-lastingresponses are produced against the entire variant repertoire, and theinfection ends. Meanwhile, in their quest to develop a malaria vaccine, Professor Adrian Hill(University of Oxford) and colleagueshave been studying parasite proteinsthat induce an immune response. Oneproblem facing vaccine researchers isthat while proteins have been found thatdo stimulate an immune response, noneso far has led to protection againstnatural malaria infection. In studies in The Gambia, the researchers have tested a newcandidate that includes part of theparasite's circumsporozoite protein,which it produces in its sporozoitestage - the stage that is injected intothe bloodstream by a feeding mosquito. They found that while several portions of the circumsporozoite protein inducedan immune response, one fragment inparticular was associated with a longer-lasting immune protection againstmalaria. 2This, they suggest, makes it a good option to include in new vaccines. 1Recker M et al.Transient cross-reactive immune responses can in thecircumsporozoite protein correlates withprotection from natural Plasmodium falciparuminfection and disease.

A review of progresshas revealed that all five CRFs haveestablished effective infrastructure and management systems. High-quality research is being carried outwithin them. And they are also playinginfluential roles locally and nationally. The CRFs - at Birmingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Manchesterand Southampton - were establishedas partnerships between the WellcomeTrust, the Department for Health, and the Scottish Executive. As well as hosting valuable research, the CRFs are having wider influence,becoming recognised regional centresof clinical research excellence. They act as beacons of best practice forgovernance and ethics, have developedstrong collaborative links with local NHS R&D offices, and created localeducational programmes targeted at clinical researchers in their areas.The Edinburgh facility now also hosts a regional centre of the NationalTranslational Cancer Research Network. One notable feature has been the development of a strong network ofnurse managers around the CRFs, aswell as a growth in nurse-led research. The CRFs have been used as a model for other similar facilities set up aroundthe country. Evidence of the success of the venture also comes from the steady stream of research papers coming out of theCRFs. Among the many importantstudies are the following: Birmingham: Cannabinoid therapy for multiple sclerosis; antibody therapy forvasculitis; gene therapy for liver cancer. Cambridge: Genetic causes of obesity; neurochemical impact of drug abuse;immune response to respiratorysyncytial virus in children. Edinburgh: Impact of air pollution on cardiovascular disease; geneticsusceptibility to cardiovascular diseasein a rural population of Orkney. Manchester: Using pelvic floor exercises to tackle stress incontinence; mol ecular genetics of autoimmune disease. Southampton: Management of hepatitis C virus infection; effects of low birthweight on infant lung function. One future challenge is to identify ways to capitalise on this initial successto strengthen clinical research in the UK. Tuberculosis is usually associated with lung disease. But its cause,Mycobacterium tuberculosis, can also invade other parts of the body, such as cerebrospinal fluid. The resultinginflammation (tuberculous meningitis)causes death or severe neurologicalproblems in more than half of thoseaffected. Research in Vietnam,however, has shown that steroid usesignificantly reduces mortality. Reasoning that corticosteroids might reduce inflammation, a team led by GuyThwaites at the Pham Ngoc Thach TBand Lung Hospital, the Hospital forTropical Diseases and the OxfordUniversity Clinical Research Unit, HoChi Minh City, ran a trial of the steroiddexamethasone plus antibiotics in 545 patients in Vietnam. 1 The trial showed that additionaltreatment with dexamethasone reducedmortality (although it did not reduce the risk of severe disability after ninemonths). The steroids not only reduceinflammation, but may also reduce therisk of other severe problems, such aspotentially fatal clinical hepatitis, whichwould have forced doctors to changethe antibiotic therapy. The work has led to changes in treatment guidelines for managingtuberculous meningitis. 1Thwaites, G et al. Dexamethasone for the treatment of tuberculous meningitis in adolescents and adults. N Engl J Med 2004;351(17): 1741-51.CLINICAL ADVANCES STEROID SUCCESS As well as hosting valuable patient-oriented research, Clinical Research Facilities are having important regional influence.TRANSLATION 26 Steroids help people survive a tuberculous meningitis infection. The Wellcome Trust-Burroughs Wellcome Fund Infectious DiseasesInitiative, launched in 1999, broughttogether researchers from the UK,North America and the developingworld. The initiative aimed to providelarge-scale, long-term support fortrilateral partnerships, in which thecentre of gravity would be in thedeveloping country. Some 13 projectswere funded, to the tune of \u00a318 million(US$27 million), based in Asia, Africaand South America. While many projects are at early stages, they have clearly deliveredmajor benefits to the participants and host institutions, and in somecases have had a direct impact on public health. A study in Bangladesh on the causes, prevention and treatment of neonatalinfections in the community hasraised the profile of neonatalhealthcare locally. The research hasfed into national policy making, whilea training manual in newborn care is being adopted at a national level. In Vellore, India, a project on rotaviral gastroenteritis in children has had an unexpected benefit - a substantialdecrease in infant mortality in theurban slum in which it was based, as field workers now recogniseillness and refer it to the project'slocal clinic. The Peruvian cysticercosis project is studying infection with theintestinal tapeworm Taenia solium , which forms cysts in both humansand its intermediate host, the pig.The team is also testing candidatevaccines, with spectacular success:the vaccines provide more than 99 per cent protection.

Skin grafting is the first-line treatmentfor burns but sometimes, in severecases, there is not enough skin to goround. CellTran, a start-up companybased in Sheffield and a recipient of Wellcome Technology Transferfunding, has come up with a solution:Myskin, 'living bandages' containingthe patient's own skin cells. The skin cells are usually taken from the thigh, under local anaesthetic, and then transferred to a small polymerdisc, coated with a chemically controlledplasma polymer film which promotesthe growth of skin cells. After five to seven days, the discs are placeddirectly onto the wound and the area is wrapped in bandages. The polymerfilm is engineered to release the cellswhen exposed to the wound, thushelping new layers of skin to grow. There is a strong surgical need for this kind of device.

A review of progresshas revealed that all five CRFs haveestablished effective infrastructure and management systems. High-quality research is being carried outwithin them. And they are also playinginfluential roles locally and nationally. The CRFs - at Birmingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Manchesterand Southampton - were establishedas partnerships between the WellcomeTrust, the Department for Health, and the Scottish Executive. As well as hosting valuable research, the CRFs are having wider influence,becoming recognised regional centresof clinical research excellence. They act as beacons of best practice forgovernance and ethics, have developedstrong collaborative links with local NHS R&D offices, and created localeducational programmes targeted at clinical researchers in their areas.The Edinburgh facility now also hosts a regional centre of the NationalTranslational Cancer Research Network. One notable feature has been the development of a strong network ofnurse managers around the CRFs, aswell as a growth in nurse-led research. The CRFs have been used as a model for other similar facilities set up aroundthe country. Evidence of the success of the venture also comes from the steady stream of research papers coming out of theCRFs. Among the many importantstudies are the following: Birmingham: Cannabinoid therapy for multiple sclerosis; antibody therapy forvasculitis; gene therapy for liver cancer. Cambridge: Genetic causes of obesity; neurochemical impact of drug abuse;immune response to respiratorysyncytial virus in children. Edinburgh: Impact of air pollution on cardiovascular disease; geneticsusceptibility to cardiovascular diseasein a rural population of Orkney. Manchester: Using pelvic floor exercises to tackle stress incontinence; mol ecular genetics of autoimmune disease. Southampton: Management of hepatitis C virus infection; effects of low birthweight on infant lung function. One future challenge is to identify ways to capitalise on this initial successto strengthen clinical research in the UK. Tuberculosis is usually associated with lung disease. But its cause,Mycobacterium tuberculosis, can also invade other parts of the body, such as cerebrospinal fluid. The resultinginflammation (tuberculous meningitis)causes death or severe neurologicalproblems in more than half of thoseaffected. Research in Vietnam,however, has shown that steroid usesignificantly reduces mortality. Reasoning that corticosteroids might reduce inflammation, a team led by GuyThwaites at the Pham Ngoc Thach TBand Lung Hospital, the Hospital forTropical Diseases and the OxfordUniversity Clinical Research Unit, HoChi Minh City, ran a trial of the steroiddexamethasone plus antibiotics in 545 patients in Vietnam. 1 The trial showed that additionaltreatment with dexamethasone reducedmortality (although it did not reduce the risk of severe disability after ninemonths). The steroids not only reduceinflammation, but may also reduce therisk of other severe problems, such aspotentially fatal clinical hepatitis, whichwould have forced doctors to changethe antibiotic therapy. The work has led to changes in treatment guidelines for managingtuberculous meningitis. 1Thwaites, G et al. Dexamethasone for the treatment of tuberculous meningitis in adolescents and adults. N Engl J Med 2004;351(17): 1741-51.CLINICAL ADVANCES STEROID SUCCESS As well as hosting valuable patient-oriented research, Clinical Research Facilities are having important regional influence.TRANSLATION 26 Steroids help people survive a tuberculous meningitis infection. The Wellcome Trust-Burroughs Wellcome Fund Infectious DiseasesInitiative, launched in 1999, broughttogether researchers from the UK,North America and the developingworld. The initiative aimed to providelarge-scale, long-term support fortrilateral partnerships, in which thecentre of gravity would be in thedeveloping country. Some 13 projectswere funded, to the tune of \u00a318 million(US$27 million), based in Asia, Africaand South America. While many projects are at early stages, they have clearly deliveredmajor benefits to the participants and host institutions, and in somecases have had a direct impact on public health. A study in Bangladesh on the causes, prevention and treatment of neonatalinfections in the community hasraised the profile of neonatalhealthcare locally.

Visitors to London's FoundlingMuseum, which opened in June2004, can learn the remarkable storybehind the Foundling Hospital,which, like an early-day Live Aid,used artistic creativity to publiciseshocking social ills. In the mid-18th century thousands of unwanted children were left to die onthe streets of London. In 1719, after a life spent as a successful ship-builderand sailor in the New World, retired seacaptain Thomas Coram tripped overone such baby left in a gutter. Stunned by the appalling social conditions all around him, he spentthe rest of his life establishing a refugefor abandoned children. His effortswere rewarded in 1739, when GeorgeII granted a Royal Charter for theestablishment of a Foundling Hospital,to provide a home and education foryoung children. Coram solicited the help of a talented set of friends. Handel wrote thehospital anthem; Hogarth contributedpaintings, and persuaded many of his contemporaries, includingGainsborough and Reynolds, to do likewise. At that time there were no public places for artists to exhibit, so the Foundling Hospital became the first British public art gallery. In the 1920s the Foundling Hospital was demolished, but its artistictreasures were saved and moved to 40 Brunswick Square. The FoundlingMuseum houses the internationallyimpo rtant Foundling Hospital Collection, which includes paintings by Hogarth, Gainsborough, Hudsonand Roubilliac, and material relating to Handel. The Wellcome Trust provided funds for an exhibition on the life and welfareof these unfortunate youngsters. The Museum includes many objectsreflecting the social and personalhistory of its children, includinghundreds of personal mementos or 'tokens' left by mothers in the hopethat they might one day be able to return and identify their child.

In 2004, the Eden Project received a \u00a3734 000 Rediscover award fromthe Millennium Commission and theWellcome Trust to redevelop itsexhibition space. To engage visitors, the exhibits have the air of a fairgroundattraction with extensive use of automataand arcade game style exhibits. All, however, illuminate the connectionsbetween people and plants, wild placesand cultures, across the globe. But the Rediscover award is only one way in which the Eden Project has attempted to use innovativeapproaches to tackle scientific issues. In 2002 it hosted an exhibition of the dresses produced by the Sciartpartnership of Helen and Kate Storey,which were inspired by early embryonic development. And it has actively drawn upon drama to engage young people, thanks to a Wellcome Trust Pulse award.Graham Mitchell's Signs of Life , which explored people's responses to genetic modification, was developedin collaboration with students on a foundation degree course inperformance at Truro College.Accompanied by associated role-playworkshops, it toured secondaryschools in the south-west, and fromJuly 2004 was performed to schoolgroups and the general public atEden's Visitor Centre. The Rediscover initiative was a \u00a333 million joint venture between the Millennium Commission, the Wellcome Trust and the Wolfson Foundation. PARADISE GAINS MEDICAL INNOVATION Cornwall's Eden Project aims to combine science, art and drama to create a rich sensory experience for its visitors.PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT 32 Art is well known to benefit from science. Less well appreciated is that science can gain from art. Teaching anatomy without cadavers at the Peninsula MedicalSchool.

These streams are complemented by 'cross-cutting' strandsof activity such as technology transferand public engagement. The aim of thereorganisation is to focus more stronglyon research priorities and strategy, ratherthan on the funding process. FundingCommittees and Strategy Committeesare being set up to assess grants andconsider strategy issues in each area. Flexible funding In 2004, we made a number of changesto our grants management processes,with the aim of providing greater flexibilityfor grantholders and reducingadministrative bur dens for grantholders, universities and Trust. The changesallow grantholders to move fundsbetween budget headings (except salary costs), and grants now include a 'flexible funding award' to provide forunanticipated direct costs and to provideadditional flexibility to researchers. New Governors Three new Governors were appointed in 2003/04: Dame Patricia Hodgson,former Chief Executive of the Independent Television Commission; Ronald Plasterk, Professor of Developmental Genetics at the University of Utrecht; and PeterSmith, Professor of Tropical Epidemiologyat the London School of Hygiene andTropical Medicine. Sir David Steel Sir David Steel, former Chairman of theWellcome Trust, died on 9 August 2004. Sir David, previously Chairman of BP ,was the Wellcome Trust's Chairman from 1982 to 1989. New staff Four new senior members of staff wereappointed during the year: Dr Ken Arnold,Head of Public Programmes; Dr DavidLynn, Head of Strategic Planning andPolicy; Frances Norton, Head of theWellcome Library; and Dr JimmyWhitworth, Head of International Activities. New headquarters The Wellcome Trust moved into newpurpose-built accommodation, the GibbsBuilding at 215 Euston Road, during2004. The new building brings togetherall Wellcome Trust staf f under one roof,except for Wellcome Library personnel, who have moved to 210 Euston Roadwhile the Wellcome Trust's previousheadquarters building at 183 EustonRoad is refurbished. The refurbished 183 building will be opened as a publicvenue in 2006. New corporate identity A new logo and corporate identity werelaunched during the year. The newidentity, launched to coincide with theoccupation of the new headquartersbuilding, is being rolled out gradually. The new identity is also reflected in theWellcome Trust website, which wasrelaunched in 2004 in a more user-friendly format. A YEAR AT THE WELLCOME TRUST 34A YEAR AT THE WELLCOME TRUST 35 A YEAR AT THE WELLCOME TRUST A brief overview of corporate activities in 2003/04. UK science We worked closely with the UKGovernment in the run-up to the launchof its ten-year framework for Scienceand Innovation. We welcomed theGovernment's decision to increaseframework spending from \u00a33.9 billionin 2004 to \u00a35 billion in 2008. We have agreed to work jointly with the Government in key areas, such as international health and public health in the UK. We were also pleased to note the Government's acknowledgement of the contribution made by charities to research in UK higher educationinstitutes, and its decision to provideadditional funds through the dual support system. Open access We have continued to promote the 'openaccess' model of science publishing, to help ensure that scientific researchfindings are shared as widely and asrapidly as possible. In April 2004, wepublished the findings of research carriedout by the consultants SQW, Costs and Business Models in Scientific ResearchPublishing , which analysed the economic consequences of different models of academic science publishing. The research suggested that openaccess publishing was economicallyviable and offered the potential forsignificant cost savings. Human Tissue Bill During the year, we liaised with legislatorsand other parties to address issues raisedby the draft Human Tissue Bill, which inits original form would have posed seriousproblems to medical research in the UK.The Human Tissue Bill was a response to cases in which the organs of deceasedchildren were taken and stored withoutthe consent or knowledge of parents or families. While supportive of the aims of the bill, we and others feared that in its original form it could have put majorobstacles in the way of potentially life-saving research. The revised billaddressed many of the medical researchcommunity's concerns, while still providingimportant protection to individuals' rights. Public health research A working group commissioned by theWellcome Trust called for a nationalstrategy to foster and enhance researchinto major public health problems facingthe UK population. The study was carried out by an independent workingparty chaired by Professor StephenFrankel, Professor of Epidemiology andPublic Health at the University of Bristol.The group's report, Public Health Sciences: Challenges and Opportunities , addresses a major issue identified in therecent Treasury-led Wanless Report,which recommended that the NHS shouldfocus more health improvement anddisease prevention rather than justtreatment of ill-health. Consultation submissions During the year, we submitted 27 formalresponses to consultations launched by the UK Government and other bodies,including the draft charities bill, the Ten-Year Science and Innovati on Investment Framework and the ScientificPublications Inquiry. Streams In October 2004, we introduced afunding 'streams' model for our researchfunding activities. The new streams cover:Immunology and Infectious Disease;Populations and Public Health;Neuroscience and Mental Health; The Gibbs Building - new headquarters of the Wellcome Trust.

Frances Norton, who joined the Trust as Headof the Wellcome Library in July 2004.L to R1 October 2003 to 30 September 2004 In the year to 30 September 2004, the Wellcome Trust's total charitableexpenditure was \u00a3378 million. Thisrepresents a drop on the figure for2002/03 (\u00a3516 million), due primarily to the decline in infrastructure fundingthrough the Joint Infrastructure Fundand Science Research Investment Fundas these initiatives drew to a close. Of the total charitable expenditure, grants worth \u00a3251 million were awarded.Although grants expenditure was downon last year, the number of grantapplications received also decreasedsignificantly - from 4312 in 2002/03 to 2988, a drop of 30 per cent.Outstanding grant commitments againshrank slightly this year, but remain in excess of \u00a31 billion. As in previous years, the bulk of grant support was for investigator-ledproposals in biomedical science.Fellowships and other careers fundingalso continued to be a major area ofsupport (27.5 per cent of grants spend).International expenditure (funding for schemes focused on the needs of developing and restructuring countries)increased as a proportion of total spend(15.5 per cent of grants spend). Grants for the medical humanities (history of medicine and biomedical ethics) andpublic engagement with scienceamounted to \u00a326.1 million. This for response-modefunding \u00a313 million) plus capitalawards to the Natural History Museum(\u00a310 million) and for the National ScienceLearning Centre (\u00a34.2 million).Expenditure on direct activities, those organised by the Wellcome Trust, roseslightly to \u00a386 million. The bulk of thesecosts were for research at the WellcomeTrust Sanger Institute, which received \u00a364 million in grants in 2003/04. Alsoincluded is \u00a311 million committed to the Diamond synchrotron project at theChilton/Harwell Science Campus. Directactivity costs also include support for theWellcome Library. Administration and support costs fell again, from \u00a344 million to \u00a341 million.Wellcome Trust subsidiaries such as the Genome Campus accounted for \u00a36.7 million of this expenditure. Investments The Wellcome Trust's investments are managed to preserve (at least) thepurchasing power of its long-term assetbase and to provide an income stream to support ongoing activities. This year,the Trust's asset base increased from\u00a310.1 billion to \u00a310.5 billion.The Wellcome Trust supports research and other activities in four main areas: Biomedical Science Technology Transfer Medical Humanities Public Engagement with Science In biomedical science , project and programme support continued toaccount for the bulk of the WellcomeTrust's support in the UK. Research isprimarily funded through response-modemechanisms, with support provided forinvestigator-led proposals in almost allareas of biomedical science and for awide range of basic and applied studies.The following pages describe some ofthe major projects funded in 2003/04. Career development support is provided at all levels from PhD (through Four-yearPhD Programmes) to professorial-levelPrincipal Research Fellowships. The 12 UK Four-year PhD Programmes allreceived five-year renewals during the year. Eight new Senior ResearchFellowships were awarded (six BasicBiomedical Science and two ClinicalScience), and eight fellowships wererenewed. Three Principal ResearchFellowships were renewed. Infrastructure investment has returned to levels seen before the surge ofspending through the Joint InfrastructureFund and Science Research InvestmentFund. Funding of \u00a311 million wasapproved for phase 2 of the Diamondsynchrotron project. The Wellcome Trust's international funding is primarily focused on regionalcentres of excellence, particularly in South-east Asia (Thailand and Vietnam), Kenya, Malawi and South Africa. TheMalawi programme received a \u00a32.3 milliongrant, to enable it to continue its researchon malaria and other infections. A \u00a31.86 million grant was awarded to support research on women's healthand ageing populations in Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East. Fourawards totalling \u00a33.8 million were madeto countries in Latin and Central America- Brazil (two awards), Costa Rica and theWest Indies. In 2003/04, 12 International Senior Research Fellowships were awarded(seven in India, four in central/easternEurope, and one in South Africa); tenwere renewed (eight in India, one in central/ eastern Europe, and one in South Africa). Technology Transfer This year was the first in which awardswere made through the Wellcome Trust'snew technology transfer schemes.University Translation Awards provide support for early-stage development of promising lines of research. The 16awards made this year covered a rangeof areas, including therapeutics, vaccines,diagnostics and medical devices. Strategic Translation Awards are large awards in areas of strategic importanceto the Trust. Four awards are currently at advanced stages of consideration. Medical Humanities In the history of medicine, the year's sole Strategic Award went to theUniversity of Oxford, for a programme of work on the history of tropical diseaseand medicine. Twentieth-century historycontinued to provide a major focus, withtopics being studied ranging from Unanipractice in India to the history ofmyxomatosis in the UK. Funding continued for Biomedical Ethics studies, in the UK and the developing world. Studies supported are of practical relevance, including thefunction of clinical ethics committees andan assessment of the impact of researchon health policy makers in Kenya.Public Engagement Public engagement funding is primarilythrough the Engaging Science programme. Rediscover funding - a partnership with the MillenniumCommission and the Wolfson Foundation- has enabled public venues such as theEden Project in Cornwall and ThinkTank in Birmingham to update exhibits. A \u00a310 million award to the Natural History Museum, for phase 2 of its DarwinProject, was confirmed. A \u00a34.2 millionaward was made to the White RoseConsortium (an alliance between theuniversities of Leeds, Sheffield and York),to support construction of the NationalScience Learning Centre at York. Direct activities As well as funding others, the WellcomeTrust organises activities directly, eitherindependently or in partnership withothers. The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute accounted for \u00a364 million for its ongoing highly productive researchprogrammes in genome sequencing and analysis. Partnerships lay at the heart of several public engagement projects, includingthe Imagine photographic competitionrun with the BBC, and the Pain exhibition at the Science Museum. Looking forward In October 2004, the Wellcome Trustintroduced a 'streams' model of funding.This is intended to provide a greaterfocus on the needs and opportunities within particular areas. Funding Committees and Strategy Committees are being established to assess grant applications and to consider how the Trust might bestmake an impact in these areas. Future Annual Reviews will report on the progress made by the streams in funding and developing strategy.

Analysis of data on the spectrum of bacteraemia in children, with datafrom over 20 000 children admittedto hospital. Of all hospital deaths, 14 per cent were attributable toStreptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae , for which effective vaccines are available but only partially implemented. Dr Sam Kinyanjui and Dr Faith Osier were awarded Research TrainingFellowships for Scientists fromDeveloping Countries to conductresearch at the KEMRI-WellcomeTrust programme in Kilifi. In South-east Asia , which encompasses research centres inThailand (led by Professor Nick Day)and Vietnam (Professor Jeremy Farrar),research highlights include: Demonstration that variable horizontal gene acquisition by Burkholderia pseudomallei is an important feature of its recent genetic evolution. Continued translation of the Programme's research results intohealth policy. Biological, economic and clinical evidence from the research publications of the programme haveprovided a basis for a change in globalantimalarial treatmentrecommendations to artemisinincombination therapies (ACTs) (see page 24). A mathematical-economic model of drug resistance has been used as a basis for the globalrecommendations on antimalarialdrug policy issued in a recent Institute of Medicine report ( Saving Lives, Buying Time ). In Vietnam, the Programme has completed the largest-ever study of TB meningitis (see page 26). The Vietnam Programme has been at the forefront of the battle againstthe outbreak of avian flu (see page 23). The New Adult Intensive Care Unit at the Hospital for TropicalDiseases opened in 2004, fundedjointly by the Vietnamese Governmentand the Wellcome Trust.During the year, 70 immunology and infectious disease awards were made,including 15 new programme grantsor renewals, to a total value of \u00a326.6 million. Research funded in the immunology and infectious disease area ranged from fundamental and applied research in basic immunology and infectiousdiseases conducted in the UK throughto field, epidemiological and clinicalresearch based in developing countries. Professor Brian Spratt, Imperial College, had the programme grant associated withhis Principal Research Fellowship renewedat a cost of \u00a31.7 million. Professor Spratt,who has been a Principal Research Fellowsince 1989, studies the epidemiology andevolution of bacterial populations, and haspioneered the use of multi-locussequence typing as a scientific andepidemiological tool. Senior Research Fellowships in Basic Biomedical Science were awarded toDr Allison Green, University of Cambridge,for studies into inflammation andautoimmune disease, and to Dr Danielvan Aalten, University of Dundee, for his studies on structural biology andinhibitor design in chitin metabolism. Fifteen programme grants were awarded, including grants to: Professor Jose Vazquez-Boland, who moved from the University of Leon inSpain to take up the Chair of VeterinaryMolecular Microbiology at the Universityof Bristol, for his studies of themolecular and cellular pathogenesis ofListeria infection. Listeriosis has one of food-borne infections.Professor Vazquez-Boland isinvestigating the actin-basedmechanism of cell-cell spread used by the bacterium. Dr Gavin Wilkinson, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, for studiesinto human cytomegalovirus. Thisherpesvirus is able to evade theimmune system of healthy but infected persons, but in immunocompromisedindividuals it presents a major clinicalproblem. Using clinical isolates, Dr Wilkinson will look at how the virusinteracts with natural killer cells, themain weapon in fighting viral disease.The team will use whole genomecloning techniques to investigate therole of different viral genes in evadingthese immune cells. Professor David Wraith, University of Bristol, for research on thedifferentiation and stability of inducedregulatory T cells. Professor Wraith'sresearch is aimed at the developmentof therapies to control autoimmuneconditions, such as multiple sclerosis.

Dr Corbett was awarded the 2004 Chalmers medalby the Royal Society of Tropical Medicineand Hygiene for her contributions totropical medicine. An interim review was carried out of the Wellcome Trust/Burroughs WellcomeFund Infectious Diseases Initiative . Launched in 1999, the initiative awarded\u00a318 million to support 13 projects, eachinvolving partners in the UK, USA and adeveloping country, and has played animportant role in fostering internationalpartnerships and developing capacity. While many projects have yet to come to full fruition, it is clear that they havedelivered major benefits to the participantsand host institutions, and in some caseshave had a direct impact on public health. For example, the project based in Bangladesh has raised the profile of neonatal healthcare locally, attracting the interest of the Ministry of Health andother NGOs/charities (see page 27). Major Overseas Programmes Following a favourable review in 2004, an award of \u00a32.3 million was made to the University of Liverpool for theMalawi-Liverpool-Wellcome TrustClinical Research Programme . The programme, which is led by ProfessorMalcolm Molyneux and is based in theWellcome Trust Research Laboratories at the University of Malawi College ofMedicine, Blantyre, conducts researchinto malaria, HIV, TB and other bacterialand viral infections, and anaemia. In addition to research costs, the awardprovides funds to support the training of local researchers associated with theprogramme (see page 25). In Kenya building work began on new laboratories in Kilifi for the Wellcome Trust/Kenya Medical Research InstituteResearch Programme , led by Professor Kevin Marsh. The building has beenfunded by a Wellcome Trust grant of\u00a32.75 million to the Kenya MedicalResearch Institute. The building should be completed by August 2005. Research highlights from the Kenya programme include: The completion of a survey of epilepsy in over 160 000 people and theidentification of all cases of activeepilepsy, the largest study of its kindever conducted in Africa. The Wellcome Trust Centre for Molecular Parasitology The Wellcome Trust Centre for Molecular Parasitology at the University of Glasgow,led by Professor Dave Barry, carries outresearch on basic features of parasites,using genetic and molecular technologyallied with organismal biology. One aim is that such studies will lead to novelcontrol approaches. Much of the research at the Centre concerns African trypanosomes,microscopic parasites that cause humansleeping sickness and the wastingdisease nagana in domestic animals. The malaria parasite, Plasmodium , and a related parasite, Theileria , which infects cells of the cattle immune system,are also studied at the Centre. In 2004, the Centre established a new partnership with INSERM, the nationalmedical research agency of the FrenchGovernment. INSERM has begun tolocate its researchers in universitiesabroad, and the first of these INSERMResearch Units, led by ProfessorChristian Doerig, has been established at the Centre. During the year, a programme grant was awarded to Professor Andy Tait at the Centre, based on his application of genetics to the identification ofimportant trypanosome genes.

During the year, 63 physiological sciences awards were made, includingseven new programme grants orrenewals, to a total value of \u00a320.2 million. Physiological science awards covered a broad range of basic and clinicalresearch. Awards were made in areas as diverse as epidemiology - for example, to Dr Louise Parker (University of Newcastle), for an analysis of a historicalbirth cohort to explore the effect of pre-and post-natal exposure to airborneparticulate matter on subsequentmortality and health - and organ transplantation - such as the award to Professor Peter Friend (University of Oxford), for the development of anovel preservation technique for donorlivers involving warm perfusion. One notable theme during the year centred on appetite control, nutrition and body size, obesity and theirimpact on health , particularly diabetes. Awards included a programme grant to Professor Stephen Bloom (ImperialCollege London) for his studies aimed at exploiting the discovery that guthormones physiologically controlappetite. This programme will examinehow different gut hormones producetheir effects and interact in obese andlean volunteers. The research shouldprovide a better understanding of thecomplex interactions in appetiteregulation and provide new strategies to treat and prevent obesity. Another significant award in a related area was made to Professor PatrikRorsman (University of Oxford), for his studies into the physiology and pathophysiology of beta-cell exocytosisand insulin secretion. Greater insight intothe control of insulin secretion has thepotential to inform both our fundamentalknowledge of the defects involved intype 2 diabetes and the development of novel therapies to treat this debilitatingand widespread condition. This awardwas of further importance as it aidedthe recruitment and retention ofProfessor Rorsman, an internationallyrenowned scientist previously workingoutside the UK. In this same general theme, an award was made to Professor David Dungerand colleagues (University of Cambridge)for a study looking at the effect of geneticvariation in the insulin gene on birthweight and perinatal survival in Africanpopulations. This study will, for the firsttime, test the hypothesis that genesrelating to size at birth influence fetal and postnatal survival. A significant amount of multidisciplinary research was also funded through the year. This included an award to ProfessorDavid Paterson and colleagues at theUniversities of Oxford and Auckland (NewZealand) for a heart 'physiome' project . The aim of their project is to demonstratethe use of integrative multi-scale modelling- at the levels of atoms, proteins, cells,tissues and organs - to relate detailedgenomic information to a model of thestructure and function of the human heart.Since biological systems are extremelycomplex, the team will develop speciallydesigned instrumentation, databases and software to help understand thegenetic basis of mechanisms underlyingarrhythmia in the heart. These tools will be accessible on the web for otherinvestigators to use in further studies. Another award for multidisciplinary research was made to Dr David Webb(Aston University) and colleagues at the University of Birmingham. They aredeveloping a 'smart vest' which, whenworn next to the skin, will collect clinicallyuseful information related to respiration.Such information should aid clinicians in the diagnosis of respiratory disease. As well as grant funding, a joint MRC/ Wellcome Trust workshop was organised on integrative physiology. The workshop,held in May 2004, brought together basicand clinical physiologists and exploredhow an appropriate strategy to furtherencourage integrative physiology might be developed. NEUROSCIENCE AND MENTAL HEALTHNEUROSCIENCE AND MENTAL HEALTH 42 The Neuroscience and Mental Health stream aims to support high-quality research into the function of the nervous system in health and disease. During the year, 62 neuroscience awards were made, including 11 new programme grants or renewals, to a total value of \u00a326.6 million. One Principal Research Fellowship was renewed, to Professor Chris Frith(Institute of Neurology) for his studiesof social interactions (see page 8). Neuroscience awards continued to cover a wide range of both basic and clinical research topics throughout 2003/04.Two examples of the diversity of fundingare awards to Dr Lucia Sivilotti (UniversityCollege London), for a highly detailedstudy of the subunits of the nicotinicacetylcholine receptor, and Dr Mariannevan den Bree (University of Wales,Cardiff) who is carrying out a longitudinalstudy in adolescents of the risk factorsassociated with substance abuse. Two significant awards were made in the field of child psychiatry . The first was to Professor Alan Stein (University of Oxford) for his ongoing work whichaims to understand how maternalpostnatal psychiatric disorders can affectthe development of a child, even afterthe mother has recovered. His group will be looking at how interactionsbetween mother and child are affectedby postnatal depression, following infantsin the first years of life to see how theysubsequently develop. In a related study, Professor Ian Goodyer (University of Cambridge) will be lookingat how genetic and environmental riskfactors in infancy affect the occurrence of psychiatric disorders during the keychanges accompanying adolescence.His group will be carrying out alongitudinal study of 13 and 14 year-oldsto find associations of selected genesand childhood adversity with depressionand associated conditions. Several awards were for basic research projects aiming to increase our knowledgeof how neurons communicate with each other - essential for ourunderstanding of the nervous system. Two awards were made to groups atUniversity College London, to ProfessorsDavid Attwell and Stuart Cull-Candy.Professor Attwell's group will be involvedin studies into how neurotransmittersfunction in ways distinct fromconventional fast synaptic transmissionbetween neurons, looking particularly at their communication with glia cells.Professor Cull-Candy's research willexamine how changes in nature ofneurotransmission at glutamate and GABA synapses. Other research projects are looking at chemicals that are not classicalneurotransmitters but have a major rolein neuronal transmission. One suchaward was made to Professor Alan North (University of Manchester), whois studying the role of ATP, classically known as a molecule which transfersenergy within cells, which interacts with specific receptors on neurons. Furthering our understanding of how these molecules enable neurons tocommunicate is important in their furtherdevelopment as targets for drugs fordiseases of the nervous system. A number of projects are aiming to clarify how the very complex connections in the nervous system develop. Dr UweDrescher (King's College London), forexample, is examining how neurons canbe directed to their targets, which areoften a great distance away, by guidancemolecules. Dr Drescher is studying thedifferential expression of genes at criticaltimes of development which assist inguiding neuronal projections from theretina to the tectum. Professor Kristjan Jessen (University College London) was awarded a grant to study the development of Schwann cells within the nervous system. These very specialised cells form the myelinsheath which insulates nerve axons and are essential for normal nervefunction. However, following injury theycan revert to an immature state, leadingto demyelination of the axon and loss of function.

L to R PHYSIOLOGICAL SCIENCES 43 PHYSIOLOGICAL SCIENCES The Physiological Sciences stream aims to support high-quality basic and clinical research relevant to the understanding of biological processes at the cell, organ, system and whole-animal level in health and disease. During the year, 63 physiological sciences awards were made, includingseven new programme grants orrenewals, to a total value of \u00a320.2 million. Physiological science awards covered a broad range of basic and clinicalresearch. Awards were made in areas as diverse as epidemiology - for example, to Dr Louise Parker (University of Newcastle), for an analysis of a historicalbirth cohort to explore the effect of pre-and post-natal exposure to airborneparticulate matter on subsequentmortality and health - and organ transplantation - such as the award to Professor Peter Friend (University of Oxford), for the development of anovel preservation technique for donorlivers involving warm perfusion. One notable theme during the year centred on appetite control, nutrition and body size, obesity and theirimpact on health , particularly diabetes. Awards included a programme grant to Professor Stephen Bloom (ImperialCollege London) for his studies aimed at exploiting the discovery that guthormones physiologically controlappetite. This programme will examinehow different gut hormones producetheir effects and interact in obese andlean volunteers. The research shouldprovide a better understanding of thecomplex interactions in appetiteregulation and provide new strategies to treat and prevent obesity. Another significant award in a related area was made to Professor PatrikRorsman (University of Oxford), for his studies into the physiology and pathophysiology of beta-cell exocytosisand insulin secretion. Greater insight intothe control of insulin secretion has thepotential to inform both our fundamentalknowledge of the defects involved intype 2 diabetes and the development of novel therapies to treat this debilitatingand widespread condition. This awardwas of further importance as it aidedthe recruitment and retention ofProfessor Rorsman, an internationallyrenowned scientist previously workingoutside the UK. In this same general theme, an award was made to Professor David Dungerand colleagues (University of Cambridge)for a study looking at the effect of geneticvariation in the insulin gene on birthweight and perinatal survival in Africanpopulations. This study will, for the firsttime, test the hypothesis that genesrelating to size at birth influence fetal and postnatal survival. A significant amount of multidisciplinary research was also funded through the year. This included an award to ProfessorDavid Paterson and colleagues at theUniversities of Oxford and Auckland (NewZealand) for a heart 'physiome' project . The aim of their project is to demonstratethe use of integrative multi-scale modelling- at the levels of atoms, proteins, cells,tissues and organs - to relate detailedgenomic information to a model of thestructure and function of the human heart.Since biological systems are extremelycomplex, the team will develop speciallydesigned instrumentation, databases and software to help understand thegenetic basis of mechanisms underlyingarrhythmia in the heart. These tools will be accessible on the web for otherinvestigators to use in further studies. Another award for multidisciplinary research was made to Dr David Webb(Aston University) and colleagues at the University of Birmingham. They aredeveloping a 'smart vest' which, whenworn next to the skin, will collect clinicallyuseful information related to respiration.Such information should aid clinicians in the diagnosis of respiratory disease. As well as grant funding, a joint MRC/ Wellcome Trust workshop was organised on integrative physiology. The workshop,held in May 2004, brought together basicand clinical physiologists and exploredhow an appropriate strategy to furtherencourage integrative physiology might be developed. NEUROSCIENCE AND MENTAL HEALTHNEUROSCIENCE AND MENTAL HEALTH 42 The Neuroscience and Mental Health stream aims to support high-quality research into the function of the nervous system in health and disease. During the year, 62 neuroscience awards were made, including 11 new programme grants or renewals, to a total value of \u00a326.6 million. One Principal Research Fellowship was renewed, to Professor Chris Frith(Institute of Neurology) for his studiesof social interactions (see page 8). Neuroscience awards continued to cover a wide range of both basic and clinical research topics throughout 2003/04.Two examples of the diversity of fundingare awards to Dr Lucia Sivilotti (UniversityCollege London), for a highly detailedstudy of the subunits of the nicotinicacetylcholine receptor, and Dr Mariannevan den Bree (University of Wales,Cardiff) who is carrying out a longitudinalstudy in adolescents of the risk factorsassociated with substance abuse. Two significant awards were made in the field of child psychiatry . The first was to Professor Alan Stein (University of Oxford) for his ongoing work whichaims to understand how maternalpostnatal psychiatric disorders can affectthe development of a child, even afterthe mother has recovered. His group will be looking at how interactionsbetween mother and child are affectedby postnatal depression, following infantsin the first years of life to see how theysubsequently develop. In a related study, Professor Ian Goodyer (University of Cambridge) will be lookingat how genetic and environmental riskfactors in infancy affect the occurrence of psychiatric disorders during the keychanges accompanying adolescence.His group will be carrying out alongitudinal study of 13 and 14 year-oldsto find associations of selected genesand childhood adversity with depressionand associated conditions. Several awards were for basic research projects aiming to increase our knowledgeof how neurons communicate with each other - essential for ourunderstanding of the nervous system. Two awards were made to groups atUniversity College London, to ProfessorsDavid Attwell and Stuart Cull-Candy.Professor Attwell's group will be involvedin studies into how neurotransmittersfunction in ways distinct fromconventional fast synaptic transmissionbetween neurons, looking particularly at their communication with glia cells.Professor Cull-Candy's research willexamine how changes in nature ofneurotransmission at glutamate and GABA synapses. Other research projects are looking at chemicals that are not classicalneurotransmitters but have a major rolein neuronal transmission. One suchaward was made to Professor Alan North (University of Manchester), whois studying the role of ATP, classically known as a molecule which transfersenergy within cells, which interacts with specific receptors on neurons. Furthering our understanding of how these molecules enable neurons tocommunicate is important in their furtherdevelopment as targets for drugs fordiseases of the nervous system. A number of projects are aiming to clarify how the very complex connections in the nervous system develop. Dr UweDrescher (King's College London), forexample, is examining how neurons canbe directed to their targets, which areoften a great distance away, by guidancemolecules. Dr Drescher is studying thedifferential expression of genes at criticaltimes of development which assist inguiding neuronal projections from theretina to the tectum. Professor Kristjan Jessen (University College London) was awarded a grant to study the development of Schwann cells within the nervous system. These very specialised cells form the myelinsheath which insulates nerve axons and are essential for normal nervefunction. However, following injury theycan revert to an immature state, leadingto demyelination of the axon and loss of function. Professor Jessen's group is examining the signals that controlSchwann cell differentiation and theprocess of myelination, and will also look at mechanisms that may allow the Schwann cells to form new myelinsheaths and thus aid nerve repairfollowing injury.

L to R MEDICAL HUMANITIES 45 MEDICAL HUMANITIES The Medical Humanities stream aims to enhance understanding of the historical and social context of medicine and biomedical science. It supports researchprogrammes in history of medicine and biomedical ethics, and encourages use of research findings, for example to inform public policy making. POPULATIONS AND PUBLIC HEALTHPOPULATIONS AND PUBLIC HEALTH 44 The Populations and Public Health stream aims to improve our understanding of the determinants of disease and quality of life in populations. It promotes the use of this understanding to improve public health and healthcare delivery. In the history of medicine, a Strategic Award was made to Dr Mark Harrison(University of Oxford) for his study 'The history of infectious disease, andmedicine in the tropics'. EnhancementAwards were made to ProfessorVirginia Berridge (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine),Professor Anne Crowther (University of Glasgow) and Dr Nick Hopwood(University of Cambridge). Two University Awards were made, to Dr Tim McHugh (Oxford BrookesUniversity; Rural medical charity andsociety in Brittany, 1598-1789) and Dr Rosemary Elliot (University ofGlasgow; Smoking and health inGermany from occupation toreunification, 1945-1995). Fellowshipand project support covered a widerange of topics, from Unani practice in India to fungal diseases in modern medicine. Preservation The Research Resources in Medical History scheme was set up to improve access to documentary collections thatare important to historians of medicine,by funding preservation, conservation,cataloguing and digitisation projects. In June 2004, the scheme was extended for a further two years, withfunds of \u00a3500 000 available each year.In its first four years, the scheme hasfunded 58 projects to a total value of \u00a32 million. An evaluation of the scheme carried out in 2004 discovered that institutions thathave received funding for cataloguingnow urgently require second-stagefunding for preservation andconservation. As a result, the newscheme is focusing primarily onpreservation and conservation, althoughproposals for cataloguing projects willstill be accepted. Biomedical ethics Research is supported on issuesrelevant to policy and practice in the UKand the conduct of biomedical researchin the developing world. A total of 50awards in biomedical ethics were madein 2003/04, primarily project grants but including six fellowships, ninestudentships and 17 symposia. The Wellcome Trust also organised a workshop, 'Investigating ethics and mental disorders'. Among the research projects funded, Dr Sheila McLean (University ofGlasgow) was awarded a project grantto review and evaluate clinical ethics committees in the UK. Dr Robin Williams (University of Durham) receivedproject grant funding for follow-up to hisprevious study on the UK National DNA database , this time reviewing forensic databasing in support of criminalinvestigation in the EU states, and howDNA data are being shared acrossnational borders. Dr Mike English, a clinician at the KEMRI/Wellcome Trust Major OverseasProgramme in Kenya, was awardedproject grant support to investigate the research-to-policy-to-practice pathway in Kenya. He will explore the environment in which health policydecisions are made, mapping out thelinkages and information flow betweenkey stakeholder groups. The development of novel diagnostics, therapeutics and health services isincreasingly predicated on the searchfor significant biological differenceswithin and between populations. Dr Paul Martin (University of Nottingham)was funded to investigate how thecategories of race/ethnicity are used in research and what their practicalimpact might be. During the year, 53 awards were made in this area, principally through theHealth Consequences of PopulationChange Programme, to a total value of \u00a312.7 million. Latin America An initiative to support Centres of Excellence in Latin America culminated in the award of four programmes (totalling\u00a33.8 million) to support multidisciplinaryresearch on the impact on health of demographic and socioeconomicchanges in the region. Professor MauricioBarreto (Univesidade da Bahia, Salvador,Brazil) will study the impact ofurbanisation, migration and lifestylechanges on allergic diseases (atopy and asthma).

The project will assessa number of possible risk factors,including family structure, social networks,and instabilities resulting from migration. Major centres Dr Michael Bennish at the Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies ,University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa has been awarded funding for a feasibilitystudy to examine different approaches to using antiretroviral drugs against HIVinfections in resource-poor settings.These drugs are normally used on a long-term basis to suppress disease, withcareful monitoring of patients - presentingmajor challenges where the numbers ofpeople in need are large and resourcesare scarce. The Trust-funded building housing the Africa Centre at Somkhele has beenwidely praised - a tribute to a distinctivebuilding that reflects the Centre'scommitment to community-based healthresearch. A series of regional and nationalawards culminated in the South AfricanInstitute of Architects Award of Excellencefor 2002, where the building wasdescribed as one of the best ever built in South Africa. Professor Huda Zurayk, Center for Research in Population and Health,American University of Beirut, wasawarded a \u00a31.86 million programme grantto continue her studies on reproductivehealth of women, health of adolescentsand the elderly in the Middle East. The award reflects the progress madesince it was awarded a 'regional centre of excellence' grant in 2001. Training The Master's-level Research Training Fellowship scheme was reviewed during the year. The awards consist of a taughtcourse, followed by a research project in the applicant's home country. In all, 67 individuals received Masters' supportbetween 1998 and 2002.

L to R WELLCOME TRUST GENOME CAMPUSTECHNOLOGY TRANSFER 46WELLCOME TRUST GENOME CAMPUS 47 The Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, at Hinxton, near Cambridge, is home to the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, the Wellcome Trust Conference Centre and WellcomeTrust Advanced Courses. The Genome Campus is currently being extended to provideadditional laboratory and ancillary space. Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute is one of the world's leading scientificestablishments, generating and providingdata and resources to the global scientificcommunity. Genome sequence and themultitude of variants present in apopulation are responsible for many of the differences between individuals,from cognition to cancer predisposition in humans to virulence in pathogens.Hence DNA sequence provides anessential platform for much of biomedical research. The Sanger Institute produced the largest contribution to finished human genome sequence (see page 6), and has also developed tools such as the Ensembl gene browser which enable hundreds of thousands of researchers to view andutilise genome sequence data from 17different species via the web, with humanand mouse the most popular. In 2004, papers from the Sanger Institute describing the sequence content ofchromosomes 6, 9 and 10 - a total of nearly 400 million base pairs - werepublished. The Sanger Institute has nowproduced some 2.5 billion base pairs of finished sequence. The Sanger Institute has increased its faculty strength to 35, as its programmesevolve to place a greater emphasis ongene function through genetic analysis in humans and model organisms. High-volume sequencing continues to fuel many of these activities: during last yearthe zebrafish genome was a priority, but there was an increasing emphasis on re-sequencing in humans, mice and pathogens to document variation and identify disease-causing alleles. In the past year the Sanger Institute has identified genes that play a role indiabetes and lung cancer (see pages 12, 22), while the genome of MRSA(methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ) was decoded. The Sanger Institute plays a leading role in identifyingvariation in the major histocompatibility complex - a key part of the immune system which is also involved inautoimmune diseases such as arthritisand type 1 diabetes. Teams from the Sanger Institute have been funded by the US National Institutesof Health to contribute to the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project,a consortium that aims to put in place thebest technologies to map all functionalelements of the genome. In its initial pilotphase, 1 per cent of the human genomeis being evaluated. The Sanger Institute now has established major activities in mouse genetics and this year announced the development of SITGR and MICER, two resources formouse functional genomics. These freelyavailable resources are dramaticallyaccelerating the process of discoveringgene function in mice in laboratoriesacross the globe. Wellcome Trust Conference Centre The Conference Centre continued to expand its activities, hosting some200 meetings and more than 7500delegates. Highlights of the year includedfive large Wellcome Trust Conferences -Functional Genomics, Days 2004, FunctionalGenomics of Host-PathogenInteractions, and Genome Informatics. The latter two events were held jointly with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.International collaboration was also a feature of Days of Molecular Medicine(coorganised with the University of California San Diego and NatureMedicine ) and Genomes 2004 (with The Institute for Genomic Research and Institut Pasteur). These events have been well attended and well received, and more will beorganised for 2004/05 and beyond. Wellcome Trust Advanced Courses The Wellcome Trust Advanced Coursesprogramme provides postdoctoralresearchers with hands-on training in emerging research techniques . The courses, which are attended byresearchers from all over the world, are held in dedicated laboratories in the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. During the year four Advanced Courses were held - Genotype to Protein, DNAMicroarrays, Functional Genomics andHuman Genome Analysis. In addition fourbioinformatics Open Door Workshops were held, giving participants hands-onexperience of working with human andpathogen genome sequences. The Advanced Courses programme was positively reviewed in 2003, and new courses will be added from2004/05 onwards in key areas. South Field Project The South Field Project, the \u00a395 milliondevelopment of the Genome Campus,remained on schedule to be completedin 2005. The 13 000 square metre development will provide additional research laboratories and data-handlingfacilities for the Sanger Institute and improved ancillary facilities for allGenome Campus staff. The laboratorieswill provide additional space for genomicand molecular biology research, while thedata centre will provide a substantialincrease in the computing power of theSanger Institute, making it one of themost advanced in Europe. The ancillary building houses a new lecture room, restaurant facilities and sports hall andgymnasium. Completion and handover ofthe project is scheduled for spring 2005.For the Wellcome Trust to achieve its mission, it is important that the basicdiscoveries made by the scientificcommunity are translated into practicalinnovations that can be utilised directlyor indirectly to improve human andanimal health. To be effective intranslating scientific advances intohealth products, scientists need to engage with the business andinvestment community. Bridging thegap between academic research andcommercial R&D is difficult because of the risks inherent to early-stagetranslation. This is a particular problemin the healthcare sector, where thetechnical and regulatory hurdles are a significant challenge on the path to market. Technology Transfer at the Wellcome Trust seeks to mitigate the risks of early- stage translation by funding projects that are too early to attract venture capitalor to be seen by industry as credible in-licensing opportunities. Up to 2003, it achieved this through the \u00a320 millionDevelopment Fund . Over a period of five years, this has supported around 40projects from 14 institutions. Many ofthese have raised additional investmentand two have developed products already(see pages 22 and 27), although it is stilltoo early to appreciate the full impact of the funding provided. In March 2003 the Wellcome Trust announced two new forms of translationaward. University Translation Awards provide a response-mode funding stream.As such, they are used to support adiverse array of technologies, not onlyfrom biology but also from the physicalsciences and mathematics. The commonrequirements are that the research isaimed at the improvement of health andthat the project can be advanced to apoint at which it represents an attractiveproposition for follow-on support by athird party. Both academic institutions and associated early-stage companiesare eligible to apply for these translationawards. Managing projects to a successfuloutcome is the responsibility of theinstitution or company management. Technology Transfer has just completed the first full year of funding of UniversityTranslation Awards. Of 58 applicationsreceived from 30 institutions, 25 per centwere awarded. An equivalent number ofawards were made to universitydepartments and small businesses. The mean value of these awards was \u00a3276 000 (range: \u00a348 000 to \u00a3594 000).In keeping with the response-mode natureof the scheme, projects were funded thataddressed a wide range of potentialapplications - including therapeutics,vaccines, diagnostics and medicaldevices, as well as new platformtechnologies. One award was made to investigate the effectiveness of policytools for promoting translation inneglected diseases, such as malaria and African sleeping sickness. Strategic Translation Awards are a second form of funding designed to support translational research in areasof key importance to the Wellcome Trust.These may be technologies that have a particular role in support of the Trust'smission and address an unmet need in healthcare, and where TechnologyTransfer can add value by providingproject management support or securingfollow-on funding. Four Strategic Translation Award applications have been considered sincethe scheme was announced. Theserelated to diagnostics, vaccination and anovel genotyping technology. The meanvalue of the awards was \u00a31.3 million.Further developments in strategicallyimportant translational research are likelyto be announced in the coming year. There has been encouraging progress in a number of the projects supportedthrough the Development Fund. CellTran , a spin-out company from the Universityof Sheffield, launched a 'smart bandage'product called ' Myskin ' for the treatment of serious burns (see page 27). Anotherearly-stage company, Diagnostics for the Real World , has developed dipstick technology for the diagnosis of Chlamydia infection (see page 22). The year also saw important develop- ments in a drug discovery project, basedat the Institute of Cancer Research, on a mutant form of the B-Raf kinase associated with malignant melanoma.The project is being taken forward by a partnership that includes the Instituteitself, Cancer Research Technology, theWellcome Trust Sanger Institute, theWellcome Trust and Astex Technology , a biotech company with expertise in drugdiscovery, especially structure-activityrelationship research. With the expandedteam, the programme is set to progressthrough the critical phases of leadselection and lead optimisation over the coming year. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER Technology Transfer at the Wellcome Trust seeks to maximise the impact of research innovations on health by facilitating the development of early-stage projects to a pointat which they can be further developed by the market.

Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute is one of the world's leading scientificestablishments, generating and providingdata and resources to the global scientificcommunity. Genome sequence and themultitude of variants present in apopulation are responsible for many of the differences between individuals,from cognition to cancer predisposition in humans to virulence in pathogens.Hence DNA sequence provides anessential platform for much of biomedical research. The Sanger Institute produced the largest contribution to finished human genome sequence (see page 6), and has also developed tools such as the Ensembl gene browser which enable hundreds of thousands of researchers to view andutilise genome sequence data from 17different species via the web, with humanand mouse the most popular. In 2004, papers from the Sanger Institute describing the sequence content ofchromosomes 6, 9 and 10 - a total of nearly 400 million base pairs - werepublished. The Sanger Institute has nowproduced some 2.5 billion base pairs of finished sequence. The Sanger Institute has increased its faculty strength to 35, as its programmesevolve to place a greater emphasis ongene function through genetic analysis in humans and model organisms. High-volume sequencing continues to fuel many of these activities: during last yearthe zebrafish genome was a priority, but there was an increasing emphasis on re-sequencing in humans, mice and pathogens to document variation and identify disease-causing alleles. In the past year the Sanger Institute has identified genes that play a role indiabetes and lung cancer (see pages 12, 22), while the genome of MRSA(methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ) was decoded. The Sanger Institute plays a leading role in identifyingvariation in the major histocompatibility complex - a key part of the immune system which is also involved inautoimmune diseases such as arthritisand type 1 diabetes. Teams from the Sanger Institute have been funded by the US National Institutesof Health to contribute to the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project,a consortium that aims to put in place thebest technologies to map all functionalelements of the genome. In its initial pilotphase, 1 per cent of the human genomeis being evaluated. The Sanger Institute now has established major activities in mouse genetics and this year announced the development of SITGR and MICER, two resources formouse functional genomics. These freelyavailable resources are dramaticallyaccelerating the process of discoveringgene function in mice in laboratoriesacross the globe. Wellcome Trust Conference Centre The Conference Centre continued to expand its activities, hosting some200 meetings and more than 7500delegates. Highlights of the year includedfive large Wellcome Trust Conferences -Functional Genomics, Days 2004, FunctionalGenomics of Host-PathogenInteractions, and Genome Informatics. The latter two events were held jointly with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.International collaboration was also a feature of Days of Molecular Medicine(coorganised with the University of California San Diego and NatureMedicine ) and Genomes 2004 (with The Institute for Genomic Research and Institut Pasteur). These events have been well attended and well received, and more will beorganised for 2004/05 and beyond. Wellcome Trust Advanced Courses The Wellcome Trust Advanced Coursesprogramme provides postdoctoralresearchers with hands-on training in emerging research techniques . The courses, which are attended byresearchers from all over the world, are held in dedicated laboratories in the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. During the year four Advanced Courses were held - Genotype to Protein, DNAMicroarrays, Functional Genomics andHuman Genome Analysis. In addition fourbioinformatics Open Door Workshops were held, giving participants hands-onexperience of working with human andpathogen genome sequences. The Advanced Courses programme was positively reviewed in 2003, and new courses will be added from2004/05 onwards in key areas. South Field Project The South Field Project, the \u00a395 milliondevelopment of the Genome Campus,remained on schedule to be completedin 2005. The 13 000 square metre development will provide additional research laboratories and data-handlingfacilities for the Sanger Institute and improved ancillary facilities for allGenome Campus staff. The laboratorieswill provide additional space for genomicand molecular biology research, while thedata centre will provide a substantialincrease in the computing power of theSanger Institute, making it one of themost advanced in Europe. The ancillary building houses a new lecture room, restaurant facilities and sports hall andgymnasium. Completion and handover ofthe project is scheduled for spring 2005.For the Wellcome Trust to achieve its mission, it is important that the basicdiscoveries made by the scientificcommunity are translated into practicalinnovations that can be utilised directlyor indirectly to improve human andanimal health. To be effective intranslating scientific advances intohealth products, scientists need to engage with the business andinvestment community. Bridging thegap between academic research andcommercial R&D is difficult because of the risks inherent to early-stagetranslation. This is a particular problemin the healthcare sector, where thetechnical and regulatory hurdles are a significant challenge on the path to market. Technology Transfer at the Wellcome Trust seeks to mitigate the risks of early- stage translation by funding projects that are too early to attract venture capitalor to be seen by industry as credible in-licensing opportunities. Up to 2003, it achieved this through the \u00a320 millionDevelopment Fund . Over a period of five years, this has supported around 40projects from 14 institutions. Many ofthese have raised additional investmentand two have developed products already(see pages 22 and 27), although it is stilltoo early to appreciate the full impact of the funding provided. In March 2003 the Wellcome Trust announced two new forms of translationaward. University Translation Awards provide a response-mode funding stream.As such, they are used to support adiverse array of technologies, not onlyfrom biology but also from the physicalsciences and mathematics. The commonrequirements are that the research isaimed at the improvement of health andthat the project can be advanced to apoint at which it represents an attractiveproposition for follow-on support by athird party. Both academic institutions and associated early-stage companiesare eligible to apply for these translationawards. Managing projects to a successfuloutcome is the responsibility of theinstitution or company management. Technology Transfer has just completed the first full year of funding of UniversityTranslation Awards. Of 58 applicationsreceived from 30 institutions, 25 per centwere awarded. An equivalent number ofawards were made to universitydepartments and small businesses. The mean value of these awards was \u00a3276 000 (range: \u00a348 000 to \u00a3594 000).In keeping with the response-mode natureof the scheme, projects were funded thataddressed a wide range of potentialapplications - including therapeutics,vaccines, diagnostics and medicaldevices, as well as new platformtechnologies. One award was made to investigate the effectiveness of policytools for promoting translation inneglected diseases, such as malaria and African sleeping sickness. Strategic Translation Awards are a second form of funding designed to support translational research in areasof key importance to the Wellcome Trust.These may be technologies that have a particular role in support of the Trust'smission and address an unmet need in healthcare, and where TechnologyTransfer can add value by providingproject management support or securingfollow-on funding. Four Strategic Translation Award applications have been considered sincethe scheme was announced. Theserelated to diagnostics, vaccination and anovel genotyping technology. The meanvalue of the awards was \u00a31.3 million.Further developments in strategicallyimportant translational research are likelyto be announced in the coming year. There has been encouraging progress in a number of the projects supportedthrough the Development Fund. CellTran , a spin-out company from the Universityof Sheffield, launched a 'smart bandage'product called ' Myskin ' for the treatment of serious burns (see page 27). Anotherearly-stage company, Diagnostics for the Real World , has developed dipstick technology for the diagnosis of Chlamydia infection (see page 22). The year also saw important develop- ments in a drug discovery project, basedat the Institute of Cancer Research, on a mutant form of the B-Raf kinase associated with malignant melanoma.The project is being taken forward by a partnership that includes the Instituteitself, Cancer Research Technology, theWellcome Trust Sanger Institute, theWellcome Trust and Astex Technology , a biotech company with expertise in drugdiscovery, especially structure-activityrelationship research. With the expandedteam, the programme is set to progressthrough the critical phases of leadselection and lead optimisation over the coming year. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER Technology Transfer at the Wellcome Trust seeks to maximise the impact of research innovations on health by facilitating the development of early-stage projects to a pointat which they can be further developed by the market.

L to R PUBLIC ENGAGEMENTPUBLIC ENGAGEMENT 48PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT 49 The Wellcome Trust's Public Engagement activities aim to raise awareness and understanding of biomedical science, its social and ethical implications and its historical context. The Wellcome Trust Gallery at the British Museum , funded by a \u00a35.4 million grant to the British Museum, opened on 3 November 2003 with Living and Dying (see page 31). Pharmakon ran from 17 October 2003 to 6 February 2004 at the TwoTen Galleryon Euston Road. The exhibition featuredworks from the US artist Beverly Fishman. Wonderful: Visions of the near future , a major collaborative science and artventure exploring the languages andassumptions of art and science and whathappens when these research interestsfuse, opened at the Arnolfini Gallery inBristol in February 2004. Supported bythe Wellcome Trust and other partners,Wonderful comprises a national touring exhibition, new commissions, live work,an education CD-ROM, conference,publication and interpretative film. Education Construction work began on the newNational Science Learning Centreat the University of York, part of the \u00a351 million national network of ScienceLearning Centres being funded by theWellcome Trust and the Department for Education and Skills. The nationalcentre, which is due to open in autumn2005, will be run by the White RoseConsortium. The national network aimsto provide enhanced professionaldevelopment opportunities for scienceteachers and technicians. Life Study , a research report describing the views and attitudes of a range of stakeholders and interested partiestowards A-level biology , was published in October 2003. The research wascommissioned by the Wellcome Trust and carried out by the Centre forEducation and Industry at the University of Warwick. Two editions of LabNotes: New biology and society - a publication providing teachers with up-to-date information on research findings in biomedicine andtheir wider social implications - werepublished during the year. Ageing covered the science and socialimplications of increased longevity, while Dying for change: Infectious disease in the developing world examined the reasons underlying the huge impact of infectious disease in resource-poor countries. Wellcome Library Significant progress was made on thecataloguing of the Wellcome Foundation Ltdarchive (which was transferred to the Wellcome Library from GlaxoSmithKline in 2001). The cataloguing project will helpilluminate both the early development of the Wellcome pharmaceutical company and the wider history of thepharmaceutical industry in the UK. Public outreach , particularly with schools and young people, was a feature of the Wellcome Library's year. Fourteenstudents from South Camden CommunitySchool, all refugees, embarked on theRemedies and Recipes project. Aftervisiting the Wellcome Library to examine a range of recipe books they compiledtheir own books of home cures from both the UK and their home countries. Two GCSE Medicine Through Time INSET days were run by the Wellcome Library in partnership with the SchoolsHistory Project (www.tasc.ac.uk/shp) withthe aim of improving teachers' knowledgeand increasing their confidence inteaching the history of medicine. The first, held in January 2004, examined why Victorian industrial towns were sounhealthy; the second, held in June 2004,explored changes in medicine, surgeryand our understanding of the humanbody over this period. The Wellcome Library ran a programme of 40-minute video-conference sessions for schools. Topics included 'What's theDifference?', looking at medical advancesin the 19th and 20th centuries, and 'WhatWas it Like?', exploring Tudor andVictorian healthcare. During the sessionschildren could see unique items from the Wellcome Library collections (such as Louis Pasteur's notebooks from histime as a student in Paris) via a video link.They then had the opportunity to askquestions about the material and thesubject. This enabled them to get first- hand experience of historically significantobjects without needing to make a special trip. The Wellcome Trust contributed \u00a3750 000 to a project promoting open access to published scientific papers . Run by the Wellcome Library, the JointInformation Systems Committee and the US National Library of Medicine, the new project will digitise the full text of every issue of a number of importantmedical journals. Publications Talking Heads: Cognitive behaviouraltherapy comes of age , the latest Wellcome News Supplement , was published in June 2004. It featuredarticles exploring the latest thinking on cognitive behavioural therapy - and how it is being applied to a widerange of disorders, including depression,social phobia, post-traumatic stressdisorder, schizophrenia and borderlinepersonality disorder. An evaluation of The Human Genome microsite - which provides key information about the human genome -indicated that the site is a valuable andwidely used resource; it attractedaround 280 000 visitors in the year. A microsite was also developed toaccompany the Pain exhibition, providing articles on the science,medicine, culture and history of pain. An Advocacy and Training Interactive Guide was produced in 2004 for theSchistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI).The CD-ROM was produced incollaboration with the SCI at ImperialCollege, London, which is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.The CD-ROM delivers programme-oriented advocacy messages and training materials to those responsible for implementing the programme. A French translation of a Lymphatic Filariasis CD-ROM was published in August 2004. In the Topics in InternationalHealth series of CD-ROMs, a revisededition of HIV/AIDS was launched in November 2003.Grants A total of 41 Society Awards wereawarded under the \u00a33 million EngagingScience grants programme. These largeawards of \u00a350 000 or more supportpublic engagement 2003/04, 'broadening Awards under 'broadening access' theme included an award to Dr Guto Roberts to introduce biomedicalscience to the National Eisteddfod ofWales, the most important annual culturalfestival of Wales, and one to Dr CarolynStephens at the London School ofHygiene and Tropical Medicine, to seewhether children's participation inepidemiological research can stimulatean interest in medical science. Ten Research and Development Awards of up to \u00a315 000 were awarded underthe Sciart theme, as were four ProductionAwards of around \u00a3100 000: The Fluent Heart , an original music and dance work inspired by the cardiovascular system,created by composer Sir John Tavener,heart imaging specialist Dr Philip Kilnerand choreographer Wayne McGregor;Projected Worlds , an exhibition and events season at Camden Arts Centreexploring how scientific interventiontransforms our surroundings; How To Live, a live performance by Bobby Baker, inspired by her experience of dialectical behavioural therapy and created withpsychologist Professor Richard Hallam;and Tomorrow Belongs to Me , a series of filmed interviews with scientific and medical professionals researchinginherited genetic disorders, by artistJacqueline Donachie and geneticist Dr Darren Monckton. A notable award under the Young People's theme was for a project at theUniversity of Bristol, which will createyoung people's Research EthicsCommittees. School students willconsider real grant applications and feed back comments to the actualpanels considering the applications. A total of 31 People Awards - a fast- response mechanism to support smallerprojects - were also funded under theEngaging Science programme. In 2003, 27 awards were made through the Pulse initiative, which encouraged youth theatre and dance companies todevelop new performance arts projects to engage young people with science.The projects embraced a huge spectrumof themes, including the bioscience of light, neuroscience, cloning, eugenics,ageing and vaccination programmes. This year saw many performances based on projects funded through Pulse.In addition, a two-day conference at the University of Manchester (25-26June 2004) featured performances andenabled participants to share thoughtsabout their experiences. The initiative has been so successful that a secondcompetition is planned for 2005. Grants worth \u00a32.5 million were made by the Wellcome Trust through the \u00a333 million Rediscover initiative. This partnership with the MillenniumCommission and the Wolfson Foundationprovided funds for science centres andmuseums to redevelop their exhibits.Recipients of Trust funds included theCentre for Life in Newcastle upon Tyne,W5 at Odyssey, Belfast, Sensation inDundee and the Eden Project in Cornwall(see page 32). Public participation In September 2004 the Wellcome Trustand BBC Science launched the secondImagine photographic competition to encourage school groups, young peopleand adults to explore 'how is sciencechanging us?' The Wellcome Trust organised a series of online debates and public events with Spiked , an online publisher and discussion forum (www.spiked-online.com). The opening debate in theseries, 'Fearing the Unknown: Are wetoo risk averse?' risks. The seconddebate, 'Human Body Parts', focusedon issues around the Human Tissue Bill,including consent and the use of humantissue and organs in research. Debates were also organised with the Institute of Contemporary Arts . The first debate looked at privacy and questionsof how personal biomedical data are used; the second at the pathwayfrom research to the media. Exhibitions Pain: Passion, compassion, sensibilityran from 13 February to 20 June 2004 at the Medicine in Context Gallery at theScience Museum (see page 30). Toaccompany the exhibition, a public event,The Heartache of St Valentine's Day , was held at the Dana Centre on 11 February2004, while a series of films and debatesabout pain were organised at the Instituteof Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London. An innovative multimedia CD-ROM catalogue was produced for theexhibition, featuring a gallery of worksfrom the exhibition, audio and video clips,and specially commissioned essays.
