You are a businessman, role model, nonprofit leader, and celebrated, record-breaking athlete who has dedicated your boundless energy equally to your dual careers as a NFL dynamo and change-making philanthropist. Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, you grew up amid adverse circumstances that ultimately inspired your lifelong commitment to giving back to your community. You began your career in the National Football League with the New England Patriots, immediately making an impact on the league by earning the esteemed honor of Offensive Rookie of the Y ear in 1995. You played with the Patriots for three years before joining the New York Jets for the remainder of your outstanding 12-year career, serving as a reliable, consistent workhorse who made five Pro Bowl appearances and was one of only two players to rush for more than 1,000 yards in your first ten years. Later in your athletic career, you also became the oldest player to win a rushing title, at the age of 31, and retired as the fourth leading NFL rusher of all time. In recognition of your many on-the-field accomplishments, you were inducted into the Professional Football Hall of Fame in 2012. For all of your athletic talent, you are most recognized for your off-the-field accomplishments. Using football as your way to connect with others, you worked to better your community with the same driven intensity that you played with throughout your football career. Y ou founded the Curtis Martin Job Foundation, a non-profit organization for which you are sole financial supporter, by investing 12 to 15 percent of every paycheck you received during your NFL career and now 20 percent of your income to fund the foundation's endeavors. Through your foundation, you provide both financial and hands-on support to single mothers, children's charities, individuals with disabilities, and low-income housing providers, among other causes. The foundation has also funded Surgicorps International, a team of surgeons that performs medical procedures to individuals in developing countries free of charge; partnered with the Bloomberg administration to decrease homelessness in New York City; and funded scholarships for disadvantaged children. Awarding of Honorary Degrees 4Y our commitment to helping athletes (and the general weekend warrior) suffering from chronic pain has led to your working with Mount Sinai to develop a path towards a safe, non-addictive, non-opioid FDA pain medication. You are also the owner and co-owner of several businesses in the New York Metro area where you reside with your wife and two daughters and are currently pursuing ownership within the NFL. Curtis Martin, you always give your best, and you are a role model to many New Yorkers. For your commitment to leveraging your work ethic and natural ability to benefit the lives of others in your community, and for inspiring others to do the same, it is my privilege to confer upon you the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, Honoris Causa .

EVANS, PhD Department of Microbiology Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Essanna Gray joined the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) in 2013. She began her career at ISMMS in the Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) and continued her research and training in the Microbiology multidisciplinary training area of the PhD program in Biomedical Sciences at the GSBS. Essanna was a member of the Evans lab, where her research focused on understanding why the hepatitis C virus can only efficiently infect human and chimpanzee cells. Her ultimate goal was to determine the host factors that limit infection in nonprimate animals, and evolve the virus to overcome these blocks to establish a new small animal model to study hepatitis C virus pathogenesis and develop vaccines. She was revered as not only a brilliant researcher but a mentor to her peers. In honoring her research and academic accomplishments, the GSBS posthumously awarded the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biomedical Sciences to Essanna Gray at the Memorial of Essanna Gray: Celebration of Life at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai on January 29, 2019. 23Candidates for Degrees Hooded By AIYA ABOUBAKR MONICA KATHERINE AMOO-ACHAMPONG BRITTANY ARDITI ^ ALAINA ARISTIDE MINA AZIZ CHRISTINA MARIE BECK EVA ELAINE BERLIN CAROLINE WILEY BEYER KHAWAJA HASAN BILAL STEPHEN PHILLIP BOHLMAN** BENJAMIN BOODAIE ADAM JEFFREY BOSSERT ANDREW MICHAEL BREGLIO RACHEL SAMANTHA BRONHEIM ELIZABETH E.

MUELLER JOAN SARNOFF EDIE SCHURList as of April 19, 2019 45Oath for Doctoral Candidates With my Doctor of Philosophy, I willingly pledge to uphold the highest levels of integrity, professionalism, scholarship and honor. I will conduct my research and professional endeavors with honesty and objectivity. I will apply the highest standards of rigor and respect for the generation and application of knowledge, and fully acknowledge the contributions of others. I will not allow financial gain or ambition to cloud my judgment or decision-making nor cause harm to society or subjects of research. I will embark on the furthering of knowledge through respectful interaction and collaboration with my colleagues and community, without prejudice or exclusion. I will be a role model, and use my skills to inspire, mentor and empower future generations, instilling in them the highest principles of ethical behavior. As witnessed by all present today, and in the tradition of Graduates before me, I do affirm to uphold these guiding principles. 4646Oath for Doctoral Candidates As written and selected by the Icahn School of Medicine Class of 2019 I acknowledge all those who have helped me in my path to this day and recognize the enormous privilege of my medical education. I will always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling. Grant me the strength, time and opportunity always to correct what I have acquired and to advance medicine through the study and conduct of scientific inquiry. I will remain a life-long learner and challenge myself to grow personally and professionally. I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science. I will treat each patient with dignity and compassion as a human being\u2014respecting their autonomy, beliefs, and culture. I will not be ashamed to say \"I don't know,\" nor will I fail to call on my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient's recovery. I will respect the privacy of my patients. I will remember that I do not treat disease but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, f I am to care adequately for the sick. I will serve as an advocate for social justice and human rights\u2014challenging our profession's role in systemic inequality and promoting wellness for all. I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure. I pledge to remember each day why I chose to become a physician\u2014to keep this oath as a reminder of my initial motivation and ongoing commitment. Oath for Medical Degree Candidates 47Oath for Faculty The mission of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is to produce physicians and scientists who are prepared to enter society as informed advocates and activists who are able to advance clinical care and science and promote change. We, the faculty, seek to embody this mission and so pledge the following to you, our students, in our effort to help you to become the best possible physicians and your best possible selves: T o serve as models for caring, competent, and unbiased care of our patients. T o engage you in the joy and privilege of practicing the art and science of medicine and the rewards of learning for life. T o uphold the highest standards in scientific and medical research. T o inspire you to respect the art and science of medicine, but also to question the status quo. T o recognize that our opportunity to teach is also our opportunity to learn. T o not just teach, but also nurture. T o share of both our craft and ourselves. T o demonstrate that self-examination means as much as examinations. T o be kind in evaluating you and ourselves. T o never lose sight of our wellness and the wellness of all of those around us. T o have the courage to stand up for the oppressed and vulnerable and against prejudice and racism in all that we do. T o be aware of our own biases and those around us and strive to eliminate them. T o meet you where you are and get you where you want to be. And, finally, to never forget as physicians, scientists, and educators what we know as human beings. 48Academic Regalia Oath for Faculty The caps and gowns worn by the participants in today's Commencement exercises are patterned after the attire of scholars in the Middle Ages, when a warm gown and hood were needed for study in unheated buildings. While European institutions continue to show great diversity in their academic costume, an Intercollegiate Commission met in 1895 to standardize the style and color for robes and hoods to be worn at colleges and universities of the United States. Since then the costume code has been revised and clarified several times by the American Council on Education, most recently in 1986. The governing force, however, is tradition tracing back to the academic symbols of the Middle Ages. Black gowns were originally recommended for all degrees at all institutions, with the style of the gown denoting the degree: pointed sleeves for Bachelor's, long closed sleeves for Master's, and full, round sleeves for the Doctor's degrees. In addition, the Doctor's gown was to be faced in black velvet down the front and with three bars of the same velvet across the sleeves. Some universities have begun to adopt more colorful robes. The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai robe is blue; other colors currently in use are violet for New York University, slate gray for Columbia, crimson for Harvard, blue for Yale. Much information is represented by the colors of hoods worn by holders of doctoral and master's degrees. The colors of the interior lining of the hood are those of the institution from which the degree was earned. The hood is bordered in velvet in a color that signifies the discipline of the degree: In the case of the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree, the dark blue color is used to represent the mastery of the discipline of learning and scholarship in any field and is not intended to solely represent the field of philosophy. Members of the Board of Trustees at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai wear a specially designed costume.
