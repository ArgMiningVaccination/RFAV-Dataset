It utilizes very thin, flexible, sterile, single use needles that are inserted into the body to help bring it back to a harmonious state in order for the body to begin healing itself. The needles facilitate the movement of Qi and blood throughout the body to allow for this healing to begin. Qi is a vital substance in the body that is involved in all physiological processes in the body and is essential for life. When Qi and blood do not flow and become blocked, that is when disease and pain can occur. Below is a small list of some but not all of the things that acupuncture can help with: - Musculoskeletal disorders - Digestive disorders - Autoimmune disorders - Reproductive disorders - Pain - Chronic or acute The first treatment will involve a thorough interview to help understand what is truly causing the symptoms that the patient is experiencing and what the best way to treat them would be. Then, the very fine, sterile, single use needles will be carefully inserted into the body and you will rest for about 15 to 30 minutes. Almost all patients regardless of their primary complaint will experience relaxation, increased quality of sleep, improved digestion, and overall pain reduction following acupuncture treatment. Our mission is to provide the highest quality patient care with the use of Traditional Chinese Medicine to help with pain relief and wellness. Dan focuses on acupuncture, tui na, and other modalities to meet the specific needs of our patients. He will take the time to actively listen to our patients and to help guide them to attain their health goals. We strive to provide our patients with a very safe, comfortable experience to help encourage the harmony of their mind, body, and spirit. Acupuncture Acupuncture is a technique that uses very fine, sterile, single use needles that are inserted into specific points on the body that help to regulate and promote the body's abilities of naturally healing itself. Dan is trained to have quick, smooth, and gentle insertion techniques in order to provide the greatest comfort possible for the patient. Once the needles are inserted, you may feel sensations of warmth, spreading, or a heavy sensation. Dan will be in complete communication with you to make sure that you have a comfortable and relaxing treatment. Tui Na Tui Na is a type of Chinese medical massage that is often used for the treatment of superficial trauma and musculoskeletal pain. This massage helps to remove blockages in the muscles and to help promote the free flow of blood and qi to bring the body back to a balanced state. Cupping Cupping is a modality that uses glass or silicone cups that are suctioned onto the skin to help improve local circulation, helps with poor lymphatic flow and also helps move stagnations that can be causing pain. Cupping can also be used for treating asthma, headaches, the common cold, and many more diseases. Dan utilizes both stationary cupping and slide cupping to best fit the needs of the patient. Slide cupping is a technique that is used with the addition of a lubricant on the skin so that the cup can be slid around on the body to allow for a much larger area of effect. Gua Sha Gua Sha is a soft tissue scraping technique that uses a blunt object to break up adhesions in the fascia and connective tissues in the body to relieve pain. These adhesions can cause an obstruction in the free flow of qi and blood, which can cause pain. Moxibustion Moxibustion is a heat therapy that uses a method of burning a non-toxic herb known as mugwort over specific acupuncture points or painful areas on the body to warm and invigorate those areas to alleviate symptoms. This modality can help regulate the digestive system, boost your immunity, alleviate pain, and much more. Dietary Therapy We will have you fill out a diet log that will then be analyzed to make suggestions on how certain changes could possibly be beneficial for you. Dietary therapy does not have to strictly be about losing weight. It can also help with particular food sensitivities or to improve your digestion to help you feel better after eating. Food is medicine and our diets are important for optimizing our health. Qi Gong Qi Gong is a type of energy work that helps to course qi and blood throughout the body to eliminate blockages and boost the energy in the body. This can be accomplished through different exercises that incorporate both internal and external movements that are repeated in order to promote blood flow, mental clarity, emotional stability, and much more. These exercises may be taught to you so that you can perform them outside of the office to help enhance the acupuncture treatment and also to teach you how to keep your mind and body balanced.
