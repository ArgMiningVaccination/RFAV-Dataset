These pills are amazing are easy to swallow and the effect on indigestion is incomparable to any OTC product I've tried. Sharon As a person with frequent heartburn, this is a great product. I cut back on taking over the counter medicine and replaced with Aci-balance. When my acid reflux is bad, I take two everyday for a week or so and it clears it up. When I have eaten something that causes heartburn I take one or two and it helps as well as over the counter products did. I highly recommend aci-balance! Margaret S I have been using Aci-Balance for many, many years. I am 78 years old and occasionally have indigestion. I always make sure I have Aci-Balance in my medicine closet - always. And it never fails to relieve my symptoms and give me a good night's sleep. These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
