In this review, we give a comprehensive overview of determinants\u2014based on the integrated change model\u2014predicting vaccination uptake in these groups. In travellers, low perceived risk of infection and low awareness of vaccination recommendations contributed to low uptake. Additionally, ICP were often unaware of the recommended vaccinations. A physician's recommendation is strongly correlated with higher uptake. Furthermore, ICP appeared to be mainly concerned about the risks of vaccination and fear of deterioration of their underlying disease. For HCW, perceived risk of (the severity of) infection for themselves and for their patients together with perceived benefits of vaccination contribute most to their vaccination behaviour. As the determinants that affect uptake are numerous and diverse, we argue that future studies and interventions should be based on multifactorial health behaviour models, especially for travellers and ICP as only a limited number of such studies is available yet.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-08-27", "cleaned_text": "Populations: A Comprehensive Literature Review [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8030480](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8030480) [Vaccination Coverage, Efficacy and Attitude in Targeted Risk Groups]( /journal/vaccines/special_issues/vaccination_efficacy )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-08-00480)]. The first one is the need for fast development of effective and safe vaccines for new (re-)emerging pathogens. The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an example in which a vaccination is highly desired and may reduce the enormous impact of the current pandemic. The second challenge in the field of vaccinology is the upcoming trend of vaccine hesitancy and declining vaccination uptake. [2](#B2-vaccines-08-00480)]. Vaccination uptake is declining globally, resulting in a rise in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD) [ [3](#B3-vaccines-08-00480)]. For instance, measles cases have increased\u2014up to 300 percent\u2014over the past years [ [4](#B4-vaccines-08-00480)]. Vaccine hesitancy has predominantly received attention in the light of parents rejecting the national immunization programs. However, low vaccination uptake among adult populations also raises concerns [ [5](#B5-vaccines-08-00480)]. Adults are progressively at risk for infectious diseases because life expectancy increases [ [6](#B6-vaccines-08-00480)], the incidence of chronic diseases that require immunosuppressive treatment rises [ [7](#B7-vaccines-08-00480)], and international travel expands [ [8](#B8-vaccines-08-00480)]. Other determinants will play a role in vaccination uptake in adult populations as compared to children. [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00480)]. [7](#B7-vaccines-08-00480)]. Therefore, optimal protection of this vulnerable group is of utmost importance. [10](#B10-vaccines-08-00480)]. On top of that, HCW play an important role in providing their (immunocompromised or travelling) patients with information or recommendations regarding vaccinations. [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00480)]. In 2003, the integrated change (I-Change) model was developed by de Vries et al. [ [12](#B12-vaccines-08-00480)]. This model is derived from the attitude-social norm-self-efficacy (ASE) model and integrates several other models, among which are the often-used health belief model (HBM) and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) ( [Supplementary Table S1](#app1-vaccines-08-00480)). According to the I-Change model, vaccination behaviour is shaped by the intention to get vaccinated which is subject to barriers and facilitators. Intention is established by motivation, awareness, information, and predisposing determinants. As this I-Change model comprises a wide variety of determinants that are used by other studies, for example those based on the HBM and ASE model, we use this model as a conceptual framework. 2. Methods 2.1. Search Strategy [Supplementary File S1](#app1-vaccines-08-00480)). For each risk groups we combined search terms for vaccination uptake and health behavioural models. We searched the following databases: Embase, Medline, Cinahl, Web of Science Core Collection, ERIC, PsychINFO, and SocINDEX. As determinants of vaccination uptake may vary over time, we limited our search to studies published during the last ten years (between 1 January 2010 and 1 January 2020). We excluded research papers written in another language than English. All records were retrieved into an EndNote database. Duplicates were removed and titles and abstracts were screened (by LD). Thereafter, papers were sorted in the three different groups and full texts articles were reviewed for suitability using inclusion and exclusion criteria (by L.D. and L.v.L.) using EndNote X9. 2.2. Study Selection 2.3. Data Extraction [13](#B13-vaccines-08-00480)], which is a screening tool specifically designed for cross-sectional studies, as those in our review, and includes 20 items relevant to this design. Scores 1-9 are rates as low, 10-14 as medium and 15-20 as high. 2.4. Labelling of Determinants [Figure 1](#vaccines-08-00480-f001). The following concepts are used: (1) predisposing factors, including baseline characteristics of studied populations; (2) information factors, including information retrieved via media, social contacts and HCW; (3) awareness, of the infectious agent being present or a vaccine being available; (4) knowledge (either examined or self-evaluated), about the consequences of the infection, or about the efficacy and duration of protection of vaccination; (5a) perceived risk of the infection, which is divided into perceived severity of the disease and perceived susceptibility to get infected; (5b) perceived risk of vaccination, including vaccine-specific considerations such as fear of side-effects and trust in the effectiveness of the vaccine; (6) attitude, defined as a person's disposition to respond favourably or unfavourably to vaccinations [ [14](#B14-vaccines-08-00480)], often reflected by a person's general believes about vaccinations; (7) social influence, which can be social norms imposed by family, friends or religion, but also recommendations from a healthcare professional or tour guide; (8) self-efficacy, defined as beliefs in one's own capacity to perform certain behaviour [ [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00480)]; (9) intention to behaviour, expressed by people before they perform the behaviour; (10) barriers and facilitators, that withhold individuals from or enable them to certain behaviour, such as time, costs, or accessibility. 3. Results [Figure 2](#vaccines-08-00480-f002)). After removing duplicates and excluding articles published before 2010, 1260 articles were available on the topic. These were screened based on title and abstract, resulting in 242 articles that were eligible for full-text assessment. These were divided into the three subgroups (some were included in more than one category): 30 for travellers, 95 for ICP, and 122 for HCW. Finally, 17, 29, and 44 articles were included in the data analysis for the three groups, respectively. The most common reason for exclusion was that no determinants (other than predisposing factors) were reported. [Table 1](#vaccines-08-00480-t001)describes the characteristics and quality of included studies for travellers, ICP, and HCW. Determinants that play a role in vaccination uptake were retrieved from the articles and summarized in [Table 2](#vaccines-08-00480-t002), [Table 3](#vaccines-08-00480-t003)and [Table 4](#vaccines-08-00480-t004)for travellers, ICP, and HCW respectively. The results of the quality assessment are presented in [Supplementary Table S2](#app1-vaccines-08-00480). 3.1. Vaccination Uptake Among Travellers [Table 1](#vaccines-08-00480-t001)). Travellers that were studied originated from the USA (6 studies), Australia (4 studies), Europe (5 studies), or mixed continents (2 studies). Sample sizes ranged from 55 to 27,386 and comprised Hajj pilgrims in three studies, travellers to Africa in two studies and to Asia in two studies. Other studies had broader inclusion criteria. Three studies used KAP (knowledge-attitude-practices) surveys and one study mentioned a health behavioural model (theory of planned behaviour) as theoretical background for their study. 3.1.1. Predisposing Factors [Table 2](#vaccines-08-00480-t002)). The vaccinations that were studied were diverse, most papers discussed vaccinations for influenza (n = 7), hepatitis B virus (HBV) (n = 6), hepatitis A virus (HAV) (n = 5) and meningococcal disease (n = 5). Regarding age, three papers reported that younger people had a higher uptake [ [18](#B18-vaccines-08-00480), [20](#B20-vaccines-08-00480), [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00480)]. However, for influenza vaccination this was the opposite: older travellers were more likely to be vaccinated for seasonal influenza [ [27](#B27-vaccines-08-00480), [32](#B32-vaccines-08-00480)]. Gender was not a significant predictor of vaccination uptake in any of the studies. Education level was studied by three papers [ [18](#B18-vaccines-08-00480), [27](#B27-vaccines-08-00480), [31](#B31-vaccines-08-00480)]. Two found this determinant to be positively associated with (intention to) obtaining recommended vaccinations [ [28](#B28-vaccines-08-00480), [31](#B31-vaccines-08-00480)]. Seven studies reported travel purpose in relation to vaccination uptake, but the results were diverse. One study concluded vaccination uptake was highest if the reason of travelling was business or backpacking [ [20](#B20-vaccines-08-00480)]. However, work-related travel was associated with lower uptake in another study (OR = 0.39, (0.17-0.92)) [ [27](#B27-vaccines-08-00480)]. Travellers visiting friends and relatives (VFR) had a lower uptake in two studies [ [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00480), [29](#B29-vaccines-08-00480)], but two other studies found no association [ [20](#B20-vaccines-08-00480), [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00480)]. Six papers studied the relation between travel duration and vaccination uptake. Two studies showed that uptake was significantly lower when people travelled longer [ [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00480), [28](#B28-vaccines-08-00480)], while one found that it was higher (for rabies only) [ [29](#B29-vaccines-08-00480)] and three studies found no difference [ [19](#B19-vaccines-08-00480), [20](#B20-vaccines-08-00480), [27](#B27-vaccines-08-00480)]. 3.1.2. Information Factors 3.1.3. Cognitive Determinants [16](#B16-vaccines-08-00480)], and another five reported this factor to play a role in the majority of the study population. Although not often tested for significance, \"not feeling at risk of the disease\" was a common explanation of a lot of travellers for not receiving the recommended vaccinations. Perceived risk of vaccination was sparsely discussed (n = 4). [19](#B19-vaccines-08-00480), [31](#B31-vaccines-08-00480)]; reliance on natural immunity was mentioned three times as a reason to reject vaccination [ [17](#B17-vaccines-08-00480), [23](#B23-vaccines-08-00480), [30](#B30-vaccines-08-00480)]. Awareness was also discussed in six papers; although it was not tested for significance, 13-73% mentioned unawareness of the availability of the vaccination (or unawareness of the recommendation of the vaccination) as an important reason for non-uptake [ paper described that 3-24% of travellers require a reminder to complete their vaccination series [ [22](#B22-vaccines-08-00480)]. 3.2. Vaccination Uptake among Immunocompromised Patients [Table 1](#vaccines-08-00480-t001)). Studies were performed among European (n = 23), American (n = 3) and Canadian (n = 3) populations. Sixteen studies involved patients with auto-immune diseases, of which four studies focussed completely on patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The vaccination uptake of HIV patients was studied in three papers. Four papers studied populations with solid tumours, six papers studied patients who received haematological stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and three papers investigated patients who received a solid organ transplantation (SOT). Almost all papers addressed the influenza vaccination uptake (n = 25) and many also included the uptake of pneumococcal vaccinations (n = 13). Influenza vaccination rates varied from 6-79% and pneumococcal vaccination rates from 2-54%. Lowest rates were reported in Polish inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients [ [60](#B60-vaccines-08-00480)] and highest in American rheumatic patients [ [55](#B55-vaccines-08-00480)]. In ICP, health behaviour models were cited slightly more than in the travellers population. Two studies were based on the (HBM) and another three studies used KAP surveys. 3.2.1. Predisposing Factors [Table 3](#vaccines-08-00480-t003)). Especially for influenza vaccination, older patients tend to be more compliant with vaccination guidelines in the studied year. Only in one study a negative association was found (OR 0.02, 95% CI (0.01-0.57)) [ [46](#B46-vaccines-08-00480)]. Most studies report that gender and education level are not significant predictors of vaccination uptake in ICP, with a few exceptions. Three studies showed in a multivariate analysis that males had a higher uptake. Two studies showed a negative association between uptake and education level, while one showed a positive association. In five studies, the use of strong immunosuppressive medication was positively associated with vaccination uptake, whereas in two studies the association was negative and in three there was no association. Generally, ICP with comorbidities in their medical history tend to have a higher uptake in four [ [38](#B38-vaccines-08-00480), [39](#B39-vaccines-08-00480), [42](#B42-vaccines-08-00480), [54](#B54-vaccines-08-00480)] out of seven studies. One study reported a negative association [ [42](#B42-vaccines-08-00480)] and two found no significant difference [ [33](#B33-vaccines-08-00480), [52](#B52-vaccines-08-00480)]. All five papers that included vaccination history (for the same or another vaccination), concluded that there was a positive association between vaccination uptake in the past and current uptake [ [34](#B34-vaccines-08-00480), [43](#B43-vaccines-08-00480), [44](#B44-vaccines-08-00480)]. Perceived risk of infection was mentioned equally often as attitude (n = 14) and was also positively associated with uptake, in two of the four studies that tested for significance [ [46](#B46-vaccines-08-00480), [59](#B59-vaccines-08-00480)]. [56](#B56-vaccines-08-00480)], while another reported that patients who find it easier to attend a GP for vaccination, have a higher intention to get vaccinated (p < 0.001) [ [46](#B46-vaccines-08-00480)]. Regarding intention to behaviour, one high-quality study expressed that 80% of their IBD study population expressed to be willing to receive all of the recommended vaccinations, while only 9% had ever received a pneumococcal vaccination and only 28% was vaccinated against influenza at the time of participation in the study [ [58](#B58-vaccines-08-00480)]. In another study with 17% influenza and 4% pneumococcal vaccination uptake, the intention to be vaccinated next year was also high and not significantly different between the vaccinated (89%) and unvaccinated group (80%) [ [59](#B59-vaccines-08-00480)]. 3.2.4. Barriers and Facilitators [36](#B36-vaccines-08-00480)]. Lack of time (n = 2) and the inconvenience of another appointment (n = 4) were more often given as reasons for declining vaccination. 3.3. Vaccination Uptake among Healthcare Workers [63](#B63-vaccines-08-00480)] to 97% (mandatory policy) [ [96](#B96-vaccines-08-00480)]. Most studies were conducted in Italy (n = 8), followed by France (n = 5) and the USA (n = 5). All but one were designed as cross-sectional surveys, with sample sizes ranging from 77 [ [76](#B76-vaccines-08-00480)] to 32,808 [ [91](#B91-vaccines-08-00480)]. Seven studies mentioned the use of a theoretical model for their study, which includes the HBM [ [88](#B88-vaccines-08-00480)], the TPB [ [89](#B89-vaccines-08-00480)], the risk perception attitude framework [ [93](#B93-vaccines-08-00480)], the Triandis model of interpersonal behaviour [ [81](#B81-vaccines-08-00480)], the cognitive model of empowerment [ [99](#B99-vaccines-08-00480)] or mixtures the 30 articles that studied age, 22 found that older healthcare workers had a significantly higher uptake. On the other hand, in the case of hepatitis B [ [84](#B84-vaccines-08-00480), [95](#B95-vaccines-08-00480)] and measles [ [78](#B78-vaccines-08-00480), [82](#B82-vaccines-08-00480)], younger HCW's had higher compliance. In the 27 papers that studied gender, being male was associated with higher vaccination uptake in 13 studies. Five papers mentioned a significantly higher uptake in women, one for rubella only [ [97](#B97-vaccines-08-00480)], and another for hepatitis B only [ [82](#B82-vaccines-08-00480)]. Occupation was studied in relation to vaccination uptake in 18 articles. Sixteen papers showed that physicians had a significantly higher uptake than other HCW. This also complies with the significant positive association between education level and uptake that was found in five papers. Presence of a chronic disease resulted in significantly higher uptake in seven studies. In three other studies investigating this factor, no association was found. Having children at home was studied in nine papers, but six found no significant role for this factor in vaccination uptake. Good vaccine compliance in the past turned out to be an excellent predictor of uptake in all 11 studies investigating this factor. 3.3.2. Information Factors [63](#B63-vaccines-08-00480), [92](#B92-vaccines-08-00480)]. Only one study found that gaining information from colleagues was associated with a higher uptake [ [78](#B78-vaccines-08-00480)]. 3.3.3. Cognitive Determinants [66](#B66-vaccines-08-00480)], but the others showed either a significant (n = 8) or considerable (n = 6) positive relation with vaccination uptake. Specific for HCW are the social arguments 'I got vaccinated because it's my duty as an HCW' or 'as an HCW, I have a role in the prevention of epidemics/spread of diseases', that we collected under the term 'professional norms'. This determinant was positively associated with uptake in all 15 studies focusing on this factor; in seven out of 11 studies that tested for significance, this factor remained a strong predictor for uptake in multivariate analysis. 3.3.4. Barriers and Facilitators [62](#B62-vaccines-08-00480), [67](#B67-vaccines-08-00480)]. On the other hand, facilitators stimulating uptake were getting a reminder (n = 3), convenient time/place of distribution (n = 4), and getting a reward (n = 3). However, in none of the studies were the potential rewards specified. 4. Discussion and Conclusions [107](#B107-vaccines-08-00480)]. Indeed, more side-effects are reported by females, while on the other hand, from a biological perspective, females typically mount higher antibody responses [ [107](#B107-vaccines-08-00480)]. Although we did not find a clear relationship between education level and vaccination uptake in the risk groups, in HCW the uptake was markedly higher in physicians compared to other HCW. Overall, vaccination history seems to be an excellent universal predictor of future vaccination uptake, probably due to unaltered cognitive determinants. [52](#B52-vaccines-08-00480)] and 187 [ [44](#B44-vaccines-08-00480)]), underline the importance of positive attitudes towards vaccination in improving education alone will probably not be sufficient to increase uptake. In all groups, the perceived susceptibility and severity of diseases on one hand and the perceived effectiveness and risks of vaccinations on the other hand are important determinants predicting uptake. Especially ICP and HCW express concerns about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines particularly for influenza vaccination [ [38](#B38-vaccines-08-00480), [44](#B44-vaccines-08-00480)]. And although the effectiveness of influenza vaccination varies with the coverage of circulating strains each year, another part of the perceived lack of effectiveness could also be explained by the lack of protection for other common cold viruses that can cause influenza-like symptoms [ [109](#B109-vaccines-08-00480)]. Travelers seem to have low risk perceptions for the diseases they could be vaccinated for as well as for the potential negative effects of vaccination. Despite the high morbidity and mortality of some VPD such as yellow fever, hepatitis B, and influenza, in all risk groups, some participants stated they preferred natural immunization or were against vaccinations in general. Remarkably, attitudes differ for specific vaccinations, for instance, people tend to have a more positive attitude towards pneumococcal vaccination in comparison to the seasonal influenza vaccination [ [55](#B55-vaccines-08-00480)]. Interestingly, the mistrust of ICP and HCW towards the vaccinations produced by the pharmaceutical industry seems disproportionate to therapeutics manufactured by the same pharmaceutical companies [ [40](#B40-vaccines-08-00480), [50](#B50-vaccines-08-00480), [72](#B72-vaccines-08-00480), [78](#B78-vaccines-08-00480)]. Here, the difference between prevention and treatment might play a role, where the latter provides a more direct and visible effect. Another possible reason for the negative general attitude towards vaccination, also described in decision making for childhood vaccinations [ [110](#B110-vaccines-08-00480)], is the increasing tendency for self-empowerment towards personal health decisions. In this view, individuals stand up against imposed policies and want to make their own decisions, which could also be judged by peers as independent and smart decision making [ [110](#B110-vaccines-08-00480), [111](#B111-vaccines-08-00480)]. At the same time, sources that are being used to make personal health decisions, such as the internet, contain a lot of negative stories [ [112](#B112-vaccines-08-00480)]. [73](#B73-vaccines-08-00480)]. They do not only experience lack of time to get vaccinated, they also feel that lack of time impedes their duty to recommend vaccinations to their patients [ [113](#B113-vaccines-08-00480)]. Again, as HCW recommendations are strongly positively associated with uptake, not only in the other risk groups, but also for HCW themselves (by colleagues for example) [ [66](#B66-vaccines-08-00480), [80](#B80-vaccines-08-00480)], removing this barrier can result in achieving optimal care for all groups. [46](#B46-vaccines-08-00480), [64](#B64-vaccines-08-00480), [79](#B79-vaccines-08-00480), [93](#B93-vaccines-08-00480), [99](#B99-vaccines-08-00480)]. Interventions that focus on a single determinant, such as knowledge, repeatedly proved to be ineffective in the past [ [66](#B66-vaccines-08-00480)], while multifactorial cognitive intervention strategies are effective to improve uptake [ [114](#B114-vaccines-08-00480), [115](#B115-vaccines-08-00480)]. Therefore, all determinants that play a role have to be taken into account. Predisposing factors could be used to target specific subgroups and personalize uptake strategies [ [93](#B93-vaccines-08-00480)]. Facilitators and barriers could be added or taken away to increase vaccination uptake. But, most importantly, interventions need to address cognitive determinants. Interventions that increase awareness and risk perception of infectious diseases are more effective than those decreasing risk perceptions of vaccination by providing scientific information [ [116](#B116-vaccines-08-00480)]. Social norms can be influenced in the case of hierarchical relationships, for instance, the employer will have an effect on the vaccination decision of HCW and HCW will impact ICP's decisions. Therefore, multifactorial interventions are needed that address the most important cognitive determinants. As these include awareness and risk perceptions, reminders and incidence data could help. Reminders for travellers could be disseminated in general media before holidays, while for ICP patient associations and HCW could play a role. To improve risk perceptions for the infections, cases of vaccine-preventable diseases should be made public. To decrease risk perceptions of negative effects of vaccinations (e.g., adverse events) new studies should compare the number of influenza-like illnesses in vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups. Furthermore, social norms can be included by making the decisions of vaccination uptake public. For example, in HCW trials have been implemented to test the effects of providing a pin that vaccinated HCW may wear that is saying \"deliberately vaccinated\", which could affect both colleagues and patients [ [117](#B117-vaccines-08-00480)].
