Used in China for several thousand years to treat humans and animals, acupuncture involves inserting very fine sterile needles at specific points to relieve pain and improve circulation. The needles are manipulated manually or by electrical stimulation. Illnesses can be caused or perpetuated by abnormal circulation, whether too much or too little. Acupuncture normalizes this blood flow to stop disease. It is one of the key components of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). According to the traditional Chinese medicine approach, stimulating specific acupuncture points corrects imbalances in the flow of qi (life force) through 14 invisible channels known as meridians. The meridians run deep within the body's tissues and organs, surfacing at some 360 places identified as acupuncture points. Stimulating these points is said to balance and restore the flow of qi. Traditional therapies and holistic therapies like acupuncture are often complementary to one another. During your pet's exam and consultation, the doctor will consider your pet's overall wellness and all therapies that may be integrated with acupuncture to provide optimal healing. What does it treat? Acupuncture treats many conditions, including the following: - Allergies - Back pain - Chronic and acute kidney disease - Constipation - Degenerative joint disease/arthritis/hip dysplasia - Incontinence - Limping - Vomiting/diarrhea - Torn Cruciate Ligaments What should you expect with regard to treatments? Comprehensive acupuncture treatment involves a thorough history of your pet and physical examination, followed by a patient assessment and formulation of a treatment plan. It usually involves multiple visits. One of our veterinarians will discuss a treatment plan with you regarding your pet and his/her specific health needs. Bloodwork and x-rays are needed to determine health issues that may affect treatment. The consultation includes the exam and first acupuncture treatment and takes about an hour. Subsequent treatments are normally done in 30-minute appointments. If acupuncture is combined with other treatments, the visit usually takes longer. The logistics of combined treatments are addressed on a case-by-case basis. A progress assessment exam is usually done at each visit. Results vary with each patient. Typically, a patient will come for 6 visits, 1 to 2 weeks apart, followed by a re-evaluation of the treatment schedule. What's Needed for your First Visit?
