Traditional talk therapy and somatic-based practices are combined in order to heal the entire person: the mind, the body and the spirit. Mind-body therapy incorporates the analysis of one's life history, thoughts, emotions, and behaviors with an integration of embodiment practices. Our bodies hold memories, emotions, and sensations that are useful for us to understand and create space for our nervous systems to regulate. The combination of yoga and mindfulness often leads to changes in the brain, alters thinking, balances emotions, opens sensory experiencing, and fosters awareness. As a result, clients unlock areas where trauma and shame are held, gain more clarity and creativity to live the life they want to live, and return to their authentic selves. Release (trauma). Learn (techniques). Connect (to bodily wisdom).
