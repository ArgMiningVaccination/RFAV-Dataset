The College of Arts and Sciences Bulletin is a resource and roadmap that provides students with the information they need to make the most of their undergraduate education and to graduate from the College in a timely manner with a broad-based liberal arts degree. It is the official source of information regarding degree requirements, rules and regulations, programs of study, courses, and opportunities within and outside of individual departments and programs. Students pursuing degrees in other schools on the Bloomington campus should consult the IU Bloomington Bulletins website to find the appropriate bulletin that covers their degree program. Students will also find much useful information listed on the College website and the websites of individual departments and programs. Which Bulletin or Supplement Should You Use? Students follow the requirements included in the Bulletin and Supplement published in the year they first enrolled (matriculated) as a degree-seeking student at Indiana University (any campus). For instance, a new freshman beginning at IUB in the summer or fall of 2015 will be held to the requirements laid out in the 2015-2016 Bulletin of the College of Arts and Sciences . For questions regarding which Bulletin or Supplement to use, please consult the College Recorder's Office, (812) 855-1821 or coasrecd@indiana.edu . The requirements outlined in the Bulletin or Supplement in effect at the time of your matriculation will remain constant throughout your time in the College, assuming you graduate within eight years. **College of Arts and Sciences Bulletins were formerly printed on paper in an alternating two-year cycle of full-length Bulletins and abbreviated Supplements. Supplements listed only the policy, course, and requirement changes that occurred in the alternate year in a two-year cycle and did not reprint the information that was unchanged since the publication of the last full- length Bulletin. Students had to consult both the Bulletin and Supplement to access complete information. Since 2010 the College has moved to a yearly Bulletin cycle, and the official version is published once a year, online, in the months of May or June. Although the Bulletin is no longer printed, the online version includes PDF print functionality. The College of Arts and Sciences The College of Arts and Sciences With a tradition of excellence in the liberal arts and sciences stretching back to the founding of Indiana University in 1820, the College of Arts and Sciences offers more than 90 baccalaureate majors leading to the Bachelor of Arts, the Bachelor of Science, the Bachelor of Arts in Journalism, the Bachelor of Fine Arts and the Bachelor of Liberal Studies degrees. In addition to educating our majors, the College also provides asignificant portion of the campus-wide General Education courses. At the heart of the College's tradition is excellence in teaching based on excellence in research. College faculty, who are at the forefront of their disciplines, teach at all levels of the curriculum, from freshman through senior and graduate courses. Although the content of courses has changed as society has changed and knowledge has developed, the College faculty has always sought to provide students with specialized knowledge in a major field of study that is enriched by a broad liberal arts education. For over 190 years, the mission of the faculty has been to provide students with the knowledge, skills, and perspectives to help them develop an understanding of themselves and the world around them through a combination of specialized and general study. Because of the richness and diversity of its more than 90 majors, the College offers students a variety of advising services to help them take full advantage of their opportunities at Indiana University. Academic advisors in each department in the College are eager to help students understand the special requirements and options of the department, and are also happy to discuss general degree requirements and the best options for their completion. Finally, Career Advisors in Arts and Sciences Career Services help students understand how to combine their liberal arts education and their career goals in satisfying employment. The College Undergraduate Recorder's Office is available throughout a student's career to answer questions about academic records, policies, and procedures\u2014by email ( coasrecd@indiana.edu ), by phone (812-855-1821), or in person in Owen Hall 003. Academic assistant deans in the College can answer specific questions or talk with students about their goals. Liberal Learning at IU A liberal arts education begins with the premise that one's world and one's self are worth knowing. To understand our world, we must know something about its physical, biological, cognitive, social, cultural, and spiritual dimensions. The liberal arts provide these perspectives on knowledge to serve as the basis for a full and effective professional and personal life. No better preparation for success in the professions exists than a strong liberal arts education, and our experience demonstrates that the liberal arts help develop the rigor of mind needed for advanced study in any field and for the pursuit of a richer life through the enlargement of mind and spirit. By its very name, a liberal arts education suggests that broadness of study is a primary concern. It inspires openness and breadth of mind, regard for values unlike our own, and respect for the creative processes of diverse disciplines. The liberal arts emphasize cultural, social, and biological change and assess the impact of technological progress on the world's environment. They generate appreciation and understanding of many societies' past accomplishments and provide the basis for future insight and enterprise.2 September 16, 2015 The liberal arts education of the College of Arts and Sciences provides the fundamental knowledge, skills, and experience essential for a full, rich, and rewarding life. Such an education taps many of the capacities that we as human beings possess. It offers us fuller lives, in understanding and expressing ourselves and in relating to others. The arts and sciences are pre-professional in the best sense. They serve as a foundation for many professions, many ways of earning a living. More than training for today's occupations, a liberal arts education offers students the foresight and flexibility they will need as they move on to careers and technologies not yet known or imagined. Finally, a liberal arts education develops the qualities of mind that are needed by informed and responsible people. Any decision or action\u2014whether personal or professional \u2014informed by knowledge, rationality, and compassion makes the greatest contribution to a better world. 11 Goals: The Liberal Arts and Sciences in the College At IU, the College of Arts and Sciences provides the means for undergraduates to acquire a liberal arts education: an education that broadens the student's knowledge and awareness in the major areas of human knowledge, significantly deepens that awareness in one or two fields, and prepares the foundation for a lifetime of continual learning. The distinguishing mark of the university is that its faculty is engaged in the discovery and dissemination of knowledge, thereby offering students an unusually rich opportunity to gain a liberal education. At Indiana University, the liberal arts curriculum of the College of Arts and Sciences directs its students to achieve eleven major goals. Our students: 1.Achieve the genuine literacy required to read and listen effectively, and to speak and write clearly and persuasively. 2.Learn to think critically and creatively. As perceptive analysts of what they read, see, and hear, students must learn to reason carefully and correctly and to recognize the legitimacy of intuition when reason and evidence prove insufficient. 3.Develop intellectual flexibility and breadth of mind. Liberal arts students remain open to new ideas and information, willing to grow and learn, and sensitive to others' views and feelings. 4.Discover ethical perspectives so that they can formulate and understand their own values, become aware of others' values, and discern the ethical dimensions underlying many of the decisions they must make. 5.Cultivate a critically informed appreciation of literature and the arts and forge the aesthetic judgment that makes possible the enjoyment and comprehension of works of the creative imagination. 6.Practice and apply scientific methods. This approach to knowledge forms the basis of scientific research; guides the formation, testing, and validation of theories; and distinguishes conclusions that rest on unverified assertion from those developed through the application of scientific reasoning.7.Learn to reason quantitatively, a skill essential in an increasingly technological society. 8.Develop historical consciousness so that students can view the present within the context of the past, appreciate tradition, and understand the critical historical forces that have influenced the way we think, feel, and act. 9.Investigate and study the international community to become involved in the contemporary world. By understanding the range of physical, geographic, economic, political, religious, and cultural realities influencing world events, students cultivate an informed sensitivity to global and environmental issues. 10.Develop and practice communication skills in public settings and in the study of at least one foreign language. Public speaking and listening are fundamental skills for participation in civil society. Study of a foreign language not only promotes communication with people from other cultures but also offers insights into distinct patterns of thought and modes of expression. 11.Pursue in-depth knowledge of at least one subject to be complete. Students in the College of Arts and Sciences must learn to acquire and manage a coherent, sophisticated understanding of a major body of knowledge with all its complexities, power, and limitations. The Curriculum The current degree requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences are more than the sum of their parts. They incorporate the 11 principles of Liberal Learning at Indiana University into a coherent and complementary curriculum that helps students to develop to their full potential as ethical and thoughtful individuals and citizens. Course work in English Composition, Mathematical Modeling, Public Oral Communication, Intensive Writing and Foreign Language provides opportunities for students to develop communication skills for understanding other communities and the computational skills necessary to thrive in an increasingly data-driven society. Critical Approaches to the Arts and Sciences and Breadth of Inquiry courses help students to acquire broad familiarity with the general areas of human knowledge in the arts and humanities, social and historical studies, and natural and mathematical sciences. Culture Studies classes enable students to enrich their understanding of their neighbors at home and internationally. These courses serve as the foundation upon which students can develop a major program of study. The requirements for the B.A. Major and the degree structures of specialized B.F.A., B.S., B.L.S., and B.A.J. programs provide the in-depth expertise that prepare students for further study or entry in the professions and other careers that value critical thinking and deep analysis.

Admission Admission to IU Most incoming freshmen admitted to Indiana University first enter University Division , where they must complete a specific set of requirements if they are interested in gaining admittance to the College of Arts and Sciences. Although University Division provides advising services, students who are considering pursuing a degree from the College should also meet, early in their time at IU, with the academic advisor from any department(s) that offers a major, minor, or certificate that the student thinks he or she may want to pursue. Also, a small number of incoming students with records of academic excellence may be invited to apply for Direct Admission to the College. For additional information on applying to Indiana University, please visit the Office of Admissions website . Entering the College Most incoming students admitted to Indiana University first enter University Division . With the exception of those individuals who are admitted directly into the College (see Direct Admission), students who wish to enter into the College must: complete 26 credit hours of course work that can count toward a degree in the College; maintain a minimum cumulative College grade point average of 2.000; maintain a minimum grade point average of 2.000 in the intended major; satisfy the CASE English Composition Requirement. IU students at other schools on the Bloomington campus who wish to enter the College must fulfill the same entry requirements as University Division students. When students in the University Division have satisfied the College entry requirements, they will be certified to the College department that offers the major that they have chosen to pursue (and that is listed on their record). To declare or change a major, students in University Division should see their University Division advisor or go to the University Division Records Office , Maxwell Hall 030. Students are encouraged, early on in their time in University Division, to make an appointment with the advisor of any departments that offer majors that students think they may want to pursue. Students with an interest in pursuing a B.F.A. must meet program admission standards before declaring their majors. For details, see the B.F.A. in Dance, the B.F.A. in Fine Arts Studio, or the B.F.A. in Musical Theatre. It is important to note that, even when they are still in University Division, students can begin to satisfy College degree requirements. Direct Admission College Direct Admission Scholars Each year, the College of Arts and Sciences recognizes the achievements of a small number of outstandingincoming freshmen by extending to these future scholars invitations of direct admission. Students honored with this distinction are among the most talented and accomplished undergraduates pursuing studies in the arts, humanities, languages, mathematics, sciences, and social sciences. Direct Admission allows these highly motivated, intellectually curious, and dedicated individuals the opportunity to declare their major immediately and begin their studies as College of Arts and Sciences students at the very start of their freshman year. Early entrance to the College provides them access to academic advisors, faculty, and departmental resources within their chosen field(s) of study. Direct Admission students embody a record of achievement, enthusiasm for learning, and scholarly potential, suggesting they will benefit from a focused start to their studies. Competitive candidates will be students admitted to IU who have indicated a major in the Arts and Sciences on the IU Freshman Application for Admission and who are qualified based on a combination of minimum SAT or ACT score and GPA or class rank.

Degree Requirements CASE Curricular Requirements \"CASE\" (College of Arts and Sciences Education) is an acronym the College uses to distinguish its specific degree requirements from those of other Indiana University Bloomington schools (Kelley, Jacobs, Public and Environmental Affairs, Public Health, etc.) and from the requirements of campus-wide General Education. The College's degree requirements are well-aligned with campus-wide General Education, but they are not identical. All of the College's degrees incorporate English Composition\u2014teaches students to read critically, summarize, apply, analyze, and synthesize what they have read, discussed, and researched\u2014 skills developed in this course are transferable to a wide variety of college courses and experiences.Mathematical Modeling\u2014provides rigorous instruction in fundamental mathematical concepts and skills presented in the context of real-world applications. Critical Approaches to the Arts and Sciences (CAPP) \u2014helps first- and second-year students begin to develop an understanding of the fundamental questions asked and methods employed by the various disciplines represented in the College. CAPP classes can be included in course work applied towards the Breadth of Inquiry requirement described below. Public Oral Communication\u2014prepares students in the liberal arts to communicate effectively with public audiences. Intensive Writing (IW)\u2014provides students with additional, focused practice in writing, preferably in their major field, under the guidance of an instructor well-acquainted with the standards of good writing in that discipline. IW classes can be included in course work applied towards the Breadth of Inquiry requirement described below. Breadth of Inquiry\u201411- to 12-course cluster that helps students to acquire broad familiarity with the general areas of human knowledge by taking courses in the Arts and Humanities, Social and Historical Studies, and Natural and Mathematical Sciences. Two additional CASE requirements are Culture Studies and Foreign Language. Culture Studies\u2014Two-part requirement where students complete a course on Diversity in the U.S. (DUS) and a course on Global Civilizations and Cultures (GCC). DUS and GCC classes can be included in course work applied towards satisfaction of the Breadth of Inquiry requirement described above. This requirement is included in all B.A., B.F.A. and B.L.S. degrees and in some B.S. degrees. Foreign Language\u2014provides the fundamental skills for communicating with people from other cultures and offers insights into other patterns of thought and modes of expression. Students pursuing B.F.A. and B.A. degrees must establish proficiency in a single foreign language through the second semester of the second year of college-level course work. Students pursuing B.S. degrees should check the Foreign Language requirement for their particular degree program since the requirement varies from one degree to the next. B.L.S. students are not required to complete study in foreign language, but may apply these courses towards degree. Academic Advising The College has a staff of dedicated and knowledgeable academic advisors who help students make informed decisions about their course of study and maximize the College experience. Students should seek out and work with academic advisors in College departments that offer the majors, minors, and certificates they are interested in pursuing. (For an up-to-date listing of all College academic advisors, please see the Academic Advisors list . Advisor contact information is also available on the \"Faculty\" page included under the link within each College department or program. See \"Departments and10 September 16, 2015 Programs.\") Advisors can aid students in understanding of this Bulletin and their Academic Advisement Reports, which document student progress toward the completion of degree requirements. Nevertheless, it is imperative that students remember it is ultimately their responsibility to inform themselves about requirements to earn a Bachelor's Degree from the College, and to make sure that they plan their course of studies to achieve their academic objectives. For more information, see \"Student Responsibility\" in this Bulletin. CASE Credit Hour and Residency Requirements The following credit hour, GPA, upper-level credit hours and residency policies apply to all B.A., B.F.A., B.S. and B.L.S. degrees awarded by the College of Arts and Sciences.

For detailed information about the requirements for any particular major, please see the entries in this Bulletin for individual Departments and Programs . Some departments require students to complete a minor in addition to the major. 1.With the exception of interdepartmental majors, majors that are part of the B.A. degree require aminimum of 30 and a maximum of 42 College of Arts and Sciences credit hours. Students\u2014especially those considering graduate school\u2014may count up to 20 major credit hours taken in excess of 42 toward the 120 minimum credit hours required for the degree if the total number of credit hours outside of the College and excess major hours combined do not exceed 20. 2.Certain departments and programs do not count 100-level language courses toward the requirements. 3.Students must complete at least 18 credit hours at the 300-400 level in courses applicable to the major. 4.Any course in which the student earns a grade below C- may not be used to fulfill a major or minor requirement. Courses in which the student earns a D- or higher, however, count toward the 120 credit hour total. 5.Courses taken to satisfy the Foundations requirement in English Composition may not be applied toward a major or minor requirement. 6.The grade point average of all courses taken in the major must be at least 2.000. 7.The residence requirement of at least 18 credit hours in the major at Bloomington must be met. Double or Triple Majors (B.A.) The College offers a double or triple major for the B.A. degree with the following requirements: 1.At least 27 distinct College of Arts and Sciences credit hours must be taken in each major. 2.The residence requirement of at least 18 credit hours in each major at Bloomington must be met. 3.Students must have two or three advisors, one from each department in which they propose to study. 4.With approval of the relevant major departments and the College, one course may be counted toward both majors of a double major or all three majors of a triple major program. Whether a student plans two majors or three majors, a total of only one course may be double-counted. Interdepartmental Majors (B.A.) Interdepartmental majors are available in some disciplines for students who are pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree and who wish to combine two disciplines or subjects into an interdepartmental concentration area. Such students are required to complete a minimum of 40 credit hours but cannot exceed 62 credit hours in the interdepartmental major. However, a maximum of 20 major credit hours taken in excess of 62 may be counted toward the 120 minimum credit hours required for the degree. In no case may the total of credit hours outside the College and excess major credit hours exceed 20 credit hours. Requirements for the B.A.J., B.F.A., B.S., and B.L.S. Because of the unique nature of each of the B.A.J., B.F.A., B.S., and B.L.S. degrees offered in the College, students should consult the entry in this Bulletin for the department or program that offers a particular degree. For instance, for information regarding the requirements for the B.S. in Chemistry, students should go to the listing,12 September 16, 2015 under \"Departments & Programs,\" for the Department of Chemistry. For information about the Bachelor of Liberal Studies degree, please see the specific entry in the \"B.L.S. Degree Requirements\" section of this Bulletin. B.L.S. Degree Requirements To earn the Bachelor of Liberal Studies degree, students must complete the following requirements: 1.Overall credit hour requirement and limitations. Students must complete a minimum of 120 credit hours. At least 81 credit hours must be earned in courses offered by the College of Arts and Sciences.

Following completion of their 60th credit hour toward degree, students are required to take 36 credit hours of College course work on the IU Bloomington campus or in an IU-administered or IU co-sponsored Overseas Study program. Also, students will need to complete 15 credit hours of College course work in the concentration on the IU Bloomington campus (see 8d).11.GPA requirements. To be eligible for graduation, students must have a minimum 2.000 cumulative GPA. They must also have at least a 2.000 GPA in the concentration (see 8b). Requirements for Certificates Undergraduate certificates in the College are offered as concurrent credentials earned while a student is an undergraduate at Indiana University pursuing a conventional baccalaureate degree with a declared major. To earn certificates students must complete a significant body of work in a sub-specialty or interdisciplinary field of study. The certificate marks the acquisition of a particular set of related skills that cross traditional curricular boundaries and can have practical applications that grow out of skills earned in the classroom. Certificates can require as few as 21, and as many as 30, credit hours of work. Many Indiana University students outside the College add certificates to their pre-professional degrees. Due to their interdisciplinary nature, certificates often include a wide variety of core skills courses from a broad spectrum of departments and (inter)disciplines. In completing requirements for certificates, students should be aware of the following College of Arts and Sciences policies and procedures: 1.A certificate must include at least 21 credit hours. 2.A certificate must include at least 9 credit hours at the 300-400 level. 3.Students must complete at least 9 credit hours in the certificate in residence on the Bloomington campus. 4.Certain departments and programs do not count 100-level language courses toward the requirements for their certificates. 5.Any course in which the student earns a grade below C- may not be used to fulfill a certificate requirement. 6.The grade point average of all courses taken in the certificate must be at least 2.000. 7.Some certificates may have a higher overall grade point average requirement. 8.Courses taken to satisfy the Foundations requirement in English Composition may not be applied toward a certificate requirement. 9.Students in the College of Arts and Sciences may earn both a certificate and a major from the same department or program under the following conditions: The total number of distinct credit hours used to earn the certificate and major totals at least 51 distinct hours--the combination of the minimum requirements for a BA major (30 credit hours) and a College certificate (24 credit hours)--with no more than one 3 credit course allowed to overlap. Students must meet all other College policies and standards regarding majors and certificates. Course-specific requirements for certificates can be found in the \"List of Certificates\" or in departmental entries in this Bulletin. For certificates outside the College of Arts and Sciences that can be listed on a College student's transcript, pleaseSeptember 16, 2015 13 see the section of this Bulletin entitled \"Opportunities Outside the College.\" Requirements for Minors The College of Arts and Sciences offers more than 80 minors, each consisting of at least 15 College of Arts and Sciences credit hours drawn from a subset of departmental courses that focus on a set of well-defined skills associated with an established field of study or discipline. The minor does not require the same degree of immersion or specialization as a major. Students with a major in one department (e.g., English) may satisfy the requirements for a minor in a different department (e.g., Religious Studies). A student may complete up to three minors in addition to their required major. A few majors require that students also complete a minor. Only those minors that are listed in this Bulletin may appear on student transcripts. Students planning to complete a minor should consult the academic advisor in the department in which the minor is offered. The following policies and requirements apply to all minors offered by the College and outside minors College students wish to list on their transcripts: 1.A minor must consist of at least 15 or more credit hours. 2.A minor must include at least 9 credit hours at the 300-400 level. 3.A student must complete at least 9 credit hours in the minor in courses on the Bloomington campus. 4.Certain departments and programs do not count 100-level language courses toward minor requirements. 5.Any course in which the student earns a grade below C- may not be used to fulfill a minor requirement. 6.The grade point average of all courses taken in the minor must be at least 2.000. 7.Some minors may have a higher overall grade point average requirement. 8.Courses taken to satisfy the Foundations requirement in English Composition may not be applied toward a minor requirement. Course-specific requirements for minors can be found in the \"List of Minors\" or in departmental entries in this Bulletin. For a list of minors outside the College of Arts and Sciences that can be listed on a College student's transcript, please see the section of this Bulletin entitled \"Opportunities Outside the College.\" CASE Foundations CASE English Composition The CASE English Composition requirement can be satisfied by any course currently used for that purpose in the campus-wide General Education Curriculum at Indiana University. Please see the General Education 2015- 2016 Bulletin for a list of courses that satisfy the CASE English Composition requirement. Note that, although the College's English Composition requirement is satisfied with a minimum grade of C-, the General Education Curriculum requires a minimum grade of C.Students are exempted from the CASE English Composition requirement if they meet the following standards: SAT Critical Reading score of 670 or higher; or ACT English score of 32 or higher; or AP Program English: Composition and Literature score of 4 or 5; or AP Program English: Language and Composition score of 4 or 5. CASE Mathematical Modeling The CASE Mathematical Modeling requirement can be satisfied by any course currently used for that purpose in the campus-wide General Education Curriculum at Indiana University. Please see the General Education 2015-2016 Bulletin. Note that the same course can simultaneously count toward the campus-wide General Education Curriculum's Mathematical Modeling requirement and the CASE Breadth of Inquiry requirement in Natural and Mathematical Sciences ( CASE N&M ). CASE Public Oral Communication Candidates for all bachelor's degrees in the College of Arts and Sciences must complete the Public Oral Communication requirement. A course in Public Oral Communication prepares students in the liberal arts to communicate effectively with public audiences. The course emphasizes oral communication as practiced in public contexts: how to advance reasoned claims in public; how to adapt public oral presentations to particular audiences; how to listen to, interpret, and evaluate public discourse; and how to formulate a clear response. The ability to communicate effectively in a public setting is an essential component of a liberal arts education and an important skill needed in every discipline. Employers continually emphasize the need for students to have well- developed oral communication skills. Courses that fulfill this requirement are designated with CASE POC. COLL-P 155 Public Oral Communication (3 cr.) CASE POC Prepares students in the liberal arts to communicate effectively with public audiences. Emphasizes oral communication as practiced in public contexts: how to advance reasoned claims in public; how to adapt public oral presentations to particular audiences; how to listen to, interpret, and evaluate public discourse; and how to formulate a clear response. Credit given for only one of P155, CMCL-C 121, or CMCL-C 130. CASE Intensive Writing The CASE Intensive Writing (IW) requirement may be fulfilled by completing one Intensive Writing course at or above the 200 level after completing the English Composition requirement. Normally, CASE Intensive Writing sections are taught by faculty in small sections and include written assignments in which students are asked to make, illustrate, and develop arguments. Graded revision of assignments is a requirement of all CASE Intensive Writing courses. Students must check the listings for courses in the online Schedule of Classes each semester to make certain that the course section they have chosen fulfills the requirement. CASE Intensive Writing credit will not be awarded for written work in courses that are not listed as CASE14 September 16, 2015 Intensive Writing unless special arrangements have been completed and approved prior to the relevant deadline. All special arrangements are subject to the approval of the College. Students who wish to arrange an individual Intensive Writing component for a course or section that is not listed as CASE Intensive Writing must obtain the approval of the faculty director of undergraduate studies of the department of their major concentration as well as that of the Office of Undergraduate Academic Affairs of the College of Arts and Sciences, Owen Hall. Please see the Proposal to Satisfy Intensive Writing by Special Arrangement form for information on deadlines for submitting proposals. CASE Foreign Language Students pursuing the B.A., B.F.A., or B.A.J. degree in the College must establish proficiency in a single foreign language through the second semester of the second year of college-level course work. Students pursuing B.S. degrees should check the Foreign Language requirement for their particular degree program since the requirement varies according to the degree being pursued. Students are encouraged to include foreign language study in their first semester at Indiana University Bloomington (IUB) and plan for two years of consecutive fall and spring foreign language enrollments. Students can complete foreign language courses during the summer when they are offered, but summer course selection for individual languages and course-levels varies by demand and instructor availability; the College cannot guarantee that any one language or a specific course in a language sequence will be taught in a given summer. Completion of the CASE Foreign Language requirement can be achieved in four ways: 1.Completion of the final course in the sequence (i.e., fourth-semester course in a particular language). 2.Testing out of the requirement by virtue of appropriate performance on certain types of exams, such as Advanced Placement (AP), SAT II, and/or International Baccalaureate (IB) exams. Check with the relevant department for additional information about which type of exam is accepted. 3.Appropriate official documentation that the student establishes proficiency via formal education in a language other than English. This documentation must be from an accredited international institution which is considered appropriate by both the relevant department and the College of Arts and Sciences. Such documentation generally indicates satisfactory completion of at least two years at the secondary level in a language other than English\u2014i.e., a transcript. 4.Satisfactory completion of a proctored proficiency exam administered by the relevant department (NOT a placement exam), if such an exam is offered by that department. Completion of high school foreign language courses is not accepted as completion of the requirement. Please note that the CASE Foreign Language requirement differs from the campus-wide General Education curriculum's World Languages and Cultures requirement. Fulfillment of the CASE Foreign Language requirement for B.A., B.F.A., and B.A.J. degrees will,in most cases, also fulfill the campus-wide General Education's World Languages and Cultures requirement. For information about the latter, please see the . Placement Students who matriculate to Indiana University with prior knowledge of a foreign language must take the placement test in that language before registering for their first semester's classes to identify the appropriate foreign language course to take at IU Bloomington. For the following languages, this is done online: Chinese French German Hebrew Italian Japanese Latin Spanish For all other languages, please visit the website of the relevant department for information on their placement tests. Proficiency The test used for placement is NOT the same exam used to establish proficiency in foreign language. A few departments offer proficiency exams to students who wish to demonstrate that they do not need any additional foreign language enrollment/study to meet the IU General Education World Languages and Cultures requirement and/or the College's CASE Foreign Language requirement. Proficiency exams are not tied to special credit. Domestic students interested in establishing proficiency should contact the department offering the relevant language. International students who wish to use their native language (if their native language is not English) to establish foreign language proficiency should complete the Application for Establishment of Foreign Language Proficiency for Non-Native Speakers of English. Students interested in this option should complete the process as early in their undergraduate careers as possible. Special Credit Policy Degree-seeking students can earn a maximum of two semesters of special credit for foreign language and this special credit is limited to two semesters of second-year study (the third and fourth semesters). The number of credits varies according to the language. To earn special credit, students must take the placement test offered by the appropriate department at IUB, complete a validating course on the IUB campus with a grade of C or higher, and apply for the special credit to be posted retroactively. If a student earns a grade of C- or below in the validating course, s/he will not earn special credit. To be eligible to earn foreign language special credit, students must take a validating language course which must be their first IUB course in that language. A transfer course may not be used as a validating course. If a student drops the validating language course, s/he can re-enroll and be eligible for special credit provided that s/he earns a grade of C or higher in the course. Grades (A, B, C, etc.) are not given for special credit. Students may not earn special credit in their native language. Students can earn special credit in more than one language as long as they meet the otherSeptember 16, 2015 15 requirements listed above and below to earn special credit. Students who have taken the AP, SAT II, or the IB exam must check with the respective language department to find out departmental policy regarding which exam has precedence in terms of placement in language classes. Policies regarding AP, SAT II, and IB credit are unrelated to those for IU special credit, so AP, SAT II, and IB credit remain unaffected by the College's special credit policy. Special credit can be awarded for all third- and fourth- semester foreign language courses. The validating foreign language course: must be taught at IUB; can only be a fourth-semester language course or higher; must be the student's first course in that language at IUB; may only be completed once in an effort to earn special credit; and must be completed with a grade of C or higher. Students interested in special credit in foreign language should complete their validating course as soon as they begin their studies at IUB. Pass/Fail Students are not permitted to enroll in foreign language courses on a Pass/Fail basis until the CASE Foreign Language requirement has been completed. CASE Breadth of Inquiry Students pursuing a B.A., B.A.J., or B.F.A. in the College must complete 6 courses in CASE Breadth of Inquiry in addition to the Breadth of Inquiry courses that they must complete for campus-wide General Education including two designated courses in the arts and humanities, two designated courses in social and historical studies, and two designated courses in natural and mathematical sciences. For information about Breadth of Inquiry requirements for the B.L.S. or B.S. degrees, please see the entry for the department or program that offers the degree in question. Specific courses that fulfill the College's Breadth of Inquiry requirement are designated by abbreviations following the course titles (CASE A&H, CASE S&H, or CASE N&M). For a complete list of courses that fulfill the Breadth of Inquiry requirement, please use the CASE Course Designations tool. Courses to be considered for CASE Breadth of Inquiry credit must be conducted as formal classes. A course can carry only one Breadth of Inquiry designation. Arts and Humanities (CASE A&H) Courses in this area examine the complexity of human experience, interrogate the range of human thought and emotion, interpret varieties of aesthetic expression, and grapple with moral issues. Such courses analyze written texts and works in literature, the visual arts, music, and the other performing arts, as well as philosophical and religious thought, and intellectual and cultural traditions from both contemporary and historical perspectives. They also develop the abilities to think rationally and to construct and assess opinions, ideas, and arguments. The approach may be comparative, historical, or analytical, butthe emphasis is on developing students' interpretive and critical skills. Courses approved for Arts and Humanities Breadth of Inquiry credit explore and analyze the artifacts of human expression and/or put their knowledge into practice through producing work in (a) literary form, (b) the visual arts (painting, sculpture, textiles, etc.), (c) musical composition and performance, or (d) dramatic performance (live theater, video and film, dance, etc.). These courses should include some written component \u2014whether an analytical paper, a research paper, or a response to an aesthetic experience. Social and Historical Studies (CASE S&H) Courses in this area analyze social institutions, the behavior of individuals in social contexts and historical settings, and changes in social conditions over time. Such courses study the political, economic, and cultural institutions of society, from individuals in social interactions to the international system of nation-states and transnational organizations and actors as well as changes in the human condition over time, including the inception, development, and transformation of institutions and civilizations, ideas, genres, or forms of representation. Courses approved for the Social and Historical Breadth of Inquiry credit help students gain knowledge of human cultures and the impact of historical events by (a) understanding and using appropriate theoretical underpinnings and methodologies, (b) developing their critical analytical skills, (c) increasing social awareness and the ability to reason ethically, and (d) developing an appreciation for diversity and inclusiveness. These courses should include some written component, whether an essay, an analytical paper or a research paper that address social, historical and/or cultural aspects of human cultures and events. Natural and Mathematical Sciences (CASE N&M) Courses in this area provide an understanding of physical and biological phenomena, introduce students to systematic investigation of those phenomena, show the value of scientific inquiry and hypothesis testing, review the state of the science related to scientific theories and natural laws and the evidence for them, and establish the role and approaches of mathematics. Courses cover the natural sciences, introducing and emphasizing basic principles of the chemical, physical, and life sciences, and expand students' understanding of the physical world and scientific inquiry about it, as well as analytical reasoning and mathematics. Courses may focus on forms of reasoning or the nature and processes of cognition and computation. CASE Culture Studies The purpose of the Culture Studies curriculum is to introduce students to cultural systems, to allow students to define what is commonly meant by the term \"culture,\" and to examine critically specific examples of culture. The curriculum also provides students with the opportunity to explore the relationship between cultural artifacts and the community that produced them and/or draw comparisons between different cultures. This exposure can lead students to understand the facts, possibilities, and limitations of their own cultural conditioning.16 September 16, 2015 Diversity in the U.S. (CASE DUS) courses will offer students the chance to explore cultural artifacts and the communities that produced them and may also allow for students to learn about the choices made by individuals and communities as they create, refine, and blend cultures. Students will study values, attitudes and methods of organizing experience that may diverge or dissent from the predominant American culture, allowing them to better understand the facts, possibilities and limitations of their own cultural world view. Under the rubric of diversity, the College includes race, ethnicity, gender, class, age, sexual orientation, religious practice, and multiple other categories. We wish to ensure that students are introduced to a cultural system in the United States which differs from that of mainstream America. Global Civilizations and Cultures (CASE GCC) courses examine cultures and/or cultural artifacts from outside the United States as a means of understanding the communities that produced them and the relationships of these communities to other groups of people. Such courses convey the distinctive world view, institutions, and patterns of organization of another culture. Not restricted to a chronology of events or one aspect of the traditions or institutions of a particular cultural group, these courses instead teach the relationships among some of the following aspects of the culture: art, religion, literature, philosophic traditions, social behavior and institutions, and linkages with other cultures. A course on one specific aspect of a culture--for example, its art or political institutions--would fulfill the spirit of the requirement only if it devoted a substantial amount of time to the relationships between that specific aspect and the culture more generally. Similarly a course might have a broad conceptual focus within a narrow geographical and temporal setting (such as the intellectual and aesthetic traditions of Russia under Catherine the Great) or a narrow conceptual focus across a broad geographical or temporal setting (such as the political institutions of Africa in the pre-colonial period.) Please note that the College's CASE Culture Studies requirement is different from the campus-wide General Education curriculum's World Languages and Cultures requirement. Students in the College must fulfill the CASE Culture Studies requirement, the CASE Foreign Language requirement, and the campus-wide General Education's World Languages and Cultures requirement. Fulfillment of the CASE Foreign Language requirement for B.A. and B.F.A. degrees will, in most cases, also fulfill the campus- wide General Education's World Languages and Cultures requirement. For information about the latter, please see the General Education 2015-2016 Bulletin . Students pursuing a B.A., B.A.J., B.F.A., or B.L.S. degree in the College must observe the following guidelines when fulfilling the CASE Culture Studies requirement: 1.Students are required to complete two courses that carry CASE Culture Studies credit, one from \"Diversity in the U.S.\" and one from \"Global Civilizations and Cultures\" (for a list of designated courses, please use the CASE Course Designations tool). 2.Students who successfully complete a semester (or more) abroad in a program sponsored by the Indiana University Office of Overseas Study will satisfy the \"Global Civilizations and Cultures\" component of theCASE Culture Studies requirement. These students must still complete a course designated \"Diversity in the U.S.\" CASE Critical Approaches Courses in Critical Approaches (CAPP) are intended to help first- and second-year students begin to develop an understanding of the fundamental questions asked and methods employed by the various disciplines represented in the College. Rather than focusing on depth of coverage, CAPP courses introduce students to the different kinds of scholarship that take place in a university. Through these courses, students learn about the ways particular disciplines seek answers, solve problems, and organize ideas. Alternatively, these courses can demonstrate the merits of viewing a problem from an interdisciplinary or a multidisciplinary perspective. CAPP courses also teach students how to seek information from various sources, evaluate the validity of that information, and construct arguments. One of the main objectives of these courses is to instill sound research and writing practices that students will employ in their future undergraduate course work. Any student who is a candidate for a bachelor's degree offered by the College is required to complete one CAPP course on the Bloomington campus. This includes students who transfer from other IU Bloomington schools, from other IU campuses, and from other institutions. Students are encouraged to take this course in their first year; in any case, they should plan to take their CAPP course no later than the first semester of their second year. For a listing of all courses that can satisfy the CAPP requirement, please use the CASE Course Designations tool. For semester-specific CAPP course descriptions, see the College website at college.indiana.edu/undergrad/ courses.php and search on \"CASE Critical Approaches\" for the relevant semester. CAPP courses can also be counted toward a College and campus-wide General Education Breadth of Inquiry requirement.

Second Bachelor's Degree In certain cases the Dean may admit Bachelor's degree holders or students currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree at IU Bloomington to candidacy for a second Bachelor's degree. There are two types of second degrees, concurrent and sequential. A concurrent degree is one earned simultaneously with a first degree. A sequential degree is one earned subsequent to a first degree (earned at IUB or elsewhere). Admission to second degree candidacy is a selective process. Applicants must meet all eligibility requirements. Candidates for second degrees must complete all degree requirements for the College of Arts and Sciences and the major(s) that they are pursuing.Students interested in pursuing a concurrent second degree should meet with the academic advisor for the intended major of the second degree to discuss both their eligibility and rationale for pursuing a second degree. Students should download the Second Bachelor's Degree application from the College Recorder's Office website and complete it before meeting with the second-degree advisor. Concurrent applications are accepted on a rolling basis. Students interested in pursuing a sequential second degree should contact the College at colldeg2@indiana.edu to request application information. Students who currently hold a Bachelor's degree and wish to further their education in the same field of study as their first degree or in a closely related field should consider working toward admission to a graduate program instead of pursuing a second Bachelor's degree. Students who are certain that they want to pursue a sequential second degree must provide a compelling rationale for pursuing a second Bachelor's degree and evidence of their commitment to completing the second degree if admitted. Sequential application deadlines are April 1 for a fall start, and November 1 for a spring start. (International student deadlines are April 1 for a fall start, and September 15 for a spring start.) Courses Outside the College A candidate for a bachelor's degree in the College of Arts and Sciences, with the exception of the B.L.S. degree, must satisfactorily complete a minimum of 100 credit hours in courses offered by the College. Students may select the remaining 20 credit hours from courses in the College of Arts and Sciences and/or from courses outside the College. (Please note that certain specific courses from both the Jacobs School of Music as well as the School of Informatics and Computing in Computer Science that are listed as being approved for CASE Designations may be counted among the 100 credit hours inside the College of Arts and Sciences.) Any course applied towards satisfaction of a Concentration or Specialization requirement will count towards satisfaction of the 100 College of Arts and Sciences credits requirement. Students satisfying requirements for a teaching certificate may take a maximum of 29 credit hours outside of the College if the courses selected are required for teaching certification. Students planning teacher certification may need to complete more than 120 credit hours and should confer with the academic advisor in their major and with an academic advisor from the School of Education early in their academic careers. Students should also consult the School of Education Undergraduate Academic Bulletin. The College does not accept certain types of credit, including engineering, technical, or self-acquired competency credits. Policies & Procedures The Bulletin and \"The Code\" The College and campus policies described in the \"Policies and Procedures\" section of this Bulletin inform students how to process conventional requests related to their enrollment, academic standing, and academic records. For detailed information on the policies and procedures governing appropriate personal conduct while a student at Indiana University, students are encouraged18 September 16, 2015 to consult The Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities and Conduct . This document identifies the basic rights, responsibilities, and expectations of all students and student groups at Indiana University. Both The College of Arts and Sciences 2014-2015 Bulletin and The Code are designed to provide essential information that will help to improve students' overall experience at Indiana University. Academic Policies & Procedures Petitioning the College of Arts and Sciences Exceptions to College policies may be granted only in rare instances upon written petition to the College of Arts and Sciences. Absences from Final Examinations A student who fails to attend the final examination of a course and who has a passing grade up to that time may be given a grade of I (Incomplete) if the instructor has reason to believe the absence was beyond the student's control. If not, a grade of F must be recorded. (For additional information regarding Incompletes, please see the section of this Bulletin entitled \"Grade of Incomplete.\") The Committee on Absence of the Division of Student Affairs reviews excuses concerning absences from final examinations and informs instructors of its decisions. Absences from Scheduled Classes Illness is usually the only acceptable excuse for absence from class. All absences must be explained to the satisfaction of the instructor, who will decide whether omitted work may be made up. The names of students who are absent excessively are to be reported by their instructor to the Dean of Students. Addition of Courses No course may be added by an undergraduate student after the first week of a semester or summer session without the approval of the instructor of the course, the chair of the department in which the course is offered, and the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled. Grade Appeals and Retroactive Changes Appeals of grades should be resolved with the instructor who recorded the disputed grade. If the student and instructor cannot resolve the matter, the student should discuss it further with the chair of the department offering the course. Appeals unresolved at the department level may be referred to the academic assistant deans. Appeals of grades or requests for other actions after the conclusion of a course should be made as soon as possible. Such requests will not be considered after one calendar year from the end of the semester in which the course in question was taken. Note that grades of I (Incomplete) or W (Withdrawal) may not be recorded for a course when a student has taken the final exam, or completed the final paper or project for the course. Applying for Graduation An application for graduation with a degree must be submitted to the College Recorder's Office in Owen Hall 003 nine to twelve months ahead of the desired graduation date. Applications can be submitted online from the Recorder's Office website . This should be done no later than June 1 for subsequent May graduation,no later than December 1 for subsequent August graduation, and no later than March 1 for subsequent December graduation. Failure to file an application by these deadlines may delay graduation. Candidates for degrees must have all credit on record at least six weeks before the conferral of degrees, except that of the current semester. Credit for current semester enrollment in Indiana University or non- Indiana University programs must be posted on the student's Indiana University transcript by the last day of the semester in which the student wishes to graduate. Students enrolled in non-Indiana University programs should make arrangements to have their transcripts sent to the Indiana University Office of Admissions on the Bloomington campus as soon as possible once final grades are posted. Students enrolled in programs where grades will be reported after the end of the Indiana University Bloomington semester should apply for the next appropriate graduation date. Please consult with the College Recorder's Office (Owen Hall 003, coasrecd@indiana.edu, 812-855-1821), for further information. Change of Major To be eligible to declare a new major, students must have a minimum grade point average of at least 2.000. To change their major, students in the College must contact the academic advisor in the department in which they wish to become a major. The advisor will submit a Major or School Change Request to the College Recorder's Office for processing. For information on the requirements for transferring into the College, see \"Transfers from Programs in Other Schools on the Bloomington Campus (\"School Change\"). Class Standing Class standing is based on the number of credit hours completed toward graduation: Freshman, fewer than 30 credits Sophomore, 30 to 60 credits Junior, 60 to 90 credits Senior, 90 or more credits Credit for Correspondence Courses Courses taken by correspondence may not be applied to any degree requirement of a bachelor's degree without prior special permission of the Dean. Credit by Examination Students may receive credit for certain courses by successful performance on the SAT, SAT II Subject Tests, College Board Advanced Placement Tests, International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level (HL) exams, and, with permission of the Dean, examinations offered by academic departments while at Indiana University. The appropriate department of the College reviews the placement tests in order to make recommendations about advanced standing. Students who believe that they are prepared for advanced study or that they are eligible for special credit because of superior preparation are urged to accelerate their college programs by taking the requisite exams. Students may thus graduate early, or they may use the time gained to take higher-level courses. Credit will be recorded simply with the grade of S (Satisfactory)September 16, 2015 19 unless the examination clearly merits an A grade and the department requests the use of a grade other than S. Failure to pass the examination carries no penalty. Fees for special credit/credit by examination are waived for undergraduate students enrolled in an IU degree- seeking program for at least 12 credit hours in either the fall or spring semester. Regular credit-hour rates apply for graduate students and undergraduate students enrolled in fewer than 12 credit hours. For a discussion of credit offered for foreign language exams, please see the section of this Bulletin entitled \"Foreign Language Requirement.\" Graduation Dates Degrees are conferred in December, May, and August; Commencement ceremonies are held in May and December. Candidates for degrees in August may participate in the May Commencement. Extended X Indiana University allows students to retake up to three IU courses (or a total of 10 credit hours) and replace the grades earned in the first enrollment with the grades earned in the second enrollment, with some significant restrictions. Students wishing to pursue this option should read the full text of the policy on the Registrar's website. Additionally, College of Arts and Sciences students should contact their academic advisor(s) and the College Recorder's Office, Owen Hall 003, (812) 855-1821. Important Note: The College does not acknowledge this policy for internal GPA purposes. All grades in completed course work, even if an \"X\" is on record, are calculated into the College of Arts and Sciences cumulative GPA. Since this policy does not affect the College's GPA (that is, the College still includes the grade earned in the first enrollment in the College GPA), class rank, major GPA, and the academic standing of College of Arts and Sciences students remain unaffected by any \"X\" grade. This policy does not apply to the B.L.S. Four or More Exams in One Day In the event of four or more final exams scheduled in one day, the instructor/department of the fourth exam is obligated to adjust the student's exam time, provided the student notifies them by the mid-point of the semester. The student may exercise the following options: 1.Take all final examinations as they are scheduled; 2.Consult with instructors or departments giving the final examinations to determine if any make-up examination(s) is or can be scheduled; 3.If no make-up examination is available, then the student must notify the instructor or department of the course scheduled for the fourth (and additional) final examination of the day. That instructor or department will then be obligated to adjust the student's final examination schedule, provided the student has notified the department. It is the student's responsibility to be aware of the date and time of the final examination for each of his or her classes before officially enrolling. See the Enrollmentand Student Academic Information Bulletin (Office of the Registrar) each semester for further information. Grading System Grades are awarded on the following basis: A 4.000 Excellent A- F 0.000 Unsatisfactory Graduate-Level Course Work Under normal circumstances undergraduate students should not be enrolled in graduate-level courses. If, however, the instructor, the department and the student agree that the course is appropriate given the student's academic goals and interests and that s/he is qualified to take the course, the student may enroll. The student must accept full responsibility for fulfilling the course requirements and for the grade earned. Even if the student has successfully completed a graduate-level course, it will satisfy degree requirements for a bachelor's degree only by special permission of the Dean. Approval for graduate-level courses to be applied toward the requirements for a bachelor's degree is not guaranteed, but rather is granted on a case-by-case basis. To request such approval, the following procedure should be followed: 1.The student obtains permission from the instructor of the course and the department to enroll in the graduate-level course; 2.The student asks his/her academic advisor to submit an exception in the College database; 3.The Dean reviews the exception request and notifies the academic advisor of the decision; 4.The academic advisor notifies the student of the decision. In those cases in which undergraduates are permitted to count graduate-level course work toward a bachelor's degree, no more than 12 credit hours will be counted. Graduate courses taken while an undergraduate and counted toward the requirements of a bachelor's degree may not count toward a graduate degree at Indiana University (and may also not count toward graduate degrees at other universities). Note: This policy does not apply to graduate credit earned by students participating in a number of highly selective College-sponsored accelerated five-year undergraduate/graduate degree programs. For details consult \"Accelerated Undergraduate/Graduate Degree Programs\" in this Bulletin.20 September 16, 2015 Grade of Incomplete A grade of I (Incomplete) may be given only when the work of the course is substantially completed and when the student's work is of passing quality. A grade of I may not be given when a student has taken the final exam or completed the final paper or project for the course. When an I is assigned, a record must be maintained in the office of the department in which the grade was given. The record will include a statement of the reason for recording the I and an adequate guide for its removal and a suggested final grade in case the instructor should leave campus for an extended time. The time allowed for the removal of an I may not exceed one calendar year from the date of its recording, although the dean of the student's college or school may authorize adjustment of this period in exceptional circumstances. To complete a course in which a student received a grade of I, the student should consult with the instructor. The student should not reenroll in the course. By assigning an I, an instructor implicitly authorizes and requires the I to be changed to an F at the end of one calendar year if that instructor does not act to remove the I. The registrar will automatically change the I to an F at the end of this time period. Both the student and the instructor in whose course the student received the I will be notified of this change of grade. These regulations do not apply to Research and Readings courses in which completion of the work of the course is not necessarily required at the end of the semester and the grade R (Deferred) is given. Once a student has graduated, nothing in these regulations shall prohibit the I from remaining on the record. Junior College Credits No more than 60 credit hours earned in accredited junior colleges may be applied toward a degree. Pass/Fail Option During their undergraduate program, students in good standing (not on probation) may enroll in a maximum of eight elective courses to be taken with a grade of P (Pass) or F (Fail). The Pass/Fail option is available for a maximum of two courses per academic year, including summer sessions. For the Pass/Fail option, the academic year is defined as beginning with the start of the fall semester and ending with the end of the second summer session. The course selected for Pass/Fail must be an elective. It may not be used to satisfy any of the CASE Foundations, Intensive Writing, Foreign Language, Breadth of Inquiry, Culture Studies, Public Oral Communication, or Critical Approaches requirements. Nor may it be counted as a part of the student's concentration area, minor, or certificate program. Credit earned for courses completed using the pass/ fail option can be applied towards the minimum 120 hours required for degree and the minimum number of credit hours completed at the 300-400 level. During the freshman year, students may elect to take activity courses in the School of Public Health on a Pass/Fail basis in addition to the two other permitted courses. Students are not permitted to enroll in foreign language courses on a Pass/Fail basis until the CASE Foreign Language requirement has been completed.Students who wish to use the Pass/Fail option must submit the appropriate form to the College Recorder's Office by the relevant deadline. See the Enrollment and Student Academic Information Bulletin (Office of the Registrar) for deadline dates, including deadlines for eight- week sessions. A grade of P is not counted in computing grade point averages; a grade of F is counted. A grade of P cannot be changed subsequently to any other letter grade. Status Update Form As do students from all other units of the university, College of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who have been away from the university for two sequential regular semesters must fill out a brief informational form regarding their activities while away from the university system. For information regarding the Status Update Form , please contact the College Recorder's Office, Owen Hall 003, (812) 855-1821, coasrecd@indiana.edu . Transcripts Complete information on transcripts can be found in the Enrollment and Student Academic Information Bulletin . Requests for transcripts must be made in person or in writing to the Office of the Registrar, 408 N. Union Street, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47405, or via email to registrar@indiana.edu . Withdrawals from Courses The College follows the deadlines concerning withdrawals from courses as prescribed in the Official Calendar published in the Enrollment and Student Academic Information Bulletin . Petitions for late withdrawal after the periods specified above will not be authorized by the Dean except for urgent reasons beyond the student's control related to extended illness or equivalent distress. The desire to avoid a low grade is not an acceptable reason for withdrawal from a course. If students withdraw with the Dean's consent, their grade in the course shall be W if they are passing at the time of withdrawal and F if they are not passing. As with all grades, instructors will assign the appropriate grade. The grade will be recorded on the date of withdrawal. Failure to complete a course without authorized withdrawal will result in a grade of F. The grade of W may not be recorded for a course when a student has taken the final exam, or completed the final paper or project for the course. Academic Standing Academic Probation Students are on academic probation when their cumulative or major grade point average is below 2.000 (C). They are also on probation for the duration of the regular semester following one in which they failed to attain at least a 2.000 (C) grade point average. Students on academic probation must comply with any restrictions the Dean of the College deems necessary.September 16, 2015 21 Candidates for Bachelor's Degrees in Good Standing Students are considered to be candidates in good standing for an Indiana University bachelor's degree when they have been regularly admitted by the Office of Admissions, when their academic grade point average is not less than a 2.000 (C) for the last semester's work, and when their cumulative grade point average and major grade point average are at least 2.000 (C). Dismissal Students are dismissed from the College of Arts and Sciences when, in the judgment of the Academic Retention Committee, they have ceased to make adequate progress toward their degree. Students are automatically dismissed when they: 1.have been on academic probation during any previous semester; and 2.have a grade point average for the current semester below 2.000 (C); and 3.have a cumulative College grade point average below 2.000. All three (3) of the above criteria must be met in order to be automatically dismissed. Whether or not students have been placed on probation before, the Academic Retention Committee may dismiss students if their record reveals any of the following: failing or near-failing performance in any semester; failure to make adequate progress toward completion of major requirements; failure to make any progress toward completion of degree requirements in any semester; a cumulative grade point average below 2.000 (C). Readmission The Academic Retention Committee considers petitions for readmission from students who have been dismissed. A student dismissed for the first time must petition to continue as a student in the College. A student dismissed for the second time may not be admitted for the next regular semester but is eligible to submit a petition for readmission after a period of at least one regular semester. Third dismissals are generally considered final. Students should contact the College Recorder's Office (Owen Hall 003, coasrecd@indiana.edu , or 812-855-1821), for further information concerning eligibility to petition. In order for petitions for readmission to be considered and accepted by the committee, students eligible to submit them must do so before June 20 for the fall semester and before October 1 for the spring semester. Restart Policy Students who have been away from Indiana University for at least five years and who earned grades that make it impossible or very difficult to return to a College of Arts and Sciences degree program may petition for a \"restart.\" Under a restart, the College of Arts and Sciences will establish a new degree record for the student that will consist of courses previously taken that were completed with a minimum grade of C. Note that all Indiana University course work will remain on the student'spermanent record (the university transcript); this policy will affect only the student's College of Arts and Sciences record. Students will be eligible for consideration for this policy once a minimum of five years have passed since full-time or continuous part-time enrollment. Students will need to provide evidence that indicates a significant change in their ability to succeed in academic work. Reevaluation of fundamental skills may be necessary before the student can proceed. Students should petition for a restart as part of the readmission process. For information about deadlines for submitting readmission petitions, please see the section of this Bulletin entitled \"Readmission.\" Students should contact the Office of Undergraduate Academic Affairs , Owen Hall, to begin the petition process and to discuss the details of this policy. Student Records Confidentiality of Records Indiana University, in compliance with the campus-wide General Education Provisions Act, Section 438, titled Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), provides that all student records are confidential. Confidential academic information is released by the College of Arts and Sciences only to the student, and to person(s) whom the student authorizes in writing to be appropriate recipients of the information. Students may review their records upon request and may ask for deletions or corrections of the record in a hearing process described in detail in the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct . References, recommendations, and other similar documents may carry a voluntary waiver relinquishing the student's right to review this specific material. The student may also release the record to others by signing a written release available in the offices that maintain records. Further details regarding the provisions of the Privacy Act and a list of offices where student records are kept may be found in the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct. Additional information can be obtained at the website of the Office of the Registrar under \" Student Privacy and FERPA.\" Release of Information in Student Records An implicit and justifiable assumption of trust is placed in the College of Arts and Sciences as custodian of personal data submitted by students entering the College or generated during their enrollment. This mutual relationship of trust between the College and the individual student requires that such data be held in confidence. For additional information, please see the website of the Office of the Registrar under \" Student Privacy and FERPA.\" Public Information Upon request of a third party, certain information is made available to the public by the Office of the Registrar. Public information is limited to name; address; e-mail address; phone; major field of study; dates of attendance;22 September 16, 2015 admission or enrollment status; campus; school, college, or division; class standing; degrees and awards; activities; sports; and athletic information.

Recommendations During the freshman and sophomore years, students should take African American and African Diaspora Studies courses at the 100 and 200 level that satisfy General Education requirements. During the senior year, however, majors are strongly encouraged to enroll in the department's suggested electives (A400, A486, and A495) to help them more clearly define their last year, which AAADS is calling the fourth-year senior experience. These 400-level courses are suggested in order to create space within the curriculum to provide majors with additional understandings concerning how they can use their degree in AAADS to secure career opportunities and/or continue their studies at the graduate and/or professional level. The AAADS academic advisor will work closely with students to ensure that all required courses for the major are completed during the first three years, thereby making it possible for majors to utilize the fourth year for specific learning contexts. Students who plan to have a double major should make this decision as early as possible so that course selections in African American and African Diaspora Studies and the second major can be closely coordinated. Majors in media, business, public and environmental affairs, pre-law, social work, education, and many other disciplines have found African American and African Diaspora Studies courses to be useful, interesting, and important to their chosen fields.

CASE A&H African Studies Introduction The African Studies Program (AFRI) provides unique opportunities for students on the Indiana University Bloomington campus to study with distinguished faculty members, meet with visiting Africanists from all over the world, learn African languages, and use the outstanding facilities of the Wells Library, the Archives of Traditional Music, and the Art Museum. The Program has both regional and subject-area concentrations in which faculty conduct research and offer courses. Regularly offered language courses include Akan, Arabic, Bamana, Swahili, Wolof, Yoruba, and Zulu. Tutorial sections in other African languages may be provided if funding is available. Undergraduate students can earn a Certificate in African Studies by completing a flexible course of study designed to fit their individual interests and needs. A certificate is more rigorous than a minor, showing potential employers and graduate schools that students have completed a comprehensive course of study in an important world region. It is intended to give undergraduates both a broad, interdisciplinary understanding of the African continent (as does the minor), but it also requires that students gain a more in-depth knowledge of Africa as it relates to at least one discipline and one of its languages. Four semesters of an African language such as Akan/Twi, Arabic, Bamana, Swahili, Wolof, Yoruba, or Zulu are required. A Certificate in African Studies also complements a major in many departments and professional schools throughout the university. The African Studies Minor is intended to give undergraduates an opportunity to gain a broad, interdisciplinary understanding of the African continent. As an interdisciplinary minor, it complements a varietyof majors. The African Studies Minor provides students with a cross-disciplinary understanding of the African continent by helping them gain a basic understanding of African history, achieve a familiarity with African cultures and societies, contextualize and analyze current African issues, and acquire at least an elementary knowledge of a language spoken on the African continent (not including English). The minor is sufficiently flexible to complement any departmental major. The African Expressive Culture Minor allows students to develop a deeper understanding of African societies, nations, ethnic groups, citizens, and their many contributions to world history and current events through the study of African expressive practices--including the visual arts, music and dance, theater and cinema, epics and oral traditions, and a large variety of other creative forms of communication such as religious and political activities and numerous types of sports and games. Effective, punctuated expression\u2014which is to say aesthetically designed and enacted communication-- carries tremendous social weight across the continent of Africa, in every nation and every culture. It is used to communicate values, to bolster and garner support for them, or subvert and change them. It is used to wield or reform political influence. It is used to gain or maintain social and economic resources. It possesses this clout because aesthetic expression is sophisticated business in African societies, and citizens from every walk of life put much stock in its importance. The minor will allow students to take several courses across a spectrum of creativity\u2014such as literature, music, and the visual arts \u2014or concentrate courses in any one of those, or even concentrate on a particular geographic region of the continent. Recognition that a student has earned a certificate or a minor appears on the transcript along with the student's major department. The certificate or minor is awarded upon graduation from Indiana University. The African Studies Program is affiliated with the new School of Global and International Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences, dedicated to providing Indiana University undergraduates with the intellectual tools they will need to live, work, and thrive in the globalized world of the twenty-first century. Degree programs associated with SGIS emphasize language proficiency, cultural competency, and in-depth training in qualitative and quantitative methodologies. SGIS students will enjoy unparalleled access to a stellar faculty and career-focused advising.

Animal Behavior Introduction The Program in Animal Behavior (ABEH) encourages students to explore the many different ways in which scientists aim to understand the physiological, environmental, and evolutionary factors influencing and constraining animal behavior, both human and nonhuman. The program offers a B.S. degree, a minor, and a certificate in animal behavior. The ABEH curriculum emphasizes courses needed to develop a background in the different disciplines that study animal behavior, providing students with the foundations they need to transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries and to reflect on the consequences of different intellectual approaches to a single problem. To complete degrees in animal behavior, students take courses in evolutionary biology, neuroscience, learning, and more. They also have the opportunity to engage in their own independent research and to participate in applied internships in which they apply their newly learned knowledge to real-world contexts such as zoos, museums, and wildlife rescue centers.

PurposeThe B.S. Degree in Animal Behavior includes courses from the different disciplines that study animal behavior, providing the interdisciplinary foundations students need to reflect on the consequences of different intellectual approaches to a single problem. The B.S. in Animal Behavior is particularly valuable for students interested in careers in animal biology and behavior (e.g. research and teaching, wildlife management and conservation, veterinary medicine, animal training, zoo management, etc.). Students have opportunities to conduct their own independent research or gain hands-on experience in animal behavior through the CISAB internship program and/or supervised laboratory research in which they apply their newly-learned knowledge to real-world contexts such as zoos, museums, and wildlife rescue centers. Animal behavior is the scientific study of everything animals do. The field of animal behavior examines the causes, functions, development, and evolution of behavior including the stimuli that affect behavior, whether external (food or predators) or internal (hormones or nervous system). The function of behavior includes both the immediate effects of behavior on an animal, and the adaptive significance of the behavior in a particular environment. The development of behavior is concerned with how behavior changes over an animal's lifetime. The evolution of behavior is concerned with origins of behavior patterns and how these change over generations.

Anthropology Introduction Anthropology is the interpretive, scientific, and comparative study of humankind. The Department of Anthropology (ANTH) offers courses in the history of the discipline, museum studies, general anthropology, and the four subfields: anthropological linguistics, archaeology, bioanthropology, and social/cultural anthropology. Anthropological linguistics concentrates on human communication through language: the structure of languages, the history of their development and interrelationship, and the social contexts for language use. Archaeology explores the material remains of cultures in the recent and distant past, seeking to understand how people once lived. Bioanthropology emphasizes primate origins, evolution, and present-day biological/ genetic variation and adaptation of human populations. Social/cultural anthropology studies contemporary and historical cultures and societies of every scale worldwide. Anthropology courses are organized by both geographical areas and interpretive themes.

Ferguson, Student Building 055, (812) 856-0905September 16, 2015 47 Major in Anthropology Purpose The B.A. in Anthropology includes courses in the history of the discipline, museum studies, general anthropology, and in four subfields: 1.Anthropological linguistics concentrates on human communication through language, the structure of languages, and the history of their development and interrelationship. 2.Archaeology deals with the origins of culture, past societies around the world, and the study of their material remains. 3.Bioanthropology emphasizes primate origins, evolution, and present day biological/genetic variation, adaptation of human populations, and disease. 4.Social/cultural anthropology studies contemporary and historical cultures and societies of every scale around the world. Anthropology is the interpretive, scientific, and comparative study of humankind. Anthropology is an excellent foundation for many careers. Employers hire anthropologists because they have strong communication skills and understand how to manage multicultural situations. Employment opportunities related directly to Anthropology include: archaeology companies, physical anthropology labs, museums and zoos, schools and universities, government agencies, and a growing number of private corporations. Requirements Students must complete a minimum of 33 credit hours in anthropology, including: 1.B200, E200, L200, and P200 2.One advanced course (300-400 level) each in three of the four subfields with prefixes \"B\" for bioanthropology, \"E\" for social and cultural anthropology, \"L\" for anthropological linguistics, and \"P\" for archaeology. Students may substitute A410 for one of these courses. 3.One course designated as having a methods component. sections taught under variable title if approved by the advisor. (Methods courses may also count toward the upper-level subfield requirement.) 4.Remaining credit hours are distributed across advanced courses (300-400 level) in any of the four subfields according to student interest. A student may count one additional course at the 200 level. A105, A107, A303, A310, E105, and E303 do not count toward the major.

Departmental Honors Program The anthropology honors program offers tutorial guidance to superior students who want to develop in-depth research interests. Students may enter the program in the second semester of their sophomore year or at any time during their junior year. Ordinarily, only students with outstanding academic records will be accepted, but applicants' strength of interest and commitment are also considered. Acceptance is made by the department chairperson or honors advisor, who will assign the student to a faculty tutor. Honors students must enroll in A399 Honors Tutorial in Anthropology, in which a thesis must be prepared from original research. A399 may be repeated once. A one- hour oral examination over the thesis will be administered during the senior year by a three-member committee, of which one member is to be selected from outside the Department of Anthropology. Eligible and interested students should consult with the departmental honors advisor. Field School and Overseas Study Anthropology is predominantly founded on field research, and students are encouraged to register for a field school. Many course requirements for the major or minor in anthropology can be met through approved field schools, and field school elective hours are applicable to any College degree. Anthropology credit for field school participation is guaranteed only for programs directed by IU anthropology faculty or with advance approval by the director of undergraduate studies for non-IU programs. Opportunities for participating in fieldwork with IU faculty also exist outside of formal field school courses. For more information about field schools and fieldwork, contact the Anthropology undergraduate academic advisor. Students are encouraged to study abroad, particularly in Indiana University overseas study programs, where they can continue to make progress toward their degrees and usually apply financial aid to program fees.

AMID currently offers an Apparel Merchandising B.S., Interior Design B.S., a Fashion Design B.A. and two minors in Apparel Merchandising and Fashion Design. In the Apparel Merchandising program, students learn to apply knowledge of the design process and design thinking to all aspects of the merchandising industry, developing both creativity and skills in critical analysis. The Interior Design program is accredited by CIDA (Council for Interior Design Accreditation) and addresses the creation, use, and analysis of interior spaces. The Fashion Design program explores the art and design of fashion products within various cultural contexts, focusing on couture and other intensively hand-made garments and accessories. AMID is also home to the IU Center for Art + Design in Columbus, Indiana, which was created to explore the intersections of various forms of art and design (for example, architecture, landscaping, public art) within a unique, urban context. Over a period of several decades, the citizens of Columbus have developed that city's infrastructure through a grass-roots \"coalition-building\" process, infusing art, design, and design thinking into many of that city's institutions and businesses. It serves as a living laboratory for study by Bloomington-based students and faculty. The Elizabeth Sage collection is another invaluable component of AMID, consisting of more than 24,000 objects of women's, men's, and children's clothing and accessories from the late eighteenth century to the present, focusing on both local clothing traditions and couture in the United States. This collection is used both for academic study and for historic preservation.

Asian American Studies Introduction The program in Asian American Studies (AAST) introduces students to the history, culture, arts, and life experiences of people of Asian descent in the United States, and in other parts of the world. The term Asian American applies to groups from diverse cultural heritages within the United States, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, Asian Indian, Pakistani, Vietnamese, Hmong, Cambodian, Burmese, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander. In attending to these populations, the undergraduate minor aims to foster awareness of Asian American experiences and contributions as part of the multicultural and multiracial history and ongoing development of the American experience, and to locate this experience in a larger global context. Its faculty members undertake a wide range of research and scholarship on issues such as Asian immigration, community development, labor market status, physical and mental health, gender and sexual politics, ethnic and diasporic identities, cultural representations, civil rights, and citizenship. Courses in Asian American Studies provide students the opportunity to deepen their understanding of these issues from an interdisciplinary perspective that includes history, sociology, literature, ethnography and media studies, political science, applied health science, and counseling psychology. Students in Asian American Studies not only learn the traditional skills in critical analysis and research, but also develop domestic and global perspectives as effective and responsible agents in a rapidly changing twenty-first century world.

Astronomy Introduction The Department of Astronomy (AST) offers courses toward the B.S. degree in astronomy and astrophysics as well as 100-level courses for non-astronomy majors. This degree program is designed to prepare students for graduate study and a subsequent career in astronomy and astrophysics. The program also serves the needs of students preparing for careers in related technical fields. Students enrolled in this program use the telescopes at the campus observatories. Ambitious students might use and/or analyze data from the Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale- NOAO Observatories, other ground-based observatories, and space-borne observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope. Students also use the extensive computing facilities in Swain Hall.

Friel Professors Haldan N. Cohn Eileen D. Friel Phyllis M. Lugger Stuart L. Mufson Catherine A. Pilachowski John J. Salzer Associate Professors Constantine P. Deliyannis Katherine L. Rhode Liese van Zee Assistant Professor Enrico Vesperini Academic Advising Kathleen Davis, Swain Hall West 244, (812) 855-2391 Major in Astronomy and Astrophysics Purpose The B.S. in Astronomy studies the entire universe\u2014its past, present and future. Topics covered in courses and research programs include our solar system (Sun, planets,68 September 16, 2015 asteroids, and comets), the life cycles of stars, our Milky Way galaxy, other galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and the large-scale distribution of both luminous and dark matter in the universe. Students in Astronomy confront fundamental questions about the nature of our universe and our place in it. They use telescopes at campus observatories. Ambitious students might use and/or analyze data from the Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale-NOAO Observatories, other ground-based observatories, and space-borne observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope. Students also use the extensive computing facilities in Swain Hall. The degree not only prepares students for graduate study and a subsequent career in astronomy and astrophysics, but also for careers in related technical fields including conducting research at universities or national facilities such as NASA centers (e.g. the Goddard Space Flight Center near Washington, DC) and national and private observatories (e.g. the National Optical Astronomy Observatory in Tucson, Arizona or the Carnegie Observatory in Pasadena, California), teaching at the college or high school level, working at planetariums and science museums, computer-support positions for NASA contractors, scientific writing, positions in the aerospace, defense, surveillance, and environmental fields, and military work. Requirements Students must complete the following Foundations, Intensive Writing, Foreign Language, Breadth of Inquiry, Critical Approaches, and Public Oral Communication requirements for the B.S. in Astronomy and Astrophysics: 1.Writing, same as the general requirements for the B.A. degree (English Composition, CASE Intensive Writing). 2.Foreign language, 3 credit hours (or the equivalent) at or above the second-year level. French, Spanish, German, or Russian is normally required. 3.Two courses in arts and humanities. 4.Two courses in social and historical studies. 5.Two courses in natural and mathematical sciences, fulfilled by major. 6.One Critical Approaches course. 7.One Public Oral Communication course. Students must complete the following requirements for the astronomy courses other than S499. Students must also complete the degree requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences. Recommendations The following physics courses are highly recommended for students planning graduate study in astronomy and astrophysics: PHYS-P 309, P340, P321, and two additional courses from PHYS-P 441, P442, P453, or P454. Other courses 117, C118. Departmental Honors Program The honors program is designed for superior students who plan to pursue graduate studies in astronomy and astrophysics. Students wishing to pursue the honors program should contact the undergraduate advisor in the Department of Astronomy during the second semester of their sophomore year or first semester of their junior year. To be admitted to the honors program, students must have a minimum overall GPA of 3.300 and a minimum GPA of 3.300 in their astronomy, mathematics, and physics courses. Students must maintain these GPAs to receive a degree with honors in astronomy and astrophysics. In the honors program, students complete the same requirements as for the regular B.S. in Astronomy and Astrophysics and in addition take Astronomy S499 Honors Research. Astronomy S499 is to be taken one or both semesters during the senior year and counts for 3 credits each time it is taken. Students will carry out research supervised by a faculty member in the department. During the second semester of the senior year, the student will write a research report and make an oral presentation describing the work to the Department of Astronomy in a minicolloquium. A Sample Schedule for Honors Astronomy and Astrophysics Program The following schedule is just an example, and there is considerable flexibility in how to schedule courses. Those considering a career in astronomy, astrophysics, or a related field should consider a more accelerated schedule, though it's also possible to complete the major requirements even if one begins taking the required courses as late as the beginning of the sophomore year. Regardless, students are strongly encouraged to seek advice in the Astronomy Department as soon as possible, to determine what kind of schedule best suits their needs and goals. Freshman Mathematics M211-M212 Physics P221-P222 Astronomy A221-A222 (Students with good high school preparation in physics and mathematics are encouraged to take A221-A222 during the freshman year.)

Biology Introduction The Department of Biology (BIOL) offers a wide range of programs, including B.A. and B.S. degrees in biology and microbiology. Because the minimal requirements for each degree differ widely and prepare students for varied careers, students should consult advisors and evaluate each degree carefully. Independent research and honors degrees can be earned under any degree program. In departmental course work the letter prefix indicates the major emphasis of the class: \"B\" cover microbiological, botanical, and zoological subjects. Contact Information Department of Biology Indiana University Jordan Hall A115 1001 E. 3rd St. Bloomington, IN 47405 (812) 855-3810 bioadv@indiana.edu http://www.bio.indiana.edu/ Faculty Chairperson Clay Fuqua Associate Chairpersons Gregory Demas Richard Hardy Distinguished Professors Keith Clay Thomas Kaufman Ellen Ketterson Curtis Lively Michael Lynch Jeffrey Palmer Rudolf Raff Loren Rieseberg Mike Wade Professors Brendel Yves Brun Lynda Delph Gregory Demas Foster Clay Fuqua James Goodson Roger Hangarter Roger Innes David Kehoe Em\u00edlia Brian Calvi Lingling Chen Yean Chooi-Odle Matthew Hahn Spencer Hall Richard Hardy Laura Hurley Daniel Kearns Justin Kumar Stefan Surzycki Michael Tansey Associate Professor, Part-time Whitney Schlegel Montooth Richard Phillips Joseph Pomerening Nicholas Sokol Andrew Zelhof Teaching Faculty Amy Berndtson Clara Cotten Pam Hanratty Jim HengeveldSeptember 16, 2015 71 Hengeveld Holdeman Nick Konkol Carl Kulow Laura Mojonnier Claire Nisonger William Ruf Peggy Schultz Senior Lecturer Judy Surzychi Academic Advising Jordan Bissell, Mary Ann Miller, Danielle Murry- Knowles, Libby Tilghman, Jordan Hall A115, (812) 855-3810 Departmental Honors Program Outstanding students in any of the departmental degree programs are urged to fulfill the requirements for an honors degree. Since independent research is an integral part of the Department of Biology honors program, students must enroll in at least two semesters of L490 Individual Study. (In some limited circumstances MSCI-M 450 and CHEM-C 409 may count in place of L490 credit.) The Undergraduate Advising Office should be consulted for other requirements, but in general, students completing course work with a minimum grade point average of 3.300, a senior thesis, and at least 6 credit hours of BIOL L490 over a minimum of at least 2 semesters or a semester and one full summer will be awarded a degree with honors. Honors students are urged to enroll in special honors courses and seminars offered by many departments in the College of Arts and Sciences. Overseas Study Students are encouraged to study abroad, particularly in the Indiana University Overseas Study programs in Australia, Bonaire, Cayman Islands, Copenhagen, Costa Rica, Great Britain, and where students may continue to make progress toward their biology degrees. For information about study abroad, contact the Office of Overseas Study , Leo R. Dowling International Center, 111 S. Jordan Avenue, (812) 855-9304. Options for Special Credit The department awards 3 hours of credit with a grade of S for E112 to students who score a 4 on the College Board Advanced Placement exam or 6 hours of credit for E111 and E112 to students who score a 5 on the College Board Advanced Placement exam. Students who have taken the College Board SAT II Biology E/M test earn credit as follows: a score of 680 on the Biology E test earns 3 credit hours of E111. A score of 680 on the Biology M test earns 3 credit hours of E112. For students who have taken the older SAT II Biology subject test, a score between 680 and 719 earns credit for E112; a score of 720 or higher earns credit for E111 and E112. This credit satisfies the introductory course requirements for majors but carries no lab credit. It is strongly suggested that students understand this material before proceeding to L211. Depending on their score, students should consider completing L112 before proceeding to L211. Nonmajors can apply the credit toward the College of Arts and Sciences Breadth of Inquiry requirements.Major in Biology\u2014B.A. Purpose The B.A. Major in Biology trains students in the major subject areas of biology while remaining the most flexible of all biology degrees offered. Minimal chemistry and mathematics requirements allow students to substitute a second major, such as computer science, chemistry, psychology, environmental studies or business.

Beginning in their eighth semester and then continuing in the summer after their fourth year and in a fifth year of study, students complete76 September 16, 2015 all of the requirements for the M.S.Ed. in Secondary Education with licensure. Students must apply and earn admittance to the School of Education's Secondary Transition to Teaching and the Master of Science in Education programs during the fall semester of their senior year. After they have completed a minimum of 90 credit hours in the College of Arts and Sciences and satisfied the Foundations, Intensive Writing, Foreign Language, Breadth of Inquiry, and major concentration requirements for the B.S. in Biology, students may apply up to 30 credit hours earned in the School of Education as College electives. The requirements for the B.S. in Biology must be completed before student teaching begins in the final spring semester of the five-year program. The two degrees (B.S. in Biology and M.S.Ed. in Secondary Education) are awarded simultaneously. Students considering this degree should seek advising from both the Department of Biology and the School of Education. Also, students are advised to check with the Office of Financial Aid (through Student Central on Union) on the effect that the transition to graduate status may have on existing undergraduate funding. Honors Courses In order to provide opportunities and challenges for superior students, the department offers honors courses equivalent to its main courses and designated with an \"S.\" These small-enrollment courses offer tightly integrated lecture and laboratory experiences that include an experimental approach and a quantitative orientation, in addition to covering the basic material taught in the regular courses. Candidates for an honors degree (see \"Departmental Honors Program\") need not necessarily take these courses but would clearly benefit from them.

The heart of the honors program is participation in an undergraduate research project within a faculty research group. This research generally begins in the freshman or sophomore year and must culminate with an honors research thesis and enrollment in G410 in the senior year.* Students in the program must maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.300. *Students are strongly encouraged to take G207 to prepare for G410, and to take G307 for successful career preparation. B.S. Chemistry/M.S. Secondary Education In an effort to address the shortage of Indiana high school teachers in certain subjects, the College, in conjunction with the IU School of Education, offers an accelerated five-year program in which students can obtain a B.S. in Chemistry and an M.S. in Secondary Education and also complete all requirements for State licensure in Secondary Education. Under this program, students complete all of the course work required for this B.S. Chemistry major by their eighth semester at IU. Continuing in the summer after their fourth year and then in a fifth year of study, students complete all of the requirements for the M.S. in Secondary Education with licensure. Students must apply and earn admittance to the School of Education's Secondary Transition to Teaching and the Master of Science in Education programs during the fall semester of their senior year. After they have completed a minimum of 90 credit hours in the College of Arts and Sciences and satisfied the Foundations, Intensive Writing, Foreign Language, Breadth of Inquiry, and major concentration requirements for this B.S. Chemistry, students may apply up to 30 credit hours earned in the School of Education as College electives. The requirements for the B.S. Chemistry must be completed before student teaching begins in the final spring semester of the five-year program. The two degrees (B.S. in Chemistry and M.S. in Secondary Education) are awarded simultaneously. Students considering this program should seek advising from both the Department of Chemistry and the School of Education. Also, students are advised to check on the effect that the transition to graduate status may have on existing undergraduate funding.

At its core, the program focuses on formal theories of mind and information. The field is inherently interdisciplinary, with contributions from computer science, psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, linguistics, biology, anthropology, and other fields. Both natural intelligence (in humans and in animals) and artificial intelligence fall within the scope of inquiry. The field deals with aspects of complex cognition, computational models of thought processing, knowledge representation, dynamics of real-world engagement, and emergent behavior of large-scale interacting systems. Goals of the Cognitive Science Program include a better understanding of mind, learning and teaching, cognitive skills, and the development of intelligent systems designed to augment human capacities in constructive ways. The Cognitive Science Program is structured to give students fundamental skills, applicable in a wide variety of information-related careers: psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, telecommunications, information processing, medical analysis, data representation and information retrieval, education, scientific research, human-computer interaction, multimedia, knowledge management, and information policy. The skills also have wide applicability in technical and expository writing, mathematical analysis, experimental techniques, and computer programming. Students interested in a cognitive science degree are encouraged to take advantage of services and opportunities that complement their academic study: advising, colloquium series, internships, research, the Student Organization for Cognitive Science (SOCS), and a free technical report series.Contact Information Cognitive Science Program Indiana University 819 Eigenmann Bloomington, IN 47406-7512 (812) 855-0031 cogsadv@indiana.edu cogs.indiana.edu Faculty Director of Cognitive Science and Provost Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences Peter Todd Arnold and Maxine Tanis Chair, History and Philosophy of Science and Medicine Elisabeth Lloyd Chancellor's Professors, Psychological and Brain Sciences Jim Craig Robert Goldstone Robert M.

Courses trace themes, problems, ideas, and techniques across these borders while instructing students in the methods and theories of comparative literary study. Courses also investigate relationships between literature and the visual arts, film, music, and other performance arts, and between literature and other disciplines such as philosophy, history, and religious and cultural studies. Majors may tailor their course work to suit their particular interests by selecting from a wide range of course offerings. Required Courses 1.General Methods and Theory C205 and C305. 2.One course each from two courses (18 credits) in Comparative Literature, at least four of which (12 credit hours) must be at the 300 level or above. Students completing a double major must consult with advisors in each major regarding stipulations. C110 may not be used to fulfill major requirements. 4.In addition to the above requirements, students must satisfy the requirements for one of the following two options: Option A - Language and Literature: One advanced course at the 300 or 400 level, or its equivalent, that includes the study of a foreign language literature in the original. Option B - Interdisciplinary Study of Literature: One of the above 300- or Course\"), paired with an additional 300- or 400- level course offered by a corresponding department. Students who choose the interdisciplinary option will select an upper-level class in an outside field in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. The student will then write a one-page explanation of why the class is suitable for the interdisciplinary track. The standing Undergraduate Committee of Comparative Literature will give final approval of the proposal. Some examples of departments and programs that offer suitable outside interdisciplinary courses include Anthropology, Fine Arts \u2014History, History, History and Philosophy of Science and Medicine, Philosophy, Political Science, Psychologicaland Brain Sciences, Religious Studies and Theatre, Drama, and Contemporary Dance. The course taken in a corresponding department must be completed on the Bloomington campus. Students must also complete the degree requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences. Recommendations for All Majors It is recommended that majors continue work in a foreign language and literature through three consecutive years, regardless of their proficiency when entering the program. Students intending to do graduate work in comparative literature are advised to begin a second foreign language. Departmental Honors Program Majors who have maintained a high level of academic achievement with a GPA of 3.300 or higher, and who have taken at least one 300-level comparative literature course, are eligible for the Honors Program. Students may qualify for graduation with honors in comparative literature in one of three ways: by completing three honors tutorials, by writing an honors paper, or by completing an honors project. An undergraduate senior seminar in comparative literature may be substituted for one of the honors tutorials. Interested students may obtain detailed information from the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Minor in Comparative Literature Students wishing to complete a minor (minimum of 15 credit hours) with the Department of Comparative Literature must complete five courses in Comparative Literature. Four courses must be at the 200 level or above with at least 3 courses (9 credits) at the 300 level or above. Note: Students who minor in comparative literature may not also minor in comparative arts. Minor in Comparative Arts Requirements Five comparative arts courses or approved cross- listed courses (minimum of 15 credit hours) At least 9 credit hours of course work (after C255) must be taken at the 300-400 level. At least two courses taken in comparative literature Note: Students who minor in comparative arts may not also minor in comparative literature. Comparative literature majors may obtain the minor in comparative arts but may not count the same courses for both the major and the comparative arts minor. Secondary Teacher Certification Students majoring in comparative literature and planning to teach at secondary schools may earn a teacher certificate for English or another language. Students considering teacher certification should consult with an advisor in the School of Education as early as possible for further information. Overseas Study All majors in comparative literature are encouraged to participate in one of the university's foreign study programs, where students can continue to make progress toward their degrees and apply financial aid to program fees.

The department offers a wide range of culture courses, open to nonmajors, that deal with virtually every facet of the cultures of East Asia. Language courses in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are offered from beginning to advanced levels. Two majors and two minors are offered. The majors differ in the amount of language required and in the specificity and range of culture courses allowed. There is a language minor in Japanese, Chinese, or Korean, and a minor in East Asian studies that requires no language training. As part of the baccalaureate training, students are encouraged to study abroad in China, Japan, or Korea on one of IU's overseas study programs. Students who are returning from East Asia or who have any background in an East Asian language prior to enrolling at IU are required to take a placement exam before enrolling in a language course. The Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures is affiliated with the new School of Global and International Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences, dedicated to providing Indiana University undergraduates with the intellectual tools they will need to live, work, and thrive in the globalized world of the twenty-first century. Degree programs associated with SGIS emphasize language proficiency, cultural competency, and in-depth training in qualitative and quantitative methodologies.

CASE A&H, CASE GCC Economics Introduction Economics is the study of how individuals and societies manage their scarce resources\u2014 people must decide how much they work, what they buy, how much they save, and how they use their leisure time. Most societies use decentralized markets as the primary means of allocating resources, so economics gives students insight into how markets function in coordinating the activities of many diverse buyers and sellers. Economics also analyzes the trends and forces that affect the economy as a whole, including growth in average income, the portion of the labor force that cannot find work, and the rate at which prices are rising or falling. A major in economics provides excellent preparation for graduate and professional school, including law school, and for rewarding careers in consulting, finance, and other private and public sector employment. The Department of Economics (ECON) offers course work in a variety of topics including microeconomic theory, macroeconomic theory, financial economics, money and banking, public finance, labor economics, international economics, economic development, game theory, and econometrics. Note: Throughout the listing of major requirements, minor requirements, and course prerequisites, any course may be replaced by the honors equivalent. All Economics and non-Economics courses listed as required for a major or minor (ECON, ECON/MATH, ECON/POLS) must be completed with a minimum grade of C-. Course prerequisites are strictly enforced. Students interested in preparing for graduate study in economics should take M211 or M213, rather than M119, and consult with theSeptember 16, 2015 143 department's undergraduate advisor regarding additional recommended mathematics courses.

Specific courses in microeconomic theory, macroeconomic theory, statistics, and mathematical modeling provide students with the tools to analyze and guide the decisions of business firms, consumers, and public-policy makers in a variety of market settings. Elective courses add breadth and depth to students' understanding of the basic tools of economic analysis by focusing on their application within specific subfields. Economics focuses on providing an understanding of how individuals and societies manage their scarce resources-- people must decide how much they work, what they buy, how much they save, and how they use their leisure time. Most societies use decentralized markets as the primary means of allocating resources, so economics gives students insight into how markets function in coordinating the activities of many diverse buyers and sellers.

Note: Students pursuing the Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science are not eligible to earn the minor. Environmental Science Introduction The B.S. in Environmental Science (B.S.E.S.) and minor in Environmental Science are degree programs offered jointly by the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Public and Environmental Affairs. The interdisciplinary B.S.E.S. program considers the environment as a scientific entity. Students preparing for professional employment or graduate study in environmental science or in one of the traditional sciences should consider this degree. While it is possible to divide environmental science into numerous subdisciplines or systems such as the atmosphere, the biosphere, the hydrosphere, and the lithosphere, these subsystems are interdependent components of a single large system. It follows that the problems encountered in the environmental sciences are inherently interdisciplinary; hence, a scientist working in this field is required to possess both a breadth of knowledge and a specific set of skills and expertise. The overall organization of the B.S.E.S. degree program reflects this philosophy with a broad core curriculum. Opportunities area also available for research projects that provide advanced hands-on experience. The minor in Environmental Science provides an interdisciplinary, science-focused course of study for students with an interest in the environment, who are pursuing other primary majors.

CASE A&H Fine Arts Introduction The Departments of the History of Art and Studio Art in the Henry Radford Hope School of Fine Arts (FINA) offer students a number of undergraduate degree programs in fine arts, including the B.A. in history of art, the B.A. in studio art, and the B.F.A. in studio art. The curricular design and goal for each of these degrees is to provide students with a balance of training in the practice, theory, and history of visual arts in order to understand and enhance the human sensibility and its diverse potential. In their classes, faculty foster an aesthetic and intellectual environment in which the highest level of creativity and critical thinking in the visual arts are studied, practiced and learned. Creative activity in Studio Art and scholarship in History of Art are enriched by the sophisticated dynamics of learning in a liberal arts context and are challengedby the rigor of knowledge generation in a leading-edge research university.

Folklore and Ethnomusicology Introduction The Department of Folklore and Ethnomusicology (FOLK) offers a major that includes the study of performance, specific cultures and regions, human diversity and worldview, and research methods. Folklore andethnomusicology emphasize fieldwork methods to learn how societies function. Fieldwork involves documenting and learning about people's lives, expressions, and beliefs in context. Through the study of different social groups and cultures, students gain skills in observation, analysis, documentation, reporting, and multicultural understanding. The study of folklore and ethnomusicology taps capacities we possess as human beings and develops the qualities we need to be informed and responsible people. Many courses in folklore and ethnomusicology fulfill Breadth of Inquiry and Culture Studies requirements. There are opportunities for direct student-faculty contact through individual and collaborative research, such as fieldwork projects, specially designed readings courses, internships in arts and cultural organizations, and performance. Additionally, the departmental honors program provides students with the opportunity to pursue an in-depth research project under the close supervision of a faculty member. Students may make use of the department's archives and state-of-the-art laboratory for sound-video analysis and production. \"Folk\" can refer to any group of people\u2014from any economic, religious, generational, or ethnic background \u2014who share a common interest. As a form of communication, folklore is created when people interact with one another. \"Lore\" represents the knowledge and artistry of a group in forms such as stories and jokes, art, architecture, music, dance, custom, belief, ritual, and festival. Folklore interprets, diffuses, or incites pressure points in modern society. Ethnomusicology is the study of music of all types and from all cultures. Ethnomusicologists not only listen to the sounds of music within particular cultures and events but also inquire into people's ideas and beliefs about music. Ethnomusicology explores the role of music in human life, analyzes relationships between music and culture, and studies music cross-culturally.

Required courses explore the making and meaning of gender across cultures and social formations and analyze gender in institutions, practices, representations, and knowledge across a range of cultural frameworks. They may also interrogate the intersections between gender and systemic forms of oppression and/ or difference, including those based on race, aboriginality, ethnicity, class, and sexual identity and desire. Students achieve a scholarly understanding of the options and situations of both women and men, in the past as well as the present. They are often encouraged to devise and execute original research projects.September 16, 2015 203 Fundamental objectives of the major pursued through each of its interdisciplinary courses are to: 1.Train students to think critically about how gender has been formed and altered in different cultures, contexts, and historical eras. 2.Equip students to identify and analyze assumptions about gender built into the varying approaches of disciplines and areas of knowledge, and to evaluate the effects of such assumptions on research, teaching, and professional profiles of the disciplines. 3.Provide students with a solid understanding of ways in which \"gender issues\" involve not only the study of women, but, as centrally, the study of men, families, workplaces, organizations, nations, economies, science, industry, laws, sexual behavior and identities, customs, mass media, sports, leisure, religion, and many other subject areas relevant to future careers of graduates. 4.Develop students' skills in undertaking research, critical analysis, and written and verbal presentations of their findings, and encourage a fully professional approach to the subject matter and content of the courses of the major. Graduates will be prepared to enter the full range of graduate and professional education. Some will become specialized researchers and scholars. In addition, the gender studies major provides a sound background relevant to employment in a variety of occupations within the private sector, the professions, government, and the nonprofit sector. Graduates can pursue occupations in public relations, advertising, or the media. Others may become lawyers, doctors, journalists, social workers, or psychologists. Still others will work in education, social services, the arts, public administration, and international aid and social justice organizations. Required Courses In addition to fulfilling the requirements for the B.A. degree in the College of Arts and Sciences, all Gender Studies majors must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours, including the following: 1.Required courses: G101 Gender, Culture, and Society, and G300 Gender Studies: Core Concepts and Key Debates. 2.Any three out of the following six core elective courses (9 credits). G206 Gay Histories/Queer Cultures G215 Sex and Gender in Cross-Cultural Perspective G290 History of Feminist Thought and Practice G310 Representation and the Body G335 Explaining Sex/Gender Differences G410 International Feminist Debates 3.At least one course must have an international/ non-Western emphasis (G102, G215, or G410 are recommended, but students may also fulfill this requirement by petition). 4.Majors must include the following: 3 credit hours at the 100 level. 3 credit hours at the 200 level 9 credit hours at the 300 or 400 level 9 additional credit hours at the 400 levelAdditional electives to meet the 30 credit hour requirement are freely chosen by the student.

The history major develops skills and tools for retrieving and interpreting the past--and, in the process, for better understanding the questions and challenges of our own time. Majors are trained to critically interpret sources and stories about the full range of people living in the past to provide an understanding of issues that remain relevant today. In the process of carrying out this work, majors will develop strong research and critical skills, creative methods for recognizing patterns of information, and techniques for clear and persuasive writing--essential skills for success in any career: research, analysis, synthesis, and effective writing. Courses cover a wide range of issues in all time periods and parts of the world. History students learn how change takes place, the tensions and conflicts it causes, and how individuals, groups, and societies change over time. Required Courses Students must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours of History classes; 18 of these credit hours must be completed on the IU Bloomington campus, and 18 credit hours must be at the 300-400 level. The major program will include: 1.Concentration: 12 credit hours (four courses) in one historical area. 2.Secondary field: 6 credit hours (two courses) in a different historical area. 3.Electives: 6 credit hours (two courses) from areas other than the concentration and secondary field categories.4.Seminars: J300 and J400 (J300 is a prerequisite for J400). Further details, including concentration and field areas, may be found at http://www.indiana.edu/~ histweb/ugrad . Students must also complete the degree requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences. Please note that students who matriculate in the summer of 2016 and later will fulfill a new set of requirements, which can be found at http://www.indiana.edu/~histweb/ ugrad/degrees.shtml . Students who began their study before summer 2016 may choose to follow the new requirements, but they should discuss the implications of this decision with the History academic advisor. Recommendations Students should consult with the History academic advisor and with departmental faculty regarding their selection of courses and their individual programs of study. Prelaw Advice The history major provides an excellent preparation for students intending to study law. In addition, those interested in legal careers should concentrate on developing particular kinds of skills needed in legal education and practice. They should, for example, develop their analytical skills by taking courses such as logic, their writing skills by taking seminars and other courses that offer structured writing exercises, and their speaking skills by taking courses in speech. Finally, since much of the law deals with marketplace issues, students interested in law should consider taking micro- and macroeconomics.

No course counting toward completion of the upper-level hours requirement of the history concentration can also be counted toward completion of the upper-level hours requirement of the African American and African Diaspora Studies concentration.

The program involves several different tracks that integrate the sciences and the humanities in a variety of ways: (1) Life Sciences; (2) Physics, Computation, and Cognition; (3) Science, Society, and Culture; (4) the Nature of Science. Required Courses Students must complete 25 credit hours\u201424 credit hours of course work divided into eight 3 credit courses, with 1 additional credit hour given for a capstone research project, typically in conjunction with one of the talks in the departmental colloquium (X333). Four courses, totaling 12 credit hours, will be in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science and Medicine, and the remaining242 September 16, 2015 four, also totaling 12 credit hours, will be spread across the other curricular units involved in the program in accordance with the chosen track. Each student's plan for a particular track must be approved by the director of the program. A 100-level core course in the history and philosophy of science and medicine is required for all students in the program. Students may select either the introductory survey course offered every semester under the course number HPSC-X 102 or a Critical Approaches (CAPP) course relevant for their chosen track taught by HPSC faculty. Prior to registration, students should check with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to make sure a specific CAPP course will count toward their chosen track. Three other HPSC courses relevant for the chosen track, one of which must be at or above the 300 level, are also required. These courses will be selected in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Four courses from other relevant units, adapted to the particular track elected by the student, will complete the program. In non- HPSC courses, at least one must be at the 300 level or above. Four courses (including both HPSC and non- HPSC courses) will be at the 300-400 level.

Note Regarding Undergraduate Courses Because the department does not offer an undergraduate major, almost no course requires a previous history and philosophy of science and medicine course for enrollment. Science and other requirements are specified only when they are essential for comprehending the course material. Guide to Course Numbers Courses at the 100 level are designed for freshmen and sophomores. Such courses are typically limited to enrollments of 35 students per section. The 200- level courses do not require extensive experience in an appropriate major and are designed for undergraduates at all levels. The 300-level courses deal with more specialized topics and may require some understanding of a particular science. The 400-level courses are specialized courses designed with college honors students particularly in mind. The 300- and 400-level courses sometimes meet with corresponding graduate courses, but will normally carry separate undergraduate requirements.

Human Biology Introduction The Human Biology (HUBI) program provides students with a holistic understanding of our species with a focus on our biology. It includes consideration of how our biology is altered by both evolutionary history and a contemporary environment that includes natural, social, and technological components, and how it is interpreted within a social and cultural context. Students explore these diverse aspects of humanity while gaining a solid knowledge of our biological foundations. In the Human Biology curriculum, students study cases from the perspectives of different disciplines, work with team members to generate and present cases, participate in experiential learning environments, conduct original research, and communicate their work to a larger community using various media. The Human Biology program is designed around a core sequence of two interdisciplinary 4-credit courses and a 3 credit senior capstone course. In addition to these, students take required courses in a variety of disciplines to gain expertise in the diverse aspects of human biology, and courses in a single area of concentration, that allow for more in-depth study in their area of interest. Each area of concentration includes courses from both the life science perspective and the historical, social, arts, and humanities perspectives.Contact Information Department of Human Biology Sycamore Hall 046 Bloomington, IN 47405 (812) 855-2250 humbio@indiana.edu www.indiana.edu/~humbio Faculty Director Professor Andrea S.

Students explore these diverse aspects of humanity while gaining a solid knowledge of our biological foundations. The focus of the B.A. is at the organismal level, with attention to lower levels as needed, and B.A. students are encouraged to investigate human biology with a broad interdisciplinary lens. Students can focus their course work in an area of concentration most suited to their interests. The B.A. degree allows for breadth and flexibility in the curriculum and the possibility for pursuing a double major. Students can also fulfill the requirements necessary for a variety of post-baccalaureate health sciences and graduate school programs. The Human Biology program is designed around a core sequence of two interdisciplinary 4 credit courses and a 3 credit senior capstone course. In addition to these, students take required courses in a variety of disciplines to gain expertise in the diverse aspects of human biology, and courses in a single area of concentration, that allow for more in-depth study in their area of interest. Each area of concentration includes courses from both the life science perspective and the historical, social, arts, and humanities perspectives. Required Courses In addition to the requirements for the B.A. degree in the College of Arts and Sciences, students must complete 38- 40 credit hours from the following: 1.

Courses taken to fulfill core course work within the major cannot be double-counted for the Area of Concentration requirement. Recommendations Human Biology Program students are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the opportunities available at IU Bloomington to complement their area of concentration by seeking internships, working in research laboratories, attending seminars, or becoming human biology peer instructors. Students are encouraged to take a course in information literacy (e.g., BIOL-L 301 Information Literacy in Biology). Students are encouraged to study abroad to gain a global perspective on the human condition. To take advantage of the many opportunities for overseas study, students should contact the Office of Overseas Study, 855-9304. Students should plan their study abroad experience carefully to accommodate HUBI core course scheduling. Major in Human Biology\u2014B.S. Purpose The B.S. Degree in Human Biology is designed to provide students with a strong scientific knowledge base in human biology, interdisciplinary perspectives on the human condition, and an opportunity to focus their course work in an area of concentration most suited to their interests. Many human biology B.S. degree students are preparing for graduate education or professional school in the health sciences, business, or law. Students can also prepare for careers in the life science industries. Core course work extends the investigation of human biology to the sub-cellular and molecular level and places the details of human biology within the larger context of biological and biochemical mechanisms common to all life forms. The Human Biology program is designed around a core sequence of two interdisciplinary 4-credit courses and a 3 credit senior capstone course. In addition to these, students take required courses in a variety of disciplines to gain expertise in the diverse aspects of human biology, and courses in a single area of concentration, that allow for more in-depth study in their area of interest.

Courses taken to fulfill core course work within the major cannot be double-counted for the Area of Concentration requirement. Recommendations Human Biology Program students are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the opportunities available at IU Bloomington to complement their area of concentration by seeking internships, working in research laboratories, attending seminars, or becoming human biology peer instructors. Students are encouraged to take a course in information literacy (e.g., BIOL-L 301 Information Literacy in Biology). Students are encouraged to study abroad to gain a global perspective on the human condition. To take advantage of the many opportunities for overseas study, students should contact the Office of Overseas Study, 855-9304. Students should plan their study abroad experience carefully to accommodate HUBI core course scheduling. Certificate in Human Biology Purpose The Certificate in Human Biology provides a broad and rigorous introduction to the biological sciences and relates these sciences to the problems raised by relationships of human beings to one another and to their environment. This distinctive program is designed to meet societal demand for students with broad biological knowledge and a scientific approach to problem-solving, who also possess an understanding of the social and cultural issues facing them as scientists. What is the biological basis of life, diversity, and disease? What is the biological basis of human behavior? How do social forces influence science and our understanding of what it means to be human? These are samples of the types of broad questions that can be explored within the Certificate in Human Biology. Required Courses A student may earn a certificate as part of completing the bachelor's degree and in addition to completing requirements for a major. Students should contact the Human Biology Program advising office to apply for the certificate. Students must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.700 at the time of admission and must maintain this GPA to graduate with the certificate. Additionally, in order to complete the certificate, students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.000 in courses taken for the certificate. Students will also be required to complete exit surveys and to develop an electronic portfolio that demonstrates the connections students have made between the courses they complete as part of theSeptember 16, 2015 249 certificate and their goals for career and further study after graduation.

India Studies Introduction The Madhusudan and Kiran C. Dhar India Studies Program (INST) seeks to provide for the interdisciplinary study and critical analysis of the cultures and civilizations that have developed on the Indian subcontinent from ancient times to the present. The primary focus of the program is on present-day or modern India, but in order to understand modern India, it is important to have some basic knowledge about the great periods in the history of India that have shaped modern Indian social reality. This approach requires a sophisticated understanding of the country's highly developed arts, music, literature, drama, philosophy, religions, and social and political structures. In addition to providing an overall, comprehensive education about Indian civilizations, the program allows for more specialized work in (a) literary and performance studies, (b) philosophical and religious studies, and (c) social, political, and historical studies. The India Studies Program also offers beginning and intermediate-level courses in several Indian languages.

The program offers courses that investigate the culture, literature, arts, philosophy, socio-political and historical dimensions of India. The curriculum allows students to pursue interdisciplinary study and critical analysis of this complex and exciting region. The primary focus of the program is on present-day or modern India, but in order to understand modern India, it is important to have some basic knowledge about the great periods in the history of India that have shaped modern Indian social reality. This approach requires a sophisticated understanding of the country's highly developed arts, music, literature, drama, philosophy, religions, and social and political structures. In addition to providing an overall, comprehensive education about Indian civilizations, the program allows for more specialized work in (a) literary and performance studies, (b) philosophical and religious studies, and (c) social, political, and historical studies. The India Studies Program also offers beginning and intermediate-level courses in several Indian languages. All students in the program are encouraged to take language classes, as well as to consider study abroad in India. Required Courses Students pursuing a major in India Studies must complete a second major (B.A.) in a department of the College of Arts and Sciences. (Students completing a simultaneous second degree program in the College or through another school should check with the advisor for details.) 1. Six credits through the fourth-semester level of a modern Indic language, Sanskrit, or an appropriate substitute which must be approved in advance by the Academic Program Committee of the India Studies Program. Students demonstrating proficiency to a level commensurate with the completion of four semesters of course work may substitute six credit hours from other India Studies courses.September 16, 2015 255 2. In addition to fulfillment of language requirements (specified above), completion of a minimum of 24 credit hours of India Studies courses, including the following: The India Studies \"core course\" At least one 3 credit course at the 300 level or above from the Literary and Performance Studies group At least one 3 credit course at the 300 level or above from the Philosophical and Religious Studies group At least one 3 credit course at the 300 level or above from the Social, Political, and Historical Studies group One 3 credit course (or course equivalent) at any level Three additional 3 credit courses at the 300 level or above, at least one of which must be at the 400 level. See the India Studies website for a listing of courses in each group. At the discretion of the Director, a student may receive credit for course work taken under the auspices of a Study Abroad program. Students wishing to receive such credit should consult their academic advisor and the Director of India Studies. Other IU course work that involves a significant amount of work related to India/South Asia, but without an India Studies designation, may also be applied to these requirements at the discretion of the Director. Students wishing to receive such credit should consult their academic advisor and the Director of India Studies. Students must also complete the degree requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences. Certificate in India Studies Required Courses The undergraduate Certificate in India Studies requires 24 credit hours, including the following: 1.I100 Introduction to India (the core course for India studies); 2.Two courses each from the three areas of specialized work in India studies (i.e., two courses from the Literary and Performance Studies group, two courses from the Philosophical and Religious Studies group, and two courses from the Social, Political, and Historical Studies group); 3.The remainder of the units will come from interdisciplinary electives in any of the areas of specialization. See the India Studies Advising Office, 825 E. Eighth Street, for a listing of courses in each area of specialization. Of the total 24 credit hours, at least 15 credit hours must be taken from courses at the 300 level or above. It should be noted that, under certain circumstances, other courses that include some aspect of the study of India may, by special arrangement and with the permission of the director of the India Studies Program, be counted toward the certificate program. The first two years of language instruction in Hindi or Sanskrit, however, do not count toward completion of the certificate.Only four courses from a student's major may be double- counted toward the Certificate in India Studies. The India Studies Program encourages work in elementary, intermediate, and advanced Hindi and Sanskrit. All students in the certificate program are strongly urged to study either Hindi or Sanskrit (and preferably both) and to begin the study of the languages at the earliest possible opportunity. Students in the program should also consider the possibility of studying in India and should consult about this possibility with the Office of Overseas Study, Franklin Hall 303, (812) 855-9304 (www.indiana.edu/~overseas ). India also has a rich English-medium cultural tradition (in such areas as Indo- British literature, drama, and Third World studies, among others), so students may choose to focus their work on these English language traditions. Minor in India Studies Required Courses 15 credit hours, chosen in consultation with the undergraduate advisor, including: 1.The India Studies \"core course\" 2.At least one course from the Literary and Performance Studies group. 3.At least one course from the Philosophical and Religious Studies group. 4.At least one course from the Social, Political, and Historical Studies group. 5.No more than 6 credit hours of course work may be taken at the 100 level. 6.At least 9 credit hours must be taken at the 300 level or above.

Only two courses from a student's major may be counted toward the India Studies minor. All students in the minor program are strongly urged to study an Indic language at the earliest possible opportunity. India also has a rich English-medium cultural tradition (in such areas as literature, drama, and Third World studies, among others), so students may choose to focus their work on these English language traditions. Overseas Study Students in the program should also consider the possibility of studying in India and should consult with the director about opportunities, and with the Office of Overseas Study , Leo R. Dowling International Center, 111 S. Jordan Avenue, (812) 855-9304. Course Descriptions INST-B 100 Introductory Bengali I (5 cr.) Basic sound patterns and writing system with ideas about grammar.

Individualized Major Program Introduction The Individualized Major Program (IMP) is an interdisciplinary program resulting in a B.A. from the College of Arts and Sciences. The IMP facilitates the creation of student-designed interdisciplinary majors whose primary emphasis is in the liberal arts. The IMP allows students with interests that cross traditional departmental and disciplinary boundaries to combine those interests in coherent and meaningful ways, building upon\u2014and using in new ways\u2014the resourcesSeptember 16, 2015 259 available in the College, and bringing in expertise from the professional schools as needed. The IMP also offers an Individualized Minor that allows students to define and pursue a cluster of courses that falls outside the standard curriculum and combine them in a transcriptable minor. This option may appeal to students with conventional majors across the campus, and it can also allow students to form their course work associated with the College's annual Themester into a coherent program. Contact Information Individualized Major Program Indiana University 129 Ballantine Hall Bloomington, IN 47405 (812) 855-9588 imp@indiana.edu www.indiana.edu/~imp Faculty Director Associate Professor Nicholas Williams (English) Assistant Director Paul Aarstad, Ballantine Hall 129, (812) 855-9588, imp@indiana.edu Individualized Major Students develop majors in consultation with faculty sponsors and propose them to committees of two faculty members selected from the IMP's Faculty Committee (IMPFC). The IMPFC is responsible for ensuring that individualized majors are distinct from fields of study available in existing degrees and majors and that they conform to College and university standards of breadth, depth, and rigor. Approved majors normally combine courses from two or more College departments, and, as needed, from the professional schools, with independent and self-directed work. In addition to granting admission to the program, faculty committees work with sponsors to monitor students' progress, evaluate theses or projects, and administer final oral reviews. Each IMP major will include at least 18 credit hours of 300-400 level course work. Students in the IMP must fulfill the College requirements for the B.A. degree. Students are eligible to apply for admission to the IMP after completing one IU semester with a GPA of 2.500 or higher, but they cannot be accepted to the IMP until they have been admitted to the College. Formal requirements for admission are otherwise the same as those for the College. Students who do not meet the GPA requirement, but who feel that their past grades do not accurately reflect their potential for success in the IMP, may request permission from the IMP director to go through the application process. Such permission allows the applicant, like other applicants, to present his or her case to an admission committee, but does not, of course, guarantee that the student will be accepted into the IMP. Students of any class standing or level of interest in the IMP are encouraged to meet with the Assistant Director and may arrange a meeting by calling (812) 855-9588 or e-mailing imp@indiana.edu .IMP students are eligible to take a second major in another department if the course credit is separate and distinct from the IMP concentration. Students in the IMP may graduate with honors if their GPA meets College honors standards and if their project work is deemed of honors quality by the IMP review committee. Individualized Minor The Individualized Major Program now offers students the opportunity to create a 15 credit hour minor on topics not otherwise available at IU. The minor may be connected with the College's annual Themester or colloquia offered through IU's centers and institutes, or on any subject for which the student is able to make a compelling case. Minors are approved by a committee of faculty based on an application and an essay in which the applicant answers the following questions: Does the minor resemble others that are regularly offered at IU Bloomington? If so, how is the proposed IMP minor different from others it may resemble? What is the principle of coherence unifying courses for the minor? What do you hope to learn from completing this minor? How does the minor complement your major? Is there a close thematic connection? Does it address an interest not otherwise reflected in your degree? Minors must include 9 credit hours of course work at the 300-400 level and adhere to the following guidelines: Individualized minors may include no more than two courses that are completed at the time the student applies. No more than two courses from a single department or administrative unit can count in an individualized minor. No more than three hours of internship and three hours of independent study courses may count in the minor. Only one course from the individualized minor can count toward other degree objectives including majors, other minors, or certificates. The individualized minor must include at least 9 credit hours of course work inside the College. Interested students should meet with the IMP assistant director to discuss the viability of their ideas. Applications are accepted once per semester. The application, instructions, and application deadlines are available on the IMP website . Students pursuing a major in the Individualized Major Program are not eligible for the individualized minor. Students pursuing an individualized minor may later choose to apply for an individualized major in the same subject or a different subject. In either case, the minor will be dropped upon admission to the major. Course Descriptions IMP-I 360 Individualized Major Program, Readings and Research (regular grading) (1-3 cr.)

International Studies Introduction Both the B.A. and the B.S. in International Studies (INTL) provide an intellectual foundation that enables students to communicate, collaborate, and work across national, cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic boundaries. By incorporating extensive foreign language study and mandating an overseas experience, these degrees foster competencies that students need in order to function successfully in a global environment. The majors are broadly constructed to allow flexibility as well as depth and breadth of regional and thematic knowledge. Students explore the majors by taking two introductory courses chosen from the following thematic concentrations: Global Health and Environment; Global Development; Human Rights and International Law; International Communication and the Arts; Identity and Conflict; and Diplomacy, Security, Governance. They are also required to complete 300- and 400-level courses that focus directly on their chosen thematic concentration. Students must choose a regional concentration area with the approval of the departmental advisor. This area can be perceived in one of two ways (students must select one): 1.An area defined geographically (either broadly defined, such as the Pacific Rim, or with a concentrated focus, such as Egypt or Germany); or 2.An area defined linguistically, religiously and/or ethnically (such as the Jewish diaspora) outside the United States. Optimally, the regional concentration chosen will relate to the student's foreign language study. Information on the Certificate in Islamic Studies administered by International Studies can be found at Islamic Studies.International Studies is affiliated with the new School of Global and International Studies (SGIS) in the College of Arts and Sciences, dedicated to providing Indiana University undergraduates with the intellectual tools they will need to live, work, and thrive in the globalized world of the twenty-first century.

Contributing departments include Anthropology, Comparative Literature, English, Fine Arts, Germanic Studies, History, Hutton Honors College, Musicology, Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, Political Science, Religious Studies, and Slavic and East European Languages and Cultures. Modern and Biblical Hebrew language courses and Hebrew literature and culture courses taught within the Jewish Studies Program offer students a way to understand Jewish culture and its historical experience through literary analysis of texts and artifacts. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the Jewish Studies Program, students enrolled in the B.A. or certificate programs have the opportunity to structure course work individually, according to their specific areas of interest. Students in the Jewish Studies Program can pursue either a B.A. in Jewish studies or a certificate in Jewish studies. Students, in addition, may complete a Jewish Studies- affiliated minor, such as the minor in Hebrew or the minor in Yiddish studies (through Germanic Studies). These programs are open to students from all academic and personal backgrounds. We encourage students planning to major in Jewish studies to see the Jewish studies advisor in their first or second semester. Students may call (812) 855-0453 to make an appointment.

On July 1, 2015, the Department of Journalism merges with the Department of Telecommunications and the Film and Media Studies faculty from the Department of Communication and Culture to form The Media School. The Media School will offer a fully revised B.A.J. that is available to new and continuing undergraduate students interested in pursuing their studies in the fields of journalism and public relations. Latin American and Caribbean Studies Introduction The Latin American and Caribbean Studies Program (LTAM) is an interdepartmental program offering integrated study opportunities to students planning careers in teaching, research, journalism, government, and business. Recognizing the varied objectives of students, the Latin American and Caribbean studies faculty has attempted to provide diverse formats and levels of study in the program. Although the program offers no undergraduate major, students may choose Latin American and Caribbean studies as a minor or obtain a certificate along with the bachelor's degree in an academic discipline. In either case, the program provides the student with a basic knowledge of the anthropology, art, economics, folklore, geography, history, languages, literatures, music, and politics of Latin America. These credentials are especially useful to students who contemplate advanced study in the area or who plan to work or live in Latin America. Students may elect to complete the minor or the certificate but not both. The Latin American and Caribbean Studies Program is affiliated with the new School of Global and International Studies (SGIS), an autonomous unit within the College of Arts and Sciences, dedicated to providing Indiana University undergraduates with the intellectual tools they will need to live, work, and thrive in the globalized world of the twenty-first century. Degree programs associated with SGIS emphasize language proficiency, cultural competency, and in-depth training in qualitative and quantitative methodologies. SGIS students will enjoy unparalleled access to a stellar faculty and career-focused advising. SGIS serves an economically, culturally and generationally diverse student body.Contact Information Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies Indiana University The Global and International Studies Building 355 North Jordan Avenue Bloomington, IN 47405-1105 (812) 855-9097 clacs@indiana.edu www.iub.edu/~clacs/ Faculty Director Associate Professor Anke Birkenmaier (Spanish and Portuguese) Lecturers Quetzil Casta\u00f1eda (Latin American and Caribbean Studies) Alfio Saitta (Latin American and Caribbean Studies) Affiliated Faculty Distinguished Professors Richard Bauman (Emeritus, Folklore and Ethnomusicology, Anthropology, Communication and Culture) Keith Clay (Biology) Emilio Moran (Rudy Professor Emeritus, Anthropology) Richard Wilk (Anthropology) Chancellor's Professors Robert Arnove (Emeritus, School of Education) Patrick McNaughton (History of Art) Anya Peterson Royce (Anthropology, Comparative Literature) Bernardo Mendel Professor Daniel James (History) Rudy Professors Jeffrey L.

CASE A&H Liberal Arts and Management Program Introduction The Liberal Arts and Management Program (LAMP) is an honors-level, interdisciplinary certificate program offered by the College of Arts and Sciences in cooperation with the Kelley School of Business. LAMP combines a liberal arts or science major with specialized training in business and management to prepare strong students with wide interests and leadership potential for exciting futures. Selected on a competitive basis, undergraduates pursuing a major in the College of Arts and Sciences enter the three-year LAMP program as sophomores. LAMP students acquire both technical business and management skills and an understanding of the social, political, and cultural contexts that shape business life. Building on the bachelor's degree requirements of the College, students in LAMP take courses in management, business law, and computer applications in the Kelley School of Business and economics courses in the College. To draw together their course work in business, economics, and liberal arts, LAMP students take the program's own seminars. Through LAMP seminars, students engage in dynamic, deeply thought-provoking writing- and discussion-centered learning. As they solve real-world business problems and analyze the relationships between business and society, students connect with faculty who bring many perspectives from different disciplines. Admission to LAMP LAMP has two application periods each academic year: freshmen may apply online during the spring semester and sophomores and transfer students during the fall semester. Candidates for LAMP will be selected on284 September 16, 2015 the basis of their academic achievement and promise, leadership potential, and ability to articulate their reasons for pursuing an interdisciplinary program combining arts and sciences with business. Typically, applicants will not yet be students in the College of Arts and Sciences when they are admitted to LAMP. In order to continue in the program, students must declare their major in a department of the College during their sophomore year and maintain an overall grade point average of 3.300 or higher. Although it is not required for admission, LAMP encourages interested students to prepare themselves during the freshman year for the program's curriculum by taking the following: 1.Foundations requirement in English Composition. 2.MATH-M 118 or S118 Finite Mathematics; or MATH- M 119 Brief Survey of Calculus; or MATH-M 211 Calculus I; or MATH-M 213 Accelerated Calculus. 3.At least one semester of a foreign language. 4.ECON-E201 or S201 Introduction to Microeconomics. 5.At least one course in the intended major area.

Bachelor of Liberal Studies Purpose The Bachelor of Liberal Studies (B.L.S.) Degree offers a strong liberal arts and sciences foundation and is designed for students who have a wide variety of interests. Because B.L.S. students choose a broad concentration area rather than a specific major, the degree offers increased flexibility that makes it unique both in the College of Arts and Sciences and Indiana University. Students who plan carefully often find that they can easily add multiple College-approved minors and certificates to their B.L.S. degree. B.L.S. graduates are able to bring a diverse set of skills and knowledge into the workforce and pursue careers in a variety of fields, such as business, education, law, government, healthcare, real estate, social services, and industry. Some B.L.S. students go on to earn advanced degrees at professional and graduate schools. (Note: Effective May 2014, the Bachelor of Liberal Studies replaced the Bachelor of General Studies. Students with questions about how this change affects them should contact a B.L.S. academic advisor.) Concentrations B.L.S. students complete at least 30 credit hours of approved courses in one of the following areas of concentration: Arts and Humanities (A&H): Students who choose this concentration examine the complexity of human experience, interrogate the range of human thought and emotion, interpret varieties of aesthetic expression, and grapple with moral issues. The focus of the concentration is the development of interpretive and critical thinking skills. Social and Historical Studies (S&H): Students who choose this concentration analyze social institutions, the behavior of individuals in social contexts and historical settings, and changes in social conditions over time. This286 September 16, 2015 focus of the concentration is the development of skills in inquiry and analysis, as well as overall social awareness. Natural and Mathematical Sciences (N&M): Students who choose this concentration develop an understanding of physical and biological phenomena, systematic investigation, the value of scientific inquiry and hypothesis testing, and the role and approaches of mathematics. The focus of the concentration is the development of skills related to problem solving, data collection and interpretation, and quantitative reasoning. To see which courses may count toward a given concentration area, please see the College of Arts and Sciences CASE Designations webpage and filter the list using the appropriate concentration area from the \"CASE Breadth of Inquiry\" menu.

Mathematics Introduction Mathematics explores patterns in numbers, space, nature, music, science, and art. Its precise language facilitates qualitative and quantitative analysis of these patterns, and often connects them with completely unexpected areas of application. Mathematicians are creative and disciplined analytic thinkers who work in diverse areas of business, industry, government, finance, insurance, and education. Mathematics underpins the natural and life sciences, economics, and computer science, and affords dynamic double degree opportunities. A math degree also prepares a student for graduate or professional school in statistics, medicine, law, or the natural sciences, and for a mathematical research career. The mathematics major curriculum begins with the two- semester sequence M211 and M212, Calculus I and II. Students with strong prior preparation in Calculus I may qualify to enroll in M213, a one-semester accelerated version of M211 and M212. Students with both strong prior preparation in Calculus I and outstanding ability and interest in the study of mathematics may qualify to enroll in S212 Honors Calculus II. Consent of the department is required in order to register for M213 or S212; contact the undergraduate advisor or director of undergraduate studies. Advanced Placement (AP) Credit High school students who have taken the CEEB Advanced Placement Program mathematics examinations will be awarded credit as follows: A score of 4 or 5 on the Calculus AB exam earns a student 4 credits of M211. A score of 4 or 5 on the Calculus BC exam earns a student4 credits of M211 and 4 credits of M212. Special credit will be awarded with the grade of S. Credit by Examination Credit for M118, M119, M211, M212, and certain other courses may be obtained by passing an examination administered by the mathematics department with a grade of at least a B.

Students choosing this major should carefully consider the different types of courses available and how different areas of math may complement her/his interests and goals. Math B.A. majors take courses in at least two areas (see \"coursework\" below). Math B.A. majors gain general analytical and problem-solving skills that are both useful and marketable. They also gain a broad perspective of the power and beauty of mathematics. Required Courses Majors must complete the following: 1.M211-M212, M211-M213, or M211-S212. 2.M301 or M303, and M311. 3.Five additional courses representing at least two of the eight areas of mathematics listed below. Of these, two courses must be 400-level \"M\" courses. If courses are chosen from only two areas, the two 400-level \"M\" courses must For any mathematics course not listed above, the department will determine whether it will count toward the conditions in number 3. At most, one course from mathematics education and history may count toward the five required courses. With approval of the Department of Mathematics, one course outside of mathematics that has significant mathematical content may count toward the five required courses as long as conditions in number 3 are still satisfied. Computer Science C211 or A201 is recommended. Recommendations In addition to studying mathematics courses, all majors are strongly encouraged to study in depth another discipline that uses mathematics. Majors are also strongly encouraged to take a computer programming course.

For students who qualify for honors, Mathematics S499 may replace the second course in a mathematical area with approval of the Department of Mathematics. 3.Statistics: Economics E370 or Mathematics M365. Special Considerations 1.No more than 3 credit hours of Honors Thesis (Economics E499 or Mathematics S499) may be counted toward the major. 2.It is recommended that students planning to pursue a Ph.D. in economics consult with the Department of Economics concerning classes in the areas of analysis, econometrics, and statistics. 3.It is recommended that students in actuarial studies consult the \"Actuarial Studies\" section in Mathematics for recommended course work and consult with the Department of Economics concerning relevant seminar courses. B.S. Mathematics/M.S. Secondary Education In an effort to address the shortage of Indiana high school teachers in certain subjects, the College, in conjunction with the IU School of Education, offers an accelerated five-year program in which students can obtain a B.S. in Mathematics (either Program I or Program II) and an M.S. in Secondary Education and also complete all requirements for State licensure in Secondary Education. Students must begin by pursuing a B.S. Mathematics degree, Program I or Program II. After they have completed a minimum of 90 credit hours in the College of Arts and Sciences and satisfied the Foundations, Intensive Writing, Foreign Language, Breadth of Inquiry, and major concentration requirements for this B.S. Mathematics major, students may apply up to 30 credit hours earned in the School of Education as College electives. Students must apply and earn admittance to the School of Education's Secondary Transition to Teaching and the Master of Science in Education programs during the fall semester of their senior year. The B.S. requirements must be completed before student teaching begins in the final spring semester of the five-year program. The two degrees (B.S. Mathematics and M.S. Secondary Education) are awarded simultaneously. Students considering this program should seek advising from both the Department of Mathematics and the School of Education. Also, students are advised to check on the effect that the transition to graduate status may have on existing undergraduate funding. Actuarial Studies Actuaries use mathematics to determine the financial effect that uncertain future events such as birth, death, retirement, fire, earthquake, accident, and sickness have on insurance and other benefit plans. Actuaries may work for insurance companies, consulting firms, or the benefits departments of general businesses and government agencies. The program of study outlined below combined with a B.A. or B.S. degree in mathematics prepares the graduate for entry into the actuarial profession. The B.S. Program II with a Minor in Economics, or the Interdepartmental Major in Mathematics and Economics, works especially well with actuarial career preparation. For further information, contact the mathematics department's academic advisor in Rawles Hall 115, (812) 855-1589. To advance in the actuarial profession, one must pass a series of highly challenging examinations given by the Society of Actuaries ( www.soa.org ) or the Casualty Actuarial Society ( www.casact.org ). Passing these examinations requires discipline and additional study beyond Indiana University course work. Actuaries also must be comfortable with the language and substance of a wide range of mathematics, economics, statistics, and finance/accounting to prepare for these exams. An actuary student should aim to pass at least one, and preferably two, of these examinations before graduation. Actuary students who desire a summer internship may benefit from passing the first examination, Exam P, by the summer following their junior year. Internships help assure strong job placement upon graduation and are strongly encouraged. Additionally, an actuary student should take some VEE (Validation by Educational Experience) accredited courses and must receive a grade of B- or better in these courses to earn VEE credit. A list of VEE- accredited courses is available at the Society of Actuaries website and includes several of the courses mentioned below. M463 covers most of the material for the three-hour Exam P on probability. Students must take M211, M212, M311, and either M301 or M303 as preparation. Economics E425 covers the syllabus for the 2.5-hour Exam FM on Financial Mathematics, but students must first take E201, E202, and E321 as preparation. Students pursuing actuarial studies may benefit by taking Accounting A200, Computer Science C211, and Economics E471 and E472.

Media School, The Introduction The educational mission of The Media School at Indiana University is to provide students with the means to develop the abilities critical for interpreting and evaluating the mass of mediated information circulating in modern societies; to develop an understanding of how the mass media work--how they produce meaning, how they are organized, and how to use media wisely and ethically as informed citizens participating in a global digital world. The mission carries a huge responsibility along with the opportunity for a strong societal impact: how to develop the ability to create and manage media messages that provide citizens with the information they need to make the best possible decisions about their lives, their communities, their societies, and their governments. The Media School was inaugurated in 2014. For more about its history, see \"The Media School\u2014A History.\" The journalism program, an integral part of The Media School, is presently housed in Ernie Pyle Hall, a building named for a renowned reporter who was killed in World War II. For more on Ernie Pyle and his legacy, see \"Ernie Pyle.\" Faculty CoursesDegrees, Majors, Concentrations, Certificates and Minors B.A. in Journalism News Reporting and Editing Public Relations B.A. in Media Cinema and Media Arts\u2014Studies and Production Interactive and Digital Media Media Advertising Media Management, Industry, and Policy Media Science Media Technologies and Cultures B.S. in Game Design Certificates Journalism New Media and Interactive Storytelling Minors (for students with majors outside The Media School) Global Media Media and Creative Advertising Media and Diversity Media Law and Ethics Media Persuasion Media, Sex and Gender Contact Information The Media School Indiana University Room 200 Ernie Pyle Hall Bloomington, IN 47405 (812) 855-9247 mediaschool@indiana.edu www.mediaschool.indiana.edu Faculty Founding Dean James Shanahan Elizabeth Grabe Faculty* Akin Adesokan Castronova Barbara Cherry Galen Clavio Joseph Coleman Nancy Comiskey Mike Conway Stephanie De Boer Elizabeth EllcessorSeptember 16, 2015 303 William Emigh Anthony Fargo Julia Fox Terri Francis Kelley Benham French Thomas French Walt Gantz Baerbel Goebel-Stolz Amy Gonzales Mary Gray Joan Hawkins Norbert Herber Ron Johnson Minjeong Kang James Kelly Susan Kelly Steve Krahnke James Krause Annie Lang Gerry Lanosga Bonnie Joshua Malitsky Michael Martin Shannon Martin Nicole Martins Laura Meadows Michael McGregor Emily Metzgar Elaine Monaghan Jessica Gall Myrick Radhika Parameswaran Bryant Paul Jason Peifer Matt Pierce Rob Potter Ryan Powell Steve Raymer Anne Ryder Harmeet Sawhney Susanne Schwibs Mike Sellers Jon Simons Michael Uslan Gregory Waller Andrew Weaver Teresa White Lars Willnat Craig Wood Paul Wright Sung Un Yang *For more information about Media School faculty research and interests, please see http:// mediaschool.indiana.edu/faculty/ . Academic Advising Janis BollingKate Goldstein Lauren Kinzer Jeanne Myers Jay Showalter For more information, please see the Undergraduate Advisor's List . The Media School Curriculum\u2014A Rationale Each Media School degree program will equip students with a portfolio of deep knowledge and training that includes three key elements: 1) A broad liberal arts education designed to foster media literacy by incorporating: integrated training in and analysis of verbal and visual communication processes and the related ethical and policy-related questions; study of practices across multiple media platforms that affect and inform beliefs, attitudes, values, identities, and behaviors of individuals, groups, and the public; and critique and application of media design, innovation, and practice focusing on multiple platforms of media including emergent forms. 2) Development and mastery of professional skills, such as narrative and investigative writing; entrepreneurship; film, videogame and Web design, and sound production; data gathering, analysis and organization; and organizational management that informs digital communication. Instructions in these skills will be provided both within the School and through partnering with the School of Informatics and Computing in digital media, the Jacobs School of Music in the recording arts, and other appropriate Schools. 3) Respect for the role and mission of journalism and media as essential contributors to a free and democratic society in an historical moment when media are increasingly concentrated and where reliable information may be obfuscated by a growing volume of unreliable information. As part of their degree programs, students in The Media School degree programs will receive specialized training in journalism, media and film analysis and production, and digital technology in media. No matter which degree they earn, Media School graduates will demonstrate an understanding of: media literacy in the twenty-first century media history, theory and criticism media production as a craft, a profession and a public good cultural diversity and worldliness professional media ethics and responsibilities media management practice and issues the impact and role of media institutions and professionals in contemporary society304 September 16, 2015 B.A. in Media Purpose Students pursuing the Bachelor of Arts in Media will complete the 12-credit Media School core as well as a 15-credit concentration and an approved 9-credit specialization associated with their concentration. The degree shares its structure with the other undergraduate degrees offered through The Media School. Students pursuing the B.A. in Media study the organization and practices of mass media in our current era with a focus on how mass media work, produce meaning and shape society. They receive integrated instruction in verbal and visual communication including the study of practices across multiple media platforms that affect and inform beliefs, attitudes, values, identities, and behaviors of individuals, groups, and the public; and practice critique and application of media design, focusing on multiple platforms of media including emergent forms. Courses teach students to interpret and evaluate the huge mass of mediated information from a critical perspective so that they can use media wisely and ethically. They learn how to participate as informed citizens in a global digital world. The streamlined and flexible design of the major incorporates foundational, theoretical, and skills coursework focused on the convergence of information technologies and the rapid evolution in the fields of cinema, advertising, telecommunications, digital media, game design and other emerging media platforms. Required Course Work Students pursuing the B.A. in Media will complete a four- tiered set of requirements comprised of: 1. The Media School Core , which includes: A.MSCH-C 101 Media, an introductory course that stakes out the large theoretical, ethical and practical concerns that drive teaching and research in The Media School (3 cr.) B.Three courses from the Media Core\u2014Concept Clusters (9 cr.) a.One course in Managing Media b.One course in Thinking Media c.One course in Making Media Students will complete one course from each list. These courses investigate the concepts, skills, and techniques students will learn in their \"MSCH\" classes as they map onto the complex and rapidly evolving landscape of contemporary media. They should foster a sense of cohort identity among majors in The Media School. Some concentrations require that students use a particular Managing, Thinking, or Making course to fulfill prerequisites for upper-level coursework. See \"Choosing Managing/Thinking/Making Courses Based on Degree Sequence.\" 2. Media Concentration --A five-course concentration that provides students with a disciplinary framework and specialized training in particular fields of study, production, and management. (15 cr.) Concentrations include: A.Cinema and Media Arts--Studies and Production B.Interactive and Digital Media C.Media AdvertisingD.Media Management, Industry, and Policy E.Media Science F.Media Technologies and Cultures 3. Capstone seminar or project associated with the concentration or specialization. Credits for the capstone experience can be counted towards the required 15 credit hours in concentrations or the required 9 credit hours for specializations. 4. The Media School Specialization \u2014At least one three-course specialization (9 cr.) The Media School specializations combine advanced education in related professional and creative skills from courses taught across the entire Media School curriculum. Specializations allow students to develop specific transcriptable skill sets. Some concentrations specify appropriate specializations and others allow students to choose any one of the listed specializations. Audio Journalism Graphic CommunicationNew Media Marketing Broadcast JournalismHealth CommunicationNews Writing Creative Industry ManagementMedia Advertising Photojournalism Digital Journalism Media and DiversityPolitics and Media Game Art Media Law and EthicsPublic Relations Game Audio Media Persuasion Sex, Gender and Media Game Production Media Psychology Video Journalism Global Media Media Research Web Students must also complete the degree requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences. Cinema and Media Arts--Studies and Production (CMASP) Concentration Purpose Cinema and Media Arts\u2014Studies and Production (CMASP) students will take five courses within the concentration. All students will take courses in both \"Cinema and Media Arts Production\" and \"Cinema and Media Arts Studies\" to build the skills associated with the creation and a critical understanding of film, television, and digital, screen and aural media. In so doing, they come to understand and engage with both the meanings of media and the processes through which meanings are constructed within a broad range of contexts. Cinema and Media Production courses prepare students for careers in motion picture production for cinema, television and some aspects of games and web-based communication. In addition to courses that introduce them to historically important film, television and digital media, students will learn the proper practice and techniques of image capture, manipulation, finishing and distribution. The media production field is labor intensive, and students must be able to create different products for multiple purposes with emerging technology. Students will be able to:September 16, 2015 305 practice technical and professional skills essential to careers in motion picture production for cinema, television and some aspects of games and web; create original works that demonstrate skills learned in hands-on courses, including cinematography, editing, film production, field and location production, documentary production, scriptwriting, studio production, audio and many others; identify and employ emerging technologies to create products for multiple purposes on distinct platforms for a variety of audiences; and demonstrate an appreciation of the history of film, television, and digital media as outlets for aesthetic expression, political mobilization and cultural circulation. Cinema and Media Studies courses provide theoretical, critical, and historical study of cinema, television, digital, and aural media. They enable students to understand and utilize the critical interpretive skills, historical research methods, and comparative forms of analysis and thinking that are crucial to meaningfully creating and fully engaging with media in their contemporary and historical contexts. Given the ever-changing mediascape and the rich history of media over the past 150 years, Cinema and Media Studies takes a broad and inclusive view of the field, addressing non-commercial as well as commercial media, examining products and artifacts in and out of the cultural mainstream, and studying media across a broad range of national, transnational, and global frameworks. Students will be able to: analyze cinema, television, digital and aural media applying a variety of theoretical and historical concepts and critical techniques; conduct research on contemporary and historical media topics addressing commercial and non- commercial products and artifacts and situating these discussions within a broad range of national, transnational, and global frameworks; identify, evaluate and critique the aesthetic, ideological, and historical aspects of media texts; situate media artifacts and products as works of cultural work of representation impacted by the dynamics of media industries and production including the processes of media circulation, distribution, and exhibition; and describe and interrogate questions related to the reception, uses and impact of media artifacts and products. Cinema and Media Arts\u2014Studies and Production (CMASP) Concentration Requirements 1.

One 9-credit hour advertising-approved specialization, chosen in consultation with an advisor. Media Management, Industry and Policy (MIP) Concentration Purpose Management, Industry and Policy students will attain a general knowledge and familiarity with the structures of the media \"ecosystem,\" from television to movies, from games to conventional journalism, to broadband and mobile applications and beyond. This \"ecosystem\" is a complex environment in which people, law, policy, ethics, history, innovation, technology, and organizations function together to create and distribute media content for many different purposes. For this reason, many courses are taught from a \"macro\" point of view with the intent to help students understand the motivators and pressures which help and limit the success of creative industry of any size, anywhere. Students must also attain specific knowledge and work methods to enable them to work professionally within the creative industry. While journalism companies and movie studios may share an environment, within their organizations they are very different. These differences are cultural, social, economic, geographical, and ideological. While the attainment of general knowledge helps students appreciate how these businesses are similar, specific knowledge and work methods will help them understand the differences.

The degree shares its structure with the other undergraduate degrees offered through The Media School. This overall design provides students with a liberal arts education and includes the necessary training and tools to thrive in our digital era. Media School undergraduates will be taught to think critically, creatively and independently. They will learn to conduct research, evaluate information, and write and edit using the forms and styles appropriate to a variety of media. In addition to completing coursework and requirements specific to the B.A.J., students will also complete a second concentration consisting of 24 hours in a field other than journalism or public relations. This second concentration may include the requirements for a B.A. in Media concentration (with appropriate specialization) or completion of a College- approved certificate or minor. In all cases, the second concentration must include at least 24 credit hours. The learning objectives of the B.A.J. combine the strengths of a broad-based liberal arts curriculum with a hands-on and practical approach to preprofessional training in the field of journalism. Concentrations: News Reporting and Editing Public Relations B.A.J. Learning Objectives Students pursuing the Bachelors of Arts in Journalism degree learn to read, think, and communicate clearly, critically, and creatively. The program is committed to liberal education in the arts and sciences as well as to professional training in the skills of journalism and mass communication. To achieve this balance, the B.A.J. requires students to complete at least 72 credit hoursSeptember 16, 2015 313 in coursework outside the disciplines of journalism and mass communication. The Media School believes that both breadth and depth of learning must characterize the undergraduate journalism experience. To this end, the Bachelor of Arts in Journalism degree emphasizes: development of strong skills in writing, critical thinking, independent learning, mathematics, foreign language, computers, and new information technologies; exposure to a broad range of coursework in the liberal arts and sciences, both in the College of Arts and Sciences and in the liberal arts courses within IU Journalism; understanding of cultures outside the United States and of minority cultures within the United States; training in the professional skills of journalism and mass communication, including reporting, writing, editing, visual communication, new communications technology, and collaborative group work; training in statistical analysis and quantitative and qualitative research methods; awareness of the institutions, processes, and effects of mass media in society; in-depth exploration of a subject other than journalism and mass communications; preparation for a lifetime of learning. Second Concentrations\u2014Bachelor of Arts in Journalism Options for Completion To achieve the breadth of knowledge and expertise and to refine the critical thinking, analytic reasoning and problem- solving skills essential for future success, B.A.J. students must complete a second concentration of at least 24 unique credit hours in a field other than Journalism or Public Relations. As a means of completing the second concentration, students may choose to pursue: 1.a certificate listed in the College of Arts and Sciences Bulletin; 2.a concentration and specialization from the B.A. in Media (see stipulations below); 3.a minor listed in the College of Arts and Sciences Bulletin (see stipulations below); or 4.one of the approved second concentrations available outside the College as listed below. 5.With written approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS), students have the option to complete a second concentration following the major requirements of any College of Arts and Sciences departments offering the B.A. degree. This option is not a second degree from the College of Arts and Sciences.* See the list of College minors, College certificates, and other credentials transcripted by the College. Second Concentrations\u2014General Policies Students must complete a minimum of 24 credit hours. Students using certificates or minors and other credentials that require fewer credit hours are required to complete additional coursework to meet the 24 credit hour minimum.Students must earn a C- or higher in each course and a grade point average of at least 2.000 in all courses taken for the second concentration (exceptions: see Business and Informatics below). Second Concentration policies for the inclusion of coursework associated with minors, certificates, and majors outside The Media School : Students must meet with an advisor of the department offering the certificate or minor, obtain the advisor's signature on a planned program, and submit a copy of the program to the Media School advisor. Students including a minor, certificate, or concentration awarded by the College or unit outside The Media School, as a part of completing their second concentration, must follow standard policies for declaring these credentials. Completion of the B.A.J. second concentration will not result in transcription of these outside credentials. Completion of the B.A.J. second concentration will not result in automatic transcription of these outside credentials. Outside credit hours applied to the B.A.J. second concentration will be included in the 100 College of Arts and Sciences credit hours. Second Concentration policy for the inclusion of coursework associated with a second concentration and specializations awarded within The Media School Students electing to complete their B.A.J. Second Concentration with one of the 15 credit hour concentrations available through the B.A. in Media must also complete an appropriate 9 credit hour Media School specialization to achieve the 24 credit hour minimum. Students pursuing this option must select at least 12 credit hours of coursework that is not traditionally associated with journalism, public relations, or the other mass communications disciplines. MSCH-F prefix courses, as well as any course that does not use the MSCH course subject code that is listed in the concentration or specialization requirements, can count towards the 12 outside hours.

Ernie Pyle by Jon Dilts, Professor Emeritus of Journalism Ernie Pyle came to Indiana University to study journalism in 1919 but left in his senior year without a degree. Some say it was because of a romance. Some say it was because he had a job offer at the La Porte (Indiana) Herald. In any case, he worked at La Porte for only a few months before going to Washington, D.C., to join the staff of the Washington News, first as a reporter and eventually as its managing editor, a job he never liked. What Ernie Pyle did like was writing. In the 1930s he became a roving reporter for Scripps Howard Newspapers, traveling widely and writing a column about the lives of ordinary folks coping with the Depression. He was already a popular journalist, noted for his humor and humanity, when the United States went to war in the 1940s. His popularity soared when he traveled to Europe and later to the Pacific to write about the lives of ordinary soldiers coping with war. For many at home, Ernie Pyle's columns were the real story of World War II\u2014the story of sons and husbands living a deadly adventure day by day in a foreign land. Ernie Pyle came back to Indiana University in 1944. He visited with students working at the Indiana Daily Student, a newspaper for which he had once served as editor-in- chief. The university presented him with the first degree of Doctor of Humane Letters it had ever bestowed. Shortly afterward, he made arrangements to join the American armed forces fighting in the Pacific. Ernie Pyle died on the Pacific island of Ie Shima on April 18, 1945. A sniper fired at his jeep and Pyle took cover in a ditch. He raised his head to look for one of the soldiers who was with him and was killed instantly. Ernie Pyle Hall is the only building on campus named for a student. For those of us who study at Indiana University, he will always be a student\u2014always working on that elusive bachelor's degree, always editing the student newspaper, always admonishing us to write about the people who matter\u2014not the people who think they matter.September 16, 2015 317 Choosing Managing/Thinking/Making Courses Based on Degree Sequence The Managing/Thinking/Making classes serve two roles in The Media School curriculum. A.As a complement to MSCH-C 101 Media, they provide a more focused introduction to the intellectual approaches, creative practices, and analytical methods employed by particular concentrations and specializations within The Media School. B.Managing/Thinking/Making courses also function as pre-requisite courses preparing students for upper- level work associated with the Concentrations and Specializations. The table below lists recommended Managing/Thinking/ Making courses for the various concentrations associated with the B.S. in Game Design, the B.A.J., and the B.A. in Media. Only the B.S. in Game Design and the Media Science Concentration in the B.A. in Media make recommendations in more than one of these categories, leaving students some flexibility to choose courses in the other categories based on their interests and curiosity.

Courses in the department emphasize clear and cogent thinking about fundamental problems, locate the origins of these problems in the writings of the great philosophers, and provide in-depth examinations of proposed solutions. Prerequisites for courses may be waived with consent of instructor. Contact Information Department of Philosophy Indiana University Sycamore 026 Bloomington, IN 47405 (812) 855-7088 clarkma@indiana.edu http://www.indiana.edu/~phil/ Faculty Chairperson Gary Ebbs Halls Professor Allen Wood Rudy Professor Marcia Baron Professors Gary Ebbs Mark Kaplan Kirk Ludwig David C. McCarty Michael McRobbie Timothy W. O'Connor Frederick Schmitt Joan Weiner Rega Wood Associate Professors Kate Abramson Adam Leite Sandra Shapshay Assistant Professors Rosa Cao Pieter Hasper342 September 16, 2015 Senior Lecturer Leah Savion Director of Undergraduate Studies Adam Leite, Sycamore Hall 107, (812) 856-4148 Academic Advising Nathan Hendershott, Ballantine Hall 437, (812) 855-6263 Major in Philosophy Purpose The B.A. Major in Philosophy provides intellectual training by acquainting students with some of the most important developments in the history of ideas. Courses in the department emphasize clear and cogent thinking about fundamental problems, locate the origins of these problems in the writings of the great philosophers, and provide in-depth examinations of proposed solutions. The major in philosophy leads to the B.A. degree and is flexible enough to meet the needs and interests of those who are not planning to become professional philosophers, as well as the needs and interests of those who do have such plans. Required Courses Students must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours in philosophy. No more than 3 credit hours of course work in the category of introductory courses (that is, any 100-level course or P240 or P270) may be included in the 30 credit hour minimum. Students are required to take: 1.P250 Introductory Symbolic Logic. 2.One course at or above the 200 level in history of philosophy. 3.One course at or above the 300 level in ethics and value theory. 4.One course at or above the 300 level in epistemology and metaphysics. 5.One 400-level course from among the following: P401 Special Topics in the History of Philosophy P470 Special Topics in Philosophy P498 Senior Seminar P499 Honors Thesis 6.A minimum of 18 credit hours must be completed at the 300-400 level. Students must also complete the degree requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences. Recommendations An exemplary plan of course work for majors who are considering graduate study in philosophy might be as follows: one course in logic (P250, which should be completed at the earliest opportunity); four courses in the history of philosophy (e.g., P201, P211, P301 or P304, and P401); two courses in epistemology and metaphysics (e.g., P310 and P312); and two courses in ethics and sociopolitical philosophy (e.g., P340 or P342). Varied interests in particular areas of philosophy will suggest other equally worthwhile plans of course work. Transfer of Credits toward Major Students planning to transfer philosophy credits toward a major in philosophy should consult with the director of undergraduate studies. Of the 30 credit hours required forthe major in philosophy, at least 18 must be completed in residence on the Bloomington campus. These 18 credit hours will usually be 300- and 400-level courses taken from at least three of the following areas: logic, ethics and social-political philosophy, history of philosophy, and epistemology and metaphysics. Departmental Honors Program Outstanding undergraduate majors in philosophy may be eligible for participation in the Philosophy Honors Program. Prior to their last two semesters of enrollment as majors, interested students should apply to the director of undergraduate studies. Applicants must have a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.300, and this minimum must be maintained until graduation. An Honors Program participant is expected to take P498 (4 cr.) under the direction of a faculty advisor, to engage in independent study of a self-selected topic in philosophy. The candidate for Philosophy Honors designation must then take P499 (3-6 cr.), again under the direction of a faculty advisor, and must complete a substantial honors thesis. The completed thesis must be examined and certified by a committee of at least two philosophy faculty members, including the thesis advisor.

B.S. Physics/M.S. Medical Physics The Applied Physics alternative within the Physics program (Program II) emphasizes practical applications of physics in order to prepare students for high-tech physics jobs in industry and medicine. Some of these Applied Physics requirements can be fulfilled by taking courses also required for a Master's Degree in Medical Physics. By fulfilling requirements satisfying both programs, students can complete a Master's Degree in Medical Physics within as little as one additional year. Students must apply for and earn admittance to the University Graduate School and the Master of Science in Medical Physics program after completing at least 90 credit hours of the Applied Physics undergraduate track (generally during the fall semester of their senior year). The B.S. degree will be conferred upon successful completion of the Applied Physics program (Program II) requirements. The student must also successfully complete (passed with a grade of B or above) 40 credit hours of graduate work, at least 18 credit hours of which must be Physics courses numbered 501 or above (not included are reading, seminar and research courses) and must satisfy all other requirements for that degree to receive the M.S. B.S. Physics/M.S. Secondary Education In an effort to address the shortage of Indiana high school teachers in certain subjects, the College, in conjunction with the IU School of Education, offers an accelerated five-year program in which students can obtain a B.S. in Physics and an M.S. in Secondary Education and also complete all requirements for State licensure in Secondary Education. Under this program, students complete all of the course work required for the Physics concentration (B.S.) by their eighth semester at IU. Continuing in the summer after their fourth year and then in a fifth year of study, students complete all of the requirements for the M.S. in Secondary Education with licensure. Students must apply and earn admittance to the School of Education's Secondary Transition to Teaching and the Master of Science in Education programs during the fall semester of their senior year. After they have completed a minimum of 90 credit hours in the College of Arts and Sciences and satisfied the Foundations, Intensive Writing, Foreign Language, Breadth of Inquiry, and major concentration requirements for the B.S. in Physics, students may apply up to 30 credit hours earned in the School of Education as College electives. The requirements for the B.S. in Physics must be completed before student teaching begins in the final spring semester of the five-year program. The two degrees (B.S.September 16, 2015 349 in Physics and M.S. in Secondary Education) are awarded simultaneously. Students considering this program should seek advising from both the Department of Physics and the School of Education. Also, students are advised to check on the effect that the transition to graduate status may have on existing undergraduate funding. Minor in Physics Required Courses Students must complete: 1.One of the two 10 credit introductory course sequences, P201-P202 or P221-P222. 2.A modern physics course, to be chosen from P301 or P453. 3.A laboratory course, to be chosen from P309, P451, or P460. 4.Another 3 credit physics course above the level of P301. 5.At least 9 credit hours of physics course work at the 300-400 level. Departmental Honors Program The honors program provides well-qualified students with an exceptionally strong foundation in physics, both by encouraging excellence in course work and recognizing the importance of early participation in research. It is strongly recommended that students intending to enroll in graduate school pursue this option. The key component of the honors program is involvement of the student in an independent research project, typically carried out under the supervision of a faculty member. This work must culminate in the writing of an honors thesis (S409) before the end of the senior year. An oral presentation describing the work would also be expected. For more detailed guidelines, see the \"Honors\" section of the departmental Web pages. In addition to fulfilling the requirements associated with the B.S. degree, students in the honors program would also be expected to complete most of the course work listed under \"Recommendations\" for this degree; in particular, at least two of the three courses P332, P442, and P454 must be completed. To graduate with honors, students should maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.500 in all physics course work. Further information regarding this program may be obtained from the department.

Political and Civic Engagement Introduction The Political and Civic Engagement program (PACE) offers an interdisciplinary, 22-credit certificate program. It combines academic study with hands-on learning to provide students with an education in democratic citizenship. The PACE certificate prepares students to make a difference through active engagement in American political and civic life. Students learn to seek out various perspectives, engage in dialogue, analyze the effectiveness of policies, and take principled stands on vital public issues. They also explore the relationship between theory and practice, develop informed critiques of political and civic institutions, practice collective decision- making, work with those who hold opposing views, and devise effective solutions to public problems. Through academic and co-curricular experiences, students learn how to engage in a wide range of political and civic activities: advocacy groups; nonprofit agencies; political campaigns; branches of local, state, and national government; community organizations; and the media. PACE prepares students to enter work in political and civic organizations right after graduation and to pursue post- graduate education in law, public policy, the media, and kindred fields. It also enhances the education of students headed toward careers in other areas such as health care or the arts who want to be engaged citizens. Co-curricular activities are critical to PACE's goal of developing students' political and civic knowledge and skills. They range from formal lectures and panels to informal lunches with individuals with a wide variety of political and civic experiences. PACE students also engage in debates, election-watching parties, program retreats, blogs, roundtable discussions, and other activities designed to enhance their academic and experiential learning.

Departmental Honors Program The Department of Political Science makes a special effort to give outstanding students opportunities appropriate to their abilities and interests. In addition to a number of topics courses and small seminars, the department offers a formal program leading to a B.A. with honors. Admission to the program usually occurs at the end of the sophomore year. Students are eligible to apply if they have completed at least 9 credit hours in political science, including at least one 300-level course, with a minimum grade point average of 3.500 in political science and a minimum overall GPA of 3.300 in university courses. Students must complete an application and meet with the director of honors in the Department of Political Science to discuss the student's proposed program. To attain a degree with honors, students must: 1. Present an acceptable honors thesis. There are two paths to the thesis: The student researches and writes a thesis, usually over the course of two semesters. Honors students typically enroll in 3-12 hours of Y499 for one or two semesters (usually in the senior year). The total amount of credit is determined by the chairperson of the student's honors committee. The honors thesis is written under the direction of two faculty members: the faculty supervisor who serves as chairperson of the student's honors committee, and at least one additional member of the honors committee. Graduate students may not serve as honors supervisors. The student arranges with a faculty member to enroll in a graduate seminar in political science. The research paper for that seminar serves as the basis for the honors thesis, and the instructor of the graduate seminar becomes the chairperson of the student's honors committee. This path is used very infrequently. 2. In both cases, during the fall and spring semesters of the year in which the thesis is being completed and defended, honors students are required to enroll and participate in the \"Honors Colloquium\" section of Y480. Any exceptions to the above requirements must be approved by the Director of Honors in Political Science. Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis The Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis develops courses that provide students with an opportunity to relate theoretical analysis of contemporary policy issues to empirical field research. Students in both graduate and undergraduate courses participate in the design and implementation of small-scale, policy-relevant research projects. These projects help students gain practical experience in reasoning through policy problems, in conducting research, and in analyzing data. Students may also use data collected in these studies for their own research, such as class assignments and honors theses.360 September 16, 2015 High-quality work may be considered for publication in the workshop publication series. The subject matter of the courses varies from year to year, but a consistent theme is the comparative study of alternative institutional arrangements for dealing with public sector problems. In addition to the development of specific courses, the workshop holds weekly colloquia where faculty and students at Indiana University and guest speakers address theoretical and policy problems of mutual interest. Reprints of recent studies in the workshop's publication series are available to students without charge. Further information, including listings of current course offerings and publications, is available from the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis, 513 N. Park Avenue, Bloomington, Indiana 47405, (812) 855-0441. Course Descriptions POLS-Y 100 American Political Controversies (3 cr.)

Psychological and Brain Sciences Introduction The Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences (PSY) offers a major in psychology leading to the B.A. or B.S. degree, a B.S. degree in neuroscience, and course work for undergraduates who wish to satisfy Breadth ofInquiry requirements. As a science, psychology seeks to understand the basic principles by which living organisms adapt their behavior to the changing physical and social environments in which they live. The breadth of the discipline, with its links to the humanities, mathematics, and other social and natural sciences, encourages the development of broad problem-solving skills through exposure to research methodology and statistical analysis and contributes to the development of communicative skills. Psychological knowledge, techniques, and skills obtained in the B.A. and B.S. programs are applied in many careers and provide background for students entering graduate work in psychology and related areas, as well as the professions of medicine, dentistry, law, and business.

The university offers a wide range of Russian and East European courses in more than 20 departments in the College of Arts and Sciences and the Schools of Education, Informatics and Computing, Public and Environmental Affairs, Public Health, the Kelley School of Business, and the Jacobs School of Music. The program does not grant an undergraduate major, but students can obtain one of three undergraduate minors: a minor in Russian and East European Studies, a minor in Russian and East European Studies with a language certificate, or a minor in Polish Studies. Any REEI credential may be earned along with any bachelor's degree. The Russian and East European Institute is affiliated with the new School of Global and International Studies (SGIS) in the College of Arts and Sciences, dedicated to providing Indiana University undergraduates with the intellectual tools they will need to live, work, and thrive in the globalized world of the twenty-first century. Degree programs associated with SGIS emphasize language proficiency, cultural competency, and in-depth training in qualitative and quantitative methodologies. SGIS students will enjoy unparalleled access to a stellar faculty and career-focused advising.

Slavic and East European Languages and Cultures Introduction The Department of Slavic and East European Languages and Cultures (SLAV) offers courses that meet a wide range of needs and interests in Russian, Polish, Czech, Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian, Ukrainian, Romanian and Old Church Slavonic. Advanced language courses are not only for the department's majors, but also for students specializing in other disciplines, particularly in the social sciences, natural sciences, and other languages and literatures. The department offers literature, culture, linguistics, and film courses that require no knowledge of a Slavic or East European language and that can be taken by any student interested in the Russian, Slavic, and East European area. There is an intensive program during the summer that allows coverage of a full year of Russian and other Slavic and East European languages in eight weeks. By attending two such summer sessions in conjunction with a regular course of study, students can cover four years of Russian in two, or two years of another Slavic or EastEuropean language in one. Admission to the Summer Language Workshop is by application. To ensure proper placement in language courses at all levels, transfer students and those who return to the study of a departmental language after a lapse of time are required to take a placement examination administered by the department prior to enrolling in a language course. Majors and prospective majors are urged to consult early with the departmental academic advisor concerning the possibility of double majors and the scheduling of strong minors.

Statistics Introduction Statistics is the science of data. Data are numbers with a context; the particular context that gave rise to the numbers is important. In addition to a knowledge of mathematics, statisticians must learn about the scientific disciplines that generate data of interest to understand and explain the observational studies or the statistical experiments in question. For example, statisticians calculate probabilities for DNA paternity tests; design clinical trials to study the effectiveness of new medications; study economic time series data, such as gross domestic product from developing countries in Africa; and develop statistical models of responses from fMRI psychological experiments. The field of statistics has a coherent body of theory, which students of the field master, as well as methodology designed for applied uses in many disciplines. The Department of Statistics (STAT) teaches courses in both theoretical and applied statistics. Contact Information Department of Statistics Indiana University 309 N.

Credits from non- Indiana University programs may be accepted as transfer credit, subject to the following conditions: 1.Indiana University admissions policy limits the acceptance of transfer credit from study-abroad to programs administered by a regionally accredited U.S. college or university, or by a foreign institution recognized by the ministry of education of the country as a university-level institution. 2.Credit can be awarded only upon receipt of an official transcript, or equivalent document, listing specific courses taken and grades assigned. The amount of credit awarded by overseas study may not exceed the number of credit hours that can be earned at Indiana University in the same amount of time. 3.The assignment of equivalent Indiana University course numbers or undistributed credit for course work transferred from non-Indiana University overseas study programs is subject to the approval of the appropriate academic departments and an assistant dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. 4.Course work not approved for transfer as credit in a particular academic department may be accepted, with the approval of the College of Arts and Sciences, as College of Arts and Sciences foreign study credit. However, no more than 8 hours of such credit can be counted toward a degree in the College of Arts and Sciences. 5.In cases where courses taken abroad fall into a set sequence of courses at Indiana University, the relevant academic departments may at their discretion require examinations before any transfer credit is awarded. Specific examples include courses in foreign languages, applied music, music theory, mathematics, and natural sciences. 6.Overseas study programs vary greatly in quality. No transfer credit at all may be awarded for programs of uncertain quality, despite the issuance of a transcript. 7.Students denied transfer credit for overseas study may seek credit by examination, as outlined elsewhere in this bulletin. To assure that credits can be accepted from a particular overseas program, students are urged to submit a Credit Transfer Agreement form to the Office of International Admissions prior to committing themselves to participating in the program. Forms may be obtained online from the Office of Overseas Study ( www.indiana.edu/~overseas/ programs/noniu.shtml ). Under certain circumstances students may be permitted to use Indiana University financial aid toward programs sponsored by organizations other than Indiana University. Information and application forms may be obtained from the Office of Overseas Study, Leo R. Dowling International Center, 111 South Jordan Avenue, (812) 855-9304.
