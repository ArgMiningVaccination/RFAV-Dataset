Under 38 USC 3320(b)(4)(A)(i), a STEM field of study is a field of study included in the Department of Education's Classific ation of Ins tructional Programs taxonomy within the two-d igit series containing biological or biomedical science, physical science, scienc e technologies or technicians, computer and informati on science and support services, mathematics or statistics, engineering, engineerin g technologies, health pr ofessions or medical residency, agriculture or natural resources science programs, or a related field. In general, related fields will include fields involvin g research, innovation, or development of new technologies usi ng engineering, mathematics, h ealth, computer science, or natural sciences. Accordingly, this list designates the following twelve CIP summary groups/series at the 2- digit CIP code level: Biological and Biomedical Sciences (CIP code 26), Physical Sciences (CIP code 40), Science Technologies/Technicians (CIP code 41), Computer and Information Science s and Support Services (CIP code 11), Mathematics and Statistics (CIP code 27), Engineering (CIP code 14), Engineering Technologies/Technicians (CIP code 15), Health Professions and Related Clinical Sciences (CIP code 51), Health Professions Residency /Fellowship Programs (CIP code 60), Medical Residency/Fellowship Programs (CIP code 61), Agriculture, Agriculture Operations, and Related Sciences (CIP code 01) and Natural Resour ces and Conservation (CIP code 03). Any new additions to those areas will automatically be included on this STEM Designated Degree Program list. Consistent with the definition of \"related field\" above, related fields in this list include fields involving r esearch, innovation, or development of new technologies using engineering, mathematics, health, computer science, or natural sciences. VA designates these fields at the 6 -digit level.
