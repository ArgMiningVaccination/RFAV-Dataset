Page 5 By Tracie White When the staff at the School of Medicine's Office of MD Admis- sions began to review the thou- sands of applications they received last fall, they were not only looking for appli- cants who excelled academically, but also for those who best reflected the school's mission of promoting leadership, inno- vation, discovery and diversity. This is according to Iris Gibbs, MD, associate dean for MD admissions, who pointed to Bongeka Zuma as an exam-ple of one such person. Now among the 100 new students who began classes on Aug. 28, Zuma was the valedictorian of the inaugural class of Oprah Winfrey's Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa. She was raised in poverty in the province of Kwa Zulu-Natal, where she said every Saturday there was a funeral, and family and friends routinely died of preventable diseases. \"I was really attracted to Stanford be- cause I wanted a school that stressed that I could be a doctor and also have the op- portunities to be something else,\" said Zuma, who never saw a physician as a child. \"I hope to make changes in health care by getting involved in policy in gov- ernment back home.\" Gibbs said Zuma is the type of stu- dent Stanford seeks: One with the po- tential to shine in the classroom and the clinic, as well as with the qualities of a future leader in health care. Multifaceted backgrounds \"Everyone is struck by Bongeka's story,\" said Gibbs, who is also a professor of radiation oncology. \"And when you meet her she has this wonderful confi- dence and sense of giving back. \"All of our students exhibit a similar multifaceted background,\" Gibbs added. The first-year medical students bring with them a wide variety of life experi- ences. There's an Olympic gold medalist, the founder of a green technology com- pany, a former DREAMer who came to the United States as an undocumented immigrant, and an accomplished classi - cal pianist. Sixteen were varsity athletes, including Owen Marecic, a retired NFL player and former Stanford football player who currently works in a research lab on campus. Five of the students were Fulbright fellows, two were Rhodes scholars and 18 hold advanced degrees. T wenty-six are racial and ethnic minori - ties underrepresented in medicine, in-cluding 11 African-Americans and 12 Latinos. Lloyd Minor, MD, dean of the School of Medicine, noted this as he welcomed the new medical students on Aug. 25 during a ceremony at which they were given white coats and stethoscopes. The stethoscopes, symbolizing the close rela- tionship between physician and patient, were provided by Stanford Medicine Alumni Association. \"You come from all around the globe with various perspectives and experi - ences,\" Minor said. \"You've played the bagpipes, run companies, tap danced, written poems, published groundbreak- ing scholarship, competed in the NFL and the Olympics, and made a lasting impact on underserved communities and our natural environment. I'm honored that you're bringing your intellectual rigor, generosity and unbridled creativity to this campus and to our community, and that you chose Stanford as the place to begin your journey in medicine and in life.\" Furthering the school's goals It was Minor who helped to articu- late the school's mission to embrace inclusivity and diversity when he first ar- rived at Stanford as dean in 2012, said Gibbs, who was a member of the admis- sions committee at New medical students slip into white coats By Bruce Goldman I stood, exposed, at the prow of an underwater vessel and watched a great white shark come toward me, its rows of gleaming, pointy teeth headed for my throat. The shark got within about 2 feet of me, hung a U- turn and smoothly swam away. Another approached. I was stuck in the middle of a whole school of them.A guilty source of comfort was the knowledge that a couple of the other divers were way more exposed than I was. I wouldn't want to be in their fins. Most calming of all, I knew that none of this was real \u2014 or, at least, the conscious part of my brain did. Had I been convinced I was really 100 feet underwater and surrounded by these bionic buzz saws, my fear lev- els would have been registering on the Richter scale. I would be freaking out. In actual fact I was standing in a small room immersed in sensory in- puts, mostly visual, telling me that I was below the surface of the waters off Guadalupe \u2014 an island 150 miles west of Baja California \u2014 dodging the serial swim-bys of a few dozen great white sharks. Vision's role in fear Andrew Huberman, PhD, an as- sociate professor of neurobiology at Stanford, doesn't know the meaning of fear \u2014 literally. You probably don't, either, although we all know it when we feel it: Our heartbeat speeds up, our limbs tingle, our breathing be- comes shallow and rapid, our muscles pulse with multiples of their normal strength and By Bruce Goldman The average age of newborns' fathers in the United States has grown by 3.5 years over the past four de- cades, according to a new study from inves- tigators at the School of Medicine. Men over the age of 40 now account for about 9 percent of all U.S. births. Men over the age of 50 account for nearly 1 percent. Those statistics come from the Stan- ford study, which is the first comprehensive analysis of all live births reported to a federal data depository in the United States from 1972-2015: to be precise, 168,867,480 births. The researchers obtained the data from the National Vital Statistics System, an intergovernmental data-shar- ing program sponsored by the federal Centers for Dis- ease Control and Prevention.

Packard Children's is one of the first hospitals in the country to begin imple-menting distraction-based VR therapy within every patient unit. \"Many kids associate the hospi- tal with things they deem stressful and scary,\" said pediatric anesthesiologist Sam Rodriguez, MD, co-founder of Packard Children's Childhood Anxi- ety Reduction through Innovation and Technology, or CHARIOT, program, which is leading the VR rollout. \"We are finding that the ability to distract these patients with fully immersive, fun and relaxing sensory environments can have a significant impact on the anxiety and pain that they experience during minor procedures, dressing changes and other medical treatments.\" In February, 9-year-old Blaine Bax- ter suffered a severe injury to his arm while racing a go-kart and had to un- dergo daily, painful dressing changes. \"He would immediately start crying and scream out of fear, and had to be sedated before doctors could approach his arm,\" explained Blaine's mother, Tamara Bax- ter. \"He was so riddled with anxiety after everything he had been and was going through. VR was a game changer for Blaine. As soon as he put the goggles on, sedation was no longer needed, and dur- ing his dressing changes we went from hearing pain-stricken screams to 'Wow, I'm under the sea looking at sea snakes. This is so cool. You have to see this!'\" Evolution of CHARIOT The use of VR is a novel experience for many of the patients at Packard Children's, said Veronica T uss, a child life specialist with the hospital's Child Life and Creative Arts Department. The department's members engage pa- tients in age-appropriate activities to help normalize their time in the hospital. Through providing education and pro- cedural support, they play a key role in helping to decrease patients' stress levels prior to procedures. \"VR is often so un-familiar that it is instantly engaging and incredibly distracting,\" T uss says. \"If I'm preparing a child for their very first IV, and they share with me that they don't want to see what's happening procedur - ally, I know I need a distraction that is visually engaging. With VR, an often- intimidating setting suddenly becomes this really cool thing or place that they get to explore. It can minimize the expe- rience of getting the IV to the point that we may actually turn a negative experi-ence into a positive one.\" The hospitalwide VR rollout is the latest evolution in distraction-therapy techniques pioneered by Rodriguez and fellow anesthesiologist Thomas Caruso, MD, who co-founded CHARIOT with Rodriguez. In 2015, the duo intro- duced the Bedside Entertainment and Relaxation Theater, which uses video projection to allow patients undergo- ing surgery to watch movies, music vid- eos and other entertainment on a large screen attached directly to their gurney up to the moment they enter the operat- ing room. Earlier this year, CHARIOT launched Sevo the Dragon, an interactive video game projected on the BERT screen that takes a necessary part of anesthesia \u2014 breathing anesthesia medicine through a mask \u2014 and transforms it into a game. While BERT is great for younger chil- dren, the VR experience is becoming a useful tool, especially for older chil- dren, said Rodriguez and Caruso, both of whom are clinical assistant professors of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine at the School of Medicine. The VR goggles escalate the immersive en- tertainment experience to a 360-degree view of relaxing scenery and engaging games. For patients as young as 6, VR dis- traction therapy is being used in Packard Children's Bass Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Diseases, short stay unit and emergency department; the vascular access, imaging, ambulatory orthopedics and general surgery clin- ics; and the perioperative unit. It will be rolled out by the end of the year to the hospital's acute care floor units, Stanford Children's Health's ambulatory surgery clinics and even the labor and delivery unit. The goal is for all of the hospital's 29 child life specialists to be trained on the use of VR goggles by that time. In addition, pediatricians at the Stan- ford Children's Health Bayside Medical menting VR technology during immu - nizations for patients who are fearful of needles. \"Children shouldn't grow up be- ing afraid to go to the doctor to have a shot, but certain experiences can cause phobias that last into adulthood. Needle phobia is a common example of that, and it's the primary reason adults avoid important immunizations like flu shots,\" Caruso said. \"Now, when patients get a shot while they are wearing VR goggles, they are reporting only limited levels of pain, if any.\" Customizing VR for the hospital The CHARIOT team has medically customized the VR headsets to better fit kid-sized heads with an easy-to-clean strap and a disposable screen liner for immunocompromised patients. Sound capabilities allow the volume to be ad- justed so the care team can communicate with patients during procedures, and each headset is accompanied by a smart-phone preloaded with customized con - tent specific to children in the hospital. The CHARIOT team works carefully to select games that require limited head and arm movement so kids seated in bed can play without turning their bodies or getting tangled in IV lines and other wires, and so patients with arm bandages or casts can still participate. CHARIOT also works with companies to adapt commercially available games for the health care setting, removing themes of injury or death and eliminating \"game over\" termination so that the distraction of the game doesn't go away at the mo- ment patients need it the most. Working with Silicon Valley-based software engineers, Rodriguez and Ca- ruso are also developing original VR content specifically created for the pe- diatric patient population. Their first game, Spaceburgers, was developed with Juno VR and is specifically designed for children in a hospital setting. It trans - ports patients to outer space and immerses them in relaxing music as they zap space objects \u2014 includ-ing \"spaceburgers\" \u2014 that fly toward them. It allows health care providers to adjust the cogni- tive load according to the patient's needs, meaning they can use a controller to in- crease the level of distraction during the most stressful parts of a procedure, like right before a needle poke. Research is underway to further quantify the impact VR has on the levels of pain and anxiety that patients experi - ence during vascular access procedures, including blood draws and port access, by comparing the experiences of patients who have used VR with those who have not. \"Preliminary results have shown that kids tend to be more cooperative when they are engaged in VR, with less movement, less fear and sometimes even lower pain scores, which can make the experience more positive for the provider and the child,\" Rodriguez said. The impact of VR can last beyond the immediacy of a procedure, Caruso added. \"Having a less terrifying experi- ence when you go to the hospital can change your behavior for weeks after a procedure,\" he said. \"Things like sleep regression or acting out during the recov- ery period are associated with distressing perioperative experiences, but by using VR and reducing the fear and anxiety that kids experience before a procedure, we hope to positively impact their be- haviors after the procedure.\" Now, the CHARIOT team is re- searching the impact of passive VR ex- periences, such as watching fish float by, compared with the impact of active games, such as zapping spaceburgers, to understand whether the content itself impacts patients' reported pain and anxi- ety levels in the clinical setting. Packard Children's is one of the first hospitals to integrate the use of VR as a potential method of anxiety reduction into pa- tients' electronic medical records, which is helping care teams determine which content is most effective for certain pop- ulations, according to patient age, pro- cedure and content type. \"Among our patients, there is a subgroup who do well during a procedure with or without VR, a sub- group with minor anxiety where VR helps slightly and they enjoy it, and a subgroup where it makes a profound difference,\" Rodriguez said. \"These patients sometimes come in for a procedure with a 10-out-of-10 level of anxiety and fear, but when we imple- ment VR during a procedure, they re- port stress levels of 2-, 1- and in some cases 0-out-of-10. Those are the patients we are really targeting with these VR interventions.\" What's next CHARIOT's hospitalwide VR rollout is on track to be fully realized in the new Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stan- ford, which is set to open in December, and will continue to expand with addi- tional technologies. \"Our ultimate goal is to take a per- sonalized approach to care by adapting and developing technological interven- tions for each child's needs,\" Rodriguez said.

See CHARIOT , page 7\"As soon as he put the goggles on, sedation was no longer needed.\"INSIDE STANFORD MEDICINE SEPTEMBER 11, 2017 3By Erin Digitale Scientists at the School of Medicine have completed the first-ever characterization of the meticulously timed immune system changes in women that occur during pregnancy. The findings, which were published Sept. 1 in Sci- ence Immunology, reveal that there is an immune clock of pregnancy and suggest it may help doctors predict preterm birth. \"Pregnancy is a unique immunological state. We found that the timing of immune system changes fol- lows a precise and predictable pattern in normal preg- nancy,\" said the study's senior author, Brice Gaudilliere, MD, PhD, assistant professor of anesthesiology, periop- erative and pain medicine. Although physicians have long known that the ex- pectant mother's immune system adjusts to prevent her body from rejecting the fetus, no one had investigated the full scope of these changes, nor asked if their timing was tightly controlled. \"Ultimately, we want to be able to ask, 'Does your immune clock of pregnancy run too slow or too fast?'\" said Gaudilliere. The new research comes from the March of Dimes Prematurity Research Center at Stanford University, which aims to understand why preterm births happen and how they could be prevented. Nearly 10 percent of U.S. infants are born prematurely, arriving three or more weeks early, but physicians lack a reliable way to predict premature deliveries. \"It's really exciting that an immunological clock of pregnancy exists,\" said the study's lead author, Nima Aghaeepour, PhD, instructor in anesthesiology, periop- erative and pain medicine. \"Now that we have a refer- ence for normal development of the immune system throughout pregnancy, we can use that as a baseline for future studies to understand when someone's immune system is not adapting to pregnancy the way we would expect.\" Prior research at Stanford and elsewhere suggested that inflammatory immune responses may help trigger early labor. If scientists identify an immune signature of impending preterm birth, they should be able to design a blood test to detect it. The study used blood samples collected from 18 women who had full-term pregnancies. Each woman gave four blood samples \u2014 one during each of the three trimesters of pregnancy and one six weeks after delivery. Samples from an additional group of 10 women with full-term pregnancies were used to validate the findings. How each immune cell experiences pregnancy The researchers used mass cytometry, a technique developed at Stanford, to simultaneously measure up to 50 properties of each immune cell in the blood samples. They counted the types of immune cells, assessed what signaling pathways were most active in each cell, and determined how the cells reacted to being stimulated with compounds that mimic infection with viruses and bacteria. With an advanced statistical modeling technique, introduced for the first time in this study, the scien- tists then described in detail how the immune system changes throughout pregnancy. \"This algorithm is telling us how specific immune cell types are experiencing pregnancy,\" Gaud-illiere said. Instead of grouping the women's blood samples by trimester for analysis, their model treated gestational age as a continuous vari- able, allowing the researchers to account for the exact time during pregnancy at which each sample was taken. The mathematical model also incorporated knowledge from the existing scientific literature of how im- mune cells behave in nonpregnant individu-als to help determine which findings were most likely to be important. The model improved understanding of the immune system much as mapping software that knows which streets are one- way gives better driving directions. \"If there are several models that are statistically equivalent, we are interested in the model that is most consistent with our existing knowledge of immunology,\" said Aghaeepour. Hopes of finding 'sweet spot' The study confirmed immune features of pregnancy that were already known. For instance, the scientists saw that natural killer cells and neutrophils have en- hanced action during pregnancy. The researchers also uncovered several previously unappreciated features of how the immune system changes, such as the find- ing that activity of the STAT5 signaling pathway in CD4+T cells progressively increases throughout preg- nancy on a precise schedule, ultimately reaching lev-els much higher than in nonpregnant individuals. The STAT5 pathway is involved in helping another group of immune cells, regulatory T cells, to differentiate. Interestingly, prior research in animals has indicated that regulatory T cells are important for maintaining pregnancy. The next step will be to conduct similar research using blood samples from women who deliver their babies prematurely to see where their trajectories of im- mune function differ from normal. \"We're especially interested in understanding more precisely what is happening very early and very late in pregnancy,\" Gaudilliere said. \"We'd like to see if there is really a switch we can catch, a sweet spot where devia-tion from the norm would be maximal with pathology.\" \"The immune system does not act in isolation, and we're now very interested in profiling its interplay with other aspects of mothers' biology, such as their genetics, metabolism and the body's microbial communities to come up with a holistic biological clock of pregnancy,\" Aghaeepour added. The work is an example of Stanford Medicine's focus on precision health, the goal of which is to anticipate and prevent disease in the healthy and precisely diag- nose and treat disease in the ill.

ISMImmune system changes in pregnancy are precisely timed Brice Gaudilliere By Nathan Collins A survey of DNA fragments circulating in human blood suggests that our bodies contain vastly more di- verse microbes than anyone previously understood, ac- cording to Stanford researchers. What's more, the overwhelming majority of those microbes has never been seen before, let alone classified and named, the researchers report. \"We found the gamut,\" said Stephen Quake, PhD, professor of bioengineering and of applied physics. \"We found things that are related to things people have seen before, we found things that are divergent and we found things that are completely novel.\" A paper describing the findings was published online Aug. 22 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Quake is the paper's senior author. The lead author is graduate student Mark Kowarsky. Searching for rejection The survey was inspired by a curious observation Quake's lab made while searching for noninvasive ways to predict whether an organ-transplant patient's im- mune system would recognize the new organ as foreign and attack it, an event known as rejection. Ordinarily, it takes a tissue biopsy \u2014 meaning a large needle jabbed into one's side and at least an afternoon in a hospital bed for observation \u2014 to detect rejection. The lab members figured there was a better way. In theory, they might be able to detect rejection by tak- ing blood samples and looking at the cell-free DNA \u2014 bits and pieces of DNA circulating freely in blood plasma \u2014 contained therein. Apart from fragments of a patient's DNA, those samples would contain fragments of the organ donor's DNA, as well as a comprehensive view of the collection of bacteria, viruses and other mi- crobes that make up a person's microbiome. Over the course of several studies, the first of which was published in 2013, Quake and his colleagues col - lected samples from 156 heart, lung and bone mar-row transplant recipients, as well as from 32 pregnant women. (Pregnancy, like immunosuppressant drugs taken by transplant patients, also changes the immune system, albeit in ways both more complicated and less well understood.) Something weirder The results of these earlier studies suggested there were identifiable changes to the microbiomes of people with compromised immune systems and that positive tests for the organ donor's DNA were a good sign of rejection. But there was something else, too \u2014 something weirder. Of all the nonhuman DNA fragments the team gathered, 99 percent of them failed to match anything in existing genetic databases the researchers examined. With that in mind, Kowarsky set about character - izing all of that mystery DNA. The vast majority of it belonged to a phylum called proteobacteria, which includes pathogens such as E. coli and Salmonella. Previously unidentified viruses in the torque teno family, which is generally not associated with disease but often found in immunocompromised patients, made up the largest group of viruses. \"We've doubled the number of known viruses in that family through this work,\" said Quake, who also holds the Lee Otterson Professorship in the School of Engineering. An unsurprising surprise? Perhaps more important, they identified an entirely new group of torque teno viruses. Among the known torque teno viruses, one group infects humans and another infects animals, but many of the ones the re- searchers found didn't fit in either group. \"We've now found a whole new class of human-infecting ones that are closer to the animal class than to the previously known human ones, so quite Nearly all microbes inside us unknown to science, study finds See MICROBES, page 8NORBERT VON DER GROEBEN Stephen Quake and his colleagues examined the bits and pieces of DNA in blood plasma and found that 99 percent of the nonhuman DNA fragments didn't match anything in existing genetic databases.4 SEPTEMBER 11, 2017 INSIDE STANFORD MEDICINEBy Katie Gray What advice would Stanford physi- cian Lucy Kalanithi, MD, give to stu - dents beginning their medical journey? That was one of the questions Lloyd Minor, MD, dean of the School of Medi- cine, asked Kalani- thi at an Aug. 25 talk for incoming MD and physician- assistant students. Her answer: to expect the unexpected. Kalanithi's late husband Paul Kalanithi, MD, a Stanford neurosurgeon, wrote the memoir When Breath Becomes Air before dying of lung cancer in March 2015. \"I never thought I'd be speaking so publicly about such personal stuff,\" she said. She added that while she used to think medicine offered a direct path, she has since learned that many unfore-seen events can take people down unan- ticipated roads. The key to adapting to change is to be open to uncertainty, she said, and to \"keep rising to the occasion.\" That's exactly what Kalanithi and her late husband had to do four years ago af- ter he was diagnosed with cancer. Since his memoir \u2014 in which he reflects on end-of-life care, medical training and meaningful living \u2014 was published in January 2016, the book has been on The New York Times best-seller list for 66 weeks. \"What struck me most\" about the book, said Minor in his opening re - marks, \"was Paul's perfect articulation of the vivid bond between physician and patient.\" Minor, who is collaborating with Kalanithi, a clini- cal assistant pro- fessor of medicine, as part of a winter seminar called \"Literature, Medicine and Empathy,\" also asked Kalanithi what she learned about the patient's perspective during her husband's illness. \"I was desperate for people to empa- thize and listen,\" she said. On a given day, while a care provider may be think- ing about the long list of cases they need to handle, the patient has waited weeks and weeks for that one encounter, she said. \"There's real data on patient adher- ence being related to how much they feel allied with you as their provider,\" she said. \"You are the medicine.\" Noting By Tracie White A welcome ceremony for the School of Medicine's inaugural class of students in the Master of Science in physician as- sistant studies was held Aug. 25 on the lawn next to the Medical School Office Building. Robert Harrington, MD, professor and chair of medicine, and Arturo Mo- lina, MD, Stanford Medicine Alumni Association board member, were among those who welcomed the new class of 27 students. Molina gave the students stethoscopes. \"You are, and forever will be, the first PA master's degree class at Stan - ford,\" Harrington said. \"You will set the standard for the many classes to follow. We expect you to be great clinicians, teachers, researchers and administrators. You will be leaders in the profession. Don't let that frighten you. Embrace it.\" The 30-month program will empha- size training alongside medical students in coursework and clinical care. The students are required to choose an area of scholarly concentration within one of four areas: community health, health services and policy research, clinical re- search or medical education. The quickly growing field has jumped from 20,000 licensed physician assistants in 1990 to about 115,500 today, according to the American Academy of Physician Assis- tants. ISMthe time. Three years ago, she stepped into the position of as- sociate dean of admissions. \"Since then, we have really been working toward furthering these goals,\" Gibbs said. \"That includes creating pipelines and pathways to attract the types of students who best reflect our vi- sion, our goals. \"With the dean's leader- ship and approval, we've been able to bring in an assistant dean, Judith Ned, to help with this building of a pipeline. We've increased our efforts to reach out to a broader range of individuals.\" Ned, EdD, was appointed assistant dean and director of MD admissions in March to supervise operational aspects of medical student admissions and to support and develop new programs to expand outreach and recruitment efforts. Each year, the MD admis- sions office receives 7,000 to 8,000 applications. It sends out supplemental questions to each of those and receives back about 6,000 fully completed applica- tions. From that number, 450 to 500 applicants are selected for interviews based on their academic accomplishments, rel- evant life experiences and per- sonal qualities detailed in their applications. In 2011, the medical school switched from holding hourlong inter- views with faculty members to an inter- view process known as the multi-mini interview, which involves a series of short interviews over a two-hour period de- signed to measure character and critical-thinking skills. Since Gibbs took office, an additional, more in-depth interview with a faculty member has been added to this process. \"We think it's really important for stu- dents to get a chance to talk to faculty while they are here during the interview process,\" Gibbs said. As a final step in the process of choos- ing applicants to whom admission will be offered, Gibbs said, the reviewers pause to ask themselves the question, \"How will this particular student con- tribute to the learning of others?\" \"It is my hope that every single medi- cal student will feel that not only are they learning from those individuals who are teaching up in front of the classroom, but that they are learning from each other,\" Gibbs said. \"And that they bring something unique that enhances the learning environment themselves.\" ISMStudents continued from page 1 (Clockwise from top left) Iris Gibbs said the new class of medical students reflects the school's mission of promoting leadership, innovation, discovery and diversity.

It's the thing that says, 'Go after gene A, not gene B,'\" said Chang. The difficulty for Eterna players is to come up with an RNA molecule that does several things, said Greenleaf. The guide RNA has to be recognized by the CRISPR-associated enzyme. The CRISPR-enzyme sys- tem has to be able to recruit bio - chemical activity to the targeted gene. And lastly, the activity of the CRISPR-enzyme system has to be controlled by a small- molecule drug, so there needs to be a \"binding pocket\" for that small molecule. The RNA mol- ecule has to function so that the CRISPR system is active when the small-molecule drug is pres- ent and inactive when it's not. So far, experts have not been able to create such a drug- activated CRISPR, which is why Chang and Greenleaf are calling on the community of Eterna gamers for help. The new puzzle will be quite different from the re- cent challenge in which Eterna players had to design a molecule that could do a math- ematical calculation for a tu- berculosis diagnostic test. \"The CRISPR puzzle actually should be pretty easy to solve in silico, even for new players who get to the switch design levels,\" said Rhiju Das, PhD, associate pro- fessor of biochemistry and prin- cipal investigator for Eterna. From in silico to in vitro: an iterative process How those Eterna-designed switches will behave in living cells is a big question. Das said the team will be asking players for different possible solutions to the same problem. \"We're not sure yet if there will be un- foreseen problems with the Cas9 protein experimen- tally. That's partially why we want as many diverse solutions as possible for the Greenleaf and Chang labs to test, even in this pilot round,\" Das said. It will be an iterative process, said Greenleaf. His Stanford lab will test the first round of solutions and then return these data to the players with refinements that will guide their design work. \"We're hoping for 10,000 to 100,000 players to contribute 10 solutions each. If we get that many, we'll indeed work to get that many synthesized and tested,\" Das said. Out of the ivory tower One of the goals of Stanford's Center for Personal Dynamic Regulomes is to get people interested in sci - ence, said Chang. \"The Eterna game is a powerful way to engage lots and lots of people,\" he said. \"They're not just passive users of information but actually involved in the process.\" Like other computer games, Eterna allows players to accumulate points, build expertise and advance to higher levels. The best players have a chance of having their designs implemented in the lab. One thing that makes the project exciting, said Chang, is that it is an experiment in the sociology of science. \"There is a misconception of science as something that hap- pens in an ivory tower by someone in a white coat with a long beard. And they are saying things and drawing things that nobody un- derstands. But it's not like that! It's really like a puzzle that anybody can get engaged with,\" he said.

In addition to the funding from NIGMS and Stan- ford's Center for Personal Dynamic Regulomes, the new Eterna challenge is being launched with collabora- tive support from the Innovative Genomics Institute at the University of California-Berkeley. Stanford's departments of Biochemistry and of Ge- netics also supported the work. ISMBy Jennie Dusheck A team of researchers at the School of Medicine has launched a new challenge for the online computer game Eterna in which players are being asked to design an RNA molecule capable of acting as an on/off switch for the gene-editing tool CRISPR/Cas9. Molecular biologists will then build and test the actual molecules, based on the most promising designs provided by the players. A gene editor as powerful as CRISPR could have unexpected effects inside living cells, so it makes sense to turn it off when it's not needed. In addition, an on/off switch might be able to put CRISPR-influenced genes on a sort of timer, activating and deactivating them on a schedule that could mimic the way we schedule taking doses of drugs. Anyone can play the Eterna RNA-design game. \"All you need is a good internet connection, the interest and the time,\" said Howard Chang, MD, PhD, professor of dermatology and director of the Center for Personal Dynamic Regulomes at Stanford. The center, funded by the National Institutes of Health's Center of Excellence in Genomic Science program, is providing $15 million to support the project. \"Great ideas can come from anywhere, so this is also an experiment in the democratization of science,\" Chang said. \"A lot of people have hidden talents that they don't even know about. This could be their call- ing. Maybe there's somebody out there who is a security guard and a fantastic RNA biochemist, and they don't even know it.\" The challenge to design a CRISPR switch is the lat- est puzzle offered through Eterna, a game portal that allows players to design virtual RNA structures. Eterna most recently hosted a game event challenging players to build an RNA molecule that could simplify the wide- spread use of a tuberculosis test. What is CRISPR/Cas9? CRISPR/Cas9 is a gene-editing tool derived from bacteria. Researchers in the 1980s discovered that E. coli, a species of bacterium that lives in the gut, has a system for reading and damaging viral DNA. When a virus infects a bacterium, it can copy and incorporate segments of the viral DNA into its own genome. (These viral DNA regions are called \"clustered regularly inter- spaced short palindromic regions,\" or CRISPR.) Just as our own immune systems can use antibodies to re- member previous infections, the viral DNA in CRISPR regions helps E. coli bacteria recognize a subsequent viral infection. When a bacterium's RNA molecules recognize the viral DNA, they guide the CRISPR/Cas9 complex to that DNA, and the bacterium's Cas enzymes destroy the viral DNA by cutting it. In 2012, researchers found a way to deploy the bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 immune system \u2014 including CRISPR, a protein called Cas9 and a \"guide\" RNA \u2014 to recognize, cut and replace any DNA sequence. Since then, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has enabled rapid gene editing projects in everything from viruses to corn to human stem cells. How a CRISPR on/off switch might be used \"CRISPR is a technology for cutting or binding DNA,\" said Chang. \"But you don't want it to be on all the time.\" It would be useful to have a switch that could turn gene activity on and off on some sort of schedule. A doctor often tells a patient to take a drug twice a day for two weeks. But if the \"drug\" were generated by the patient's own genes, he said, small molecules might be used to switch on that gene activity for an hour or two twice a day for two weeks and then stop. Right now, Chang said, if someone used CRISPR/ Cas9 to engineer cells to activate a gene, it would be hard to know how much the gene is being turned on. Plus, he said, the gene would be on all the time. \"We just hope everything works out and it's the right amount. But that's a little scary, right?\" said Chang. CRISPR's not just about breaking the gene to turn it off, said William Greenleaf, PhD, associate professor of genetics. \"A switch on the CRISPR/Cas9 system can control how the genes are being expressed \u2014 that is, when and where.\" Where the RNA molecule comes in In the new Eterna challenge, called OpenCRISPR, players will design a guide RNA molecule that leads CRISPR to the right sequence of DNA for editing or Game challenges players to design on/off switch for CRISPR Howard Chang Rhiju Das A new challenge on the Eterna computer game allows players to try to design a molecule that can turn CRISPR gene-editing on and off.COURTESY OF RHIJU DAS that the memoir describes this responsibility as both an enormous blessing and a burden, Minor asked Kalani-thi about physician wellness. She said medical institu-tions have a clear role to play in removing the stigma of asking for help. \"If you feel burned out, or if you feel depressed or anxious, it's not that there's something wrong with you. It's a greater system issue,\" she said, adding that Stan - ford Medicine is becoming a national leader in the field of physician wellness. As for her own well-being, Kalanithi talked about navigating life in the years since the death of her hus- band. She said she thinks often about how to describe him to their daughter, Cady, who is now 3. \"I'm really happy that he wrote this book because he did it in part for her,\" she said. In response to an audience member's question about whether her definition of happiness has changed since losing Paul, she said, \"I used to think, 'I want to be happy all the time' or 'I want to raise a happy kid,'\" she said. \"Now I really want to have meaning in my life, and I really want to raise a resilient kid.\" ISMKalanithi continued from page 4 STANFORD VIDEO Lucy Kalanithi, whose late husband wrote the best-selling memoir When Breath Becomes Air , talks with Lloyd Minor on Aug. 25.\"The Eterna game is a powerful way to engage lots and lots of people.\"6 SEPTEMBER 11, 2017 INSIDE STANFORD MEDICINEtime seems to slow down. But there's more to fear than a constellation of pe- ripheral bodily signals, Huberman said. It's a state of mind, as well, a holding pattern designed to maintain heightened arousal while you figure out what to do next. To neuroscientists, that means it's also a state of the brain, shaped by eons of evolutionary trial and error during which the punishment for failure to respond ap- propriately and quickly was often death, not to mention fewer viable offspring. Huberman wants to learn more about fear by iden- tifying the neural circuitry underlying it, and pinpoint-ing the circuits' settings during episodes of fear. In the long run, Huberman also hopes to help people gain more control over irrational fear, a response that can get tripped off so often or so severely it hampers healthy coping. To study fear, one must induce it, which Huberman is doing. Having spent the last 20 years or so studying the neurobiology of vision, he's taking a mainly visual approach, with the help of a virtual-reality chamber his team created from scratch. Vision is our dominant mode of sensation, Huber- man noted. \"Nearly 40 percent of the human brain is dedicated to processing visual information,\" he said. So it stands to reason that visual information about a real or imag- ined threat gets VIP treatment in the brain. But very little has been done in charting the flow of information from visual input through the deeper centers in the brain where fear is generated, processed, acted on and overcome, Huberman said. \"There's still so much we just don't know.\" We do know that images landing on the retina trig- ger signals in nerve-cell relays that, after numerous processing steps, yield a conscious perception of what we see. But we've also evolved specialized, faster forms of response to visual threats. Faced with a poisonous snake or a hungry beast, you don't want to wait until you've been devoured or injected with a lethal toxin be- fore you get around to stepping back, starting to run or putting up your dukes. You need to register right away that something bad is happening, and figure out exactly what it was later. There's an alternate fast-track route, from the retina to a well-studied brain structure, the amygdala, which speedily carries out many functions, including flagging threats. Signals from the amygdala can trigger secre- tion of stress hormones from the adrenal glands into the bloodstream, unlocking loads of energy-rich glucose stored in the liver for rapid uptake by the muscles. The mice that roared Other important, though not as well-studied, brain centers are involved in visual threat detection and re- sponse. Lindsey Salay, a graduate student in Huber- man's laboratory, has identified one of those centers, right smack in the middle of the brain. Ironically, the brain center Salay found responds to fear-inducing stimuli by stiffening the spine. One thing mice are afraid of \u2014 innately so, no pre- vious training required \u2014 is aerial predators: hawks, owls and so forth. Put a mouse in an open field, and it's a sitting duck. Within a second of perceiving an air- borne predator, that mouse almost invariably makes a decision to either freeze, which it hopes will make it harder to detect, or make an immediate run for shelter if it's available. There aren't a whole lot of other promis- ing options. To determine how brain activity changes in the pres- ence of a visual threat, Salay employed a laboratory mock-up of a predator's approach: a mouse-scale arena akin to an open field, with a video screen covering most of its ceiling. On that screen could be shown an expanding overhead disk that simulates an approaching bird of prey. A postdoctoral scholar in Huberman's lab, Melis Yilmaz Balban, PhD, created this contraption while a student at Harvard and then CalTech. In a study published in 2013, Yilmaz Balban showed that mice sighting a dark overhead expanding disk either run for cover or freeze for an extended period. Salay compared the brain activity of mice that had been exposed to this \"looming predator\" for a few min- utes with that of mice that hadn't. She located a par- ticular region called the ventral midline thalamus, or vMT, that became activated in the presence of the over- head expanding disk but was relatively quiescent in its absence. Salay found that despite its activation by fear-induc- ing stimuli, the vMT, to which humans have an anal - ogous structure, wasn't just another cog in the brain's run-and-hide machinery. To the contrary: If you stimu- late mice's vMT sufficiently, she observed, instead of freezing or running for cover, they become uncharac- teristically inclined to stand their ground. They remain right out there in the open and start rattling their tails. \"You can actually hear their tails thumping on the floor or against the wall of their enclosure,\" said Salay. This defiant behavior, displayed by macho male mice just before they start fighting or by nursing mouse moms when a strange male intrudes into their space, is observed only rarely in regular mice under simulated aerial attack, and then only after they've ducked into a shelter they can crouch in, safe and sound. The vMT-stimulated mice also run around more out in the open. That, as well as the tail-rattling, would make the mouse much more visible and tantalizing to a real attacker in real life. Call it \"courage.\" Said Salay, \"It's like flipping a switch from cowardice to bravado. The vMT is the switch.\" And the mice like playing Mighty Mouse. Given a choice between two locations, one where they get their vMT stimulated and another where they don't, they preferentially head for the one that generates stimulation. Humans apparently like it, too. According to studies from the early 1960s, patients preferred stimulation of a brain region analogous to a mouse's vMT over stim- ulation of any other brain area tested, including ones associated with sexual arousal. Oddly, when asked to describe the sensation they perceived when it was stim- ulated, they didn't recount titillating tales associated with pleasure. Instead, they reported feeling \"frustration and mild anger.\" Hmmm. And they liked it. This could explain a lot about our attraction to sports, not to men- tion the chemistry in a person's previous relationships. In short, the vMT is like Popeye's spinach. Activating it appears to bring on a bird-flipping rush of righteous defiance. The lion and the gazelle A gazelle running for its life and the lion chasing it are, in many respects, in similar physical states. Both animals' adrenal glands are pumping furiously, and both animals' livers are shovel-ing tons of glucose into their bloodstreams. Their hearts are pounding, their breathing is accelerated, their senses are heightened. So, what's the difference? Well, for one thing, their state of mind. The lion wants to be there; the gazelle really doesn't. Activating the vMT appears to turn a mouse's mental state in the face of a harrowing situation from gazelle- like to lionlike. What if you could do that in humans, too? \"We're hoping to learn how to turn gazelles into li- ons,\" Huberman said. Doing that doesn't necessarily re-quire gaining direct physical access to a person's vMT. That's lucky, because you can't just tuck a bunch of elec- trodes into the middle of people's heads and crank up the juice. So instead, Huberman and his teammates are planning to induce fear under controlled conditions; monitor some of the more easily accessed autonomic states that accompany it; and see if there are reliable, testable ways of reducing it. For this, they've turned to virtual reality. VR is uniquely capable of capturing visual experi- ences so that the full sphere of visual input gets repro- duced: Put on the goggles, hit the \"play\" button, and wherever you look, you'll see a 3-D replication of pretty much whatever you would have witnessed in the real- life scenario. Audio input, easily provided, further en- hances the experience. Huberman's group equipped its VR chamber with an observation window so investigators can monitor par- ticipants in real time, and with padded walls in case a participant reflexively makes a run for it under the mis- taken impression that an open field lies ahead. After filling out questionnaires concerning their cur- rent and general levels of anxiety and fear, participants will be fitted with sensors and filmed as they undergo a series of unsettling VR scenarios, of which the shark encounter is just one. Afterward, they'll be coached in one of a variety of ways that might help them dial down the typically uncomfortable, often decision-hindering, and sometimes debilitating autonomic reactions that, given the corresponding mental state, we categorize as fear. Then they'll be tossed back into the VR chamber for a repeat round of the hair-raising episodes to see if the training worked. Huberman and his colleagues hope to run hun- dreds of healthy, normal participants through this just- completed VR chamber in the next year. The idea is to establish baselines for the various parameters being measured. Eventually Huberman hopes to introduce hundreds or even thousands of participants, including people with post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorders or a variety of phobias, to the chamber. Many people carry around uncomfortable levels of fearfulness with them even when they're not contend- ing with an oncoming 30-foot-long shark. During their lifetimes, about 5 percent of all Americans will be diag- nosed with a severe anxiety disorder, nearly 8 percent will receive a diagnosis of PTSD and more than 10 per- cent will suffer from a phobia. They can't simply calm themselves by repeating, \"It's not real\" or \"This isn't re- ally a threat.\" Invoking journalistic privilege, I volunteered to be the first person to test the waters, as it were, by being treated to a walk-through of the entire sequence of scare scenarios. So there I stood in the customized chamber, begoggled, headphoned and festooned with multiple electrical leads monitoring my heart rate, breathing and sweat output. Cameras in the room's upper corners spied on my face and hands, while the goggles fed me virtual-reality footage. (They were also checking my pupil size, a good indicator of a person's arousal level: the wider the pupil opens, the higher the arousal.) Watching through the observation window was Yilmaz Balban, the creator of the \"looming predator\" paradigm. \"When I put mice in a box and showed them a de- fined stimulus \u2014 an overhead expanding disk \u2014 they exhibited an easily identified and measurable behavioral response: freezing or running for cover,\" she said. \"Now, I wanted to put humans in a box and see what hap- pened and whether that could be measured, too.\" So she conducted an online survey asking people what they're afraid of, and received lots of feedback: Plenty of us are afraid of heights, spiders, snakes and vicious dogs. Oh, and sharks. Scare scenarios and high hopes In October 2016, Huberman and a few members of his team traveled to Guadalupe, an island off the coast of Baja California where great white sharks abound at that time of year. Accompanying them was famed Hol- lywood photographer and skilled open-water shark diver Michael Muller. Huberman, Muller and other divers entered a cage that was then submerged 30 me- ters straight down into a school of great whites. From that submersible enclosure, Huberman shot 360-de- gree \"spherical video\" (wherever you look, you see whatever was there when the camera was filming the scene). Muller and a few other divers left the cage to get very up-close video of the 14- to 20-foot long, 2-ton creatures. \"Visually speaking, it's about as real as being there,\" Huberman said. \"The only difference is you don't get wet \u2014 although some people sweat a lot.\" I watched this episode unfold all around me during my VR experience. I was also subjected to scenarios in which I was perched on a branch of a very tall tree hundreds of feet above the sidewalk, or seated next to a vicious, toothy pit bull that \"attacked\" my arm. Rounding out the pic- ture were computer-generated but nonetheless ultra- realistic bouts of leaping off a plank several stories above the ground, and fending off attacks by a large hairy spider with the rough Fear continued from page 1 Stanford researchers are planning to study fear by inducing it under controlled conditions with the help of virtual reality technology.TOMER HANUKA See FEAR, page 7 \"Our goal isn't just to learn about fear, but to test ways of engaging in more adaptive coping.\"INSIDE STANFORD MEDICINE SEPTEMBER 11, 2017 7equivalent of a baseball bat. In the latter scenario, you're supposed to play a complicated game in which you aim a wand at a wall to make lit-up squares flip to dark and vice versa. But that's just a distraction. You soon become aware that there's a gross, hairy tarantula on the wall behind you. At least they give you a bat to smash it with. I chose to do so. But it was rigged. I discovered the bat couldn't kill or even dent the damned spider. It just caused the spider to leap off the wall and fly into my face or onto my clothes. You could say I was moving around a lot during this episode. Afterward, Yilmaz Balban told me that I was most pumped, autonomically speaking, while I was locked in gladiatorial combat with the spider. \"I wasn't scared, though,\" I blurted out, not with- out pride and, perhaps, a hint of emotional amnesia. \"You were aroused.\"I guess that's how it feels to have your vMT stimulated. After spending over an hour under the spell of a pair of VR goggles, ripping them off is somewhat of a shock \u2014 a rapid splashdown into what shrug-ging techies, videogame addicts and others for whom ordinary reality has been demoted call \"the default world.\" To ease my re-entry, Huberman walked me down the hall into his office, offered me a seat in a body- contoured plastic chair and slapped some head - phones on me. For the next 15 minutes, I was guided through a recorded, customized audio de-stressing session consisting largely of controlled-breathing and relaxation exercises. It worked so well that for the last several minutes I didn't know where I was, or care. It was a preview of what is to come. Huberman wants to put science to work developing tools for systematically reducing pathologic fear and anxiety. After their exposure to the battery of threats, partici-pants will receive training in various methods for do- ing that. \"Our goal isn't just to learn about fear, but to test ways of engaging in more adaptive coping \u2014 to help people make more logical decisions in the face of fear,\" Huberman said. \"There are a lot of prac - tices already out there that claim to reduce anxiety. We know they have some utility.\" But rigorous test- ing of these methods isn't easy, he said, due to the lack of standardization and difficulty in measuring their component inputs or their outcomes with any exactitude. One of several potential fear-countering tech- niques the researchers will test is controlled breath-ing. Choppy, rapid breathing stimulates arousal, whereas deep, slow breathing patterns with empha- sized exhalation purportedly induce calm. \"We're not talking about meditation,\" Huberman said. \"This is about how you can control your state by action, not inaction \u2014 how to cope when you have to make a split-second decision or when you are stressed and know it but can't seem to snap out of it. We want to come up with protocols that prescribe exact, testable steps: for instance, inhale for two sec- onds, hold for two seconds, exhale for four seconds, and don't worry about keeping a mantra in mind \u2014 how would we measure that, anyway? Behaviors like breathing, I can measure carefully.\" Huberman sees a tremendous potential for testable fear-reduction techniques. \"We're talking about test- ing and developing practices that are teachable, por- table and free,\" he said. But, he adds, \"We're not trying to 'cure' fear. We want to develop coping tools for reducing irrational fear. \"Fear can keep you alive. Most people should stay away from sharks.\" ISM A version of this article appears in the summer 2017 is-sue of Stanford Medicine magazine. The study was published online Aug. 30 in Human Reproduction. Michael Eisenberg, MD, an assistant professor of urology, is the senior author. The lead author is Yash Khandwala, a medical student at the University of California- San Diego who was a research scholar in Eisenberg's lab at Stanford when the analysis was done. The National Vital Statistics System records births and deaths reported by all 50 states, as well as self-reported mater- nal and, where available, paternal ages, levels of education and race and ethnicity of the parents. While the CDC periodi-cally produces reports on maternal statis- tics, little information about newborns' dads has been available. Older dads and college degrees Between 1972 and 2015, the research- ers found, the average paternal age at the time of an American child's birth grew from 27.4 years to 30.9 years. Asian- American dads \u2014 and in particular, Japa- nese- and Vietnamese-American dads \u2014 are the oldest, at 36 years of age on average. Paternal age rose with more years of education; the typical newborn's father with a college degree is 33.3 years old. Over the same time period, the share of newborns' fathers who were older than 40 doubled from 4.1 percent to 8.9 per- cent, while the share who were over 50 rose from 0.5 percent to 0.9 percent. Similar trends of increasing age have been reported in other industrialized countries. The steadily advancing age of new- borns' fathers is likely to carry public- health implications as well, Eisenberg said. A rising paternal age can affect the total number of children a man will have, which can impact the demographics of the population. In addition, he said, \"every potential dad acquires an average of two new mutations in his sperm each year. And there are associations between older fatherhood and higher rates of au-tism, schizophrenia, chromosomal ab-normalities, some pediatric cancers and certain rare genetic conditions.\" On the flip side, he noted, older fa- thers are more likely to have better jobs and more resources, more likely to have reasonably stable lifestyles and more likely to live with their children and, thus, be more involved in child-rearing. Ages of new moms increasing, too \"Maternal ages at birth have been in- creasing, too,\" Eisenberg said. \"In fact, they've advanced even more than pater - nal ages have in the same time frame. This may be a consequence of women waiting longer to get married or putting off childbearing as the years they spend in higher education increase and as ca- reers become more central to their lives. The result is that the average age differ - ence between moms and dads has been shrinking, from 2.7 years in 1972 to 2.3 years in 2015.\" This convergent pattern appears to apply to all racial, regional, age and edu-cation categories, he said. \"We've seen a lot of changes in the last several decades. Contraception is more reliable and wide- spread. Women have become more in- tegrated into the workforce. This seems to be reflected in an increasing parity in parental ages over the last four decades.\" Advancing parental age leaves fewer years for childbearing and is likely to ex-ert a follow-on effect of reducing the av- erage family size over the long haul, with potentially huge economic and public- health ramifications, Eisenberg said. \"Fewer people being born means fewer productive workers a generation down the road,\" he said. \"This can ob- viously have profound tax and economic implications.\" While parental-data reporting to the National Vital Statistics System by some states was spotty in the early years of the period under study, it's been running at virtually 100 percent since 1985, at least for mothers, said Eisenberg. In 2015, the latest year available, information about newborns' fathers was missing in one of every nine births. That could be because the father was unknown or because the mother didn't wish to report his name or any details about him, Eisenberg said. It matters. Evidence indicates that, on the whole, young children whose pa-ternal data appears in their birth records have better health outcomes. Paternal-data reporting rates vary ac- cording to mothers' race, ethnicity, age, education and regional location, the analysis showed, with the reporting rate for African-American newborns consis- tently the lowest for all races. Over the past decade, African-American mothers under the age of 20 reported paternal data only half the time. However, the rate of paternal reporting for children born to African-American mothers has grown from its low of 63 percent in 1985 to a current rate of 70.9 percent, Eisen - berg said.Overall paternal reporting for U.S. births has risen to its current 88.4 per- cent since reaching a nadir of 85.5 per- cent in 1991. The youngest dad recorded during the 44-year period covered in the study was 11 years old; the oldest was 88. But the world-record holder, Eisenberg said, is a gentleman from India who in the last decade fathered two children at the age of 94 and 96 with a wife who was in her late 50s. \"Unfortunately, they wound up separating,\" he said.

Prober will serve as both the founding director of the center and the senior as-sociate vice provost for health educa- tion within the office. \"We are very pleased to serve the School of Medicine and the field of medicine in this way,\" said John Mitch - ell, PhD, vice provost for teaching and learning. \"An important part of our mis- sion is to make Stanford's expertise more broadly available. This new center provides an opportunity to do that through mean- ingful impact on human health.\" The center's offerings ultimately may range from free content in re- source-poor countries to fee-based certificate and degree programs in de-veloped economies, Mitchell said, and will be funded by private foundations and philanthropy, tuition and, in some cases, research sponsorships. Building on existing programs Prober noted that the prolifera- tion of smart devices into the farthest reaches of the globe has made it pos - sible to distribute health information broadly, with content tailored to ad - dress a wide variety of audiences. A topic like nutrition education, for ex- ample, can be tailored to reach medical students, patients, health professionals in continuing medical education or in- dividual citizens in rural communities in some of the world's most impover- ished countries. \"Anything we create of inherent value for health care should be re- purposed for health care for all, including developing countries,\" he said. The center will build upon existing programs developed by the medical school and the vice provost's office and also expand partnerships with other organizations, including academic institutions, governmental agencies and nonprofits both in the United States and abroad. The center will expand Stanford's Digital Medical Education Interna- tional Collaborative program, which aims to improve health education by creating high-quality, accessible con- tent for use in developing countries. Digital MEdIC already has a strong presence in India, where Sakti Srivas-tava, MD, associate professor of sur - gery and director of the program, has been building partnerships with public and private medical schools, nonprof- its and government agencies to make online and simulation-based resources about health more widely available. Similarly, Maya Adam, MD, a lec-turer in pediatrics, is now expanding the Digital MEdIC program in South Africa by disseminating digital teach- ing tools on nutrition, pregnancy, breastfeeding and HIV management that can be used by community health workers and local women who might not otherwise have access to this information. Online and interactive The new center also will promote courses that combine online and inter-active learning. For example, students at Stanford's medical school now learn biochemistry by watching short videos on their own time and then attending interactive class sessions to discuss the material. Whereas attendance in bio- chemistry lectures once hovered be- tween 20 and 30 percent (not unusual at medical schools), some 95 percent of students now attend the interactive sessions. The School of Medicine has been collaborating with other medi- cal schools in developing a similar ap- proach to teaching microbiology and other topics in basic science. While the center will initially draw content from the School of Medicine, it eventually will include other Stan- ford faculty whose work touches on health and wellness \u2014 for example, experts on climate change, economics, psychology and international law. \"We invite faculty from other Stan- ford schools with an interest in health to join in the effort and help us make the most effective contribution possi- ble to world health,\" Mitchell said.

For one thing, researchers tend to go deep in the microbiome in only one part of the body, such as the gut or skin, at a time. Blood samples, in contrast, \"go deeply everywhere at the same time.\" For another, researchers often focus their attention on just a few interesting microbes, \"and people just don't look at what the remaining things are,\" Kowar-sky said. \"There probably are some interesting, novel things there, but it's not relevant to the experiment people want to do at that time.\" It was looking at blood samples in an unbiased way, Quake said, that led to the new results and a new ap- preciation of just how diverse the human microbiome is. Going forward, Quake said, the lab hopes to study the microbiomes of other organisms to see what's there. \"There's all kinds of viruses that jump from other spe- cies into humans, a sort of spillover effect, and one of the dreams here is to discover new viruses that might ultimately become human pandemics.\" Understanding what those viruses are could help doctors manage and track outbreaks, he said. \"What this does is it arms infectious disease doctors with a whole set of new bugs to track and see if they're associated with disease,\" Quake said. \"That's going to be a whole other chapter of work for people to do.\" Quake is a member of Stanford Bio-X, the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, the Stanford Cancer Institute and the Stanford Neurosciences Institute, as well as a faculty fellow of Stanford ChEM-H.
