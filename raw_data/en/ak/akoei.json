Why Detox? Your body is naturally designed to detoxify, which is why a smart and safe detox (or cleanse) can help jumpstart your body's natural recalibration abilities while promoting healthier liver function and elimination. Detox Benefits Too often, we assume that unexplained health issues like brain fog, weight gain, insomnia, memory loss and weakened immune systems are simply a reflection of age or our \"new normal.\" A detoxification program can reset your body and reverse many of the symptoms that keep us from feeling like our best selves and living a full, vibrant life. Benefits of Detoxification may include: - Increased energy levels - Reduced cravings - Weight loss - Restful sleep & mental clarity - Overall feeling of wellness - Healthier skin, hair, and nails About Our Detox Program Our 21-day program includes hands-on guidance from our Functional Medicine doctors and comprehensive nutritional supplements that make everything easy to follow, ensuring that you never miss any necessary nutrients. While your body eliminates what it no longer needs (heavy metals, toxins, and allergens), the nutritious supplements included in the program help to replenish your system with essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and other nutrients that are vital for maintaining optimal health. During your detox, you will receive a program kit that includes a set of supplements, drink mixes, and a customized blender bottle accompanied by a detailed patient guide that helps you choose your meal plans. Every day, you are set up for success with Daily Core Nutrition shakes (and supplements) and a meal guideline that is rich in whole foods. Our plan is not calorie restrictive and allows for snacking on healthy whole foods in moderation. Our program includes professional support and a consultation with a [Functional Medicine ](https://alignedmodernhealth.com/services/functional-nutrition/)provider at the Aligned Modern Health location of your choice.
