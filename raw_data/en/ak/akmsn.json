E San Diego, CA 92121-3263 Dear Mr. Li: The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your facility located at 8830 Rehco Rd., Ste. E, San Diego, CA from September 11 - 17, 2018, and on March 19, 2019. During the inspection we collected labeling for your products. Based on a subsequent review of your product labeling, including labeling collected during the inspection as well as your website at the internet address [www.activeherb.com](http://www.activeherb.com), we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA's home page at http://www.fda.gov. Unapproved New Drugs Following the September 2018 inspection, FDA reviewed labeling collected during the inspection, including product labels and a product catalog. FDA also reviewed your website at the internet address https://www.activeherb.com in March 2019 and has determined that you take orders there for your Active Herb brand products YinVive, EaseTonic, and LiverVive, and your Guang Ci Tang brand products Vertigoff (Ban Xia Bai Zhu Tian Ma Pian), Nasopass (Bi Yan Pian), NeuroSoothe (Chai Hu Long Gu Lu Mu Li Pian (Wan)), JointsJoy (Du Huo Ji Sheng Wan), Cardiovigor (Fu Fang Dan Shen Pian), Kudzu Relaxe (Ge Gen Tang Pian), Stomacare Qi Pian), Breathmooth (Ke Chuan Stonepass (Li Shui Pai Shi Pian), and Bupleuri Relaxe (Xiao Chai Hu Pian (Wan)). The claims on your website and other labeling establish that these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. Examples of some of the labeling claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include: EaseTonic Product webpage: - \"You will feel happier without having to rely on taking a 'little blue pill' that may potentially cause side effects. If you feel . . . depressed, or prone to mood swings, EaseTonic may help.\" In your 2017 Active Herb Product Catalog, which you stated you continue to distribute: - \"EaseTonic is based on one of the most well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas, Xiao Yao San, which has been studied extensively in clinicals trails against placebo, antidepressants, or in combination with antidepressants. The collective results of the numerous studies show Xiao Yao San has beneficial effects on patients with depression, either using the formula alone, or combining with antidepressants.\" LiverVive Product webpage: - \"In a clinical study, a Chinese herbal formula that is a variation to LiverVive was used to treat 50 chronic hepatitis B patients.

It . . . reduces swelling.\" - \"The chief herb in the formula, Jin Qian Cao . . . reduces stone formation of pure calcium oxalate crystals\" Product catalog: - \"may . . Hepatitis Remedies\" Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are \"new drugs\" under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). \"Adequate directions for use\" means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. Your EaseTonic, LiverVive, Vertigoff, NeuroSoothe, Cardiovigor, Stonepass, and Bupleuri Relaxe products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safety for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your EaseTonic, LiverVive, Vertigoff, NeuroSoothe, Cardiovigor, Stonepass, and Bupleuri Relaxe products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(a)]. Misbranded Dietary Supplements FDA also reviewed several product labels collected during the inspection and notes significant label deviations, as follows: 1. Your Guang Ci Tang brand products Cold Signoff, NeuroSoothe, Skin Windclear, Tumoclear, and Spiritcalm, products YinVive and QiVive are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(s)(2)(C)] because the labels fail to identify in English the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1). Furthermore, if all components of a plant are used as a dietary ingredient, the Supplement Facts label must declare \"whole plant,\" \"entire plant,\" or a similar descriptor. Finally, the term \"herb\" is not a plant part. 2. Your Active Herb brand Yin Vive and QiVive products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) because the serving size declared on the labels is incorrect. The serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. The YinVive and QiVive labels' Suggested Use directs to take up to 4 capsules at a time, but the Serving Size listed in the Supplement Facts labels is two capsules. 3. Your Guang Ci Tang brand products Cold Signoff, NeuroSoothe, Skin WindClear, Tumoclear, and SpiritCalm, and your Active Herb brand products Yin Vive and QiVive products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(i)(2)] in that product labels fail to include ingredients that are not dietary ingredients or that do not contain dietary ingredients, such as excipients, fillers, artificial colors, artificial sweeteners, flavors, or binders. In addition, the product labels fail to declare all the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. For example: a. The YinVive and QiVive products are encapsulated, but the capsule ingredients are not declared in the ingredient statement. b. If a botanical ingredient is listed in Herbs of Commerce, the standardized common name must be listed on the Supplement Facts label. Your Guang Ci Tang brand Cold Signoff lists \"Platycodi Grandiflori\", however the standardized common name for this plant as noted in Herbs of Commerce is \"Platycodon.\" Likewise, your Guang Ci Tang brand Neurosoothe product label lists \"Radix Ginseng.\" Ginseng is not the complete standardized common name for a plant. c. Terms such as \"Concha Ostreae,\" \"Os Draconis\", \"Periostracum Cicadae, and \"Gypsum Fibrosum\" are not common or usual names for dietary ingredients. d. Terms such as \"Rhei\", \"Paridis\", \"Sarcandrae\", \"Dogwood\", Albiziae\", \"Citrus Peel\" are not common or usual names for dietary ingredients. 4. Your Guang Ci Tang brand products Cold Signoff, NeuroSoothe, Skin Windclear, Tumoclear, and Spiritcalm products are misbranded within the meaning section 403(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(f)] because the product labels contain information in two languages but do not repeat all the required information in both languages. As required by 21 CFR 101.15(c), if a product label contains any representation in a foreign language, all words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the Act to appear on the label must appear in the foreign language. These products include foreign language on the labels but fail to list the \"Herbal Dietary Supplement\" part of the statement of identity, net quantity of contents, all information in the Supplement Facts label including Supplement Facts, Serving size, servings per container, and so on, and the name and address of the responsible party. 5. Your ActiveHerb brand YinVive product label is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(y) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(y)] in that the label fails to bear a domestic address or domestic phone number through which the responsible person (as described in section 761) may receive a report of a serious adverse event with such dietary supplement.
