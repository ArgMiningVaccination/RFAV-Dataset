The Mandarin signage reminds us that all of the construction elements for this 150-bed facility came directly from China - which donated the entire institution - as well as its equipment and medicines. But the Chinese contribution to this flagship of the Malian health care system does not end there. Walking through the departments, we came across several Asian doctors offering traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatments - including acupuncture, which is used primarily for pain management. Elsewhere in the city, there are Chinese medicine \"clinics,\" owned by private entrepreneurs, testament to the popularity of these treatments and products among the capital's inhabitants. Bamako is far from being an exception on the continent, as TCM is offered in many African cities. Scholarships and training Health has been a pillar of Beijing's foreign policy for decades. \"The presence of TCM is often a reflection of historical links between China and the States. It is found to a greater extent in countries where Chinese medical missions were set up, from the 1960s onwards,\" said Xavier Auregan, a lecturer in geopolitics at the Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Lille. In Mali, the first Chinese medical mission was established during that time in the Segou region. Since then, Chinese involvement in the African health-care landscape has taken many forms, with recent major investments in large health-related projects, such as the recently completed African Union Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC Africa) building in Addis Ababa. One of the health-care components of the \"New Silk Roads,\" TCM is dispersed through scientific and medical cooperation centers, called \"Luban workshops.\" The roll-out of around a dozen of these workshops - which are supposed to enable thousands of African students to pursue courses leading to professional qualifications - was one of the eight initiatives presented in September 2018 by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, in Beijing. The Bamako center opened shortly before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in late December 2019. \"During the months that followed, China had a strong presence on the health front, notably by offering TCM products and care to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV-2,\" said Xavier Auregan. \"It was also a way to fight the anti-Chinese sentiment that the origin of the virus tended to fuel.\" Since then, 14 Luban workshops have reportedly taken place, across Africa from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to Madagascar, Ethiopia and Kenya. In addition to doctors sent from Beijing, TCM is also increasingly practiced by African traditional therapists In addition to doctors sent from Beijing and expatriates working as private entrepreneurs, TCM is also increasingly practiced by African doctors and traditional therapists. Some Luban workshops, as well as Confucius Institutes on many African campuses, offer TCM training, such as at the University of the Western Cape in South Africa.

This is a way for a number of local traditional therapists to diversify their range of treatments and expand their client base. TCM is a flourishing market and not only on the continent: In 2018, it brought in $50 billion worldwide, with the world's largest consumer outside of China being the United States. Diabetes, hypertension and malaria Is TCM competing with traditional African medicines? \"It is tempting to pit traditional Chinese and African medicines against each other, but it seems more accurate to see them as two different methods, which sit alongside each other in the provision of local care and don't necessarily target the same people,\" said Elisabeth Hsu, Professor of Anthropology at the University of Oxford and author of the book Chinese Medicine in East Africa: An Intimacy with Strangers (ed. Berghahn, 2022). A rare scholar on the subject, she informed her research with repeated visits to Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. According to her observations, TCM attracts clients of all ages, but is more popular to middle-class men, who live on outskirts of cities. They seek advice for a wide range of conditions, including diabetes, hypertension and malaria, where the efficacy of Chinese medicine has been proven. Indeed, in 2015 Tu Youyou, research director at the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for the discovery of artemisinin, a potent antimalarial drug. This has helped build trust in TCM. \"We talk broadly about TCM, but many people who go to these clinics don't really know what they are actually buying. And you can find a lot of things there! Remedies from traditional Chinese medicine as well as Western medicine, but manufactured in China,\" said Hsu, who pointed out that Chinese doctors have become particularly established in reproductive medicine, \"a field in which Western medicine has a low success rate.\" Many remedies sold in \"clinics\" promise to improve sexual function and fertility. \"During one of my stays in Bamako, I watched a TCM practitioner's store, opposite my hotel. He almost exclusively sold products for men, with very explicit packaging, and his store was always full! For many men, it is easier to go to a Chinese practitioner, who will never say anything to anyone, rather than the local traditional therapist, who probably knows friends or family,\" said Auregan. Some people are speaking out against the threat that certain ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine pose to flora and fauna. Animals such as pangolins, rhinoceroses and tigers, for example, are still hunted mainly so that some of their organs or dander - such as hair, feathers and scales - can be used in TCM remedies. "}
