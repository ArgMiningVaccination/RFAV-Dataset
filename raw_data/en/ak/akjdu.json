In January 2015, we started Natural Medicine and Detox and took over the space of Phoenix Natural Medicine. The owners are Dr. Fontes and Malissa Stawicki. In April of 2018 we had to move as the building we were in on Roosevelt was coming down so we moved a few miles away to 7th Street, just south of Thomas Rd. We completely renovated the 1940's duplex and continue to work on the exterior... lots of plans for organic garden and edible landscape.", "sitename": "Yelp", "date": "2023-08-10", "cleaned_text": "Natural Medicine and Detox [(41 reviews)](#reviews) [Naturopathic/Holistic](/search?find_desc=Naturopathic%2FHolistic&find_loc=Phoenix%2C+AZ), [Acupuncture](/search?find_desc=Acupuncture&find_loc=Phoenix%2C+AZ), [Colonics](/search?find_desc=Colonics&find_loc=Phoenix%2C+AZ) Photos & videos Services Offered Verified by Business Virtual Consultations Review Highlights \" [Mario](/biz/natural-medicine-and-detox-phoenix-2?hrid=TxEkKQb4ElfeL_n-5dZYTQ&rh_ident=Mario&rh_type=people), Melissa and the entire staff have been there to help treat my entire family at one time or another.\" [ in 6 reviews](/biz/natural-medicine-and-detox-phoenix-2?hrid=TxEkKQb4ElfeL_n-5dZYTQ&rh_ident=Mario&rh_type=people) \" [Melissa](/biz/natural-medicine-and-detox-phoenix-2?hrid=-3flv64BuJiyu566yic9IA&rh_ident=Melissa&rh_type=people), Ghail and others are all very nice people.\" [ in 3 reviews](/biz/natural-medicine-and-detox-phoenix-2?hrid=-3flv64BuJiyu566yic9IA&rh_ident=Melissa&rh_type=people) \"I was in for a colonic recently at the Phoenix NaturalMedicine and [Detox Center](/biz/natural-medicine-and-detox-phoenix-2?hrid=ni0-GdidLmVoX6MQyFCNLg&rh_ident=detox_center&rh_type=phrase).\" [ in 3 reviews](/biz/natural-medicine-and-detox-phoenix-2?hrid=ni0-GdidLmVoX6MQyFCNLg&rh_ident=detox_center&rh_type=phrase) Undersea/hyperbaric in Fertility [read more](/adredir?ad_business_id=Z3QHUXXUq3ek9iJFe5BQew&campaign_id=D0D-0GYed7I0Q2EuYDkQeQ&click_origin=read_more&placement=above_biz_review&placement_slot=0&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fiv-revival-mobile-hydration-therapy-scottsdale-2%3Fhrid%3DP-pXrYemutWrj_-Bm6nXzQ&request_id=ffb292c36145f9c6&signature=8dc99b705a6bdbc8e0fb1c69be8b54eab2f17924e35411a3859194dd7c1e2d1c&slot=2) in Iv Hydration About the Business Business owner information Mario F.

My friend recommended this place. I did 3 session of the colonic hydration and it was my first time. Melissa was helpful and accommodating. All the staff is very friendly. I will be back again and try other services. - 7/19/2022 If you are looking to heal naturally at a reasonable cost, you my friend have just stumped upon a gold mine. I remember having to pay $300 just to be seen by a natural path to tell them everything that was going on with me and leave with nothing but another $200 appointment lined up. Here for $40 you can meet with the Doc and in most cases he will have you feeling better BEFORE you leave the building. The Doc. This man is a miracle worker, he's a genius, intuitive, and he is results driven. I have never felt more seen or heard as a patient than when I go here. Here are a list of things that I recommend trying: Ozone therapy- I had a surgery and tons of inflammation and pain. I kept telling my doctor that something wrong, but was gaslighted and told it was all in my head. I went to Natural Medicine and Detox and had an Ozone treatment that day to my foot. I went home and was freezing, which was crazy because in the summer it's 111 degrees out. I bundled up in blankets and took nap. I woke up feeling refreshed and when I looked at my foot ALL of the swelling had gone away in ONE treatment. I was floored. I have also done Ozone therapy through an IV and I've had great results. It cuts down on my pain, inflammation, and IBS. And when I did this after my last surgery my healing was 10x faster. If you pay attention to any of the bio hackers right now they all say this therapy is the MOST helpful healing modality. And if you're going to do this therapy in the valley you'll find the best price here. Acupuncture- I have had acupuncture by at least 15 other providers before I went to see the Doc. His acupuncture is unmatched, it is NEXT LEVEL. I had a pain in my foot for 4 months I was limping, had MRIs, wore a leg brace, had crutches, etc. I went in to see the Doc for something else, happened to mention my foot, he put ONE needle in my foot and I almost jumped off the table (normally acupuncture doesn't hurt at all) and 10 seconds later my pain completely went away and I had my life back. What I have felt to be most effective is acupuncture on the beamer table for 30 minutes. The Beamer table- HEAVEN. When you get acupuncture on the Beamer table, I feel, it amplifies the treatment 3x. After 15 minutes on the Beamer table you feel blissful. If you have any depression, anxiety, or pain I highly recommend this treatment. You lay on the table with all of your clothes on, minus shoes and cell phone and float off to la la land. I've laid on some amethyst tables before and felt nothing. This, however, is the real deal and inexpensive. Foot baths- I was a little skeptical about these at first but they really do work. I recommend doing this at least 3-4x to notice a benefit and you will see the difference in the water. With all of the heavy metals, polluted air and water, and chemicals in our food this is a must to help detox the body. Hypnotherapy- I've tried this a couple times with other providers and never felt anything, in fact, I thought it was some New Age BS. I was having a lot of anger towards a friend that wronged me I couldn't let it go for a year. Which was completely unlike me. I usually didn't get angry and I didn't know how to let it go. The Doc suggested that we try it, so I said why not. Wouldn't you know he did the treatment and boom, I feel nothing towards this friend anymore and I'm at peace. This man never ceases to amaze me. - TDP Lamp therapy- Ladies who have period pain or endometriosis-the Doc has given me Chinese herbal tea to increase blood flow/production before and during my period(it actually tastes good). I have also found relief using the TDP lamp they have there. If you are suffering from severe cramps and you can drive there, it's a miracle lamp and all of my pain goes away when I'm under it. They have many more treatments there, but these are my favorite go to's. Go see the Doc! You don't have to do this alone. Best of luck in your healing journey. - 1/21/2023 Loved my first visit to Natural Medicine and Detox. Much different vibe than other Naturopathic Dr. Offices! From what I can tell they are not in the business of selling supplements. But seem to genuinely want to help people. They seem to really know what they are doing and take a holistic approach : ) And more affordable than most places. - 10/28/2022 Love this place as it is truly a place for healing. You have professionals with the proper mindset for natural and holistic healing and aren't just another number in the queue. David, in particular has helped me with so many of my ailments and does so with a kind hand and smile. - 5/31/2020 Hands down, the best natural medical center I have been to! They have helped to not only treat/help my body from the inside out, they have also helped to balance mood and energy in the process. Dr. Mario, Melissa and the entire staff have been there to help treat my entire family at one time or another. One of my sons, who happens to be on the \"Spectrum\" has made noticeable improvements in communication and attention, since visiting the facility. WELL WORTH IT!!! Business owner information Malissa S. 11/5/2021 Thank you so much Jesse... for kind words, we so appreciate you! - 3/11/2021 Prices are on point and schedule is accommodating. Staff is friendly and customer service is 100%. Def recommend the clear light infrared sauna they have! Business owner information Malissa S. 11/5/2021 THANK YOU KORI! We so appreciate you sharing your experience and the 5 STARS. - 12/29/2021 Staff is wonderful! Dr. Fontes is a 10 out of 10 - caring, determined to solve health issues, and identify root cause Vs my Mayo Clinic PCP who simply doesnt care about patients or entertain possible options for addressing recurring situations. Business owner information Malissa S. 1/3/2022 Thank you for the love and support, Ronnie and for sharing your experience with Dr. Fontes! We always do what we can to identify the root cause of a health issue and educate the patient so they can be pro-active in fixing it. If you ever need anything, Dr. Fontes and our team are here for you! Warmly, Malissa Stawicki, Holistic Health Advocate - 1/23/2020 I came in for an acupuncture treatment and left feeling so much better! I met with Dr. Fontes, and he made sure I understood the \"what\" and \"why\"\" of the treatment I was getting today. The office its self is clean & comfortable with a really cool retro vibe. Very friendly staff; Immediately felt at ease as soon as I walked in! They have a great list of services; I am definitely going back for at least two of the other treatments they offer! Business owner information Malissa S. 11/5/2021 Thank you Nicole for the 5 stars and for sharing your experience. Your testimony will help others and encourage them to try our services, so thank you! More people should know about holistic therapies and try them! - 11/14/2020 I went in for a colonic, the staff was friendly, knowledgeable and explained everything very well. They checked in to make sure everything was going okay and were supportive throughout the whole process! I'll definitely be back. - 7/2/2021 I was only in town for 1 day but my lower back had been out for a week. Lucky for me they had a last minute appointment. Instead of just giving me a massage (which is what I called about) David spoke to me about my pain issue and we jointly decided in a combination treatment of acupuncture and massage. At the end of an hour I felt as though my body was levitating. Always a good indication of an effective treatment. It is a small, very personal operation. Not at all a \"spa machine\". I feel very fortunate that they were the place I (and my back) landed today. Business owner information Malissa S. 11/5/2021 Thank you Jane for your 5 star review and for sharing your experience, we so appreciate it! Hope to see you the next time you are in town, hope all is well!
