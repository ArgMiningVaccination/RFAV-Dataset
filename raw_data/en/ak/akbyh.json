According to the manufacturer, Golden Revive Plus is the most powerful natural pain reliever on the market today. Here's a list of the individual Golden Revive plus Ingredients and what they do. - Curcumin - Boswellia - Magnesium - Quercetin - Bromelain Curcumin Curcumin is a pigment found in turmeric that not only gives it its characteristic bright hue but also has a range of health benefits. These benefits include antibacterial, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. Because of these wide-ranging functions, turmeric has been studied about arthritis, eye conditions, cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and more. Piperine Piperine increases your body's ability to absorb a wide variety of nutrients by interacting and enhancing the molecules involved in the metabolism of these nutrients. It enhances the bioavailability of every nutrient, ensuring that the process of blocking the \"Pain Chain\" can take place. Boswellia Boswellia contains an ingredient called boswellic acid. Research has confirmed that much like curcumin, boswellic acid is an extremely powerful anti-inflammatory substance. Boswellic acid inhibits the production of another painful chemical called 5-lipoxygenase. Boswellia initiates healing and it does this by stimulating joint repair by activating your body's production of collagen. It also keeps your joints lubricated, giving you free, effortless movement by restoring protective proteins produced in synovial fluid. Magnesium Specifically, in chronic pain, magnesium can help offset the effects of calcium, which relaxes muscles and nerves. Magnesium acts like a plug-in nerve receptor that is over-stimulated. The problem with this essential mineral is that most people do not have sufficient levels for optimal health. Quercetin Reputed to be the most super-concentrated antioxidant on the planet, it is commonly found in wine and onions. Not only does it contain powerful antioxidant benefits but it blocks pain-causing chemicals too. Bromelain Bromelain is a powerful anti-fibrotic enzyme found in the juice and stem of pineapples. One of the things that makes Bromelain so effective against pain is that not only is it super-effective at, breaking down unwanted scar tissue that often forms in joints, muscles, and nerves, it also has potent pain-relieving properties too.

Causes of Joint Pain - Golden Revive Plus Reviews Many conditions and factors can cause a person to experience joint pain. If a person has pain in multiple joints, it is known as polyarthralgia. Usually, joint pain is the result of injury, infection, illness, or inflammation. Below are some of the common causes of joint pain: Injury Injury is a common cause of [joint pain](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/joint-pain#causes). Injuries can result from the excessive use or effort of the joints or from an impact that causes a fracture, sprain, or strain. For example, a common knee injury is a damage to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). People who play certain sports, such as soccer, basketball, or football, are more at risk of injuring their ACL. Viral infection Some infections may result in joint pain. For example, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) can cause complications that result in joint pain. It is common for people with HCV to have related rheumatic diseases, which can cause problems, including pain in the joints. Disease Some diseases can cause joint pain. Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease, and common symptoms include muscle and joint pain. Joint pain is the first symptom for more than half of those who develop lupus. People develop lupus because their body's immune system becomes hyperactive and attacks normal, healthy tissue. Arthritis Arthritis and arthralgia are very similar but have key differences. Both describe joint pain, but arthralgia occurs without the distinct inflammation in the joint that characterizes arthritis. Nearly half of adults with arthritis report persistent joint pain. There are more than 100 different kinds of arthritis, including: - osteoarthritis (OA) - rheumatoid arthritis (RA) - gout - septic arthritis The cause of arthritis varies among the different types. OA results from cartilage loss in the joints. Calcification of the cartilage around the joints eventually makes the cartilage thinner before damaging it. Older adults are more likely to develop OA. RA is an autoimmune response to a trigger. The body tries to fight off what it thinks is an invader but instead degrades the cartilage and bones in the joints.
