Allied health practitioners are part of the primary care health sector that provides an essential health service to the community. [Should I close my Clinic?] There has been no directive from the government for any allied health service to close or stop providing treatments. Very strict infection control guidelines should be observed in both treatment and waiting rooms and distancing requirements in the waiting room and reception desk. The use of any available personal protective equipment (PPE) gloves, masks etc is advised. [Is it acceptable to close my Clinic?] Yes. All of us, practitioners, authorities and the public alike, are very concerned about COVID-19 and its possible spread. The practice of self care is very important in these times and for you, that may include closing your clinic. We have a responsibility for ourselves and our families to do what is best for us. That gives every practitioner the choice and control over what is best for them - when and if to close and reopen their clinic. Exercise the most suitable choice for you. [Should I be treating people if I have respiratory symptoms?] If you are unwell and potentially contagious, you should not be treating patients. [Should I treat people with respiratory signs or symptoms?] You have the right to refuse to treat a patient. If they have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 or have just returned from overseas and are unwell or fulfil any other criteria for COVID-19, you can/must refer them to their GP for assessment. Here is a link to a [self-assessment tool](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/symptom-checker/tool/basic-details) [Can I make online/virtual appointments with patients for a Chinese herbal medicine consultation?] If the patient consents to having an online consultation, it would be appropriate to deliver a consultation via telephone, Zoom, Skype or the like. All necessary practice guidelines such as record keeping and patient confidentiality should be followed. However, at this stage, the Private Health Funds do not provide rebates for online consultations. [Is AACMA lobbying the government for access to Medicare during this time?] AACMA certainly is. We are communicating with the government about this issue and several others at the moment. [Is AACMA still open?] AACMA Head Office is open and operating under reduced staff and hours to comply with social distancing directives. If the office is required to shut down, the best way to contact any AACMA office staff member is via email.
