A properly functioning immune system helps our bodies fight off disease and keeps us us happy and healthy. Now more than ever our focus should be on doing everything we can to keep our bodies natural defense system running at peak performance. What is the Immune System? The immune system is our bodies defense against a wide variety of pathogens, viruses, and diseases. It is a complex network of cells spread throughout the body that keep a constant lookout for pathogens, viruses, bacteria, or any other organism that could potentially cause us harm. If any of these are detected, the immune system immediately gets to work clearing the unwanted invaders from our system. It's important to note that as we age, the effectiveness of our immune system begins to decline, leading to an increase in infections and illness. To continue functioning properly, the immune system requires balance and harmony among all of the individual components that make up the system. Here is a list of my favorite essential oils to help promote this balance and harmony in our body. 5 Essential Oils for Immume System Support [1. Lavender](https://www.matrixaromatherapy.com/product-page/organic-lavender) Lavender is one of the most widely used essential oils across the globe. Lavender has anti-viral, anti-microbial, and anti-bacterial properties that make it a great addition to our body's natural defense system. Another added benefit of using lavender is its ability to relieve stress, which is often one of the biggest factors in promoting immune system health. Along with relieving stress, Lavender is filled with antioxidants that remove free radicals from our system which are often associated with cell damage, illness, and aging. [2. Lemon](https://www.matrixaromatherapy.com/product-page/organic-lemon-essential-oil) Lemon is a great oil to use for detoxification of the body because of the abundance of vitamins and minerals it contains. Since essential oils are the distilled essence of the parent plant, lemon essential oil retains the powerful toxin fighting properties of the fruit itself. In addition to aiding the immune system, lemon can also be used to improve mood and sharpen your focus. [3. Peppermint](https://www.matrixaromatherapy.com/product-page/organic-peppermint-essential-oil) Peppermint essential oil contains high levels of menthol, which gives it its distinctive minty scent and cooling effect. Menthol has been shown to have antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties, making it an excellent choice for boosting the immune system. One of the main ways that peppermint essential oil can help to boost the immune system is by improving respiratory function. When we inhale peppermint oil, the menthol helps to open up the airways, making it easier to breathe. This can be especially helpful during cold and flu season when respiratory infections are more common. [4. Tea Tree](https://www.matrixaromatherapy.com/product-page/organic-tea-tree-essential-oil) Tea tree, also known as melaleuca, is one of the most efficient and useful essential oils for immune system support. Tea tree is highly regarded for its outstanding anti-microbial properties and its ability to stimulate the immune system, which helps fight off infection and disease. Tea tree is also one of the more gentle essential oils that you can use, making it easy to incorporate into your daily routine. [5. Eucalyptus](https://www.matrixaromatherapy.com/product-page/organic-eucalyptus-essential-oil) Often used in natural cold and flu remedies, Eucalyptus is a wonderful decongestant that can help clear your respiratory tract and prevent infection. Multiple studies have shown that simply inhaling eucalyptus oil helps fight the bacteria that cause infections like strep, tuberculosis, and MRSA.

Tips For Using Essential Oils Safely Essential oils have been used for centuries for their medicinal and therapeutic benefits, but it is important to use them safely to avoid potential risks. Here are some tips on how to use essential oils safely. 1. Dilute Properly Essential oils are highly concentrated plant extracts and should always be diluted before use. Most essential oils should be diluted in a carrier oil such as coconut, jojoba, or almond oil. A general guideline is to use a 1-2% dilution rate, meaning 6-12 drops of essential oil per ounce of carrier oil. 2. Know Your Oils Different essential oils have different properties and should be used for specific purposes. For example, peppermint oil is energizing and can help with digestion, while lavender oil is calming and can help with relaxation. Research the properties of each oil before using them and always follow manufacturer instructions. 3. Test For Allergies Before using a new essential oil, test it on a small patch of skin to make sure you are not allergic to it. Apply a small amount of diluted oil to your inner wrist and wait for 24 hours to see if any reaction occurs. 4. Use Caution During Pregnancy Some essential oils can be harmful during pregnancy and should be avoided. Research which oils are safe to use during pregnancy before using them. 5. Keep Away From Children and Pets Essential oils should be stored in a safe place out of reach of children and pets. Ingesting or inhaling essential oils can be harmful and even toxic to pets and young children. 6. Avoid Contact With Eyes and Mucous Membranes Essential oils should not be applied directly to the eyes, ears, or mucous membranes. If oil does come into contact with these areas, rinse immediately with cool water. Always consult with a healthcare professional before using essential oils if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or are taking medications.
