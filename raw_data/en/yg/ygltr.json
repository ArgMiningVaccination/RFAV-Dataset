This anxiety can contribute to dreading, delaying, or avoiding vaccinations, even when the importance of preventing illness is understood. Good news: there are safe, effective, and practical steps that vaccinators, vaccine recipients, and caregivers can take to reduce vaccination-related pain and anxiety. Creating a less stressful vaccination experience increases confidence in vaccination. | | | |On February 28, 2023, Immunize.org and experts from |[HELP Eliminate Pain in Kids and Adults](https://helpkidspain.ca/) presented a webinar, Improving the Vaccination Experience: Reducing Pain and Anxiety for Children and Adults.
