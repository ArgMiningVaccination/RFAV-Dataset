If you are reading this information it is likely you and your pet are facing the burden of cancer. Please accept our sympathies for your troubles. It is our job to help you meet the challenge, and support you and your pet, to create the most gentle and most effective response possible. Here at HolVet we treat more cancer than anything else. It is a sad sign of the times that cancer has become an epidemic in our beloved pet population, occurring in younger and younger animals each year. Ninety percent of our care is provided by phone consultation all over the country and we see the same situation everywhere. We feel it is evident that this epidemic is mostly due to terrible nutrition, over-vaccination, and toxic environments. In order to address the needs of a cancer patient these factors must be corrected. Neoplasene is the impressive, new \"herbal chemotherapy\" and can be a great help in most cancer cases. However, Neoplasene is not a magic cure-all, and it's best effect is always in conjunction with Dr Yasson's comprehensive approach to cancer which centers on homeopathy, optimal-natural nutrition, and specific supplementation. A skilled orchestration of these four separate, synergistic modalities has given the best results in our many cases over the years, where cure is always the goal. This page focuses on cancer treatment and Neoplasene. For further information about our holistic treatment philosophy in general click here. For information on how we work long-distance click here. Bail out the Boat And Fix the Hole at the Bottom. Conventional approaches to cancer, like all conventional care, is designed to be palliative, ie, to treat the product or symptoms of the disease condition without addressing the cause. This is like bailing out a boat without ever fixing the leaking hole at the bottom. The HolVet approach to cancer treatment is to bail andfix the hole. Neoplasene is often used in our cases to \"bail.\" This creates an immediate response, and can \"buy time.\" Homepathy, supplementation, and optimized nutrition are used to stimulate the patient's body to repair its own \"leak.\" This results ultimately in a state that we call normalcy, balance, or homeostasis. This state prevents the common relapses of conventional care and is a true and complete cure. This is our ultimate goal, always. Neoplasene\u00ae Background: Neoplasene is a relatively new drug available for veterinary use. It is derived from the perennial herb bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis), so named because of the reddish sap of the root. It has historically been used as a dye, an emetic (induces vomiting) and a wart and tumor treatment, esp. by Native Americans. In cancer it has been used as a caustic escharotic paste called Black Salve, which \"burns\" any flesh it comes into contact with, whether it is healthy or not. This is indiscriminate necrosis. Neoplasene is not Black Salve, anymore than refined stainless steel is crude iron ore. Nor is Neoplasene whole bloodroot. It is, only in part, an isolate of the active ingredients of bloodroot called benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids, with the primary one being sanguinarine. Neoplasene\u00ae process stimulates the immune system by killing cancer cells. It causes cancer cells to die by a process known as apoptosis. This is a self termination process. The immune system of the patient is then stimulated to handle them as it would any other dyingcells, by way of inflammation. It does all this while sparing healthy, normal cells. This makes it extremely unique and valuable. So, unlike most conventional \"chemo\" treatments it is not toxic at recommended doses (except to cancer cells). Furthermore, according to the most current information, unlike most conventional chemo treatments, Neoplasene works on any type of cancer cell. Neoplasene\u00ae Treatment Options and Risks: Any mass may be addressed all at once or by sections. And occasionally initial removal by surgery, or debulking, prior to beginning any Neoplasene treatment may be the optimal approach. The optimal approach for your pet (including conventional support, homepathy, nutrition, and supplementation) will be determined in the first appointment. There are three forms of Neoplasene - topical, injectible, and oral. Any combination of these forms may be used on a patient. Oral Neoplasene is a somewhat bitter liquid that is usually well accepted when mixed with wet foods, esp. those in a sauce, soup, or gravy. For the very finicky palate the liquid can be put into a capsule. It must be given with a full meal. This creates an immediate dilution in the stomach and avoids nausea. Once diluted in the circulatory system, it is able to do its work without causing harm to healthy cells. The dosage is slowly increased for the maximal effect without side effects. Higher doses in sensitive patients may necessitate simple and gentle conventional anti-nausea medication. Oral Neoplasene will affect all sites of cancer in the patient's body whether or not they have all been located by diagnostic testing. This includes, for example, common metastases in the lungs. The oral treatment may be used alone or given with other initial treatment and may be required for months, or even for the remainder of the life of the pet, depending on age and other risk factors. Topical and injectible Neoplasene often necessitate a series of treatments (weekly to biweekly) which can create an immediate burn or itch. They may by administered under anaesthesia or sedation. Cancerous tissue will swell and feel sore once the body's reaction begins, as the immune system is activated and must process the dying cancer cells. The immune system works through the production of inflammation. This is a necessary, natural, and very effective process the body uses to heal most any problem. Often, with surface tumors, there is a reddened ring of healthy skin visible around a thin, grey ring of macerated, or softened, dead tissue rimming the tumor. Additionally, the entire surface of the tumor may become grey and macerated as it approaches sloughing. The dying cancer tissue is being rejected by the body. This process culminates in two to ten days as the dead tissue sloughs off. Treatment with injectable or topical Neoplasene results in a wound that is the approximate size of the treated area. The shedding of dying tissue should not be forced. It must be allowed to fall off naturally. Forced removal will often create bleeding and leave bits of surviving tumor behind. Licking, rubbing, chewing and scratching must be prevented. This may involve an E-collar, daily bandaging, etc. as part of the wound care at home, and may last for several days or weeks. You will be responsible for this care. It must be left to heal as an open wound. Scarring is a common result. Like the oral form, the injectable form of Neoplasene stimulates a generalized (body-wide) response. This means inflammation may be created at locations other than the original site of concern. This is seen as a very favorable response as unhealthy cells or metastases are being killed. The injectable form also carries a risk of anaphylactic reaction. While this is uncommon, it is unpredictable and potentially immediately fatal despite alternative or conventional emergency treatment. Rarely, cancer may reappear after treatment series with Neoplasene\u00ae has ended. This can happen because not all of the diseased tissue was destroyed, or because the conditions that caused the cancer in the first place still exist and can recreate it \"from scratch.\" Complementary treatment by homeopathy, vaccine avoidance, premium nutrition, and neutraceuticals are a critical part of your pet's treatment plan and will help prevent this. In case of recurrence the initial phase of treatment will be resumed. Unlike conventional chemotherapy there is no evidence of development of resistance by surviving cancer cells. Research is ongoing. The effects of bloodroot's active ingredients have not been researched aggressively, because most pharmaceutical companies will not spend money on something that they may not be able to patent, such as a plant. The clinical reports of hundreds of veterinarians currently using Neoplasene\u00ae are constantly added to a data base to continually improve and refine protocols. For further review there is a [study](https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/6/4/1524.full) from the medical school at Case Western Reserve University in 1999. This study was done in vitro with prostate cancer cells and skin cancer cells. The results the researchers reported were clearly impressive.
