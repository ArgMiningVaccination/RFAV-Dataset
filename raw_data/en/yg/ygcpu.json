Storniolo1,2 Histologically normal tissue adjacent to the tumor can provide insight of the microenvironmental alterations surrounding the cancerous lesion and affecting the progression of the disease. However, little is known about the molecular changes governing cancerinitiation in cancer-free breast tissue. Here, we employed laser microdissection and whole-transcriptome pro ling of the breast epithelium prior to and post tumor diagnosis to identify the earliest alterations in breast carcinogenesis. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of the three tissue compartments (microdissected epithelium, stroma, and adipose tissue) was performed on the breastdonated by either healthy subjects or women prior to the clinical manifestation of cancer (labeled \"susceptible normal tissue \"). Although both susceptible and healthy breast tissues appeared histologically normal, the susceptible breast epithelium displayed a signicant upregulation of genes and fatty acid transport-related was observed also in the microdissected susceptiblestromal and adipose tissue compartments, respectively, when compared with the matched healthy controls. Moreover, inter- compartmental co-expression analysis showed increased epithelium-adipose tissue crosstalk in the susceptible breasts as compared with healthy controls. Interestingly, reductions in natural killer (NK)-related gene signature and CD45 +/CD20+cell staining were also observed in the stromal compartment of susceptible breasts. Our study yields new insights into the cancer initiation process in the breast. The data suggest that in the early phase of cancer development, metabolic activation of the breast, together with increased epithelium-adipose tissue crosstalk may create a favorable environment for nal cell transformation, proliferation, and survival. npj Breast Cancer (2020) 6:50 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41523-020-00191-8 INTRODUCTION Despite improved screening leading to a decline in its incidence rate, breast cancer still poses a substantial public health burden. About 279,100 new breast cancer cases and 42,690 breast cancer deaths are estimated to occur in 2020 in the United States 1. While there has been a dramatic improvement in disease detection andtreatment, our understanding of the factors involved in tumor initiation and our ability to selectively interfere with this process are very limited. It has been reported that the histologicallynormal but genetically altered tissue surrounding the tumor (also known as \"normal adjacent to the tumor \", NAT) promotes mechanisms for increased replicative capacity, genomic instability,and, therefore, provides a microenvironment that supports cancer progression 2. Whether the tumor affects the NAT or vice versa remains still unclear, especially in the context of the earliestphases of cancer development. Pre-malignant cells are exposed toa myriad of altered forces and signals from the surrounding microenvironment, including diffusible growth factors, in flamma- tory acids, autocrine factors can mediate intercellular crosstalk and dramatically modify the cells 'behavior and therefore tumor development and progression 3-5. Understanding the pre- malignant eld is critical for both elucidating the impact of the microenvironmental changes on cancer initiation and for the development of biomarkers for breast cancer risk assessment. Until recently, the research community was limited to studying pre-malignancy in mouse models and immortalized cell lines6.Breast tissue obtained from either women undergoing reduction mammoplasty or NAT have been used as poor substitutes for healthy controls. However, their normalcy has been questioned as they may be affected by hyperproliferative conditions and likelyharbor genetic and/or epigenetic aberrations7,8. The establishment of the Susan G. Komen Tissue Bank at the IU Simon Cancer Center (KTB), the only repository of truly normal breast tissue, offers the possibility to address this limitation. In thethirteen years since its foundation, the KTB has collected breast tissue core biopsies from more than 5500 donors9. The well- annotated human breast tissue specimens from the KTB representan excellent system in which to investigate both the physiology of the normal breast7,10and breast cancer development8,11,12. As expected1, a relatively small number of KTB donors ( 5%) diagnosed with breast cancer a few years post-donation. The specimens originally donated by these women (here labeled \"susceptible normal tissue \") provide a window into the earliest phases of breast cancer development. Hence, to acquire new insights into the breast cancer initiation process, we examined how cancer-prone breast tissue differs from the contralateralbreast and, especially, from matched healthy breast tissue. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic pro le of the breast epithelium prior to and post tumor diagnosis, and the differences between susceptible normal and matched healthybreast tissues. In the latter, for a more comprehensive analysis, microdissection of the three tissue compartments (epithelium, stroma, and adipose tissue) was performed. Our data suggest thata metabolic rewiring, displayed as an increased expression of 1Susan G.

This metabolic activation is also re flected by an increased co- expression network interaction between the epithelial compart-ment and the surrounding adipose tissue. Furthermore, weinvestigated immune cell in ltration by examining both immune cell-related signatures and speci c immunostaining in the breast tissues. The susceptible breast tissue showed a reduction inresting natural killer (NK) and B cells, suggesting that animmunosuppressive phenotype may promote a pro-tumorigenic environment. RESULTS Comparison of the breast epithelium transcriptome prior to and post-cancer diagnosis To investigate the molecular changes of breast tissue prior to and post-cancer diagnosis, we compared the transcriptomic pro les of the microdissected epithelium of the breast tissue cores from two women who donated tissue biopsies from both the affected breast (prior and post diagnosis of cancer, here labeledsusceptible and NAT, respectively) and the contralateral healthybreast (Fig. 1a and Table 1). In terms of clinicopathological features of the tumors, one is estrogen receptor (ER) positive withboth ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) invasive ductal is ER-positive DCIS. Histological analysis of thehematoxylin and eosin-stained sections revealed a normal phenotype for both the susceptible and contralateral breast tissues, while the NAT sections displayed minor hyperplasia (Fig. 1b). Upon transcriptome analysis of the microdissected breastepithelium, we detected 262 transcripts differentially expressedbetween NAT and contralateral normal samples, and, amongthose, 156 genes (60.9%) were differentially expressed alsobetween susceptible normal and contralateral normal epithelium(FDR < 0.05; Fig. 1c-e). NAT and susceptible samples showed high similarity in their transcriptome pro les, with only 16 transcripts differentially expressed ( P< 0.01) (Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed enrichment in genes involved incellular processes, biological regulation, and metabolic processesin the NAT (27, 15, and 12%, respectively) and in the susceptiblenormal (29, 14, and 12%, respectively) breast epithelial compart-ments as compared with the paired contralateral breast (Fig. 1f). Furthermore, the genes differentially expressed between NAT and susceptible were also linked with cellular processes (43%), including cell cycle and cellular metabolism, and with themetabolic processes (21%). Transcriptome pro ling of the susceptible and healthy breast Both susceptible breast epithelium and NAT displayed molecular differences as compared with the paired contralateral normal,suggesting an early activation of speci c pathways (involved in cellular and metabolic processes) even prior to cancer diagnosis. To further investigate the molecular features of the early phase of breast cancer development as represented in the breast tissue prior to cancer diagnosis, we employed transcriptome sequencing and de ned the genomic differences between histologically normal breast tissue cores donated by susceptible and thosefrom matched healthy women (Fig. 2a). Because the subjects included in this study reported different types of breast cancer(DCIS, IDC, and invasive lobular carcinoma), the limited samplesize only allowed us to investigate pan-breast pre-cancerdistinctions from the normal breast. Nevertheless, to comprehen- sively capture the transcriptomic alterations of the breast, we microdissected and pro led separately the three breast tissue compartments (epithelium, stroma, and adipose tissue) from7 susceptible women and 16 matched healthy controls (Fig. 2b, c, Table 2, and Supplementary Fig. 1). The two cohorts includedCaucasian premenopausal women with mean age of 45.7 years and mean body mass index of 27. Unsupervised principal components analysis of the transcrip- tome pro les showed that the menstrual phase of the subjects (follicular and luteal) contributes to a large variation in our dataset (Supplementary Fig. 2). The breast tissue is an organ physiologi- cally affected by cyclic variations of circulating hormones, whichmay in fluence cellular processes and gene expression not only in the epithelium compartment but also in stroma 13and adipose tissue14. To eliminate this confounding factor, we removed from each breast compartment dataset the transcripts whose expres-sion signi cantly ( P< 0.05) varies between follicular and luteal phase within the healthy breast cohort (Supplementary Table 3). Furthermore, previously reported menstrual phase-dependent gene expression variations were also excluded from the epithe-lium dataset 10. We compared the transcriptome pro ling of each breast tissue compartment between the susceptible normal andmatched healthy breasts. We detected 222 transcripts differ- entially expressed between the two cohorts in the micro- dissected breast epithelium, 484 in the microdissected breaststroma, and 148 in the microdissected breast adipose tissue(P< 0.05) (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Tables 4 -6). The ten most upregulated and downregulated transcripts in each compart- ment in the susceptible breast as compared with healthy breastare shown in Table 3. GO enrichment, pathway, and network analyses of the differentially expressed genes in the susceptible breast epitheliumas compared with the matched healthy controls clustered the majority of the upregulated genes in the metabolic processes including adipogenesis P=3.4E-04) (Fig. 3b, c and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). However, downregulated genes were mostly linked with immune systemsignaling. Similarly, genes upregulated in the susceptible P=1.4E-03 -P=1.6E-02; i.e., antiviral immunity, TREM1 signaling, and Th1 pathway) (Fig. 3b, c and Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). In both tissue compartments, the cellproliferation pathways included equally upregulated and down-regulated genes. Pathway analysis of the genes upregulated in susceptible breast adipose tissue showed the involvement of synaptic transmission, or transmembrane transport, and metabolicprocesses, (Fig. 3b, c and Supplementary Tables 11 and 12). Upon upstream regulator analysis, PPAR , a lipid-activated transcription factor regulating lipid uptake, accumulation, and storage 15, appeared upstream of 16 differentially expressed genes in the epithelium compartment dataset ( P=2.3E-08, activation z score: 3.8) (Fig. 3d). Both PPAR and PPAR are key upstream regulators of gene expression changes in the susceptible breast stroma ( P=1.4E-9, activation zscore: 4.3 and P=8.3E-11, activation zscore: 4.7, respectively) (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 3). PPAR is also found upstream of the gene expression changes observed in the susceptible breast adipose tissue (P=1.6E-04, activation zscore: 0.6) (Fig. 3d). Lipid metabolism genes are upregulated in the susceptible breast epithelium As shown in Table 4, several genes upregulated in the susceptible epithelium are involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Among those, we identi ed genes regulating lipid catabolism. ThisN.

Marino et al. 3 Published in partnership with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation npj Breast Cancer (2020) 50 process can be mediated by either neutral lipolysis or lipophagy16. To investigate this biological process, immunohistochemistryexperiments were performed on breast tissue sections from anadditional 62 pre- and postmenopausal women (mean age: 54;mean body mass index: 29). The lack of difference in the immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of both the autophagy- related marker, TOMM20 (to assess speci cally mitophagy18) between susceptible and healthy breasts suggests activation of neutral lipolysis in thebreast epithelium prior to cancer diagnosis (Supplementary Fig. 4). The proliferation rate of the epithelial compartment in both susceptible and matched healthy breasts was determined byevaluating the expression level of MKI67 and PCNA in the RNA-seq dataset and by performing immunostaining with Ki67 (Fig. 4a, b). No difference in cell proliferation was detected between the twocohorts. Genes involved in lipid metabolism processes (Tables 3and 4) and highly differentially expressed between the two experimentalgroups ( P< 0.001) were AQP7, CD36, LIPE, among genes, the downregulated genes (Fig. 4c). Both SNORA13 and ZNP57, even though highly downregulated in the RNA-seq data (fold change 4.3;P=0.006 and fold change 29.9; P=0.0004, respectively) showed similar expression levels in the two experimental groups in either qPCR or immunohis-tochemistry (IHC) assays (Supplementary Fig. 5).

Marino et al. 4 npj Breast Cancer (2020) 50 Published in partnership with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation(P=0.0007) was also detected by qPCR in primary epithelial cells isolated from the susceptible normal breast as compared withcells isolated from healthy breast tissue cores (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 5). Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed that AKR1C1, AQP7, CD36, and LIPE display low genomic alteration frequency in breast cancer, and only CD36expression has prognostic value ( P=0.005) (Supplementary Fig. 6a-c). However, when evaluating the effect of the combination of each gene with CD36, LIPE-CD36 shows an inverse relationship,while AKR1C1-CD36 shows a direct relationship with disease-freesurvival (Supplementary Fig. 6d). Furthermore, these genes exhibitpatterns of co-occurring genetic alterations (i.e., copy number)across multiple breast cancer patients, suggesting a functional interaction (Supplementary Fig. 6e) 19. Immune phenotype alterations in the susceptible breast stroma Interestingly, pathway analysis showed that genes downregulated in both epithelium and stroma of the susceptible breast are involved in the immune response pathway. To better elucidate theimmune phenotype occurring in the susceptible breast stroma as compared with the healthy controls, two approaches were employed: (1) immune cell pro ling by deconvolution of the transcriptomic data revealed an increase in inactive or resting Fig. 3 Transcriptomic pro ling of the microdissected breast compartments. a Hierarchical clustering heatmaps of the differentiated transcripts in the microdissected breast epithelium, stroma, and adipose tissue between susceptible (red line) and healthy control (blue line).The epithelium and adipose tissue show a higher number of upregulated genes as compared with the stromal compartment. bGene ontology enrichment (PANTHER_GO) and and downregulated genes. dMaster regulator analysis (IPA v01-06) for the differentially expressed genes between susceptible and healthy control breasts in the three breast tissuecompartments.

(2) IHC staining of the breast tissue sections with generic immune cell markers showed a signi cant reduction of CD45 +cells in the susceptible as compared with healthy breasts ( P=0.003; Fig. 5b). Furthermore, while no change in CD68 (macrophage marker), CD4 and CD8 (T cell markers) staining was detected, the susceptible breast stroma showed a signi cant decrease in CD20 +B cells as compared with the controls ( P=0.002, Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 7). Increased epithelium-adipose tissue crosstalk in susceptible breast Finally, we applied the co-expression network approach to assess the crosstalk between the epithelial, stromal, and adipose tissue compartments in histologically normal breasts of either suscep- tible or healthy women3. Genes in at least two of the three pairwise associations (with a Pvalue 1E-04) were used to construct the connectivity networks (Fig. 6a), where the nodes represent genes and the edges re flecthighly similar pro les. The number of nodes in the susceptible breast is smaller than that observed in the normal breast (Fig. 6b). Analysis of the networks in the susceptible breast uncovers a set of genes involved in nucleic acid 6c). the number of pairwise associations between the transcriptome pro les of the three tissue compartments with FDR0.05 and a less stringent FDR 0.1 in both the susceptible group and healthy controls. Overall, when examining epithelium -stroma and stroma -adipose tissue associations, we identi ed a higher number of connections in the healthy samples as compared with the susceptible group. However, the susceptible cohort showed an increase in epithelium-adipose tissue con-nectivity ( n=25) as compared with the healthy control group (n=18) (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Table 14). In the normal breast, the set of most highly connected genes betweenepithelium and stroma included genes involved in the negative regulation of the immune system (BATF3, FOXF1, DCST1) and amino acid metabolism (COL3A1, COL5A2), while the geneTable 3.

Marino et al. 6 npj Breast Cancer (2020) 50 Published in partnership with the Breast Cancer Research Foundationnetworks in epithelium-adipose tissue are linked with carbohy- the most connected gene inthe epithelial -stromal co-expression network and contributed to the network primarily through its stromal expression, while between epithelium and adipose tissue we found involvedin metabolism (CA6, CYP24A1) and intracellular signaling (CR2, IL22RA1). Taken together, these results support that the rise in epithelial- adipose tissue self-loops represents an important property of the inter-compartmental interactions that occur in the early phase ofcarcinogenesis. DISCUSSION NAT tissues are frequently designated as healthy control samples for cancer studies under the assumption that histological normalcy implies biological normalcy. However, these tissues have many morphologic and phenotypic distinctions from non-tumor-bearing healthy tissue, including pH levels, allelicimbalance and telomere length, stromal behavior, and transcrip- tomic and epigenetic aberrations 7. Little is known about the transcriptomic pro le of these regions before the clinical manifestation of the tumor. Here, we investigated the molecularfeatures of the breast prior to cancer diagnosis (labeledsusceptible normal). We show that the microdissected epithelium from the susceptible normal breast has a transcriptome pro ling signi cantly different from the paired contralateral breast tissue, but similar to that of the NAT. The differences between susceptibleand NAT are limited to genes involved in metabolic processes. We further show that the breast tissue susceptible to cancer development has an enrichment in lipid metabolism-relatedgenes not only in the epithelial compartment but also in thestroma and adipose tissue, when compared to the breast tissue of healthy women. Tumor cells are exposed to a myriad of altered forces and signals from the surrounding microenvironment that dramati- cally modify their behavior and therefore tumor development 5. Ma et al. showed that both breast epithelial and stromalcompartments undergo extensive gene expression alterationsat the pre-invasive stage of DCIS as compared with normal breast tissue. The authors propose a key role of cell -cell communication between these two compartments during tumor progres-sion 20,21. Our study constitutes a more comprehensive analysis of earlier phase of breast cancer development (prior to the clinical manifestation of the tumor) through the separation and proling of the three functional compartments of the breast tissue: epithelium, stroma, and adipose tissue. Moreover, while previous studies7,8,22utilized breast tissues from either reduction m a m m o p l a s t yo ra d j a c e n tt ot h et u m o rl e s i o na sh e a l t h ycontrols, we included a proper cancer-free breast tissue, fromage-, BMI-, menopausal status-matched healthy volunteers as comparative controls for the susceptible breast. Our comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of susceptible histologically normal breast provides direct evidence of a breastcancer-associated metabolic rewiring of breast tissue affecting not only the epithelial cells but also the stroma and adipose tissue of the breast. The reprogramming of lipid metabolism is a hallmark of many cancers, including breast cancer. While healthy cells preferentially uptake exogenous fatty acids, cancer cells also synthesize fatty acids de novo by increasing the expression of fatty acidbiosynthetic enzymes 23. In our study, we detected an upregulation of fatty acid metabolism-related genes in the susceptible compartment (i.e., LIPE, AQP7, CD36, PLIN1, LPL,and LIPE), and of genes involved in fatty acid and amino acids transport (i.e., RIMS2, FABP4, and SLC6A13) in the adipose tissue. This expression pro le is indicative of the induction of lipogenesis and fatty acid transport and, as shown in the upstream regulatoranalysis, is connected with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) /signaling pathway. PPAR , which susceptible (fold change:1.3, P=0.049) and stroma (fold change: 1.4, P=0.010), is overexpressed in several tumors including breast 24. Its role in tumorigenesis is controversial25. Our data, corroborated by ndings et al.26, the biphasic action of PPAR in breast cancer develop- ment, with a pro-tumorigenic role in the early phase of malignant transformation. In this study, the breast tissue susceptible to cancer develop- ment shows an increase in genes linked to adaptation to oxidative stress (i.e., AKR1C1) and accumulation of fatty acids (i.e., LIPE, CD36, AQP7), which are used by the cells for biomass synthesis,cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CD36 and AQP7, which mediate the transport of fatty acids and water/glycerol, respec- tively, are expressed in tumors including breast cancer and areinvolved in cell migration and tumor metastasis 27,28.

Interestingly, Ladanyi et al. showed that CD36 expression was induced in ovarian cancer cells upon co-culture with primary human omental adipocytes, facilitating exogenous fatty acids AKR1C1 and HSL are involved in metabolism30,31. AKR1C1, with its ability to metabolize reactive aldehydes, has a key role in protecting transformed cells from the reactive oxygen species generated from lipid peroxidation secondary to increased lipid metabolism32. AKR1C1 's inhibition, through mefenamic acid treatment, restored cancer cells 'sensitivity to cisplatin and 5- fluoruracil33. HSL, through the cleavage of stored cholesteryl estersinto cholesterol and free fatty acids, may generate endogenous oxysterols or oncometabolites with an important role in cancer promotion and progression34. An increase in genes associated with lipid metabolism was also found in the contralateral unaffected breasts of women with unilateral ER-negative breast cancer35. Moreover, a recent report by Madak -Erdogan identi ed 25 plasma metabolites that discriminated between healthy and susceptible postmenopausal women and therefore may represent new circulating biomarkers of breast cancer risk36. The authors showed that, prior to diagnosis of breast cancer, postmenopausal women had signi cantly higher levels of nic, stearic, linoleic, oleic acids), and glycerol in their plasma as Fig. 4 Upregulation of lipid metabolism-related genes in susceptible breast epithelium. a mRNA expression (log2CPM) of proliferation markers, MKI67 and PCNA, in (Susc) and matched healthy (HC) breast epithelium. bImmunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of Ki67 in susceptible and healthy control breast tissue.

Free fatty acids also stimulated the proliferation and growth of estrogen receptor (ER) +breast cancer cells. In the susceptible breast stroma, we observed a downregulation of genes involved in the immune response, an increase in resting NK-related gene signature and a reduction in the IHC staining ofCD45 (generic immune marker) and CD20 (B-cell marker) cells. The number and function of the local immune cells can be affected by metabolites released in the surrounding microenvironment37-39. Recent reports indicate that breast cancer cells may escape immune surveillance by releasing free fatty acids, which inhibit cytotoxic T cells40. Moreover, animal studies and human trials of PPAR -activating drugs, normally used to treat diabetes, have shown these compounds to have great potential as anti- inflammatory drugs41. It has been suggested that some of the protective anti-in flammatory effects of dietary n-3 PUFAs is mediated through PPAR activation42. The altered metabolism in the tumor cells, as well as in surrounding cells, may create animmunosuppressive environment that prevents host immune cells from detecting and eliminating cancer cells. The adipose tissue, in addition to its ability to store energy reserves as triglycerides, is now recognized as an actual organ with both metabolic and endocrine functions (reviewed in ref.43). It is a heterogeneous tissue, including mature adipocytes (about 50%), stem cells, pre-adipocytes, broblasts, endothelial cells, nerve cells, and macrophages. The adipose tissue in thesusceptible normal breast showed the upregulation of molecules involved in the transport of fatty acids and amino acids, including RIMS2 and FABP4, as compared with the matched healthy breast.RIMS2 (aka RIM2, regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis 2), is a key molecule of the cAMP-dependent exocytotic machinery, and regulates the secretion of adiponectin 44. inpancreas cancer predomi- nantly in macrophages and adipose tissue, where it regulates adipocyte differentiation, fatty acids storage, and lipolysis, and is an important mediator of in flammation46. FABP4 is also expressed at a higher level in cancer cells, and its upregulation promotes tumor growth47,48. Our epithelial -stromal -adipose tissue co-expression analysis shows epithelial-adipose tissue co-expression network self-loops to be highly enriched among the most signi cant interactions in susceptible breasts as compared with the healthy controls. These data suggest an increase in the crosstalk between epithelial and adipose tissue compartments, and a key role of the latter, in theearly phase of breast cancer development. The networks connecting the susceptible epithelium and adipose tissue include genes involved in metabolism. Although the data show a limitedrole of the stroma in breast cancer susceptibility, whether the epithelium and the adipose tissue in the susceptible breast are in direct or indirect contact is still unclear and requires furtherinvestigation. Our nding supports the recent observations promoting a model where adipocytes respond to cancer cell- derived endocrine and paracrine signaling to provide metabolicsubstrates, which in turn drive enhanced cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and treatment resistance 49. Overall, our data suggest a metabolic activation occurring in the susceptible normal breast, centered on lipolysis and local immunosuppression, which may promote the survival andproliferation of a transformed cell. However, several limitations of this study warrant discussion. First, our sample size is modest due to the extended time required for developing the resource, andadditional studies with larger sample sizes and multiple centers are needed to clarify our results. Either a more precise separation of the interlobular and intralobular stroma, two sub-compartments Fig. 5 Immune cell pro ling of the microdissected breast stroma. a CIBERSORT immune cell fractions were determined for each subject.

Marino et al. 9 Published in partnership with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation npj Breast Cancer (2020) 50 structurally and functionally different, or a single-cell analysis of the breasts may unveil interesting transcriptional clues of breast cancersusceptibility. We are currently expanding our investigation to postmenopausal susceptible women and donors from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Merging transcriptomic data withmetabolomics and investigating the microbial dysbiosis in thebreast tissue of women at high risk of developing breast cancer are other interesting lines of research that we intend to pursue 50.B y overcoming signi cant challenges and continuing to collect breast tissue cores from healthy women, we will improve this uniqueresource, allowing the generation of additional statistically meaningful data. In summary, our data demonstrate that upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and adipogenesis occurs in the breast prior to the clinical manifestation of the malignancy andthat the adipose tissue in the breast plays a critical role intumorigenesis through an active crosstalk with the epithelial compartment. Because of the characteristics of the study cohort, these ndings are relevant to premenopausal women without distinction made in terms of the clinicopathological features of thetumor later detected. De ning the mechanisms that are the underpinning of the dynamic interaction between stromal adipocytes and breast cancer cells, especially in the context ofobesity, may identify novel therapeutic targets and approaches. METHODS Participants and samples This was a case-controlled study of a total of 87 women. The study cohort consisted of 2 women who donated breast tissue cores prior to and post-cancer diagnosis (paired specimens include the susceptible normal breast tissue, NAT, and contralateral normal breast tissue cores), 38 women donating susceptible normal (prior to tumor detection), and 47 matchedwomen with no history of breast cancer who donated healthy breast tissues that were used in this study as matched healthy controls. Table 1and Supplementary Table 1 list the characteristics of the subjects. Specimens were obtained from the Susan G. Komen Tissue Bank at the IU SimonCancer Center (KTB). All the samples were collected from voluntary donorsupon written informed consent. Subjects were recruited under a protocolapproved by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board (IRB protocolnumber 1011003097 and 1607623663) and according to The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). Susceptible donors were identi ed through an annual medical follow-up as individuals who had a breast cancer diagnosis post-tissue donation andlacking of any mutation in known breast cancer predisposition genes upongenetic testing. The subjects in the susceptible normal and healthycontrols cohorts were matched (at a ratio of either 1:2 or 1:3) according toage, racial background, body mass index, and follow-up time, the latter dened as the interval from the date of tissue donation to last medical follow-up. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of either formalin- xed or PAXgene- xed paraf n-embedded breast tissue cores were reviewed by a pathologist to con rm the absence of histological abnormalities. Breast tissue microdissection and RNA extraction The transcriptome pro ling was performed on breast tissue cores from 25 premenopausal (mean age 45 years) KTB donors, including two womenwho donated breast tissue biopsies prior to and post diagnosis,7 susceptible, and 16 matched healthy women. Tables 1and 2include the clinical characteristics of these subjects. Breast tissues from premenopausal women were chosen over those from postmenopausal women for their higher epithelial cellularity. Moreover, in terms of clinicalimpact, in recent decades, incidence rates of advanced breast cancerhave increased among premenopausal women, whereas they haveconsistently decreased among older women 51. In order to examine each breast tissue compartment and the tissue inter-compartmental crosstalk, microdissection of the breast tissue sections was performed. Fresh-frozen breast tissue cores ( 80 mg) were rst embedded in OCT, sectioned (8 \u00b5M thickness) on PEN Membrane frame slides (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Fig. 6 Epithelial -stromal-adipose tissue co-expression network analysis. a Connectivity networks including pairwise associations with a Pvalue 1E-04 in susceptible and matched healthy controls.

Marino et al. 10 npj Breast Cancer (2020) 50 Published in partnership with the Breast Cancer Research FoundationGrove, IL). Slides were stored at 80 \u00b0C prior to dissection. Three slides were removed from the freezer at a time and were stained using theHistoGene LCM Frozen Section Staining Kit (Arcturus, Life Technologies,Carlsbad, CA, USA). The three tissue compartments were microdissected using a laser microdissection microscope (LMD 6500, Leica Microsys- tems). Previous study transcriptional the interlobular and intralobular stroma, being limited to thelevel of speci c proteins 52; here these locations were not speci cally differentiated by the microdissection. All dissections were completedwithin an hour of thawing to minimize RNA degradation. Supplementary Fig. 1 shows the measurement of the microdissected area of each tissue compartment. Out of the 23 premenopausal breast tissues, only 16(5 susceptible and 11 healthy controls) included suf cient microdissected adipose tissue for the RNA-sequencing analysis. In all the adipose tissue represented only 12.4% (range: 0 -26%) of the entire tissue and therefore its in fluence on the global breast tissue transcriptome is limited. Moreover, in order to reduce any confounding factors, the subjects were matched also for BMI. The total RNA from themicrodissected epithelial compartment was extracted using the AllprepDNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD), while totalRNA sequencing RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was conducted at the Center for MedicalGenomics at Indiana University. The concentration and quality of the totalRNA was assessed using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. A RIN (RNA IntegrityNumber) 5 was required to pass the quality control. Then 10 ng of RNA per sample were used to prepare a dual-indexed strand-speci c cDNA library using Clontech SMARTer RNA Pico Kit v2. The resulting libraries were assessed for their quantity and size distribution using Qubit and Agilent 2100Bioanalyzer. Two hundred picomolar pooled libraries on cBot using HiSeq 3000/4000 PE Cluster Kit and s e q u e n c e dw i t h2 \u00d7 7 5 b pp a i r e d - e n dc o n guration on HiSeq4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) using SBS Kit. A Phred quality score (Qscore) was used to measure the quality of sequencing. More than 90% of the sequencing reads reached Q30 (99.9% base call accuracy). Samples were sequenced as a single batch to avoid systematic differences linked to thebatched effect. The sequencing data were rst assessed using FastQC (Babraham Bioinformatics, Cambridge, UK) for quality control. Transcriptome sequencing recovered ~36 -40 million raw reads from each of the breast specimens. After normalization, ~23 -30 million reads were uniquely mapped using STAR v2.5 and UCSC hg19 as reference genome 53and ~9 -14.6 million reads assigned to annotated genes. Quality control of sequencing andmapping results was summarized using MultiQC54. The datasets generated and analyzed during the current study are available in the Gene ExpressionOmnibus (GEO) repository (a ccession number GSE141828)55-57. Data analysis Differential expression . Genes with read count per million (CPM) > 0.5 in more than 2 of the samples were kept. The data were normalized using TMM(trimmed mean of M values) method. Differential expression analysis wasperformed using EdgeR 58. PCA (principal component analysis) plots were made to identify and remove any potential outliers. False discovery rate (FDR)was computed from Pvalues using the Benjamin -Hochberg pathway analysis: PANTHER GO ( http://www.pantherdb.org/ ) tool was used to gene ontology enrichment analysis. IngenuityPathways Analysis (IPA, Qiagen, Redwood City, CA) was used for the canonicalpathway, upstream regulator, and gene network analyses 59.A n a l y s i so f TCGA was performed by interrogating p l o y e df o rt h e deconvolution of RNAseq global gene expression data in order to analyze theimmune landscape of the breast microe nvironment. The CIBERSORT values generated were de ned as fractions of total leukocyte content per sample. Co-expression networks: For each tissue category (susceptible and healthy control), we used a linear regression to build univariate modes linkingtranscriptome pro ling in one breast tissue compartment with that in another as previously described3. To construct co-expression networks, we computed all pairwise co-expression interactions between and -stromal, epithelial-adipose tissue, and stroma -adipose tissue co-expression networks, where each node in the network is a gene, and each edge represents a co-expression relationship.Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) Because of the lower yields associated with the tissue microdissection, only the RNA extracted from the microdissected epithelium was suf cient for targets: AKR1C1 and SNORA13. qPCR was also used to detect the expression of selected targets in primary epithelial cells. Reverse transcription was performed using SuperScript IV VILOMaster Mix (Invitrogen cat#: 11756050) according to the turer instructions. qPCR was performed using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, cat# 4304437) following TaqMan Gene Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems/ThermoFisher Scienti c) and data analyzed the StepOne Software v2.3 (Applied Biosystems). Relative quanti cation was calculated with reference to either ACTB and analyzed using the comparative C T method62. qPCR experiments were performed in triplicate. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) The IHC validation cohort included 38 susceptible and 47 age-matched healthy controls Additional le 7: Supplementary Table S1 lists the clinical characteristics of the study cohort. IHC staining of 5-\u00b5m-thick formalin- xed, paraf n-embedded tissue sections was performed using the MACTH4 universal HRP-Polymer Kit following the manufacturer 's instruc- tions Brie fly, n-embedded tissue sections were deparaf nized with three successive passages through xylene, and rehydrated through decreasing concentrations (100, 95, 80, 70, and 50%) of ethanol. After antigen retrieval,peroxidase, and protein blocking steps, tissue sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies, 30 min with the post primary block reagent, and 30 min with the horseradish peroxidase-coupled polymer secondary antibodies. Upon two additional washes, secondary antibodies were revealed with the liquid DAB Substrate Chromogen System (10-min incubation).

Aperio Image Scope v12.3.2 software was used to quantify the signal of the epithelial staining using a positive pixel count algorithm, while QuPath v0.2.0 software was used to obtain an automatic count of the cells positive to CD45, CD68, CD8, CD4, and and immuno fluorescence Cryopreserved breast tissue cores were obtained from the KTB. Primary epithelial cells were isolated and cultured as previously described64. Human broblasts were obtained by incubating 1 ml of cell suspension after tissue dissociation in DMEM (Gibco, ThermoFisher Scienti c) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco). After 1 week of culture, 5000 cells were plated into each well of an eight-well-chamber slide (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). After overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the cells were washed with PBS and xed with acetone: methanol (1:1) at 20 \u00b0C for 10 min. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with blocking buffer (PBS1\u00d7, 5% normal goat serum, 0.1%TritonX-100) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibodies: rabbit anti-vimentin (Cell Signaling, D21H3, 1:100) or mouse anti-E-cadherin (Cell Signaling, 14472, 1:50) overnight. Upon three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 or goat anti- rabbit Alexa Fluor 488; ThermoFisher Scienti c, 1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the coverslide was mounted using DAKO fluorescent mounting medium (S3023 Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), and the staining was visualized using a fluorescent microscope (Eclipse TS100, Nikon Instruments inc, Melville, NY).
