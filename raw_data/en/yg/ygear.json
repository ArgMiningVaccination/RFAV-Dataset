George S. Goldman, m.d .'29 McLean, Va. Thank you so much for the issue on the unique Yale System.I learned much about its ori-gins, development and problemsthat I never knew before. For me, the Yale System was also crucial and affected meeven before I entered medical school. I suppose as an exten-sion of the system's philosophy,I was accepted after three years at the University of Michi- gan, with no degree and nomajor. I wonder if others werechosen with that background,or if I was a one-time experi-ment! If there are others like meamong our readership, please let me know. That confidence in me, and my idiosyncratic way of approach- ingrequirements, helped me to later petition out of redundantresidency requirements, subjec- tive board certification, and toenter the managed care beastfrom an academic laboratoryperspective. The latter has wonme some recognition and re-spect as an objective assessor ofmanaged care. Without the YaleSystem, I'm sure I would never have taken these risks. H. Steven Moffic, m.d .'71 Milwaukee, Wis.In praise of Milton Winternitz I read the article adapted from Dr. Gerard Burrow's A History of Yale's School of Medicine: Pass-ing Torches to Others with interest. While I haven't read hisentire book or account of DeanWinternitz's career at Yale, I take it from this portion [\" A SteamEngine in Pants,\" Autumn 2002]that he is acknowledging theunique and significant contribu-tion Dean Winternitz made tothe school. While I am greatly relieved to see this, I also wish to add a footnote that I suspect he hasomitted in his history. During my tenure at the School of Medicine from 1984 to 1993, I became aware of the fact that, in spite of Dean Winternitz's enormously impor- tant work on behalf of theschool, nothing at Yale is namedfor him. So, when it was decided to create a special medal to begiven to individuals in honor oftheir contributions to the Schoolof Medicine, I suggested thatwe create a Winternitz medal. Burrow was dean then. In vain I argued on behalf of the \"Winternitz medal,\" because inthe end Burrow vetoed this idea,saying that Winternitz was too\"controversial.\" As a result, the medal now contains the portraitand name of Dr. Peter Parker, aninteresting person (and Burrow'ssuggestion) but, in my opinionand that of a number of alumniwho actually knew Winternitz,not so worthy a person as Winternitz for this recognition. I have always regretted this oversight, and I continue tohope that one day the Yale Schoolof Medicine will repay the debtit owes Dean Winternitz bynaming something of properstature after him\u2014perhaps, inpart, because he dared to becontroversial. Ann Pecora Diamond New Haven, Conn.On the move on moving day When cardiovascular researcher Jeffrey Bender and hundreds of his colleagues unpack their labs and ofces in the Congress Avenue Building later this winter and spring [\"The Big Move,\" p. 20], a new chapter in the School of Medicine's history will begin in earnest. For the rst time in a decade, the medical school's legendary space crunch will ease, at least for a time, and the occasion will mark the completion of a process that began in the late 1980s. The design of the new building has a special purpose behind it, that of knitting together basic biology, physics, chemistry and human health, of making clinical observations relevant at the molecular level (and vice versa) and, ultimately, of alleviating human suffering. \"We have the opportunity now to make an enormous difference in people's lives,\" Dean David Kessler says of the new building. \"We have the world's best scientists and theworld's best labs. This building will move medicine forward.\" A faculty-led committee initially recommended a version of the Congress Avenue Building in the early 1990s. A dozen years, 560,000 bricks and $176 million later, it is a real- ity. In addition to the 363 laboratory rooms shared by 91 research teams, it also contains state-of-the-art teaching space, an advanced facility for breeding and caring for transgenic mice (a research model invented at Yale in 1980) and a major new center for research employingmagnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy, another eld pioneered signicantly at Yale. If you're curious about the new space and want to see architect Robert Venturi's sketches or recent photos of the construction, the school has a website full of wonderful detail. You can visit the Congress Avenue Building online at www.med.yale.edu/cab. It's just a click away, and there are no boxes to unpack.

This past fall, Yale's School of Public Health introduced a new course on cop- ing with disasters. Earthquakes, hurri-canes and volcanoes are on the agenda, as well as famines, wars and epidemics. But the real focus is how to confront the ongoing threat of bioterrorism. Since September 11, 2001, univer- sities across the nation have been devel-oping public health programs aimed at training students and professionals for future terror attacks and emerging health threats, including anthrax, small-pox and other methods of germ warfare. Yale's new course is just a rst step toward plans to develop a Yale Centerfor Bioterrorism and Disease Out- breaks. Such a move would have beenunimaginable a few years ago for lackof interest, necessity and\u2014most impor-tant\u2014funding. Today, however, publichealth is under a welcome spotlight,viewed with increasing importance aspart of the Bush administration 's goalsfor homeland security. Of the government's $2.9 billion budget for ghting bioterrorism, $20 million was earmarked this yearfor developing a nationwide disaster response network of academic publichealth programs linked with state and community health agencies. Already,some 20 universities have received funds from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( cdc) . In Sep- tember, the Association of Schools of Public Health, in cooperation withthe cdc, approved Yale's application for a grant to establish a Yale Centerfor Public Health Preparedness, but has not yet decided whether to awardnearly $1 million in funding. Heading up the Yale initiative is Brian P. Leaderer, m.p.h . '71, ph.d. 75, deputy dean of the School of PublicHealth and vice chair of the Depart- ment of Epidemiology and PublicHealth. Along with other leaders in public health, Leaderer is condent the focus on bioterrorism will spill over into more resources for disasterresponse in general. \"Bioterrorism looms as a real poten- tial problem,\" Leaderer says. \"But if youthink about it, many of the competencyareas in bioterrorism would apply to a large range of public health events.\" In the classroom, students taking \"Public Health Management of Disas-ters\" get a broad overview of the practi- cal consequences of disasters at home and overseas. They also learn about thecomplexities of orchestrating peopleand agencies that are involved in disas- ters\u2014the police, the military, hospitals, re departments, federal investigators,charities, support services, religiousgroups, families of victims, phone com- panies, electric companies and themedia, to name only a few. Public health, says course co-director Linda C. Degutis, m.s.n. '82, ph.d. '94, can provide leadership in disaster planning and emergency response. \"Who's where, and what's everybodydoing? Somebody's got to know,\" says Degutis, associate professor of surgery (emergency medicine) andpublic health. \"Who are the players?What are their capabilities? What we're trying to highlight in the course is how public health can play thatcoordinating role.\" Degutis, along with David C. Cone, m.d., associate professor of surgery (emergency medicine), tries to get stu- dents thinking about disaster relieffrom all angles. In Florida, for example,how do you handle a large elderly pop-ulation in the aftermath of a hurricane?How do people dependent on Meals onWheels get food when the roads are Learning to direct people and health resources in a bioterror emergency is the focus of \"PublicHealth Management of Disasters,\" offered atthe School of Public Health for the first time this year.

Several people had died after coming in contact with anthrax-laced letters, and there was concern that future attacks would involve small- pox. The committee needed a pediatri-cian to serve as a liaison between theacademy and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( cdc) in discussions of smallpox. Robert S. Baltimore, m.d., volun- teered and has since found himself the academy's main spokesman on the topic. \"I had no idea what I was in for,\" said Baltimore, professor of pediatricsand epidemiology, sitting in his ofce at the School of Medicine. Although hespecializes in pediatric infectious dis- eases, Baltimore, like his peers in theacademy, had no specic experience with smallpox. The virus had not been seen in the United States since 1949,when Baltimore was in grade school. His own research focuses on infections in newborns and hospital-acquiredinfections, and Baltimore studied small-pox only generally as an infectious diseases fellow in the 1970s at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Army Institute of Research. So Baltimore started educating himself, reading about the virus and collecting a grim photo archive on his computer showing the effects of smallpox on children. He had help from colleagues in the department'sinfectious diseases division, who metevery two weeks throughout 2002 to discuss bioterror-related topics in their journal club. \"The group wantedto make sure we had a very detailedknowledge,\" Baltimore said. As the academy's representative, Baltimore holds conference calls withthe cdc's \"smallpox working group\" and travels to Atlanta for cdc meet-ings. In addition, he has become embroiled in the debate over how bestto vaccinate the public in the event of an attack. At issue are competing pro-posals of mass vs. \"ring\" vaccination\u2014 whether to inoculate everyone, or justthose in the vicinity of people infected. In the fall, cdc ofcials were mov- ing away from the center's earlier support for a ring vaccination strategy and recommended making the vaccine available to the general public. [As Yale Medicine went to press President Bush announced plans to inoculate up to 500,000 frontline troops and 10 million civilian health care andemergency workers against smallpox,but advised against vaccination for the general public at this time.] Balti- more thinks mass vaccination wouldbe a mistake, and on behalf of the academy has advocated the alternate approach. Children are more suscepti-ble than adults to serious complica-tions, he said. And there is the worry that individuals who avoid vaccina- tion for health reasons might beexposed to the live vaccinia virus any-way, through contact with those whohave been vaccinated. washed out? How do you shelter older, more fragile people in a gymnasium? Examining the lessons of Septem- ber 11, for which scientic studies of disaster management of the after-math are only now being completed or published, Degutis and Cone rely on anecdotal accounts by disasterworkers, as well as media accounts such as The New York Times' detailed reporting on the structural collapse of the Twin Towers. Guest speakers with nationally recognized expertise supplement lec- tures by core faculty. One guest, Eric K. Noji, m.d. ,m.p.h ., is an epidemiolo- gist with extensive eld experience with disasters such as the Kobe, Japan,earthquake. Recently appointed as aspecial assistant for homeland securityand disaster medicine to the U.S. sur-geon general, Noji has been advisingpublic health schools such as Emory's in starting up public health prepared- ness centers. \"Public health is a growth industry now for several reasons,\" says Noji. \"Before, there was no career pathway for faculty; now there is. There was nomoney to support research; now there is. A lot of things which prevented pro- grams like this are no longer the case.\" Aside from the influx of funds, the other motivation for disaster man-agement education has been studentdemand. Even before Yale started think-ing about a public health preparednesscenter, Degutis and Cone were plan-ning a disaster course: students, joltedby September 11 and an anthrax fatalityclose to home in Connecticut, had asked for one. Neha Vibhakar, 24, a second-year student in environmental health sciences, reorganized her schedule so she could take the disaster manage- ment course. \"Hopefully, we won 't have to use it,\" said Vibhakar, who plans to study medi-cine after nishing her public health degree. \"But it's a tool that every doctorneeds to have.\" \u2014Anne ThompsonRobert Baltimore terry dagradi continuedFOR AN EXPERT FROM IRAN, REASONS TO WORRY ABOUT AIDS An emerging epidemic of hiv/aids in Iran could have disastrous consequences for the country and the region, according to Kaveh Khoshnood ,m.p.h. ' 89,ph.d. ' 95,assistant professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health and a native of Iran. Although 70 percent of Iran's 20,000 aids cases are drug users, according to unaids ,the government only recently lifted a ban on drug treatment centers, Khoshnood told congressional staffersin Washington on October 15. The briefing was organized by theAmerican Iranian Council. \"This shift in government policy createdan opening for the Iranian medical and public health communityto become engaged in a national debate regarding alternativeapproaches to drug addiction and the hiv/aids epidemic,\" said Khoshnood, who along with Yale colleagues has brought Iranianphysicians to Yale to study science-based models for treatmentof opiate addiction and prevention of hiv infection. \u2014John Curtisyale medicine winter 20036 chronicle An appreciation of the human form, in the studio as well as the operating room From his house in Old Lyme, Conn., Wayne O. Southwick, m.d., surveys a green tidal marsh, and beyond, the blue waters of Long Island Sound.The breadth of that vista, punctu-ated by four former fishermen 's cottages near the water and two light-houses in the distance, reminds Southwick of the open spaces of his native Nebraska. Southwick attributes his interest in art to the landscape of his childhood.In the town of Friend (pop. 1,100), box-cars and silos were the only embel- lishments, and \"I of them as sculptures,\" says Southwick, formerchief of orthopaedic surgery at Yale. Now, as he looks out on Smith Neckmarsh 32 miles east of New Haven, Southwick is surrounded by real sculptures\u2014his own and those of hismentor, the Italian-born Bruno Lucchesi. Southwick also sees his own work when he walks down Cedar Street, where his bronze of a youngman and woman playing basketball, An American Dream , stands near the Jane Ellen Hope Building. And this winter, a show by members of the YaleUniversity community includes hisbronze of a woman nursing a 2-year-old,Taking Nourishment . Southwick is among 19 artists exhibiting work atthe Yale Physicians Building Art Place.The show, running from Octoberthrough March, includes works rang-ing from pastels to shadow boxes,quilts and jewelry. Southwick says that the qualities that led him to pursue orthopaedicsalso drew him to sculpture. And sculp-ture, in turn, has influenced the way he sees the human body as a physi- cian. Interning at Boston City Hospitalafter earning his medical degree at theUniversity of Nebraska in 1947, South- wick discovered that he enjoyed treat- ing broken bones. \"I love the anatomyof the human frame,\" he says. In medi-cine, he often felt he had little to offer patients, especially before the advent of penicillin. He chose orthopaedics,doing a residency at Johns Hopkins, because \"I like doing things.\"There are three situations in which the vaccine could be fatal. In peoplewith certain skin conditions, includingeczema, the vaccine can spread, caus-ing pustules to form over the entirebody. Those with immune systemscompromised by aids or chemothera- py, for example, may also become seriously ill from the vaccine. And in rare cases, some of those vaccinated will develop oozing, infected sores in the injection site that spread andinvade deep tissues without healing. In the rst two instances, said Balti- more, children are more at risk. Manyskin disorders disappear with adult-hood, which means more children have them, and immune deciency may not be apparent in young children. For adults, the fatality rate for smallpox vaccine is about one per mil-lion. For infants, the rate is about 5 per million and there are serious adversereactions in about 400 per million\u2014 a rate that decreases with age. The cdc has the antidote for severe reactions, an antibody-rich blood product known as vaccinia immune globulin, but current quantities are minuscule. Baltimore also is concerned about thevaccine itself. The cdc is diluting stockpiles of the old vaccine to stretch it while new vaccine is manufac- tured. But neither the diluted versionnor the new one has been tested on children. Even if at-risk children and adults are not inoculated, they can be infectedthrough contact with people who havereceived or administered the vaccine and have it on their skin. \"Mass vacci- nation carries with it risks that can 't be justied,\" Baltimore said. \"The information that all public health peo- ple have been given is that the chancesof a smallpox outbreak are remote.Should there be additional information that says this isn 't true, we would say this should be reconsidered.\" \u2014Anne Thompsoncontinued from page 57 et cetera YALE SCIENTISTS AMONG MOST CITED Yale University ranks fifth among federally funded U.S. universities for the citationimpact of its published research, according to a Science Watch survey. The ranking was calculated by using publication and citation data to gauge howoften during the past five years papers byYale authors were cited by other scientists in 21 major fields of science and the social sci-ences. That number was then compared witha worldwide cites-per-paper average. The four universities that ranked above Yale in the two-part survey were Harvard, which came in first, followed by Stanford,the Massachusetts Institute of Technologyand the University of California, San Diego. \"We consider citations to be very signifi- cant,\" said Chris King, editor of Science Watch,a newsletter published by the Insti- tute for Scientific Information in Philadel-phia, \"because they reflect what scientiststhemselves deem to be important. Whenthey cite a paper, they're saying, 'This work isimportant. It's germane to what I'm doing.'\" \u2014Jennifer Kaylin THREE JOIN INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE Each year a few dozen select physicians and scientists are named to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sci-ences to serve as unpaid advisors to the government. Among those elected last October for their contributions to health andmedicine were three Yale faculty members:Michael H. Merson, m.d ., the dean and Anna M.R. Lauder Professor of Public Healthand chair of the Department of Epidemiol-ogy and Public Health; Richard P . Lifton, m.d., ph.d. ,chair and professor of genetics and professor of medicine and molecular biophysics and biochemistry; and MicheleBarry, m.d., hs '77, professor of medicine and public health. As members they will con-tribute their knowledge and professionaljudgment to the development of findingsand the formulation of recommendations,most of which relate to public policy. \u2014John Curtis Orthopaedist Wayne Southwick's Taking Nourishment ,on display in the current Art Place exhibit at the Yale Physicians Building, was inspired by the work of sculptor Aristide Maillol.Instead of going to the movies, he and his wife, Ann, wandered in mu- seums and even went to Paris to see anexhibit of his favorite artist, AristideMaillol, the 20th-century French sculp- tor of the female nude. But it wasn 'tuntil the early 1980s that Southwickbegan lessons in sculpture at Lyme Academy, not far from his home. There he met Lucchesi and began weekly trips to New York City to study with him. Sculpting sharpened Southwick's powers of observation as a physician. Looking for scoliosis, \"I could see the symmetry or asymmetry of the bodymore acutely after looking at modelsand various positions of the spine, but more than that\u2014the other way round\u2014 I think knowing what's underneath theskin helps you think about sculpture.\" Ironically, sculpting also requires suppressing anatomical knowledge.Southwick says sculptures work better if they exaggerate certain features, like the anterior superior iliac spine (the pelvic bones). The head should be smaller than in real life, the necklonger. These alterations \"orient your view of things.\"Southwick has retired from sur- gery (while his son, Steven M. South-wick, m.d., professor of psychiatry, carries on the family name at Yale). The senior Southwick and Lucchesirecently collaborated on a sculpture forthe new Connecticut Hospice buildingin Branford, Conn. Southwick felt hon-ored to work mymind, he's the greatest living represen-tational sculptor.\" Lucchesi himself has three sculptures on the Yale medi-cal campus, including a bronze of amother and child in the atrium of Yale-New Haven Hospital. Lucchesi appreciates that South- wick is using his talents to create real-istic sculpture at a time when\"everyone is doing a block with a hole in it.\" He describes Southwick's dis-covery of the art form as a revelation:\"Aneophyte finds a new religion: he finds sculpture\u2014and he transmits that enthusiasm to other people.\" As for the work itself, what does Lucchesi think? \"He trained me,\" Southwick says with a laugh. thinks I'm better than I was before.\" \u2014Cathy Shufro terry dagradiyale medicine winter 20038 rounds medicine and health at yale jon cannell Brain scans reveal disruption in the neural circuitry of children with dyslexia Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (f mri), researchers led by a husband-and-wife team at Yale havefound a neuronal short circuit indyslexic children and identied an areaof the brain that is linked to skilledreading. Their nding builds on a pre-vious study that linked poor reading in adults with dyslexia to a specicregion in the brain. \"Because this nd-ing coincides with ndings in adults, it shows dyslexia is persistent,\" saidSally E. Shaywitz, m.d., professor of pediatrics with an appointment in the Child Study Center and co-author of the study. \"It shows there is an urgencyfor early intervention. And we wereable to identify an area of the brain that correlates with skilled reading, the word-form area in the back of the leftside of the brain.\" Shaywitz and her husband, Bennett A. Shaywitz, m.d., professor of pediatrics and neurology with an appointment in the Child Study Center, found that neural circuits in the word-form area, also known as the occipito-temporal area, are disrupted in children with dyslexia. \"By seeing the disruption on brain imaging it says to us as physi-cians and scientists that dyslexia is as real an entity as any other med- ical disorder,\" said Bennett Shaywitz,co-principal investigator of the study and lead author of the paper in the July 15 issue of Biological Psychiatry.Also contributing to the work was John C. Gore, ph.d ., now at Vander- bilt University. This study follows one in 1998 in which the Shaywitzes and colleaguesfound a disruption in posterior neural systems for reading in the brains of dyslexic adults. That nding begged akey question. \"We did not know if this disruption was just the end result of years of poor reading or if it was therefrom the beginning of the time a childshould be able to read, which is around 6 or 7 years old,\" said Sally Shaywitz. The team used f mri to scan the brains of 70 dyslexic readers and 74 nonimpaired readers ages 7 to 18while they performed reading tasks with real words and \"pseudowords,\" made-up words that the children were asked to pronounce. The tasksmimicked the problems dyslexic children face in sounding out words.The team found evidence of a func-tional disruption of the neural systems involved in skilled reading, conrming the hypothesis that the defect is present at a young age. \"We believe dyslexic children are born with this disruption,\" Bennett Shaywitz said. The nature and cause of the dis- ruption are not clear. \"That's the next step,\" he said. With colleagues at Yale, he's using magnetic resonanceAS THE SPERM TURNS, SUCCESS Although intracytoplasmic sperm injection \u2014in which a single sperm is placed inside a mature egg\u2014increases the chances of asuccessful pregnancy, it also carries a risk of genetic abnormalitiesin children. Now two Yale scientists have devised a method forselecting genetically healthy sperm to lower those odds. Gabor B.Huszar, m.d., hs '76, and Attila Jakab, m.d., found that healthy sperm develop a receptor that recognizes an acid in the femalereproductive tract; they then devised a method of using the acid to identify the most robust candidates. Huszar and Jakab pre-sented their work at the European Society of Human Reproduc-tion and Embryology's June meeting in Vienna. \u2014John Curtis9 et cetera A CLOSER LOOK AT CLOT-BUSTERS Clot-busting drugs are almost always admin- istered to stroke patients incorrectly, some-times with serious consequences, accordingto a recent Yale study. Researchers reviewed the medical records of 63 patients who received thrombolytictherapy between 1996 and 1998. They founddepartures from recommended practice 97percent of the time. \"Major deviations fromprotocol were present in two-thirds of thecases and were associated with serious orfatal consequences,\" said Dawn M. Bravata, m.d. ,principal investigator of the study pub- lished in the Archives of Internal Medicine. Errors ranged from incorrect dosages and delays in administering the drugs to givingthem to at-risk patients. Responsibility forthe drugs' misuse was widespread, the studyfound, and detours from protocol occurred all along the heath care pathway. Why? \"It'sa hard drug to give properly,\" said.\"It's not something doctors do every day.\" \u2014Jennifer Kaylin CATS AND THE PREGNANT WOMAN There's good news and bad news for preg-nant women who live with cats. On the up side, they face little risk of contractingtoxoplasmosis from their feline compan-ions. On the other hand, there's one less rea-son to avoid cleaning the litter box. Jeffrey D. Kravetz, m.d., an assistant clini- cal professor of medicine who has two cats,decided to review the literature about cat-related diseases after his wife became preg- nant. He found that casual contact with a catdoes not put a woman's unborn child at risk.\"It's never been proven that toxoplasmosis(an infection that can cause miscarriages or damage to fetuses) comes from direct catcontact,\" he said. According to Kravetz it's much more likely a woman will get the infec-tion by eating undercooked meat or diggingwith bare hands in contaminated soil. Kravetz, whose review article appeared in the Archives of Internal Medicine in Sep- tember, advises pregnant women who mustchange a litter box to do so daily, wear glovesand wash their hands afterwards. \"Basically,use common sense and don't worry,\" he said. \u2014Jennifer Kaylinbob hambley spectroscopy to study brain cells in the region that is disrupted. According to the Shaywitzes, about one in ve children has dyslexia, which affects children without regardto level of intelligence. Typically,dyslexics compensate by using otherparts of the brain to read. \"Instead of being able to develop systems in the back of the brain they develop systems in the front of the brain, but it is very laborious,\" said Sally Shaywitz. \"It's not that theydon 't learn to read at all, but it'sharder to read.\" Although symptoms appear as soon as children start to read, most dyslexicchildren are not diagnosed until they'rein the third grade, she said. \"There isabsolutely no question that the earliera child is identied, the more differ-ence you can make,\" she said, addingthat early placement in preventive and remedial programs can help chil- dren with dyslexia. The programs useexercises, games and rhymes to help dyslexic children break up words into their individual parts. \"If you start at the beginning you can have a goodchance of helping that child in an efcient way. What we think\u2014and we have some evidence to support this\u2014 is that we can help the area of thebrain that is disrupted.\" \u2014John Curtisyale medicine winter 200310 findings from the bench An unlikely assembly plant If the ribosome makes the body's proteins, what makes it? Oddly enough, a giant. Imagine that you're out for a stroll in your neighborhood, passing the samefamiliar landmarks you see every day,when you suddenly come upon an enormous factory. Now imagine how astonished you'd be to learn that thebehemoth had been there all along, but no one had been able to see it untilnow. That's about how surprised Susan J. Baserga, m.d. '88, ph.d. '88 , was to nd the cellular equivalent of anassembly plant hiding in plain sight. Baserga and colleagues discovered and puried a new cellular entity, dubbed the ssuprocessome, which plays a key role in the making of ribosomes,the cellular machinery responsible for manufacturing all proteins. Surpris- ingly, the ssuprocessome, undetected until now, is nearly as large as a ribo-some, about 80 Svedberg units. \"We were surprised to discover that it takes a complex as big as a ribosometo make a ribosome,\" said Baserga, asso-ciate professor of molecular biophysics and biochemistry, therapeutic radiology and genetics. The ssuprocessome, a complex of rna and many proteins, wasn 't detected until now because pre-vious techniques used to look for rna- protein complexes ltered out the largerones, leaving only smaller material. \"We were able to nd it because we made our extracts\u2014the starting material forpurifying rna-protein complexes \u2014dif- ferently,\" of the University of Vir- ginia, also gured prominently. The researchers, who reported their work last June in Nature , named the complex a processome \"because it'sessential for processing the rna that becomes part of the ribosome,\" said Baserga. The \" ssu\" in the name stands for small subunit, because the com-plex is required for processing smallribosomal subunits, but not large ones.Though they're not sure exactly how it functions, Baserga and co-workersbelieve the ssuprocessome and its pro- teins help fold ribosomal rna into the proper conguration. It's already known that the rna portion of the ribosome is \"the business end\" that facilitates the ribosome's protein-producing work, so properly processed ribosomal rna is essential to the ribosome's function, noted Baserga. The ssuprocessome appears to be so critical to cell growth and health, in fact, that Baserga sus- pects that defective processomes may beat the root of some diseases for whichthe causes are not well understood. Researchers also are interested in the basic science behind rna process- ing in all types of cells, Baserga added. \"There's pretty good reason to think thatrna was the rst molecule, and thatdna and all the other molecules came from rna. So studying anything that affects rna metabolism brings you closer to understanding basic cel-lular processes.\" Next, the research team wants to explore how the ssuprocessome assem- bles into the huge complex it eventuallybecomes. \"We there's a denite order of assembly,\" says Baserga. Work- ing with helicases\u2014enzymes that foldand unfold protein and rna\u2014one of her students hopes to \"freeze\" the pro-cess in mid-course, providing a snap- shot of assembly in progress. Baserga's group will continue to tease out theexact details of how the ssuproces- some coaxes ribosomal rna into the proper form. \"That,\" she said, \"is goingto be the next 10 years or so of work.\" \u2014Nancy Ross-Flanigan Ribosomal dna (center) forms the trunk of the \"Christmas tree\" in this electron micrographof a chromatin spread from yeast.

The technique uses an engineered transcriptionfactor to switch on inactive genes that are already present in the mouse and has thepotential to spur the growth of new vesselsin tissue that has a diminished blood supply.The principle could also be extended to con-trol overactive genes that need switching off,such as those for cancerous tumor growth. In previous gene therapy trials, patients have been injected with the genes thatencode the growth factors that drive angio-genesis, the process of vessel formation. But Yale's Frank J. Giordano, m.d. ,and col- leagues at Sangamo BioSciences used a viral vector to deliver the genes that code for the switch, a zinc finger protein transcrip-tion factor dubbed Vegfa- zfp.The mouse then produced the transcription factor, whichswitched on the growth genes. Healthy blood vessels formed and wound healing was aug- mented, according to the paper, publishedonline in Nature Medicine on November 4. \u2014Celeste Biever FROM THE MOUTHS OF TICKS An anti-coagulant protein in the saliva of thedeer tick allows it to suck blood from a singlewound for days, according to Yale scientists. The identification of the protein, called Salp14,could lead to therapies for clotting disorders or vaccines against tick-borne diseases. Mosquitoes and tsetse flies can feed for only a few seconds before clots form. Exactlyhow ticks bypass this natural defense hadbeen a mystery. \"Tick saliva has an array ofpotent pharmacologic functions,\" said ErolFikrig, m.d. ,principal investigator for the study, published in the December issue ofInsect Molecular Biology .Fikrig said Salp14 blocks the actions of prothrombin, a key participant in the cascade of reactions thatlead to blood clots. \"If we st udy it in more detail, it could be used to combat any diseasewhere clot formation is a problem,\" saidFikrig. \"But this is just the tip of the iceberg.\" \u2014Celeste Biever11 et cetera Nature studies offer a new view of the immune response,from a dendritic perspective When the body is under pathogenic attack, it is the long-armed dendriticcells in the skin that identify the for- eign invaders and instruct the body's killer cells to ght them. Understand-ing how these multitalented sentinelsoperate could be central to producing the next generation of vaccines to combat diseases such as cancer and hiv, according to immunologists at Yale and Harvard who published their ndings last August in Nature . Discovered in 1868 by the German scientist Paul Langerhans, dendritic cells became of interest to immunolo-gists in the 1960s but have only recentlyrevealed their operational secrets. It took a novel imaging approach toobserve the role the cells play in precipi- tating the body's immune response. Bytagging the relevant molecules with green fluorescent dye, the groupsfrom Yale and Harvard used video imaging of cultured cells to chart the pathway of an antigen, a protein thatstimulates an immune response. For the rst time, scientists observed mole- cules moving in a live dendritic cell. Dendritic cells reside in the skin, constantly feasting on the proteins that surround them. If a foreign antigen is present, it is consumed and trans- ported to an acidic compartment deep within the dendritic cell called a lyso- some. Aided by enzymes, the lysosomechops the proteins up into more man-ageable chunks called peptides. Mean- while the dendritic cell travels to thekiller T cells in the lymph, which ulti-mately deal with invaders. But how do peptides get from the enclosed compartment, the lysosome, at the cell's core\u2014so impenetrable thatYale's Ira Mellman, ph.d ., chair and professor of cell biology, calls it \"Dante's seventh level\"\u2014to its surface, wherethey can interact with T cells? Under Mellman 's supervision, grad- uate student Amy Chow and associate research scientist Derek Toomre, ph.d ., watched the growth of long thin tubules that became the peptides' escape routes.They begin emanating from the lyso- some shortly after a foreign invader is detected, and nally fuse with the cell'ssurface. Chow saw the green-glowingcarrier molecules drag the freshly chopped peptides along the tubules. Atthe cell's surface, the carrier molecules display their cargo of pep- tides, flagging those that represent dangerous invaders differently fromthose that came from the body's ownharmless proteins. T cells respond by self-destructing if the peptide isbenign and by propagating if they must unleash their arsenal upon it. \"Dendritic cells sit at a critical nexus, deciding whether to respond orignore a protein. Most immunologists so far have been T-cell-centric, but T cells can 't do anything unless a den- dritic cell instructs them,\" said Mellman.\"Dendritic cells are like cellular psychi-atrists. They bring out the deep-seated problems, wait for them to come to the surface and then interpret them.\" Jacques Banchereau, ph.d ., director of the Baylor Institute for Immunology Research in Dallas, said the unprece-dented inside view of how dendritic cellsoperate offered by the Nature studies could pave the way to a more rationalapproach to vaccine design. \u2014Celeste Biever Arrows point to the tubules found to carry for- eign antigen and mhc class II molecules from the lysosome to the surface of a dendritic cell. amy chow and derek toomresional lives, we often forget that what we see, we imitate andwhat we imitate, we become.This is obviously a positive thingfor those who have found suc- cessful, encouraging mentors intheir fields, but finding thosementors is still much easier formen than for women.

When cells become cancerous, they grow unrestrained andsometimes ignore signals thatwould normally induce them todie. \"What are the genetic func-tions,\" Nobel laureate Harold E.Varmus, m.d ., asked in a Novem- ber 1 campus talk, \"responsiblefor sustaining the life of cancer cells?\" Varmus, president andchief executive officer of Memo-rial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Cen-ter and the former director ofthe National Institutes of Health,gave the keynote address at the2002 Graduate Student ResearchSymposium, an annual event that brings speakers to campusand provides graduate studentsa venue for presenting researchin progress. In his address Varmus described how his laboratory hasused new ways to study thosegenetic functions in mouse mod-els of lung and ovarian cancers.Varmus and colleagues con- trolled expression of a mutantgene by dosing mice with theantibiotic doxycycline: in thisway they could induce lung cells to become cancerous. Haltingthe drug dosages abruptlyreduced the expression of that gene, K-ras ,and triggered the death of the tumor cells, causingthe cancers to melt away. His laboratory is attempting to understand how genes like K- ras\"protect cells from cell death\" and what happens when thecells lose K-ras function and die. From there, the goal will be to figure out \"how to trigger a simi-lar response in humans,\" which,Varmus suggested, could prove key to developing new treat- ments for the deadly cancers. \u2014Marc WortmanMA RIA MARCHETTI-MERCER A disheartening view of aids in South Africa \"I will give you a picture that will sound a bit bleak,\" Maria C.Marchetti-Mercer, ph.d ., told an audience at a lunch spon-sored by the Center for Interdis-ciplinary Research on aids in September. Marchetti-Mercer,head of the department of psy-chology at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, pro-ceeded to paint a landscape ofsocial and political turmoil andits relationship to the growing hiv/aids pandemic. With the end of apartheid in the 1990s,political violence gave way tocriminal and domestic violence.The country has seen increasingincidents of \"family murder,\"the killing of all family membersby a parent. Added to this mix is the impact of hiv/aids ,which is estimated to have left at least660,000 orphans and reducedfamilies to poverty as breadwin- ners die or become incapacitated. \"Poverty doesn't cause aids ,\" Marchetti-Mercer said. \"Butit does create a context wherepeople are more vulnerable.\" People with hiv/aids are stigmatized, and society offerslittle in the way of social, eco-nomic or psychological support.As a result, Marchetti-Mercersaid, poverty and crime will onlyincrease. \"I think we are movingtoward another lost genera-tion,\" she said, referring to theorphans the epidemic has left.\"This whole cycle of poverty andcriminal and domestic violencewill go on because of the impactof hiv/aids .\" \u2014John CurtisANDREA TONE In history of birth control, amale influence Although birth control is widely viewed as a women's issue, menhave played a large, if unrecog-nized, role in reproductive rights,Andrea Tone, ph.d ., professor of history at the Georgia Instituteof Technology, said at a Historyof Medicine and Science lecturein December. \"If you examinesources not usually consideredvital to the history of birth con-trol\u2014arrest records, creditreports, trial transcripts, patent applications, post office records,military investigations, ftc and fda records and men's letters\u2014 you encounter a cast of charac- ters who are not only funda-mental to the history of moderncontraception, but who are also often men,\" said Tone, author ofDevices and Desires, a history of contraception from 1873 to 1973. Among those men was Julius Schmid, who, in 1883, found ause for animal intestines beyondmaking sausages. He did whatEuropeans had been doing sincethe Renaissance and turned the delicate but impermeablemembranes into condoms. Toskirt laws against such devices,condoms and diaphragms were marketed as \"French goods and medicines.\" Late-19th-century physicians favored condoms as an effective means of birth control. And,letters of that time reveal, contra-ception was on the minds of husbands as well as wives. \"Mendiscussed how anxious they were to protect their wives'health and welfare from the tollof uninterrupted childbearing,\"Tone said, \"and they worried how they, as breadwinners, couldafford to feed another mouth.\" \u2014John Curtison campus dagradi EUGENE SHINN African dust brings nutrients\u2014 and toxins For centuries winds have car- ried dust from Africa anddeposited it on islands in theCaribbean and locations in Florida and South America. Thedust provides essential nutri-ents to the upper canopy of theAmazon rain forest and, in theBahamas, contributes to the for-mation of red soils known aspineapple loam. As early as 1846, however, Charles Darwin was complain-ing about the pernicious effectsof African dust as he traveledthrough the Canary Islands. Inrecent years the dust has carried traces of fertilizers, pesticides,mercury, arsenic, bacteria and a fungus called Aspergillus that has devastated sea fans onCaribbean coral reefs. According to Eugene A. Shinn, ph.d. ,a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in St. Peters-burg, Fla., the dust also hasimplications for human health.\"It causes lung infections,\"Shinn told students at the Schoolof Forestry & EnvironmentalStudies in November. He alsobelieves African dust is linked toincreases in asthma throughoutthe Caribbean. Since the 1970s deforesta- tion and drought in Africa havecaused huge dust storms. Whenthey reached the Caribbean,the effects were obvious. \"In SanJuan, Puerto Rico, people couldfeel it in their chests. They had headaches,\" Shinn said. Shinn is working with micro- biologists and physicians to study the problem, but as hecautioned at the start of his lecture, \"This is a bad-news/bad-news story.\" \u2014John Curtis yale medicine winter 200314 capsule above Physician Giovanni Aldini (1762-1834) con- ducted experiments using electricity on newlyexecuted criminals that produced an opening of the eyes, a quivering of the jaw and contortionA monstrous notion Exhibit on Frankenstein looks at the intersection of scientific knowledge, creative power and human arrogance.by Rachel Engers top Films from the 1930s produced this enduring image of Victor Frankenstein's monster, here on a U.S. postage stamp. of muscles.

Opponents of genetic ally altered foods created this postcard.15 With his flattened pate, horrid scars and a set of neck bolts to keep his head on straight, the monster popularlyknown as \"Frankenstein \" is a lurching,grunting, remorseless killer. This image, made famous by a series of1930s lms starring Boris Karloff, canbe seen on everything from cereal boxes to postage stamps and has come to represent the notion of science out of control. Any new technologythat calls into question our traditionalunderstanding of what it means to be human, from cloning to xenotrans- plantation, seems inevitably to raise thespecter of author Mary WollstonecraftShelley's hideous monster. Nearly two centuries after its creation, Frankenstein continues to haunt us. According to Susan E. Lederer, ph.d. , associate professor of the his- tory of medicine, the story continues to maintain its hold on the popular imagi-nation. \"It's alive and it's escaped,\" says Lederer. \"These represent primal fears about human agency and respon-sibility for creation.\" Lederer was the chief curator of \"Frankenstein: Penetrating the Secrets of Nature,\" a 1997 exhibit at theNational Library of Medicine ( nlm) , and mounted a modied version of the show this summer in the rotunda of the Cushing/Whitney Medical Library. From the Yale archives, she added rare books on galvanism and the supposedreanimation of the dead that influencedShelley's 1818 novel. The exhibit exam- ines how the author used the \"scientic advances and controversies of her era as a metaphor for issues of unchecked power, self-serving ambition and their effect on the human community.\" It also looks at how playwrights, lm-makers and cartoonists have trans- formed the image of the monster and how Frankenstein 's monster continuesto emerge in debates about modern science. Over the next four years thetraveling exhibit, drawn from the exhibit sponsored by the nlm and the American Library Association, will visit 80 libraries across the country.While the idea for Frankenstein came to 18-year-old Mary Shelley in a dream,the monster reflected the curiosity ofphysicians and natural philosophers ofher era in reviving the drowned andreanimating dead tissue using electric-ity. These researchers, according to the exhibit text, aimed to benet humankind and end death and disease through theirinvestigation into the mysteries of nature. Assembled in secret from body parts gathered from graveyards and slaugh- terhouses, scientist Victor Franken-stein 's creation has flowing hair, blacklips and shriveled yellow skin, which\"scarcely covered the work of musclesand arteries beneath.\" Despite his grislyappearance, the nameless monster isintelligent and sensitive. He seeks human companionship and educates himself by reading the works of Homer,Milton and Goethe. Only after his maker rejects him does the creature turn to rage and murder. The tragedy ofthe story is Victor Frankenstein 's arro-gance and failure to take responsibility for his creation. The monster in the novel is different from and more complex than the ver-sion that has been popularized. The collection of artifacts shows an 1823 Eng-lish playbill for \"Presumption, or the Fate of Frankenstein,\" which portrayed the monster as a speechless brute. This marked the beginning of the simplica-tion of the author's tale that continues in lms and commercial culture today. The exhibit also explores the novel's often-forgotten subtitle, The Modern Prometheus . This gure in Greek myth- ology was a symbol of optimism to Mary Shelley, who noted that he used \"knowledge as a weapon to defeat evilby leading mankind beyond the state where they are sinless through igno- rance, to that in which they are virtuousthrough wisdom.\" Thus despite VictorFrankenstein 's utter failure, the exhibit points out, the author suggests the possibility that we can make responsiblechoices about scientic discovery.

As young as she looks, the rst- year medical student could no longer sustain the ction ofbeing an ordinary student the moment her four daughtersand 2-month-old grandson arrived to watch the annual rite of passage. Morris, 40, may have been on the accelerat- ed track for becoming a grandmother, but it took her a long time to get her white jacket. Morris had set her sights on medicine as a child. At age 11, she decided to become a doctor so she could take care of her ailing grandmother, who died while Morris wasstill a teenager. Motherhood at 16 and marriage to a manwho frustrated her attempts to enroll in college deflected Morris from her goal. She ran a beauty salon, worked as asecretary and eventually earned a nursing degree. Butalthough she found a certain measure of fulllment as a nurse, her desire to study medicine never waned. Under the tent on Harkness Lawn on that warm August afternoon,Karen Morris began to realize a dream deferred. The daughter of an ofce worker and a police ofcer in Harrisburg, Pa., Morris was a strong student who seemed destined to be the rst in her family to attend college. Shedid manage to nish high school in 1980 after giving birthduring her junior year to daughter Nikki (now 23). But afterMorris married the man who had been her boyfriend sincefth grade, now a machinist, she discovered that he opposedher plans to go to college. She studied cosmetology instead, and ran a beauty shop out of their home. Each fall, she pro- posed starting college, and each fall, she said, her husbandpressured her to wait\u2014until the children were older, untilnances were less strained. \"As bright as I am, it took me about nine years to realize he was never going to say OK,\" Morris recalled dur-ing a lunchtime interview at Marigold's, the medical school dining hall, a few weeks into the fall semester. Bythen the mother of ve children, Morris at age 29 quietly enrolled at Harrisburg Area Community College.When her husband interfered with her studies, she said, they separated. After working all day as a secretary, Morris would do homework alongside her children at the kitchentable and continue on while they slept, surviving on fourhours of sleep. She chose a nursing major, telling herself,\"You have ve kids. Let's be realistic: you can 't be a doctoranymore.\" She completed her associate's degree summa16yale medicine winter 2003The first grandmother to enter medical school at Yale, 40-year-oldKaren Morris is where she's always wanted to be: on her wayto becoming a physician. By Cathy Shufro Photographs by Terry DagradiLong road to Cedar Street For first-year student Karen Morris, the path to the human anatomy lab included careers as a cosmetolo-gist, a secretary and then an associate's-level nurse while sheworked toward her bachelor's degree at night.17 18 Long road to Cedar Street cum laude in 1996, and with her children 's encouragement, she enrolled at nearby York College to work toward her bach- elor's degree in nursing. Finding jobs rst at a state psychiatric hospital and then at a prison with 3,000 male inmates, Morris enjoyed nursing but craved more responsibility. \"It's one thing to follow through on a treatment plan, and it's another beingthe one responsible for formulating that treatment plan,\"she said. Her 40th birthday loomed as a deadline in Morris' mind, and she had only a few years to go. She realized, \"If I don 't try this, I'm going to regret it. My heart was set onbeing a doctor.\" And so, while pretending even to herselfthat her goal was a master's in nursing, she began taking the prerequisites for medical school. She was too embarrassedto approach the college pre-med advisor, so she searched the Internet to assemble a list of course requirements. She did well in science. It was online that she rst heard of the mcat . She also discovered the Minority Medical Education Program, a summer enrichment course for prospective medical students. The six-week program is funded by the RobertWood Johnson Foundation and offered on 11 campuses including Yale's. As an African-American, Morris qualied, and in July 2001 she left her hometown and her children for the rst time to attend the program in New Haven. Bythen, she and her former husband were on good terms, and he stayed with their children. When she took the mcat a few months before, Morris hadn 't even nished organic chemistry, and she hadn 't had the money for a prep course for the exam. She dreaded getting her scores and was pleasantly surprised when theyfell within the competitive range she was shooting for. But as she wrote down her age and listed her children on eachapplication form, Morris thought, \"They're just going to laugh this application off the desk.\" Morris lacked the money to travel to faraway inter- views, so she applied to only four schools\u2014and got into three. She chose Yale over Penn State and Pitt; JohnsHopkins rejected her. Morris earned her bachelor's degree magna cum laude in June and now lives in New Haven with her two youngest children, 16-year-old Shar-Dae and 14-year-old Ashley. (Firstborn Nikki is a col-lege graduate with a degree in information systems, and Morris' 62-year-old mother just started community college in Atlanta.) Morris is nancing her educationthrough grants and a loan. She is awed by the talents of her well-traveled, multilingual classmates, but she reminds herself of her own strengths, including years of experience taking care ofpatients and condence gleaned from coping with difcultyale medicine winter 2003 1986 1996 Karen Williams married Gregory Morris at Martin Luther KingBaptist Church in Harrisburg, Pa.Although they later divorced,they are now on good terms.Morris' children threw a party when their mother graduatedsumma cum laude with her associ-ate's degree in nursing from Harrisburg (Pa.)

'79, hs'83, said Morris was one of just a handful of students who stoodout among the 100 participants at the summer program for minority medical school candidates. \"It wasn 't just becauseshe was older,\" said Lee, who is assistant dean for multicul- tural affairs and director of the summer program. He said Morris' enthusiasm and curiosity had enlivened the entiregroup. When Morris received her certicate at the end of the course, Lee said, \"the whole group spontaneously stood up and clapped. Everybody was almost in tears.\" Lee said most people considering a demanding career change in mid-life would decide it was too late. \"I think it's remarkable that she would have the presence of mind to say, 'This is what I want to do' and go back and do it. I don 'tknow where that kind of strength comes from.\" He said Morris has what Sir William Osler called aequanimitas , 2000 2002a \"calmness amid storm \" that serves physicians well. As Lee describes Morris, \"Nothing seems to faze her. She's steady and sure with her voice, with her presence, with her visionof what she wants to do.\" As far as anyone knows, Morris is the first grand- parent to matriculate in medicine at Yale, but she's not the first Yale medical student to begin her studies at40.

By Marc Wortman Photographs by Frank Poole and Daphne Geismar20Laboratory flasks in the Boyer Center lab of cardiovascular researcher Jeffrey Bender, kept company by a colorful soap dis- penser, await packing in lateautumn. Over a 48-hour periodthis winter, crews will move the entire contents of the Benderlab, packed into 2,450 cartons and onto dollies. Bender is one of 91 principal investigators moving into the new building. The big move21 daphne geismarhe laboratory of Jeffrey R. Bender, m.d., hs'83, stretches east along the top floor of the Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine on College Street and toward the New Haven Green. Here Bender, a professor of cardiovascular medicineand immunobiology, directs a program investigating how inflammatory events in blood vessels cause atherosclerosis. It is the kind of work that could one day lead to new ways oftreating or preventing stroke, heart attack and the rejection of transplanted organs. Over the decade that his laboratory has occupied its Boyer Center space, it has lled up to bursting with the specialized tools and materials of molecular biology. Among them is a supply of costly reagents in Revcos, special deepfreezers that hum along at minus-80 degrees Celsius. Thelaboratory also maintains a supply of radioactive isotopes and uses closet-sized biosafety cabinets for working with haz- ardous and sterile materials. Then there are ve refrigerator-sized CO 2incubators precisely calibrated to keep the mil- lions of cells floating in petri dishes within them alive. Thevital core of the laboratory, those cells have been isolatedfrom normal and diseased humans and mice. Many of thecells have been genetically manipulated to study the biologi-cal mechanisms that underlie atherosclerosis. The cells 22 The big moveyale medicine winter 2003represent a lifetime of work. \"It would be devastating,\" said Bender, \"if we lost them.\" Atsome point this winter, a team of movers will pack nearly every single item in Bender's laboratory\u2014the con-tents of 700 shelves and drawers and larger discrete items according to the mover's count\u2014into 2,450 cartons and put them on dollies for easy transport. The laboratory staff will transfer the contents of the freezers and incubators into transport coolers designed for the task while a team from the Ofce of Environmental Health and Safety decontami-nates, wraps and seals the laboratory's equipment. Then themovers will load some of the material into trucks. What does not get shuttled by truck will be pushed, dolly by dolly, along a carefully mapped, 3,100-foot-long route through ve separate medical center buildings and across a new pe-destrian skybridge into the north wing of the new Congress Avenue Building. The movers will pass through the north wing and cross another bridge over the new building's lobbyinto the south wing. Eventually they will arrive by elevator on the fourth floor and head down the hall to what is now pristine, empty laboratory space. Once there, every item will be unpacked and put in its designated spot. The biosafety cabinets, freezers andincubators will be checked for contamination and thenplugged in, and their environments will be tested andrecalibrated as necessary. All of the frozen reagents, living Jeffrey Bender stands in empty lab space that will house his Programin Vascular Disease and Cardiol-ogy. The new arrangement willbring together scientists nowdoing related molecular work inscattered locations and make collaboration easier. \"The daily interaction,\" he says, \"will be a huge advantage for everyone.\" T23 cells and radioactive isotopes will be returned to their stor- age units. If everything goes according to plan, 48 hours after the move begins Bender's laboratory will be up andrunning in its new home. Now, multiply that scenario by 91. That is how many principal investigators, scattered throughout the medicalschool, will be moving into the new building over the course of 48 consecutive days starting in mid-winter. In total, the movers will pack up more than 200,000 individually tagged pieces of equipment, shelf- and drawer-loads and other itemsfrom 363 laboratory rooms in 38 separate locations aroundthe medical center. All of it should arrive at precisely pin- pointed locations in 180 rooms in the new space. With a schedule planned to within 15-minute intervals, from 8 a.m.until 7 p.m. six days a week (Sundays are reserved for anyproblems that arise), effectively one quarter of the medical school's research laboratories will be packed, hauled, pushed and trucked to new quarters in the new building. \"It is anenormous, three-dimensional puzzle,\" said Caroline Freeman Tunis, president of Freeman Enterprises, a New York City-based relocation management consulting rm planning the move. \" A move of this type puts a faculty mem-ber's life's work at risk. We have to work for perfection.\"Perfection is a tall order. Nothing in Yale's history\u2014and little in the history of any medical center\u2014compares to the scaleand complexity of the move.\"A remarkable opportunity\" The new, 457,000-square-foot Congress Avenue Building is by far the medical school's largest facility and Yale University'slargest new building in 70 years. (Among Yale buildings, only Payne Whitney Gymnasium and Sterling Memorial Library are larger.) More than a decade in the making and brought tofruition under the leadership of Dean David A. Kessler, m.d., and Yale President Richard C. Levin, the $176.6-million struc-ture is a big part of Yale's half-a-billion-dollar commitment to expand and renew its medical facilities over the next decade. (The space vacated by the move will gradually be renovated forother uses, including a planned neuroscience research center.) The new Center for Drug Discovery, built as an extension of the B wing of Sterling Hall of Medicine, is the latest structurein the expansion of the medical school. \"We're all a bit nervous, a little intimidated by the logistics of moving to a new place,\" said Carolyn W. Slayman, ph.d. , Sterling Professor of Genetics and deputy dean for academic and scientic affairs. \"But people understand it's aremarkable opportunity. Everyone who tours it is excited.\" The excitement is for a building with the complex mission of incorporating, enhancing and expanding the cen-tral research and teaching missions of the medical school.Slayman and faculty colleague Arthur E. Broadus, m.d. , ph.d., chaired the committee that planned the building. Designed by famed Philadelphia architect and former Yale frank poole24 The big moveyale medicine winter 2003 Douglas Rothman, director of the Magnetic Resonance ResearchCenter ( mrrc) ,stands in one of the massive steel boxes thatwill shield the center's powerfulmagnets. Two million of the 7 million total pounds of steel inthe new building are found in the mrrc 's research floor. With the new equipment, Yale scientists will gain as much as a 16-fold increase in image resolution, says Rothman: \"We'll be able to move from imaging systems down to imaging actual biological processes.\" frank poole25 School of Architecture faculty member Robert Venturi and the Boston rm Payette Associates, the tripartite building is composed of two block-long wings skewed at slight anglesand meeting in a large lobby facing the corner of CongressAvenue and Cedar Street. A narrow central courtyard stretch- es back from the lobby to Howard Avenue (See A Building for the 22nd Century , p. 26). The football-eld-and-a-half-long complex stretches from Cedar Street to Howard Avenue and is squeezed into a short block between Congress Avenue and Gilbert Street, occupying the site of the former nursing dormitory at 350 Congress Avenue and several smaller build-ings. Already the Congress Avenue and Cedar Street cornerhas formed a new center of gravity for the campus. That shift reflects a real change for the medical school. Many important activities will move to the new building. The six-story south wing will house some 700 researchers, while the three-story north wing will contain six teaching laborato- ries in anatomy and histology for the 136 rst-year medical and physician associate students, along with a 152-seat audi-torium and six seminar rooms. Space beneath the lobby andcourtyard houses new core research facilities serving the entire university. These include the Animal Resources Center,with facilities for production of transgenic and knockout mice and vivarium space for 74,000 rodents, and the Magnetic Resonance Research Center ( mrrc ), eventually to house nine magnets for imaging studies of humans, animals and cells. Just as important as the expanded and more modern research and teaching space, the new building brings to- gether previously far-flung scientists to encourage collabora- tions among different disciplines. It will be home to ninedistinct research programs, two in basic science and sevenin disease areas (See Of Mice and Magnets , p. 29). The basic science programs were selected to complement the clinical programs and to encourage research translating basic sci-ence discoveries into medical advances. \"The building,\" said Slayman, \"is mapped out so that basic researchers are next door to clinical researchers. There will be hallway conversa-tions, people going in and out of each other's labs, sharingequipment, borrowing reagents. There will be an upsurge in communications that we expect will speed discovery.\" The new building will also allow clinical research to grow. Bender will direct a new Program in Vascular Diseaseand Cardiology. Investigators now scattered in laboratories in four different buildings will share a large common laboratory area. Sitting in his present Boyer Center laboratory, whichopened just over a decade ago, Bender said, \"I am currently inwhat is considered premier research space at Yale, with out-standing colleagues. I don 't need better, but the opportunity tobring together a group of investigators focused on cardiovascu-lar disease is great. The daily interaction will be a huge advan-tage for everyone.\" And, as space opens up in existing buildingsafter the move, other fruitful juxtapositions are being created in what is known around campus as the \"backll\" process.Seven million pounds of steel The basic science programs include a new Program inHuman Genetics and Genomics, to be headed by Richard P. Lifton, m.d., ph.d., a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and chair of genetics. Created to promote the useof genetic approaches in the study of human disease, this new program will sit on a middle floor to foster collabora- tions among scientists throughout the building. Under thedirection of Richard A. Flavell, ph.d. , the other basic science program\u2014the Section of Immunobiology\u2014expects its previ-ous focus on the basic biology of the immune system toexpand into disease-oriented studies in its new home. Inter-actions among colleagues working in rheumatology, pul-monary disease and infectious disease are expected to grow. Magnetic resonance imaging of biological activity has become a front-line research method. Yale has pio- neered work using the imaging technology to study diabetesand psychiatric and neurological disorders in children and adults. The Congress Avenue Building will house a greatly expanded mrrc serving the entire campus. Six of the multi- ton magnets now housed beneath Fitkin Memorial Pavilion will be rolled, craned and pullied to the new center, which sits beneath the new building's courtyard. Three newimaging systems will be installed as well, including a 23-ton, 4-tesla human magnet, which arrived late one night last September from Germany, to great fanfare and fears for its safe passage over the last few, and most treacherous,feet to its new home. Along with a rigging crew, security guards, the con- struction manager, a New Haven police ofcer and a crowdof curious, late-night onlookers, about 15 engineers and scientists from the lab and their spouses were on hand as the delicate magnet and its housing were hoisted off a flatbed truck by a seven-story crane and lifted over 50 feetinto the air to clear electrical and telephone wires. After itwas successfully lowered into the loading dock at midnight, those on hand toasted it with champagne. Over the next four hours, riggers inched the magnet down a 30-foot corri-dor and into its room in the mrrc . It had to be positioned in the room with an accuracy of better than 10 millimeters, or it could not be successfully used, according to Douglas L. Rothman, ph.d. , director of the mrrc and an associate pro- fessor of diagnostic radiology. \"They accomplished this feat,\" he said, recalling the building of the ancient Egyptian pyra- mids, \"using a panoply of wedges, ramps, skates, blocks ropes and levers that would have made a Pharaohproud.\" (Plans call for the addition of a state-of-the-art, 11.7- tesla animal magnet and, funding permitting, a 7-tesla human magnet.) The magnet's destination was an iron and copper- lined room specially constructed for the purpose. Much ofthe design work was done by Terry Nixon, director of facili-ties at the mrrc. According to Nixon, even the slightest26 The big moveyale medicine winter 2003A building for the 22nd century When the planners and architects set out to create the CongressAvenue Building, they needed to think 100 years ahead, since theexpectation is that the new struc- ture will still be around and con-tributing to medical science a century from now. That's hard todo when even a year can bringhuge changes in science. The building's architect, Robert Venturi, head of the Philadelphia firm Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates, said, \"You're changing,always changing in science. Wepurposely designed it in the tradi-tion of the general American loftbuilding, a simple form and space to make it as flexible as possible.\" That flexibility had to take into consideration Yale's need for a major increase in research andeducational space and the limits of the long narrow building sitebetween Cedar and Howard streets. The result is two slender, elongated wings that extend two stories underground. The com-plex packs an enormous amountof space\u2014nearly half-a-millionsquare feet\u2014into a single cityblock. While meeting space andprogrammatic needs, the newbuilding needed to fit in with thelargely Georgian, low-scale build-ings along Congress Avenue.The three-story north wing com- plements the other buildings and reduces the street-level impact of the six-story south wing behindit. Venturi said he chose a variedpalette of colored and patternedbrick and limestone above the newbuilding's granite base to break up the surface rhythm of the structure's 700 huge windows,\"so it would not appear so big and would seem more cheerful.\" The entry to the building's lobby is a concave opening intend- ed to correspond to the entranceto Sterling Hall of Medicine and is the only sculptural form in the structure. It opens into a three-story-high, sunlit atrium, the com-plex's centerpiece. A glassed-in sky-bridge passes overhead betweenthe wings and a large staircase leads out to the courtyard. To ensure that the building will be around to contribute to sciencein the 22nd century, according to Reyhan T. Larimer, aia,the Yale project manager in charge of the building's construction, \"noexpense was spared in making it watertight.\" A watertight mem-brane wraps the entire building.\"Every piece of stone, every pieceof material,\" she said, \"was madeto shed water and to make surewater will not go into the cavity of the building.\" A century from now, scientists and students should still be working comfort- ably in what is today's mostadvanced medical sciences facility.

Two million of the 7 million total pounds of steel in the new building are found in the mrrc 's research floor. (The floor above brings together faculty members currently housed in disparate locations around campus.) Reflecting the growing demand for imaging studies, new faculty are being recruited to the recently formed Section of Bioimaging Sciences, which united imaging research faculty within the Department of DiagnosticRadiology. The present yearlong waiting list for magnet timeshould all but disappear. The new magnets will also greatly enhance what those experiments can \"see,\" offering as much as a 16-fold increase in image resolution. \"We'll beable to move from imaging systems down to imaging actual biological processes,\" said Rothman. \"For instance, as opposed to saying a region of the brain is not functioning properly in neural imaging studies, we could say which specic neuronal circuit or neurochemical pathway withinthat region is not functioning.\" A large space for small groups For years, students in rst-year gross anatomy and histology courses have attended classes in overcrowded laboratories originally intended for 50 students and lacking modern air-removal and computer systems. Now, they will move to spacious, state-of-the-art laboratories. \"It's not just that itlooks nice and doesn 't smell bad,\" said Herbert S. Chase, m.d. , professor of medicine and deputy dean for education. \"There is a strong basic science component to our curricu-lum and an emphasis on dialogue. The Congress Avenue Building is symbolic. It represents Yale's unied commit- ment to science, education and clinical medicine.\" Students will also benet from proximity to researchers. The class-room facilities in the north wing will bring students intoeveryday contact with research faculty. \"Students will bump into somebody who just gave a lecture on the way to his or her lab,\" said Chase. \"That won 't be lost on the students.Rubbing shoulders with scientists will shape the way stu- dents think about the curriculum.\" During the past two years, the faculty has moved to structure the curriculum increasingly around small-grouplearning and use of technology. \"We've cut out 25 percent of the time in the classroom in the past two years,\" said Chase. \"Students learn much faster, and small groups help studentsbecome independent thinkers. However, the lack of confer-ence rooms with computer facilities has made it hard toswitch.\" The new facilities should speed the transition. Chase believes that in the new building \"the curricu- lum will be much more richly textured. We'll move studentsalong more quickly in doing the same old activity of sitting in the room with the professor.\" William B. Stewart, ph.d. , chief of the Section of Anatomy and Experimental Surgery, believes that access to computers will greatly enhance students' experiences in gross anatomy. Computers will bemounted above each dissection table. Teaching spaces willalso have large screens and projectors as well as Internetconnections at every work space. \" Anatomy and the com-puter are a perfect marriage,\" said Stewart. \"Students will have the chance to feel the bile duct, look at an X-ray and look up information about it on the Web all at once.\" Moving the current anatomy program over to the new building presents a number of thorny issues. \"We have alarge number of specimens that we're scratching our headsabout,\" said Stewart. \"They're unique and priceless.\" Moversface the challenge of bringing them through the halls whileensuring minimal disruption of normal activity. Stewart iscondent that \"nearly everything will be able to go.\" Making sure that Stewart is correct is the responsibil- ity of Freeman Enterprises, which has hired a moving rmexperienced in handling complex hospital and laboratorymoves. Tunis' colleague Shellie Peck has been working on- site at Yale since January 2002 to inventory the contents of all the facilities to be moved and to plan the move sequence.She and the staff of the Ofce of Environmental Health and Safety have tagged every item according to a numerical and color coding system that indicates the type of handling itrequires and the exact time and pathway for its move. Eachtag also serves as the address to which every piece of equip- ment goes in the new building. \"We have databases within databases that keep track of each item,\" said Tunis. \"We allidentify a move with moving a household, but a lab move is very different. If something arrives at the wrong place, it can extinguish a lifetime of work.\" Inventorying contents was not the only job. Faculty members needed to be reassured that their laboratory property would be handled with appropriate care and under-standing. \"P.I.s [principal investigators] are possessive and rightfully so,\" said Reyhan T. Larimer, aia, the Congress Avenue Building project manager in the School of Medicine's Project Management and Construction ofce. \"You have toget their trust rst.\" Larimer has been working closely with Tunis, Peck and their 10-member team in preparing the new building for the move. The building was designed withgeneric laboratory space which will then be customized forthe needs of the individual investigators as they move in. Everything in the Freeman Enterprises' inventory had to be matched up with the new space into which each laboratorywill move to make sure that all equipment would t andhave the proper plumbing, power, communications and air-handling systems available. Should a freezer or incubatorarrive at a site that could not handle its needs, research could be interrupted, or worse.28 The big moveyale medicine winter 2003 frank pooleAnatomy professor William Stewart stands in the educationwing's dissection r oom, which will have Internet connections atevery work space. \"Anatomy and the computer are a perfectmarriage,\" says Stewart. \"Students will have the chance to feel the bile duct, look at an X-ray and look up information about it on the Web all at once.\"29 Of mice and magnets: what's inside theCongress Avenue Building When admissions candidates toured the medical school inrecent years, their student guides didn't go out of their way to showoff Yale's overcrowded and poorlyventilated first-year gross anato- my and histology laboratories. That will be changing. \"We will beputting the new building on the tour,\" said Associate Dean for Admissions Thomas L. Lentz, m.d. '64, professor and vice chair of cell biology. \"Hopefully it will helpin recruiting.\" A tour of the newbuilding should also help attractthe faculty who are expected tojoin the expanded research pro-grams it will house. What visitors to the north wing will find are three floors of new teaching facilities .The new anato- my and histology laboratories have been designed to improve interac-tion among students and faculty,with a U-shaped configurationreplacing the traditional straight line of workbenches. The newbuilding also provides computernetwork connections at every laboratory and seminar-room workspace, as well as wall monitors andother audiovisual display systems.The small-group teaching focus atYale will be enhanced by the six seminar rooms dispersed amongthe student laboratory spaces. A 152-seat auditorium adjacent to the large atrium lobby will bringstudents and faculty together forlectures and conferences. Core research facilities serv- ing the entire Yale campus fill a warehouse-sized space two floors below the lobby level. The Animal Resources Center will offer ser- vices for production of transgenicand gene-knockout mice, whichare used as animal models in dis-ease studies. On the two floorsabove, the Magnetic ResonanceResearch Center will serve investi- gators throughout Yale with ninepowerful imaging magnets.Bioimaging faculty will have alarge, open area for workingtogether on advanced computa- tional studies. Douglas L. Rothman, ph.d. ,director of the center, notes one pleasant advantage for him in moving from the center's cur-rent home in the Fitkin MemorialPavilion basement: \"It will be the first time I've had a windowsince 1985.\" The six floors of the massive south wing will house nine research programs. The two basic science components, the Section of Immunobiology ,chaired by Richard A. Flavell, ph.d. ,and a new Program in Human Genetics and Genomics ,directed by Richard P . Lifton, m.d. ,ph.d. ,will be neighbors of seven clinicalresearch programs. They are: Arthritis and Autoimmunity , under the direction of Joseph E. Craft, m.d. ,hs '77, a group that has, among other accomplish-ments, developed new tools forearly diagnosis of lupus and is testing second-generation vac-cines for Lyme disease; Asthma and Lung Diseases , which is directed by Jack A. Elias, m.d. ,and has recently been credit- ed with identifying two genes that cause pulmonary emphysema; Diabetes and Bone Diseases , composed of three groups, one working on the causes of type I diabetes and led by Robert S.Sherwin, m.d. ,a second, directed by Gerald I. Shulman, m.d .,ph.d ., focusing on understanding the molecular basis of insulin resist-ance in patients with type II dia-betes, and a third group looking atbone development, under the leadership of Arthur E. Broadus, m.d., ph.d. ; Digestive Diseases ,directed by Henry J. Binder, m.d ., recently won an nih core grant to support its wide-ranging studies of the gas-trointestinal tract and liver; Hypertension and Kidney Failure ,which studies the causes of diseases that affect 50 millionAmericans, under the leadershipof Peter S. Aronson, m.d ., and in close collaboration with Lifton; Infectious Diseases ,led by Keith A. Joiner, m.d ., focuses on how parasites live in their hostcells in the hopes of developingdrugs to kill the pathogens caus-ing such widespread diseases asmalaria and toxoplasmosis; and Vascular Disease and Cardiology , headed by Jeffrey R. Bender, m.d., hs'83, will bring together previous- ly scattered researchers working on the genetics of heart disease,the leading cause of death in theUnited States.Across the street and 1,840 miles away Following Freeman Enterprises' detailed choreography, the giant dance of the move will proceed with a daily crew of 48 to 60 movers. Every carton or piece of equipment will be placed on dollies and either rolled into 26-foot trucks that will shuttle back and forth at the rate of three to five tripsper hour or be pushed through the hallways. The farthestsingle push will be through more than 3,800 feet of hall- way. The movers' feet may ache by the end. According to Freeman Enterprises' estimates, the movers will push the contents of the Yale laboratories more than 1,840 miles intotal, the equivalent of walking from New Haven past Denver. In some cases, the most direct route is not available because the hallways are used by medical center patients.Moreover, many items that might be moved more efficient-ly by truck cannot leave the interior of the medical school because of safety and health regulations. These include a variety of hazardous materials such as radioactive isotopes,contaminated equipment and so-called \"select agents,\" biological materials such as certain highly toxic bacteria and infectious viruses strictly controlled by the federal gov- ernment. Robert C. Klein, associate director of the Officeof Environmental Health and Safety, has worked closely with faculty, Larimer and Freeman Enterprises to prepare for the move. He said, \"You need to make sure the wrongthings don 't get moved and the right things aren 't moved inthe wrong way.\" He points out that the medical school routinely moves hazardous materials. \"The hazard doesn 'tchange [with a project this size],\" he said, \"just the vol- ume.\" Most hazardous items will either be placed in spe- cial sealed carts designed to capture any inadvertent spill or leakage or be carried personally by Klein and his staff orlaboratory staff. Shortly before the movers arrive in Bender's labora- tory, Klein and his staff will have decontaminated and sealed all the equipment that previously contained hazardous ma-terials. The movers will move quickly through the laboratory,packing tagged items into cartons. Bender is condent about the move. \"I'm not overwhelmed by the logistics,\" he said. \"They will be surmountable with good organization.\" If allgoes according to plan, his laboratory's contents will arrive at their new destination on schedule and intact. Despite the move's complexity, he anticipates losing no more than twodays' research productivity. \"Moves are always unsettling,\"he said, \"but it's denitely worth it.\" Two days after Bender closes the door to his laboratory in the Boyer Center for thelast time, he plans to walk into his new laboratory and start up exactly where he left off, alongside a host of new neigh-bors and colleagues.

Every few months Richard M. Satava, m.d. ,visits colleagues at a lab atmit where there's a coffee cup with his name on it. The cup also has embedded in it something called \"smart dust,\" an electronic medium so small that it is barely noticeable as it receives and transmits infor-mation. When Satava places his cup in a coffee machine at the lab, thecup's smart dust tells the machine's smart dust how he likes his coffee,right down to the cream and sugar. For Satava, a faculty member in the Department of Surgery from 1998 until last July, when he moved to the University of Washington, thissmart dust has implications and applications far beyond the frivolity of getting his coffee right. [Satava came to Yale from darpa ,the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which was established in 1958 inresponse to the Soviet Union's launching of Sputnik.] It is one of many technologies that offer the promise of longer, healthier lives. These tech-nologies sit on the cusp of biology, engineering, nanotechnology andother sciences. They will revolutionize, he believes, not only medicine butalso society. Some of these technologies are already in use; others soonwill be. Society's task is not only to understand how to harness them butalso to address how they will change what it means to be human. Associate Editor John Curtis met with Satava before his depar- ture last summer for Seattle to discuss the \"biointelligence age\" and its implications.32 A futurist's viewyale medicine winter 2003You have described modern society as having entered \"the biointelligence age.\" What does this mean? The biointelligence age is marked by the intersec-tion of technologies to do things you can't do with a single technology. It has become obvious that one of the most important things about the future of science and research is that the major disruptive technologies that are going for- ward are going to be coming from interdisciplinary research. What are disruptive technologies? Mobile communication is an example. We've gone from a telephone to a cell phone, and we've gone from dumb stuff to smart stuff. It may be in the not-too-distant future that there won'tbe any phones in any homes. Why do you need a phone athome if you've got one on your watch everywhere you go? And so what used to be only a scientific research tool, as you saw with the Internet, became something that intruded in virtually every person's life. That's a disruptive change. Those technologies that are disruptive are no longer coming out of information or engineering alone, but from the intersection of two technologies. And you have enormous potential: disrup- tive technologies will displace other previously successful tech- nologies. So that's the origin of the biointelligence age. We had the agricultural age, the industrial age and the information age. If we look at our technologies, what we're seeing is that they're getting smaller and smaller in scale. And they're becoming smarter and smarter. So things like micro- sensors are going to be virtually everywhere. They're like a smart bar code. They interact, you can program them and they can tell you about themselves without having to be scanned. Where would these microsensors be? Virtually everywhere. This was coming out of Xerox Park Research Lab and the University of California, Berkeley, under the program Smart Dust. These particles are so tiny\u2014 they're the size of the head of a pin or smaller\u2014but they'reentire intelligence systems that have sensors on them that can sense the environment and store information. Youcan't see them without a microscope; that's why they'recalled dust.They communicate with each other. So the environment is going to be smart instead of dumb. They're going to be in the food you eat, the clothes you wear, embedded in your body, abso- lutely everywhere. For example, when you came into this room,this desk would know it was you and rearrange itself for you. Have you been able to buy anything lately that doesn't have a bar code on it? Probably not. But it's dumb. In the future,it will be smart. You plant the field and you spray it with the fertilizers and insecticides and smart dust\u2014maybe a thousand different sensors per millimeter\u2014and as the food comes up the smart dust gets incorporated into the plants. And the plantstalk to the harvester: \"Pick me. I'm ready. Don't pick me. I'm not ready.\" It goes into the store. You've got a little handheld and you talk to the artichokes. \"How ripe are you? How much do you weigh?\" A world that used to be dumb and unconnected now gets connected, and that information gets shared. How is this going to be applied to medicine? We will have sensors throughout our bodies. So, as doctors, we'll be able to continuously monitor the health of individuals. At darpa we came up with something that got called the millennium toilet. The only place that we could monitor somebody and give a physical examination every single day would be in the bathroom. Everybody has to do their morning hygiene. What today is a dumb bathroom would become a smart one. When you brush your teeth, your toothbrush takes your blood pressure and looks for cavities. When you look in the mirror there is a little camera that looks at your eyes to check your diabetes or hardening of the arteries or any of the thou- sands of diseases that we can pick up by looking at your eyes. When you go to the toilet, it would check what's in there. If, for example, Grandma was supposed to be taking her digitalis and she's got Alzheimer's disease and can't remember, the toilet would know. Because there is supposed to be a certain level of the byproduct, and if it's not there that means she didn't take her medicine. So she can be reminded. So we would postulate that in the future we would be able to make the room a smart room and it would actually be kind of an aid for you. How do you envision technology affecting surgery? Eventually the majority of surgery will be done by computers, but we're talking a minimum of 50 to 100 years from now. Youcan do a total body scan of the patient; this is called the holo-graphic medical electronic representation, or homer .You can \"The robot is not a machine. The robot is an information system.\"gale zucker33 plan the operation on the homer .You'll have the opportunity to do it on the computer two or three different times and edit them together and get the perfect operation. And when you have got the perfect operation, the robot will do it faster, quicker, moreefficiently and more precisely than you could. It's possible that you could just send the operation file somewhere, to India, and let the robot in India do it. You don't have to be there once you've programmed it exactly to the patient's specifications. The robots, I think, have turned out to be the key, one of the major innovating components of the future of surgery. The important issue here is that the robot is not a machine.The robot is an information system. It sends bits and bytes back and forth and works in the information world. Most of the people I have talked to are thinking of them as nothing more than extensions of your arm. And that unfortunately is a very narrow vision of what they are. You can give the surgeon X-ray vision because you can overlay where the blood vessels are inside of the organ. When you look at the liver, you can see all the bile ducts and all the arteries and the veins, which aren't visible to the naked eye. And then you can use that same data afterwards, when they finish the operation. And so we will know exactly what you have done with your surgery and how good your outcomes are. In addition to that, taking the analogy of the aviation industry, the robot is also a recorder. Every time I make a motion, it sends a signal to the arm to move in a specific way. All you do is tap into that and send it to the black box behind the surgeon. It's just like the black box behind the pilot when he flies the airplane. So we will have continuous recording and we'll be able to use that system to monitor how good the surgeon actually is. And this will help surgeons to improve the quality of their surgery. A few years ago you were testing \"smart shirts\" on climbers on Mt. Everest. These shirts could monitor vital signs and transmit them to base camp. Where does that technology stand now? About 18 months ago a company was set up for this, and this spring they're supposed to come out with the first commercial version that anybody can buy. And by that I mean you or your doctor can go to the store and order one of these shirts andyou put it on, and it will begin taking your vital signs. How much will they cost? The probable production cost is somewhere between $50 and$75, so you should be able to buy the shirt for $100 or $200.Not very expensive. And it's washable, you can use it for a long period of time and then you connect it to a little trans- mitter that sends the information on for analysis. Who would want to wear one of these? Oh, there are many, many people, whether they be the people who have a chronic disease like asthma, congestive heart failureor heart arrhythmia. There is a whole host of people that you can monitor various vital signs on. I think it would be super to put them on every high school or college athlete and be able to see how well they're performing. Every year we lose half a dozen young strong kids playing sports because they had some kind of unknown abnormality. And these can pick them up. There is a whole slew of different diseases that we know about that if wewould screen for them we could prevent these deaths. Any technology has potential for misuse as well. Can you pro- tect the confidentiality of the massive amounts of medical information that would be gathered and stored electronically? I always tell this little story and it has to do with the security of the medical record. When I was in the military in California, wewere able to arrange it so that the people would come to their family practitioners in the morning. If they had something wrong and needed a surgeon, we'd see them that same after- noon. And so what would happen is they would have seen the doctor in the morning and then gone shopping or gotten lunch 34 A futurist's viewyale medicine winter 2003or something, and they'd come back and see us. And every Saturday from the grocery, from the commissary over at the PX, from the department store, they would come with shopping carts full of medical records that people had left sitting on thecheckout counter. Now I ask you, is electronic security better than people bringing back shopping baskets full of these med- ical records? It's not an issue really of whether or not it's secure. It's clearly, in my view, much more secure than anything we have today. But it's not perfect, and yet 95 percent of secu- rity breaches are from people on the inside misusing legitimate access to the information. The hackers that you read about inthe newspaper account for less than 5 percent of all the losses of security of information. It's not a technical issue. Security is absolutely a regulatory issue or a human behavioral issue. What ethical issues do these new technologies pose? The ethical issues that the new technologies are raising are far beyond anything that most people are addressing at this time.Security of medical records pales in comparison to the implica- tions of the new technologies that are coming. Human cloning is one of them. There will be a human clone in 12 months. End of story. There is no question about that. And the reason is that there are two very reputable, very talented scientific groups offshore that have decided for reasons of their own that it is ethical to clone a human being. One of the groups has 200families that have tried every single known method of creating their own child and have not been able to. Should we deny these families the opportunity to have children if we have the technology to give it to them? I don't know. On the other hand we don't want a version of Brave New World ,where the gam- mas do all the physical work and the betas do all the clerical work and the alphas do all the management. And that's brought to the forefront that there are many technologies that are accelerating so rapidly and we have not even looked at the potential behind them. When they come on the scene, we're going to be completely unprepared. We need to look at a number of the issues in advanced technologies, no matter how hypothetical. There is research on apoptosis and telomerase, which we believe are the keys tolongevity. There is no known human that has ever lived more than 120 years that's been documented scientifically. Now you can control when a cell lives or dies, and you can make them live longer. They have allowed some rats tolive the equivalent of three to five life spans. That is similar toliving 360 years instead of a maximum possible 120. What happens if we just double a human's average life span so everybody now lives 150 years? What is the implication ofthat? Am I going to have one career for 130 years or 150 years? When do I retire? Do I ever? How do we feed all the additional people? We are on the threshold right now. Who is looking at the implications of longevity? A number of researchers are looking at salamanders and flat worms and beginning to find genes for regeneration. In these animals, if you cut off a leg they will grow a new one. Scientists at mit and Massachusetts General Hospital have been growing synthetic organs made with stem cells and a vascular substrate. We now have a world with synthetic organs. What does that mean? It means a lot of things. Transplant is not going to be a problem. More important for me as a surgeon, right now I know about 20 different opera-tions I do for different stomach problems. If you have an ulcer I do this procedure, if you have a cancer I do another procedure, if you're bleeding I do still a different procedure. In the future, if you have something wrong with your stomach, regardless of what the problem is, the stomach will be removed and replaced with one grown with your own stem cells. And, since I will do the same operation over and over, instead of many different ones, it will be possible for me to perfect the tech- nique to provide you with a much better outcome. Why should I repair an organ? The only reason for repair- ing now is that we cannot replace entire organs on everyone every time. What we will have in the not-too-distant future, approximately 10 to 20 years from now, is patients will have all these replaceable parts. This prompts a very fundamental ethical question: what does it mean to be human? If I am all pieces of metal and artificial organs, am I still human? This is just one of the many enormous ethical problems that technology is going to put on our plate. And the chal- lenge is, are we courageous enough at this time to face them, or are we just going to scorn them out of ignorance? Peoplesay, \"Well, that just cannot happen\u2014that's just Star Trek .\"And then Dolly appears on the scene and we're unprepared for the question of human cloning. So I think we have had awarning, and it's time to look at these technologies and say, \"Yes, they sound futuristic, but since we can't predict thefuture, it is incumbent upon us to look at them and be moreprepared than we have been in the past.\" YM\"If I am all pieces of metal and artificial organs, am I still human?\"35 faculty Distinguished company Founding members of the new Society of Distinguished Teachers gathered for a reception on September 24 in the Beaumont Room.More than 60 members attended, all recipients of major teachinghonors such as the Bohmfalk Prize, the Francis Gilman Blake Award,the Leah M.

In another era, the appointment of Susan Hockfield ,ph.d. ,as provost might have been remarkable because of her gender. But since the 1970s, three other women\u2014Hannah H. Gray, Judith Rodin and Alison F. Richard\u2014have held Yale's top academic post. \"What is perhaps more unusual in my appointment as provost at Yale is thatI'm a scientist,\" Hockfield, the WilliamEdward Gilbert Professor of Neurobiology, said in December. Hockfield, who wasappointed dean of the Graduate School ofArts and Sciences in 1998 and reappointedlast fall to that post by President Richard C. Levin, is the first medical school facultymember to hold either position. In her new job, she is the university's chief educational and administrative officer,overseeing academic policies and activities throughout the university. All deans report toher, and she has institutional responsibilityfor the allocation of resources, chairing the university's budget committee. Three professors, authorities in genetics and immunology,receive Sterling honor Three faculty members at the School of Medicine have been named to Sterling chairs,one of the university's highest tributes. Richard A. Flavell , ph.d. ,known for his pio- neering research on gene structure and criti-cal genes of the immune system, has beenappointed Sterling Professor of Immunology.Richard P . Lifton , m.d., ,the newly desig- nated Sterling Professor of Genetics, hasidentified genes that can make people sus-ceptible to cardiovascular disease, renal disease and osteoporosis. Ira Mellman , ph.d. , the new Sterling Professor of Cell Biology,is studying how individual cells organize theirinternal components to accomplish higher-order functions relevant to cancer and thebody's natural immunity to cancer. Flavell's laboratory is trying to understand how the immune system recognizes andresponds to infectious agents and why it sometimes attacks the body's own cells.Since 1988, Flavell has served as chair of the Section of Immunobiology at the SchoolYale President Richard C. Levin applauds after announcing the appointment of SusanHockfield, right, as provost in mid-December. In an interview, Hockfield said she is ex- cited by the opportunity to serve during \"a terrific new era for Yale\" in which the univer-sity is focusing on science and engineering,internationalism, the rebuilding of the cam-pus and, most recently, review of the YaleCollege curriculum. \"The university is more unified and the campuses really talk to oneanother,\" Hockfield said. And compared to a decade ago, a time when the physical planthad declined drastically, its buildings andgrounds are in great shape. \"Yale is now in afabulous period of renewal. Who would have guessed that a 300-year-old university couldturn as sharply and move as quickly?\" Hockfield, who joined the Yale faculty in 1985, has retained her laboratory on the third floor of Sterling Hall of Medicine whileserving as graduate school dean. She directsa program of research focusing on the devel-opment of the mammalian brain, with a special interest in the progression of braintumors, especially gliomas. She is the authorof more than 90 scientific papers and is primary author of the text Molecular Probes of the Nervous System: Selected Methods for Antibody and Nucleic Acid Probes .She hopes to continue her scientific work whileserving as provost but doesn't yet know to what extent that will be possible. Herfocus is on the work ahead.\"I have said that being graduate school dean is the best job in the university, becauseof the breadth and diversity of the academicactivities of the graduate school,\" she said.\"But the provost engages an even larger array.\" Hockfield succeeds Alison Richard, an anthropologist who has been named vice-chancellor of Cambridge University in theUnited Kingdom.

Lifton received the 2002 Basic Research Prize from the American Heart Associationfor his discovery of mutations that cause hypertension and low blood pressure, find- ings that have established the central role of the kidney in blood pressure regula- tion and allowed Lifton and colleagues toidentify new therapeutic targets. He is chairof the Department of Genetics and has been an hhmi investigator since 1994. Mellman is exploring fundamental ques- tions of membrane traffic\u2014how moleculesfind each other and their intended sites of residence inside cells. His research team has focused on two areas: identifying themolecular mechanisms responsible for direct-ing membrane components to their correctlocations in epithelial cells, neurons and lympho cytes; and determining how the immune sy stem processes antigens, agents that induce the formation of protectiveresponses to foreign invaders as well as to cancer cells.

About half the students attend- ed Ivy League colleges, yet not all cameto Yale straight from their undergradu- ate studies. Among the new students are a jet ghter pilot and a 40-year-oldgrandmother (See Long Road to Cedar Street , p. 16). Also in the group are a record-breaking equestrian, a juggler who demonstrated his skills at a lunchfor the new class, and students whoorganized programs or businesses that developed patient information soft-ware, published books and taught self- defense to women and teenage girls. The class includes students born in Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Vietnam, Cuba,Austria, China, Norway, the United Kingdom and Canada and students flu- ent in a variety of languages includingFrench, German, Yiddish, Hebrew, Chinese and Japanese. On the afternoon of August 27, these 55 women and 45 men gatheredunder a tent on Harkness Lawn for aceremony that both unites them in a calling and symbolizes their profes- sion. \"Donning a white coat marks arite of passage,\" said Charles J.Lockwood, m.d., fw '89 , the new chair of obstetrics and gynecology, andkeynote speaker at the White JacketCeremony. \" A white coat is a potent and durable symbol of medicine's richpast and exciting future.\" Tracing the history of medicine in the United States, Lockwood noted that many teaching techniques of the 19thcentury are still in vogue, as arehumanism and a reverence for life. \"What has changed is the quality and quantity of material that must betaught,\" he said, recalling his rst dayas a medical student 25 years ago. \"My dean told us that over the next four years we would double our vocabu-lary.\" He became a physician beforepersonal computers, before aids , before pet scans and before FedEx could deliver specimens overnight. \"Indeed, the structure of dna had only been discovered 25 years before. What occurred over the next 25 years is tooamazing to contemplate.\" Dean David A. Kessler, m.d., closed the ceremony by asking for a promise from the new students. \"Becoming adoctor is a privilege,\" he said. \"Inexchange for that privilege I want you to change the world.

Actively seek balance inSurgery program sails forward Last February, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education ( acgme ) threatened to withdraw approval of Yale's general surgery residency program because of its 100-hour work weeks and every-other-night call schedule. After steps were taken to reduce hours [Summer 2002, \"Surgical Residency Revamped\" p. 7], the acgme announced in October that the program would continue without interruption. \"We are very pleased, and we are moving along,\" said Director John H. Seashore, m.d.'65, hs'70, professor of pediatric surgery. The program now limits residents' work weeks to 80 hours, cuts back the num- ber of days they are on call and has added 12 physician associates and other staff to extend coverage. Seashore said residents have tradi- tionally worked long hours, often doing administrative work or patient transport, tasks that can be performed by others. The acgme 's action, he said, prodded the medical school and Yale-New Haven Hospital to address a longstanding imbalance between edu- cation and service. \"In some ways they are the ammunition that forces the institution to say 'We've got to expend the resources to fix this,'\" Seashore said.\"In two years they will revisit us and there is no question in my mind that we will get full accreditation at that time.\" The surgery program had held provi- sional status since merging with several other residency programs in 1995 and, under acgme rules, had to be consid- ered a new entity. \u2014John Curtis Physician Associate Program graduates Kristen Cushing and Christine Ho wait for the procession in Harkness Auditorium to begin. john curtisresidentsGut feeling Gastroenterologist Juanita Merchant followed her intuition to a new view of how the stomach deals with acid. By Nancy Ross-Flanigan Photographs by George Waldman Temperatures hit the 100-degree mark and just kept climb- ing on the summer day when Juanita Merchant tackledLava, the most challenging rapid on her 8-day rafting trip through the Grand Canyon in 1993. Only the occasional splash of chilly river water offered relief as her oar dippedin and out of the churning froth. But the heat was hardlyher main concern. Stroking in synchrony with her raft- mates, Merchant could only hope that they would slide into Lava at precisely the proper point and paddle at justthe right moment to avoid crashing into boulders or flip- ping over. There was no turning back, no second-guessing. It was a matter of trusting their instincts, believing thatthe river would eventually smooth out and take themwhere they wanted to go. Trusting one's instincts is as important in research as in roiling rapids, says Merchant, a 1984 graduate ofYale's m.d./ph.d. program who is now an associate profes- sor at the University of Michigan. Her recent work onstomach ulcers is a case in point. Ultimately, she and her co-workers showed last year that suppressing stomach acid with prescription drugs called proton pump inhibitorscan allow bacteria to flourish, triggering inflammation and ulcers that may lead to cancer. But before they could reach that conclusion, the scientists had to rethink almost everything they had been taught about stomach acid secretion, and to trust clinical observations andexperimental results that seemed to fly in the face of conventional wisdom. The standard textbook explanation of how acid secretion is regulated revolves around the hormone gas-trin, which is produced by specialized cells in the stomach when acid levels are low. Gastrin acts on acid-secretingcells to induce and maintain the proper level of acidity;then a feedback mechanism turns off further gastrin pro- duction and acid secretion. But this time-honored view doesn't square with what Merchant and other gastroen- terologists see in patients infected with Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium implicated in ulcers. Somehow, Helicobacter thwarts the feedback response, and the stomach just keepspumping out acid, which eventually leads to ulcers. To better understand the process, Merchant's research teamdeveloped a strain of mice that couldn't produce gastrin. The plan was to infect these mice with Helicobacter and see if they would still develop inflammation and ulcers.The researchers ran into a snag that again challenged theirassumptions: mysteriously, infecting the mice with Helico- bacter was virtually impossible, and yet the uninfected ani- mals were showing signs of inflammation, just as if theyhad bacteria in their guts. \"We could have just said, 'Well, this isn't working, so let's chuck this model and move on to something else,'\"says Merchant. \"But I knew we had technically executedthis experiment correctly, so I reasoned that the data must be telling us something. I always tell my postdocs that it's almost like there's a secret door waiting to be uncov-40 alumni faces41 ered. If you sit down and really organize your data and look at it without tunnel vision, without being bound byassumptions, you'll find a way to move through that door.\" By scrutinizing their data and carefully performing a series of experiments, the researchers figured out thatlow acid levels in the gastrin-deficient mice had allowed a variety of other bacteria to flourish in their stomachs,preventing Helicobacter from gaining a foothold. But far from protecting against the effects of Helicobacter ,these other bacteria, such as Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas , were themselves triggering inflammation. \"It seems that the stomach is almost like a rheostat, with acid levels controlling which organisms end up grow-ing there,\" says Merchant. Helicobacter thrives when acid levels are high; when levels drop, other bacteria take over. The finding that these other bacteria can stir up their share of trouble overthrows the notion that Helicobacter is the only bug behind the kind of chronic stomach inflammation that can lead to cancer. But the implications of Merchant's research don't end there. If low acid levels allow bacteria to run rampant,what does that mean for the millions of Americans who seek relief from heartburn and ulcers by gulping down acid- controlling pills every day? Merchant can't say for sure, but another set of experiments in mice suggests that long-termuse of such drugs may do more harm than good. In these experiments, Merchant and colleagues at the University of Michigan treated normal mice for two months with a pro-ton pump inhibitor, a type of drug that blocks acid secretion (Prilosec and Prevacid are examples). Sure enough, the mice developed inflammation that subsided only when the bur-geoning bacteria were controlled with antibiotics. Merchant isn't telling patients to dump their pills, but she cautions against taking high doses over years or decades. She plans to follow up the findings with studies of patients. \"Mice obviously can't tell you when something hurtsor feels better,\" says Merchant, a former Howard HughesMedical Institute investigator who sees patients on rotationas an attending physician in the U-M Health System. \"So we really need to correlate the inflammatory changes due tothese other bacteria to symptoms that patients have.\" Though she never set out to overturn the view that Helicobacter is the sole culprit in ulcers or to question the use of popular acid-reducing drugs, once the results were published\u2014in the January 2002 issues of Gastroenterology and the American Journal of Physiology/Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology\u2014 Merchant felt prepared to stand behind her conclusions. She had braced herself for criticism, but says that so far it hasn't come. In fact, in an article inthe April American Society for Microbiology News ,Martin J. Blaser ,m.d.,whose earlier work uncovered the Helicobacter - ulcer connection, agreed that getting rid of Helicobacter can allow other bacteria to colonize, with potentially harm-ful results. And in a commentary in the November 2002issue of Gastroenterology ,the journal of the American Gastroenterological Association, Richard M. Peek Jr., m.d., concurred with Merchant's hypothesis that other bacteria can induce and perpetuate the inflammation. Even if peers had been critical, Merchant probably wouldn't have wavered. Wavering just isn't in her makeup. That confidence comes in part from her scientific andmedical training, she says, but also from earlier influences.Juanita Merchant says the men- toring she received as a student inYale's m.d./ph.d. program exerted an important influence on hercareer.

His discovery, electrospray ionization ( esi), allows scientists to gauge the weight of largemolecules and determine quicklyand accurately what proteins arein a sample. John B. Fenn ,ph.d. '40, professor emeritus of chemi-cal engineering at Yale, describedhis technique in a paper inScience in 1989. Evidence of his method's significance is clear:last year alone more than 1,700scientific papers that relied on esiwere published. \"What really gave it a kick in the pants was the advent of proteomics,\" Fenn said whenreached by phone three weeks after he heard the news. \"Itturns out that esiis one of the most sensitive ways of gettingaccurate values of the mass of protein molecules. With theright instruments it has gotsuch tremendous resolutionthat you can distinguish individ-ual protein molecules eventhough they are in with a wholebunch of others in the sample.\" In its citation, the Royal Swe- dish Academy of Sciences saidFenn's work has led to \"increased understanding of the processesof life,\" quickened the pace ofdrug development and led tofaster diagnoses of cancer. Fenn received the news of the award at his home in Vir-ginia, where he is a professor ofanalytical chemistry at VirginiaCommonwealth University in Richmond. He shared the awardwith two other researchers,Koichi Tanaka, an engineer fromJapan, and Kurt W\u00fcthrich, ph.d ., of Switzerland. Tanaka workedon applications of and W\u00fcthrich usednuclear magnetic resonance todetermine protein structures. \"It's like winning the lottery,\" Fenn says. \"I'm still in shock.\" The technique he described in his 1989 paper solved a prob-lem that had bedeviled scientistssince 1912, when mass spectrom-etry was first used to analyzesmall molecules. Mass spectrom-etry worked only for moleculesthat weighed up to 1,000 timesas much as a hydrogen atom.Using esi,Fenn turned large mol- ecules into smaller ions, with-out causing them to decompose.He created charged droplets byspraying molecules with water inan electrical field. As water evap-orated from the droplets, onlyprotein ions remained. Theirmass could be determined bysetting them in motion andmeasuring how long they tookto travel a set distance. Fenn, who received his doc- torate in chemistry from Yale in1940, returned to his alma materin 1967 as a professor of chemi-cal engineering, after stints inthe chemical industry and on aU.S.Navy jet propulsion project. In 1978, with colleagues in chem-istry and medicine, he began the work that led to the develop-ment of esi. Fenn left for Virginia in 1994, after his wife's death and dis-agreements with the universityover lab space. (His daughter, Barbara Fenn Reif, retired inDecember as director of studentand alumnae affairs at theSchool of Nursing.) He's stillteaching and research,concentrating on the \"conforma- tion problem\" of proteins. \"Howthey fold and why they fold andwhat they fold to are extremelyimportant problems becausethey determine what chemicalreactions they do,\" he says. \"We are trying to pursue that.\" And, of course, his main tool is esi. \u2014John Curtis\"My mother was a teacher, and she raised my brother and me by herself,\" she explains. \"My father left when I wasin fourth grade, and seeing my mother struggle at such ayoung age made a lasting impression. She also instilled in us the importance of getting an education and not lettinganything deter us.\" That resolve, in turn, traces back toMerchant's mother's childhood on a small farm in Oklahoma, where hermother was determined to help the family get ahead. \"It was a family of 13, and everyone was expected to work on the farm,\" says Merchant, 46, who now has a daughter of her own, 3-year-old Olivia. \"I remember mymother telling me that her mother used to take her place in the field so that she could go to school.\" Determination does run deep in Merchant's lineage, but she would be the first to acknowledge that sheer will and ability aren't always enough. Sometimes you need an expert guide to show you the way, she says, again drawing parallels between whitewater rafting and negotiating thecareer challenges of a physician-scientist. \"As a novice rafter, there were times when my well- being was completely dependent on the skill of the guidecalling out orders from the rear of the raft,\" she recalls. Similarly, she would have been adrift without mentors who guided her, from her undergraduate days at Stanfordthrough her time at Yale, where she studied with RussellBarrnett, to her faculty position at Michigan. It was in Barrnett's lab that she learned \"how to think about science\" while working on membrane biogenesis in the duck saltgland. Her very first mentor as a sophomore Stanford pre-med student was Renu A. Heller, ph.d .'69, who suggested she obtain both a doctorate and a medical degree at Yale.She's also grateful to her first clinical mentor, Rosemarie L.Fisher, m.d.,fw'75, professor of medicine at Yale, who helped her stay focused on her goals and showed by exam- ple that a woman could succeed in a male-dominated sub- speciality. Now in the mentor's role, Merchant is the one atthe rear of the raft, offering guidance to her students andpostdocs. It's not enough simply to expect them to follow her lead, she believes. To make sure they're adequately equipped for their future careers, she meets with each per-son in her lab individually. \"We have little training sessions:How do you write an abstract? How do you present a 10- minute talk? How do you present an hour-long talk? How do you write a five-page grant? How do you write a 10-pagegrant? I could just hand them a stack of examples, but it's not the same as having me sit next to them explaining how to do it.\" But unlike the whitewater guide, you won't hearMerchant barking orders. \"I believe,\" she says, \"in a gentler approach to bring- ing people along.\" Nancy Ross-Flanigan is a freelance writer in Belleville, Mich., and a former science writer for the Detroit Free Press .George Waldman is a photographer based in Detroit. 42 alumni faces43 A long life, steeped in science and medicine Elizabeth R. Harrison ,m.d .'26, one of thefirst womento graduatefrom theSchool ofMedicineand pediatri-cian Haven chil-dren, celebrated her 103rd birth-day on November 2. A medical career seemed a natural choice for a young wo-man growing up with a fatherwho did research in embryology.\"I was just immersed in all this,\"Harrison says of medicine, duringan interview at the Whitney Cen-ter in Hamden, Conn., where she lives. She was the daughterof Yale zoologist Ross GranvilleHarrison, m.d., ph.d. ,known for developing an early method forgrowing animal cells in vitro in the early 1900s. Having beenexposed to her father's work, Harrison had no qualms aboutperforming her first human dis-section in medical school. \" All youdid was take a scalpel and movethe muscle and isolate it andreport it on the chart. There wasn't anything to be squeamish about,\" she recalls. \"My fatherhad taken us tadpole hunting andwe'd worked with live animals,so I didn't think anything of it.\" Harrison was born in Baltimore in 1899. Her German-born mother spoke five lan-guages, and Elizabeth Harrisongrew up speaking German andEnglish. According to hernephew, Ross Granville HarrisonIII,Harrison was visiting Germany on the eve of World War I andfound herself trapped there by war for three years. She returned to New Haven to graduate fromHillhouse High School, began college at Smith, then transferred to the University of Chicago. When asked if she faced prejudice as a woman in medi-cine, Harrison says that whateverproblems she encountered, shekept to herself. \"If I had shot myA Yale connection to Thailand\u2014and the King of Siam When Kanya Suphapeetiporn , m.d., ph.d. '02,finishes her pediatrics residency in Brooklyn and headshome to herfaculty posi- tion in Thailand, she hopes tosend some of her best studentsback to Yale for educationalexchanges. If they do come, it will be nothing new: the linkbetween Yale and ChulalongkornUniversity, where Suphapeetipornis both alumna and junior pro-fessor, has a long history. It began 20 miles from New Haven, more than 30 years ago.In the late 1960s, Nicholas P .R.Spinelli, m.d. '44 ,served as a mentor to a young doctor fromThailand doing an internship atBridgeport Hospital, a Yale-affiliated hospital where Spinelliwas director of medical educa- tion. That man, obstetricianSupawat Chutivongse, m.d. ,w e n t on to become dean of Chulalong-korn's medical school in Bangkok. Since then, he and Spinelli haveworked together to bring a dozenof the school's strongest gradu-ates to Yale to hone their skills. Spinelli helped Suphapeeti- porn apply to Yale's doctoral program in the Department ofGenetics, where she did researchin cancer genetics. Suphapeeti-porn plans to set up a basicresearch lab when she gets back to \"Chula,\" the university namedin 1917 after the beloved ThaiKing Chulalongkorn, King RamaV.(His father, King Rama IV, was portrayed by Yul Brynner in The King and I .) Spinelli met Supha- peetiporn at the airport whenshe arrived in 1996, invited herto his home, attended her thesispresentation and watched hergraduate last May. Suphapeeti-porn enjoyed listening to Spinelli'sstories from a career in medicinethat included private practice as an internist, overseeing theBridgeport residency programand directing alumni affairs for the School of Medicine. Reached by telephone after a long night on call at the StateUniversity of New York MedicalCenter in Brooklyn, Suphapeeti- porn says that Spinelli's dedica-tion to former students is exem-plified by the fact that he's keptin touch with her dean at Chulafor more than 30 years. \"I am so impressed that they still keepin touch,\" she says. While at Yale, Suphapeeti- porn spent most of her time inthe lab and the library, but shealso enjoyed New Haven's first-rate pizza and New England's hiking trails. Two years ago,Yale's community of Thai stu- dents, numbering about a dozen,gained a new member: a col-league of Suphapeetiporn's fromChula, Atapol Sughondhabirom, m.d. He is doing a postdoctoral fellowship in psychiatry, studying the genetics of drug addiction.Sughondhabirom and his advi-sors have a grant to train Thai students in the genetics of psychiatric disorders, furtherstrengthening the connectionbetween Yale and Chula. Spinelli says he is impressed that every Thai student he hasknown has returned to Thai-land. Planning to follow suit,Suphapeetiporn is eager to gethome. \"I do something Harrison's father, Ross Granville Harrison, chaired Yale's zoologydepartment in the early 1900s.mouth off, I never would have gotten anywhere. I was very reti-cent about my experiences.\"Her nephew says Harrison hasspoken obliquely of feeling ostra-cized or passed over during medi-cal school and in her early yearsin practice, but \"as she would say, she doesn't like to be a crab.\" Harrison lived above her Bradley Street office. Never mar-ried, she maintained a very busypractice. \"She was a spectaculardiagnostician,\" her nephew says.\"She would take one look at akid and tell you what was wrongwith him. She had instincts thatwere bigger than life.\" He says Harrison still saw patients into her 90s. When hetook her to celebrate her 102ndbirthday with a dinner at Mory's,she was not just visiting a Yalelandmark but also returning to her childhood home; what isnow Mory's was faculty hous-ing when her father was namedchair of Yale's zoology depart-ment, her nephew said, and the family lived there from 1907to 1911. Harrison still very muchenjoys music (although sheclaims she \"flunked\" piano). Shehummed along when a group of Whiffenpoof alumni sang atthe Whitney Center last fall. \u2014Cathy Shufro We are sorry to report that Dr. Harrison died on January 5,as this issue of Yale Medicine was going to press.

Since then, the disease has spread to 45 states, been diagnosed in 3,500 people and claimed 200 lives. As the virus has moved from anomaly to epidemic, Fish and his colleagues in the vector biology program have remained on the case. Now a grant to Fish will allow Yale to strengthen the nation's response to vector-borne diseases like West Nile.With $1.3 million from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the School of Public Health will join two other Yale schools in training six doctoral candidates in a \"whole- organism\" approach to vector-borne diseases\u2014which includes the field study of insects and other arthropods that carry disease. The grant will also fund summer fieldwork for 20 students in epidemiology and public health. Fish said the grant would help redress an imbalance in research into vector-borne diseases. \"In recent decades, it has been very much lopsided toward the laboratory,\" he said. Research has focused on developing vaccines, which have proven either unattainable (in the case of malaria, for exam- ple) or impractical (\"Who are they going to vaccinate against West Nile?\" Fish asks. \"The whole country?\"). The whole- organism approach complements lab research, allowing scien- tists to understand \"the entire living organism in its environ- ment. These things happen outdoors, in the fields, in the woods.\" Fish said vector-borne diseases are proliferating because of environmental change, such as the reforestation that has benefited the ticks that carry Lyme disease; and because of increased international trade and travel, which introducesexotic organisms like the mosquitoes carrying West Nile. Those mosquitoes, or that mosquito, Fish theorizes, arrived inNew York City on a jet. The possibility of bioterrorism poses anew threat. \"West Nile is a scary example of what would hap-pen if somebody wanted to introduce something,\" Fish said. \u2014Cathy Shufroyale medicine winter 200348 follow- up archives fall/winter 1971 \"The present first year medical class is the largest in the school'shistory\u2014102 students.
