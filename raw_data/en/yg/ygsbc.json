Because the term Flower Essence is similar to the term [Essential Oil](what-are-essential-oils-definition-guide.php), people sometimes get the terms confused. For this reason, I'll briefly introduce and describe Flower Essences within this article. Bach Flower Essences, also known as Flower Remedies, are a liquid homeopathic treatment that is most commonly taken internally. Flower Essences are not aromatic and are not used within the scope of holistic aromatherapy. Flower essences are not the same as essential oils and are not used directly within the scope of holistic aromatherapy. Though Bach Flower Essences aren't used directly within the field of [holistic aromatherapy](what-is-aromatherapy-definition-guide.php), it is not uncommon for individuals to utilize both essentials oils and flower essences as a part of their holistic lifestyle. In the early part of the 20th century, an English homeopath named Edward Bach began to explore the concept that that the natural energy and signature vibrations found in particular botanicals could be captured and utilized to help improve particular emotional states. He found 38 particular botanicals to be the most beneficial. Each flower essence is intended to help remedy a particular negative emotional state. A flower essence is created by adding the petals of a particular botanical to spring water. The mixture is then either allowed to bask in the sun for several hours or is boiled. The choice of method is dependent on the particular botanical and the preparer. The resulting essence is further diluted down with additional spring water. Alcohol, usually brandy, is then added to preserve the essence and to further dilute it. Bach Flower Essences are considered a homeopathic treatment, but a couple differences exist. Typical homeopathic remedies are generally created by taking a \"toxic\" substance and diluting it down significantly until only the most minuscule trace of the original substance remains. The concept is that \"let like cure like.\" Bach Flower Essences, on the other hand, are created by using non-toxic flowers with the belief amongst practitioners that the soul of the plant and its healing vibrations are imparted into the final essence. Another difference between traditional homeopathic remedies and Bach Flower Essences is that with homeopathic remedies, some substances (i.e. mint products) are considered antidotes to the homeopathic remedy and cannot be taken simultaneously with the remedy. Although I'm not aware of any scientific studies that verify the effectiveness of Bach Flower Essences, countless people swear by their effectiveness. Traditional Bach Flower Remedies The list below displays the 38 flowers that comprise the traditional Bach Flower Remedies.
