Although many think of lavender as something used topically when taken orally, lavender can have deeper calming and sedative effects. Gotu Kola Gotu Kola or Centella asiatica has a reputation as one of the best herbs for the brain. Studies have shown that Gotu Kola enhances neurite-dendrite growth and out branching in the brain. It has been used in Ayurvedic medicines for thousands of years to soothe mental turbulence. Rhodiola Root Rhodiola Root or Rhodiola rosea grows at high altitudes in cold regions of Europe and Asia. It has traditionally been used as a way to treat weakness, stamina and work performance. More recently it has been used to help with anxiety, depression and stress. Saffron Stamens Saffron or Crocus Sativus is the most expensive herb in the world and with good reason. Each Saffron flower yields just 3 stamens. To produce 1 gram of saffron requires almost 150 flowers. This powerful flower is well known as a flavor enhancer and seasoning for food but it has also been used in Folk and Ayurvedic medicine as a sedative, expectorant, anti-asthma and adaptogen. Recent studies have also shown that Saffron is just as effective as some SSRI's in treating mild to moderate depression BANISTERIOPSIS CAAPI Banisteriopsis caapi is best known as the primary ingredient of the amazonian psychedelic tea Ayahuasca. On its own the banisteriopsis caapi vine has been used as a medicine by Amazonian peoples for centuries. It has been shown to help those with depression, anxiety, and may also help with neurodegenerative diseases. Lilac Petals Lilac has been used in traditional medicine to treat fever, reduce stress and anxiety and also to stop the recurrence of disease.
