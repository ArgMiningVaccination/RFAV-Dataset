The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) preferentially recommends any of the following three flu vaccines for these individuals: Fluzone High- Dose Quadrivalent, Flublok Quadrivalent and Fluad Quadrivalent . Also order sufficient supplies of standard dose vaccine for residents and staff members under 65 years of age. Maintaining high rates of seasonal influenza vaccine coverage among residents and staff members in long- term care facilities is the best strategy for preventing cases and outbreaks of influenza. Reputable sources noted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that: 1. High dose vaccine produces a stronger immune response (i.e., higher antibody levels) among person 65 years or older.1 2. High dose vaccine was 24.2% more effective in preventing influenza infection in adults 65 years of age and older compared to standard dose vaccine.1 3. High dose vaccine can reduce the number of hospital admissions for people aged 65 years or older, especially those living in long -term care faciliti es.2 Also, please note that ALL vaccines for the 2022 -23 season will be quadrivalent.3 The components are influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), influenza B/ Austria lineage, and influenza B/Yamagata lineage.
