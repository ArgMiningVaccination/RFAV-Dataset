Customer Reviews Officially a believer! I'll freely admit that I am not a very spiritual person and had some serious doubts about buying something I would consider a little \"hippy dippy\". But my husband and I had been trying unsuccessfully for a while to have a baby and I found this store - originally on etsy. I tried to have an open mind and program the crystals according to the instructions. Got pregnant that same cycle!!! I never took it off for my entire (healthy) pregnancy and actually felt a little sad when I took it off at the hospital for my delivery. I've kept it safe for the next time I'm trying for a baby! I recently purchased for my sister in law who has been trying to get pregnant as well and am hopeful that her bracelet will bring her the luck that mine brought me! Hers and mine both had rose quartz, moonstone, and a light green stone that I'm blanking on the name of. Like I said - I really was a skeptic but hey it worked for me! Crystals for the win I'm officially a believer!! -Kelsey C Always spectacular! Jen never stops amazing me with her delicate and beautiful pieces. This delicate bracelet was bought as a gift and the new mother couldn't be happier. She loved the colors of the stones and told me that just looking at it made her serene. Thank you Jan for making these lovely healing treasures.-Carmen Simply beautiful! This bracelet was a gift for my son who does not like to wear jewelry. However, he completely changed his mind when he saw the bracelet. He liked the all black look, the smoothness and luster of the stones and the fact that it looked elegant in its simplicity. The best part was when he read the meaning and use of each stone. He was so pleased and happy with his gift.", "sitename": "Spiritual Diva Jewelry", "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Spiritual Diva Jewelry Spiritual Diva offers healing crystal jewelry hand made by a certified Reiki practitioner that promotes health and well-being.
