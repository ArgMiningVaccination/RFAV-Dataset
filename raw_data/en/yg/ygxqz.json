Project Overview On April 2, 2008, Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley (\"SMCCV\" or \"Project Sponsor\"), an affiliate of Sutter Health, submitted a developmen t application to Alameda County for the Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Ho spital Project (\"SMCCV Project\" or \"Proposed Project\") in the unincorporated Castro Valley Area of Alameda County, California. The SMCCV Project proposes to develop a new general acute care hospital, totaling approximately 230,000 square feet (sq.ft.) and containing approxima tely 130 licensed beds (\"New Hospital\") on the existing Eden Medical Center Campus. The New Hospital will replace the existing Eden Medical Center Hospital (\"Existing Hospital\"), which does not meet current earthquake-resistant standards for hospitals as mandated by State law. SMCCV proposes development of the New Hospital in accordance with the Alquist Hospital Facilities Se ismic Safety Act of 1983 (\"Alquist Act\") as amended by California State Senate Bill 1953 (SB 1953), which requires the replacement or seismic retrofit of existing acute care facilities that do not meet current earthquake resistant standards for hospitals prior to the compliance date of January 1, 2013. The SMCCV Project will ensure that medical services will continue to be provided by a licensed acute care hospital on the Eden Medical Center Campus without disr uption during construction and thereafter. The SMCCV Project also proposes construction of a new, four-story approximately 80,000 sq.ft. Medical Office Building (MOB), which will be c onnected directly to the hospital on all four levels and include approximately 20,000 sq.ft of essential hospital administrative services, urgent care, ambulatory surgery center and medical offices; demolition of the existing Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital, the Pine Cone Apartmen t complex and existing MOBs; relocation of an existing helistop; and other improvements and ch anges to the Project Site to accommodate the Proposed Project. The Proposed Project would establish a Planned Development district for the Project Site, and include related amendments to the Castro Valley Plan and Castro Valley Central Business District Specific Plan . A merger and resubdivision of the existing parcels as well as a correction of street frontage boundaries is also proposed. The SMCCV Project Site is 18.97 acres at 20103 La ke Chabot Road, bounded generally by Lake Chabot Road to the east, Renton Way and Congress Way to the south, Stanton Avenue to the west, and Somerset Avenue to the north, as delineated in Figure III-1 in the Chapter III, Project Description, of this document. I. Introduction Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project I-2 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 B. Environmental Review Initiating the Environmental Review Process Subsequent to receiving and reviewing SMCCV's development application, the Alameda County Community Development Agency (ACCDA), the L ead Agency for the SMCCV Project (pursuant to State and local guidelines for implementing the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Section 21000, et seq. and the State CEQA Guidelines [California Code of Regulations Section 15000, et seq.] promulgated thereunder together as \"CEQA\"), determined that the Proposed Project was subject to CEQA \") . ACCDA decided at the outset to prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Proposed Project. Initial Study and EIR Scoping Pursuant to CEQA Section 15063, ACCDA first Study\") to evaluate prelimin arily whether the SMCCV Project would have a significant effect on the environment and to focus the EIR on topics that may have significant impacts or that require additional investigation and analysis prior to making an impact determination. On May 5, 2008, ACCDA issued a Notice of Preparation (NOP) for 30 calendar days to announce its intent to prepare and distribute an EIR for the SMCCV Project. The NOP was distributed to governmental agencies, organiza tions, and persons interested in the Proposed Project. ACCDA sent the NOP accompanied by an Initial Study to agencies with statutory responsibilities in connection with the Proposed Pr oject with the request for their input on the scope and content of the environmental informa tion that should be addressed in the EIR. The Alameda County Planning Commission also held a Scoping Meeting on June 2, 2008 to take oral comments in response to the NOP and Initial Study. No spoken or written comments were received during the Scoping Meeting. The NOP and written comments that ACCDA received in response to the NOP are included as Appendix A to this Draft EIR. This Draft EIR addresses environmental topics identified in the Initial Study as those that could result in a potentially significant impact with the Proposed Project. The following topics are not addressed in this EIR because the analysis in th e Initial Study provided substantial evidence to conclude that the project's effect on those topics would be less than significant: Agricultural Resources, Air Quality (Odors), Biological Resources (Riparian Habitat, Wetlands, Tree Policy/Ordinance, Habitat Conservation Plan), Geological Resources (Alternative Wastewater Disposal), Land Use (Divide and Existing Comm unity, Habitat Conservation Plan), Mineral Resources, Public Services (Schools, Parks, Libraries), Recreation, Utilities and Service Systems (Solid Waste). This Draft EIR also considers comments received in response to the NOP that are relevant to environmental issues under CEQA. I. Introduction Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project I-3 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Public Review This Draft EIR is available for a minimum 45-cal endar-day public review and comment period, as identified on the notice accompanying this documen t. During this time, written comments on the Draft EIR may be submitted to ACCDA at the address indicated on the notice. Oral comments may be submitted at the public hearing on the Draf t EIR, which shall be held as identified on the notice. Following the public review and comment period for the Draft EIR, ACCDA will prepare responses that address all substantive written and oral comments on the Draft EIR's environmental analysis received within the speci fied review period. The responses and any other revisions to the Draft EIR will be prepared as a Responses to Comments document. The Draft EIR and its Appendices, together with the R esponse to Comments document will constitute a Final EIR (commonly referred to collectively as \"EIR\") for the Proposed Project. Use of this EIR Pursuant to CEQA, this EIR is a public inform ation document prepared for use by governmental agencies and the public to identify and evaluate potential environmental consequences of the Proposed Project, to evaluate and recommend mitigation measures that would substantially lessen or eliminate significant environmental adverse impacts, and to examine a range of feasible alternatives to the Proposed Project. The informati on contained in this Draft EIR is subject to review and consideration by Alameda County, the Castro Valley Municipal Advisory Council, the Alameda County Planning Commission and the Alameda County Board of Supervisors (see Project Review and Approval, below), and any responsible agencies prior to the County's decision to approve, reject or modify the Proposed Project. C. Project Review and Approval The Alameda County Board of Supervisors must ultimately certify that it has reviewed and considered the information in the EIR and that th e EIR has been completed in conformity with the requirements of CEQA. The Board must make th is determination before any decision can be made regarding the SMCCV Project, except that the Alameda County Planning Commission may certify the EIR first if it is acting first on the subdivision map proposed for the Project. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15091, no public agency shall approve or carry out a project for which an EIR has been certified which identifies one or more significant effects of the project, unless the public agency makes one or more of the following findings: (1) Changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated into, the project which avoid or substantially lessen the significant environm ental effect as identified in the Final EIR. (2) Such changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency and not the agency making the finding. Such changes have been adopted by such other agency or can and should be adopted by such agency. I. Introduction Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project I-4 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 (3) Specified economic, legal, social, technol ogical, or other considerations, including provisions of employment opportunities for highly trained workers, make infeasible the mitigation measures or project alternatives identified in the Final EIR. D. Organization of the Draft EIR Following this Chapter I, Introduction , this Draft EIR is organized as follows: Chapter II, Summary , contains a brief summary of the Proposed Project and allows the reader to easily reference the analysis presented in the Draft EIR. Table II-1 , Summary of Impacts, Mitigation Measures, and Residual Impacts, is provided at the end of Chapter II as a reader-friendly reference to each of the environmental effects, proposed mitigation measures and residual environmental impacts after mitigation is implemented, presented by environmental topic.

Introduction Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project I-5 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures, and re ference documents are available for review by the public at the Alameda County Planning Department Offices, located at 224 W. Winton Avenue, Room 111, Hayward, California, 94544. Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project II-1 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 CHAPTER II Summary A. Project Overview Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley (\"SMCCV\" or \"Project Sponsor\"), an affiliate of Sutter Health, proposes to develop the Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project (\"SMCCV Project\" or \"Proposed Project\"). The SMCCV Project is undertaken in accordance with the Alquist Act and SB 1953, whic h requires the replacement or seismic retrofit of existing acute care facilities prior to th e compliance date of January 1, 2013. Site Location The SMCCV Project Site is 18.97 acres (generally the existing Eden Medical Center Campus) in the unincorporated Castro Valley Area of Alameda County, California. The Project Site is bound by Lake Chabot Road to the east, Renton Way and Congress Way to the south, Stanton Avenue to the west, and Somerset Avenue to the north, with residential, commercial and medical uses neighboring the Project Site immediately north and south within this block. Key Components of the Project and Phasing The Proposed Project will ensure that medical servi ces will continue to be provided by a licensed acute care hospital on the existing Eden Medical Center Campus in Castro Valley without disruption during construction and thereafter. Th e following sequence of activity is proposed to occur on the Project Site over a continuous peri od of approximately 4.5 years, starting in mid- 2009 with planned completion by the end of 2013: Demolish 20,000 square feet of Existing Medical Office Buildings (MOBs) Demolish an Existing 42-unit Apartmen t Complex (Pine Cone Apartments) Relocate an existing helistop (approximately 1 50 feet) within the Eden Medical Center Construct a 230,000 square-foot, 6 to 7 st ory modern, efficient acute care hospital containing approximately 130 licensed beds with private, single-patient rooms, including the following key components: inpatient care, diagnostic treatment functions, emergency department with trauma services, a universal care unit and ancillary support services (\"New Hospital\") Simultaneously construct an 80,000-square-f oot, four-story Medical Office Building adjacent to and connected at each level to the New Hospital (via a covered, open-air bridge between the building at above-ground levels) (\"MOB\") II. Summary Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project II-2 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Demolish the six-story, 235,500 square-foot Eden Medical Center Hospital containing approximately 178 licensed beds and which does not meet current earthquake-resistant standards for hospitals as mandated by State law. (\"Existing Hospital\") Demolish the existing one story 29,000 square -foot Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital containing approximately 31 licensed beds Develop/redevelop new surface parking, campus circulation, and other site improvements (landscaping, stormwater drainage improveme nts, \"green\" sound walls/\"living walls,\" etc.) at the Project Site to accommodate the Proposed Project. A development phasing scenario in which the MO B would be developed after completion of the New Hospital (instead of concurrent, as the Proposed Project plans), would require up to six years, and is evaluated in this EIR. A scenar io that would demolish the existing Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital at an earlier phase than th e Proposed Project plans is also considered. Amendments to the General Pla n, Specific Plan, and Zoning Ordinance The Proposed Project also entails amendments to the Castro Valley Plan and the Castro Valley Central Business District Specific Plan primarily to (1) expand the existing land use designation and boundaries to include the entire Project Site, and (2) to modify policy and goal language to support the proposed hospital and related land uses within the Project Site. The Project Sponsor also proposes that the County establish a Planned Development zoning district and adopt a land use and development plan for the Proposed Pr oject, which would establish the development standards and controls for the Project Site (inc luding architectural design review and approval). B. Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures All impacts and mitigation measures identified in this EIR are summarized in Table II-1 at the end of this chapter. Included in the table ar e potential impacts, recommended mitigation measures and the level of significance of the impact after any recommended mitigation measures are implemented. The project will result in signifi cant and unavoidable impacts associated with (1) traffic intersection operations in 2035, (2) construction noise and vibration annoyance impacts due to the proposed duration of construction activities and close proximity of residences to the construction areas on the Project Site, (3) operational noise from loading dock activities that would be perceived by nearby residences, and (4) nighttime helicopter overflight noise levels that would be perceived by nearby residences. C. Alternatives Chapter V presents a detailed analysis of a ra nge of reasonable alternatives to the Proposed Project. The alternatives to the Project that ar e analyzed in detail in this Draft EIR are: No Project 1: Demolish Existing Hospital s and Build New Non-Acute Care Buildings - The Existing Hospital and Laurel Grove Reha bilitation Hospital would be demolished. One II. Summary Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project II-3 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 or more new buildings would be construc ted on the Existing Hospital location for non- acute care uses (e.g., clinic, medical offices, etc.). No Project 2: De-License/Remodel Existing Hospital for Non-Acute Care Adaptive Reuse - The Existing Hospital would be de-licensed as an acute care facility and remodeled for non-acute care uses. Reduced Project Alternative - All components of the Proposed Project would be developed, except that the 80,000 sq.ft. Ne w MOB would be reduced to a 20,000 sq.ft. New MOB. Reconfigured Hospital Alternative - All components of the Proposed Project would be developed, except the New Hospital would be r econfigured to be elongated on to the east side, and the tower would be reduced from four stories to three stories. East Site Alternative - All components of the Proposed Project would be developed. The New Hospital would be located at the easternm ost edge of the site, fronting Lake Chabot Road, and would be approximately two levels taller than the New Hospital in the Proposed Project. Environmentally Superior Alternative The East Site Alternative is considered environm entally superior. It woul d avoid or substantially reduce impacts identified with the Proposed Project and each of the other Alternatives, but would not fully meet most of the basic Project Objectives. Specifically, the Alternative would avoid the significant and unavoidable loading dock noise impact, reduce the significant and unavoidable construction noise and vibration annoyance impact, and would substantially reduce other poten tial impacts to residential uses that would occur during construction (air quality) and after th e project is completed (shadow, helistop noise, and mechanical yard/HVAC noise). However, comp ared to the Proposed Project and the other Alternatives, the East Site Alternative would increase the number of peak-hour vehicle trips on Stanton Avenue, increase the potential for site access and circulation site effects by locating service area / loading dock driveway on Lake Chabot Road, and increase the potential for vehicle/pedestrian conflicts durin g construction. Overall, the Alternative would not result in an increased impact category (i.e., less-than-significan t to significant or less-than-significant with mitigation). Basic Project Objectives that the East Site Alte rnative would not fully meet are: simultaneous construction of the New Hospital and New MOB; direct emergency vehicle and public access to the Emergency Department; optimal departmental adjacencies; utilizing existing site topography to minimize grading; separating emergency trans port, service vehicles, staff vehicles, and routine non-emergency patient/visitor access and traffi c flows; and construction that does not substantially interfere with existing campus operations. The Project Sponsor has also identified operati onal issues with the East Site Alternative, including the difficulty and disr uption associated with the relocation of referring physicians from the medical buildings that would be removed a nd limitations that the hillside building site poses II. Summary Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project II-4 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 to ensuring an efficient and functional Hospital layout that meets light access requirements within the programmed number of building stories. D. Areas of Controversy CEQA Guidelines Section 15123 specifies that the EIR summary shall identify \"areas of controversy\" known to the Lead Agency, includi ng issues raised by agencies and the public, and issues to be resolved, including the choice among alternatives and whether or how to mitigate the significant effects. No areas of controversy are known to the County. The following issues were raised by nearby residents during preparation of th is EIR, and have been addressed in the analysis in Chapter IV: Helistop noise levels perceived by adjacent r esidences north of the Project Site after relocation of the helistop; Potential noise that may be perceived by adj acent residences north of the Project Site, from the new surface parking lot on the demolished Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital site.

Land Use, Plans and Policies Impact LU-1: The Proposed Project, including the proposed amendment to the General Plan and Specific Plan, and to the Zoning Ordinance for Planned Deve lopment District (PD) Zoning, would not conflict wi th adopted applicable land use plans and policies. (Less than Significant) None Required Impact LU-2: The Proposed Project, combined with past, present and reasonably foreseeable future projects, would not result in a significant cumulati ve impact to land use, plans and policies impact. (Less than Significant) None Required B. Aesthetics Impact AES-1: The Proposed Project would not adversely affect a scenic vista or subst antially damage scenic resources. (Less than Significant) None Required Impact AES-2: The Proposed Project would change, but not substantially degrade, the existing visual character or quality of the Project Site and its surroundings upon completion. (Less than Significant) None Required Impact AES-3: The Proposed Project would temporarily reduce the existing visual charac ter or quality of large areas within the Project Site visibl e to adjacent residential uses. (Potentially Significant) Mitigation Measure AES-3 - Construction Period Visual Improvements Plan. The Proj ect Sponsor shall develop and implement a Construction Peri od Visual Improvements Plan (Plan) that would make visual improvements to construction zones within a given constr uction phase and between phases if the zone is not scheduled for co nstruction activity and would remain unused for a period of greater than six (6) months. Alameda County shall define the c onstruction zones subject to this mitigation measure and shall c onsider the size of the area, the nature of the construction ac tivity, and the proximity or visibility of the area to the public vantage points or residential uses. The Plan shall be implemented by the project contractor(s) and must be approved by Alameda County. The intent of the Plan is to aesthetically improve portions of the Project Site that would remain unimproved for an extended period and screen the construction zone from view by passersby along the public streets and sidewalks, or to make the zone usable for hospital employees, patients, and the public. Possible improvements in the Plan include, but are not limited to, the following: Less than Significant II. Summary Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project II-6 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 TABLE II-1 (continued) SUMMARY OF IMPACTS, MITIGATION MEASURES AND RESIDUAL IMPACTS Environmental Impact Mitigation Measures Level of Significance after Mitigation B. Aesthetics (cont.) Impact AES-3 (cont.) 1) The Project Sponsor shall clear a construction zone of construction debris and remo ve construction equipment whenever construction is not anticipated for at least two weeks. 2) If a site is a construction z one, but no construc tion activities are scheduled for more than one month, the Project Sponsor shall be responsible for regular garbage removal and watering of any existing landscaping. 3) The Project Sponsor shall remove or visually treat fencing around construction zones that front onto Stanton Avenue, and the northern and southern property line, in a manner deemed acceptable by Alameda County, to promote safety. 4) The Project Sponsor shall install all landscaping as early as possible to decrease visual impacts of construction, however the timing of installation shall be determined in accordance with the overa ll construction schedule to ensure landscaping is not damaged or removed due to ongoing subsequent construc tion phase activities. Impact AES-4 : The Proposed Project could increase reflective surfaces at the Project Site, and therefore potentially increase glare affecting nearby residences and motorists. (Potentially Significant) Mitigation Measure AES-4 - Treat Reflective Surfaces. The Project Sponsor shall ensure applicat ion of low-emissivity coating on exterior glass surfaces of all new structures to reduce visible light reflection on the exterior su rface and prevent interior light from emitting brightly through the glass exterior. Less than Significant Impact AES-5 : The Proposed Project would change existing shadow effects but would not substantially degrade the existing visual character or qualit y of the site or its surrounding uses or reduce adequate sunlight to residential uses.

Transportation, Circulation and Parking Impact TRANS-1: The LOS F conditions at the unsignalized intersection of Castro Valley B oulevard /Wisteria Street (#15) calculated for the PM peak hour under existing baseline conditions, would worsen with t he addition of traffic generated by the Proposed Project. The Project-generated increases would add 15 PM peak hour vehicl es to the intersection. (Significant) Mitigation Measure TRANS-1: The Project Sponsor shall install traffic signals at the unsignalized Castro Valley Boulevard / Wisteria Street intersection. The signals shall have actuated controls. Installation of traffic signals shall include traffic signal equipment with optimized si gnal phasing and timing (i.e., allocation of green time for each intersection approach), and coordination with signal phasing and timing of adjacent signalized intersections. Traffic signal equi pment shall include pedestrian signal heads (with adequate time for pedestrians to cross the streets). Signal installation shall meet County design standards and be subject to the review and approval of the County. The County intends to signalize the Castro Valley Boulevard/Wisteria Avenue intersecti on. The signal is likely to be installed within the next two years and would be funded with County traffic fees. The AM and PM peak hour traffic volume project contributions at this in tersection are 10 and 15 vehicles respectively. Less than Significant Impact TRANS-2a : Intersection Impact - The Proposed Project would add traffic to st udy intersections during the AM and PM peak hours and would increase average vehicle delay at most of the intersections. Three of the signalized study intersections would operate at LOS E, below the acceptable LOS D threshold, without and with Project traffic, however, the added vehicle delay caused by th e Proposed Project would not trigger a significant impac t. (Less than Significant) None Required Impact TRANS-2b: Freeway Merge / Diverge Impact - The Propose Project would add traffic to the freeway merge and diverge locations during the AM and PM peak hours. While one location is expected to operate at an unacceptable LOS F condition, the Project's traffi c does not change the calculated density. With no change in calculated density, the added vehicles from the Proposed Pr oject would not trigger a significant impact. (Less than Significant) None Required Impact TRANS-3: Traffic generated by the Proposed Project would affect traffic levels of serv ice at local intersections in the project vicinity in 2035.

Transportation, Circulation and Parking (cont.) Impact TRANS-3a: The signalized intersection of Castro Valley Boulevard/Strobridge Avenue/Stanton Avenue (#8) would operate at LOS F under 2035 No Project conditions. The intersection would continue to operate at LOS F with the addition of Proposed Project tr affic and the Project traffic would increase the westbound approach delay by more than four seconds during the AM peak hour. (Significant) Mitigation Measure TRANS-3a: The Project Sponsor shall pay the County's traffic impact fee in accordance with the County's normal procedure for payment of impact fees, for circulation improvements that would fully improve traffic flow operations at the Castro Valley Boulevard/Strobridge Avenue/Stanton Avenue intersection to less-than-significant levels. No feasible mitigation measures are currently available, however the County is currently studying alternatives to address traffic flow on Strobridge Avenue, south of Castro Valley Boulevard and anticipates selection of a preferred alternative in approximately March 2009. If prior to the County's approval of the Proposed Project the County identifies any circulation improvements that would improve traffic flow through this area to acceptable levels, the Project Sponsor shall pay its fair share contribution to the improvements in accordance with the County's normal procedure for payment of impact fees and prio r to the issuance of the first building permit for New Hospital. Significant and Unavoidable Because the County has no existing plan, program, or design to mitigate this impact, implementation of an improvement is uncertain, and therefore the impact is considered significant and unmitigated. Also, if the improvements affect the operation of ramps to and/or from Interstate 580, the improvement will require both Caltrans and Federal Highway Admi nistration approval and the impact would also therefore be considered to remain significant and unavoidable. Impact TRANS-3b : The signalized intersection of Castro Valley Boulevard/Lake Chabot Road (#9) would operate at LOS F during the AM peak hour under 2035 No Project conditions. The intersection woul d continue to operate at LOS F during the AM peak hour and LOS E during the PM peak hour with the addition of Project traffic. This is a significant impact because the Proposed Project would increase the total intersection average delay by more than two seconds during the AM peak hour. (Significant) Mitigation Measure TRANS-3b: Re-stripe the existing southbound approach shared through- left turn lane to be a shared through-right turn lane. Re-stripe the existing northbound approach shared through- left-right turn lane to be a shared through-right turn lane. Optimize traffic signal timings to allow for protected left-turn phasing. Optimization of tra ffic signal timing shall include determination of allocation of green time for each intersection approach in tune with the relative traffic volumes on those approaches, a nd coordination with signal phasing and timing of adjac ent intersections.

Transportation, Circulation and Parking (cont.) Impact TRANS-3c: The westbound approach Strobridge Avenue/I-580 westbound off-ramp (#10) would operate at LOS F during the AM peak hour and LOS E during the PM peak hour under 2035 No Project conditions. T he westbound approach would continue to operate at LOS E and F conditions respectively, with the addition of Proposed Project traffic. This is a significant impact because the inte rsection would operate at an unacceptable level, the project would add ten or more project trips to the intersection peak hour flow, and the intersection would meet the peak hour signal warrant (Warrant 3) without and with the project. (Significant) Mitigation Measure TRANS-3c: Install a traffic signal at the unsignalized Strobridge Avenue/I-580 westbound off-Ramp. Installation of traffic signals shall include the traffic signal equipment with optimized signal phasing and timi ng (i.e., allocation of green time for each intersection appr oach), and coordination with signal phasing and timing of adjacent signalized intersections. Signal installati on shall meet Caltrans design standards and be subject to the review and approval of Caltrans and the County. In addition to the signal, re-stripe the westbound left-turn lane to be a shared left-right-turn lane.

Significant and Unavoidable After implementation of these measures, the intersection would operate at an acceptable LOS B in the AM and PM peak hours. The traffic signal addition to the freeway ramp signal requires Caltrans approval and thus its implementation is not certain and the impact is therefore considered to remain significant and unavoidable. Impact TRANS-3d : The signalized intersection of Strobridge Avenue/I-580 EB Ramps/Gary Drive (#11) would operate at LOS E during the AM and PM peak hours under 2035 Without Project conditions. The intersec tion would continue to operate at LOS E with the addition of Projec t traffic. This is a significant impact because the Proposed Project would increase the total intersection average delay by mo re then four seconds during the PM peak hour. (Significant) Mitigation Measure TRANS-3d: Optimize traffic signal ti mings and change cycle length to 120 seconds during the AM and PM peak hour for the Strobridge Avenue/I-580 EB Ramps/Gary Drive intersection. Optimization of traffic signal timing shall include determination of green time a llocation for each intersection approach relative to the approach traffic volumes.

The Project Sponsor shall develop a construction management plan for review and approval by the County. The plan shall include at least the following items and requirements: A set of comprehensive traffic control measures, including scheduling of major truck trips and deliveries to avoid peak traffic hours, detour signs if required, lane closure procedures, signs, cones for drivers, and designated construction access routes. Notification procedures for adjacent property owners and public safety personnel regarding when major deliveries, detours, and lane closures will occur. Location of construction staging areas for materials, equipment, and vehicles (must be located on the Project Site). Identification of haul routes for movement of construction vehicles that would minimize impacts on vehicular and pedestrian traffic, circulation and safety; and provision for monitoring surface streets used for haul routes so that any damage and debris attributable to the haul trucks can be identified and corrected by the Project Sponsor. Temporary construction fences to contain debris and material and to secure the site. Provisions for removal of trash generated by project construction activity. A process for responding to, and tracking, complaints pertaining to construction activi ty, including identification of an onsite complaint manager. Less than Significant II.

Transportation, Circulation and Parking (cont.) Impact TRANS-7 (cont.) Provisions for monitoring surface streets used for truck routes so that any damage and debris attributable to the trucks can be identified and corrected. Construction worker transportation demand management (TDM) program to encourage workers to carpool or use alternative transportation modes in order to reduce the overall number of vehicle trips associated with construction workers. The program should also include provisions for offsite construction worker parking with shuttle service between the offsite parking and the Project Site. Hospital staff TDM program to encourage staff to carpool or use alternative transportation modes in order to reduce onsite parking demand. The program should also include provisions for onsite valet parking and, if insufficient onsite supply is available, offsite staff parking with shuttle service between the offsite parking and the Project Site. Mitigation Measure TRANS-7b: If Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital is not demolished prior to Phase 2 to allow for construction period parking onsite, the Project Sponsor and construction contractor shall meet with the appropriate County agencies to explore the feasibilit y and level of neighborhood support for the County to implement a construction-period Residential Parking Permit (RPP) program in the residential neighborhood adjacent to the Project Site on Stanton Avenue. If a RPP program is determined to be feasible and has substantial neighborhood support, the County shall implement the program. The Project Sponsor shall pay for implementation of the RPP program. This recommendation is made because of the hospital's proximity to the neighborhood, not because hospital-related parking activities occur in the residential neighborhood. The RPP would restrict on-street parking by non-residents to less than two hours during the weekdays. If the RPP program is implemented, it should be prior to construction of the New Hospital. II.

Air Quality Impact AIR-1 : Construction and demo lition activities associated with new development under the Proposed Project would generate and expose sensitiv e receptors to short-term emissions of criteria pollutants, including suspended and inhalable particulate matter and equipment exhaust emissions. (Potentially Significant) Mitigation Measure AIR-1a : During construction, the Project Sponsor shall require the constr uction contractor to implement the following measures required as part of BAAQMD's basic, and enhanced dust control procedures required for sites larger than four acres and close to sensit ive receptors. These include: a) Water all active constructi on areas at least twice daily. Watering should be sufficient to prevent airborne dust from leaving the site. Increased watering frequency may be necessary whenever wind speeds exceed 15 miles per hour. Reclaimed water should be used whenever possible. b) Cover all trucks hauling soil, sand, and other loose materials or require all trucks to maintain at least two feet of freeboard (i.e., the minimum required space between the top of the load and the top of the trailer). c) Pave, apply water three times daily, or apply (non-toxic) soil stabilizers on all unpaved access roads, parking areas and staging areas at construction sites. d) Sweep daily (with water sweepers using reclaimed water if possible) all paved access roads , parking areas and staging areas at construction sites. e) Sweep streets (with water sweepers using reclaimed water if possible) at the end of each day if visible soil material is carried onto adjacent paved roads. f) Hydroseed or apply (non-toxic ) soil stabilizers to inactive construction areas (previously graded areas inactive for one month or more). g) Enclose, cover, water twice daily or apply (non-toxic) soil stabilizers to exposed stockpiles (dirt, sand, etc.). h) Limit traffic speeds on unpaved roads to 15 miles per hour. i) Limit the amount of the disturbed area at any one time, where feasible. j) Pave all roadways, driveways, sidewalks, etc. as soon as feasible.

Their duties shall include holidays and weekend periods when work may not be in progress. The name and telephone number of such persons shall be provided to the BAAQMD prior to the start of construction as well as posted on site over the duration of construction. Mitigation Measure AIR-1b: To further mitigate less-than- significant Project-level impacts, additional measures related to the 2007 CARB off-road diesel rule on equipment exhaust emissions from construction equi pment shall be required in the Proposed Project's construction c ontracts to comply with the following measures: a) Prohibit the use of convent ional cutback asphalt for paving to restrict the maximum VOC content of asphalt emulsion. Diesel portable generators less than 50 horsepower shall not be allowed at the constructi on site, except for those used by welders.1 b) All diesel-fueled engines used for on- and offsite construction activities shall be fueled only with ultralow sulfur diesel, which contains no more than 15 ppm sulfur. c) All construction diesel engines used for on- and offsite activities that have a rating of 100 hp or more shall meet, at a minimum, the Tier 2 California Emission Standards for Off-Road Compression-Ignition Engines as specified in California Code of Regulations, Title 13, section 2423(b)(1) unless it is certified by the construction contractor that such engine is not available for a par ticular item of equipment.

This would include restricting typical demolition and exterior construction activities to the hours of 7:00 am to 7:00 pm on weekdays. However, certain pl anned construction activities that affect hospital operations (e.g ., activities that affect site access, etc.) would need to be scheduled during times that would be least disruptive to t hose existing hospital functions. c) Any construction activity pr oposed to occur outside of the standard hours of 7:00 am to 7:00 pm Monday through Friday for special activities shall be evaluated on a case by case basis, with criteria incl uding the proximity of residential uses.

These enclosures reduce noise from the generators by approximately 30 to 35 dB over emergency generator with just a weather enclosure. d) Exhaust stacks of emergency generators shall be equipped with muffler(s) to reduce the noise from the stack to 68 dBA at 3 feet from the stack since the sound barrier is not effective in reducing the stacks' noise. Given the height of the stack, noise reduction is not expected from the sound barrier. e) Acoustic shrouds shall be placed at the boilers' blowers to reduce their noise by approximately 5 dB. f) The surface of the sound barrier facing the yard and building fa\u00e7ade and roof overhang facing the yard shall be covered with sound absorptive mate rial. The sound absorptive material on the building fa\u00e7ade shall start at an elevation - 18 feet up to +12 feet (aligning with the top of sound barrier).

Cultural Resources (cont.) Impact CUL-2 . Although unlikely, it is possible that previously unknown buried archaeological remains could be present within the Project Site, and the Proposed Project would result in damage to or destruction to significant archaeological remains. (Potentially Significant). Mitigation Measure CUL-2: If historic-period or prehistoric cultural materials are unearthed during ground-disturbing activities, it is recommended that all work in the immediate vicinity halt until a qualified archaeologist can assess the significance of the find. Prehi storic materials might include obsidian and chert flaked-stone (e.g., projectile points, knives, debris; culturally darkened soil (\"midden\") containing heat-affected ro cks, artifacts, or shellfish remains; and stone milling equipment (e.g., mortars, pestles, handstones, or milling slabs); and battered-stone tools, such as hammerstones and pitted stones. Hi storic-period materials might include stone, concrete, or adobe footings and walls; filled wells or privies; and deposits of metal, glass, and/or ceramic refuse. If the find is determined to be potentially significant, the archaeologist, in consultation wi th the County and appropriate Native American group(s), will devel op a treatment plan. All work in the immediate vicinity of the unanticipated discovery shall cease until the qualified arc haeologist has evaluated the discovery, or the treatment plan has been implemented. Less than Significant Impact CUL-3: Construction of the Proposed Project could potentially result in the destruction of a unique paleontological resource.

Biological Resources Impact BIO-1: The Proposed Project could result in the take of special status bird specie s (Potentially Significant). Mitigation Measure BIO-1 : Direct disturbance, including tree and shrub removal or nest destruction by any other means, or indirect disturbance (e.g., noise , increased human activity in area) of active nests of raptor s and other special-status bird species within or in the vicinity of the proposed footprint of future development, the Proposed Project shall be avoided in accordance with the following procedures for Pre-Construction Special-Status Avian Surveys and Subsequent Actions. No more than two weeks in advance of any tree or shrub removal or ground-disturbing activity that will commence during the breeding season (February 1 through August 31), a qualified wildlife biologist shall conduct pre-constr uction surveys of all potential special-status bird nesting habita t in the vicinity of the planned activity and, depending on the survey findings, the following actions shall be taken to avoid potential adverse effects on nesting special-status nesting birds: a) Pre-construction surveys ar e not required for construction activities scheduled to occur during the non-breeding season (August 31 through January 31). b) If pre-construction surveys i ndicate that no nests of special- status birds are present or that nests are inactive or potential habitat is unoccupied, no further mitigation is required. c) If active nests of special- status birds are found during the surveys, the results of the surveys will be forwarded to CDFG (as appropriate) and av oidance procedures will be adopted, if necessary, on a case-by-case basis. These can include construction buffer areas (up to several hundred feet in the case of raptors), relocation of birds or seasonal avoidance. If buffers are created, a no disturbance buffer zone will be created around active nests during the breeding season or until a qualified biologist determines that all young have fledged. The size of the buffer zones and types of construction activities restricted within them will be determined through consultation with the CDFG taking into account factors such as the following: 1. Noise and human disturbance levels at the Project Site and the nesting site at the time of the survey and the noise and disturbance expect ed during the construction activity; Less than Significant II.

The Proposed Project entails the phased development of a new state-of-t he-art acute care hospital (\"New Hospital\") and related facilities within and adjacent to the Eden Medical Center, Castro Valley Campus (\"Project Site\" or \"Site\"). This chapter describes the Pr oject Site and surroundings, the background and regulatory context of the Proposed Project; Proj ect Objectives, Proposed Project characteristics (including anticipated development phasing and en titlements and approvals requested or required), and identifies other agencies that must consider or approve aspects of the Proposed Project. A. Project Location and Site Characteristics Project Location and Access The 18.97-acre SMCCV Project Site, at 20103 Lake Chabot Road in Castro Valley, is located in an urbanized portion of the unincorporated comm unity of Castro Valley in central Alameda County. Castro Valley is located north of the City of Hayward and east of the City of San Leandro. As shown in Figure III-1 , Site Location Map, the SMCCV Project Site is located approximately one-third mile nort h of Interstate 580 (I -580) and bounded genera lly by Lake Chabot Road to the east, Renton Way and Congress Way to the south, Stanton Avenue to the west, and Somerset Avenue to the north. The Project Site consists of the fo llowing five parcels, as shown in Figure III-2 , Existing Parcelization Map: Assessor's Parcel No. Property Description Address 084A-0279-001-01 Stanton Parcel 20000 Stanton Avenue 084A-0279-002 Pine Cone Apartments Parcel 20004 Stanton Avenue 084A-0279-005-10 Eden Hospital/Chabot Medical Bldg. 20103/20055 Professional Center 20081-20101 Lake Chabot Road 084A-0279-010-00 Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital / Parking Structure 19933/19991 Lake Chabot Road Carlton AveSeven Hills Rd Redwood Hill Chabot Rd AveChristensen LnSydney Wy Stanton Ave Miramar Ave Somerset AveParsons Ave San Miguel AveHeyer Ave Castro Valley Grove WayBlvd Figure Site BOUNDARY BOUNDARYRIGHT OF WAY DEDICATION LAKE CHABOT RD.STANTON AVE. Sutter Medical Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-4 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 All parcels are currently owned by Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley (\"SMCCV\" or \"Project Sponsor\"). The Proposed Project would merge and re-subdivide these parcels to accommodate the reconfiguration of development on the SMCCV Project Site (see Proposed Parcelization , under Section E, below). With the exception of the Pine Cone Apartment complex parcel, all parcels are currently part of the Existing Eden Medical Center Campus. Principal roadways providing local access to th e SMCCV Project Site include Castro Valley Boulevard, Lake Chabot Road, Stanton Avenue and Somerset Avenue. Regional access to the Project Site is provided by I-580 and Interstate 238 (I-238). The nearest access point to and from I-580 is located approximately one-half mile sout h of the SMCCV Project Site, at the Stanton Avenue / Strobridge Avenue Interchange. The Castro Valley Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Station is located approximately 1.5 miles sout heast of the Project Site, at Redwood Road and Northbridge Drive (see Figure III-1 ). Existing Alameda County Transit (AC Transit) bus service exists along Lake Chabot Road along the Project Site. Existing Project Site Characteristics Existing Buildings and Uses The Existing Hospital is eight stories and is lo cated in the central portion of the 18.97-acre Project Site, as depicted in Figure III-3 , Aerial of Project Site and Surroundings, and Figure III-4 , Existing Site Plan and Circulation. As depicted in Figures III-3 and III-4 , and detailed in Table III-1 , other existing buildings on the site include five, low-rise medical office buildings (52,234 sq.ft. total), a 6-story parki ng garage, and the single-story Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital (49,248 sq.ft.). The Pine Cone Apartment complex (42 units) is directly west of the Existing Eden Medical Center Campus, at Stanton and Nordell Avenues. Parking and Access As shown in Figure III-3 , surface parking lots and a parking garage exist throughout the Project Site, with the largest surface lot in the south east area of the Project Site. Overall, there are 995 parking spaces within the Existing Eden Medical Center: the Main Campus (447 spaces), Laurel Grove Hospital Garage (461 spaces), th e Lake Chabot MOBs (87 spaces), and the Stanton Lot Parcel in the northwest corner of the Site (62-space). There is also approximately 110 on-street spaces located along Stanton Ave nue (62 spaces) and Lake Chabot Road (48 spaces). Figure III-4 delineates that the public currently accesses the site via two driveways on Lake Chabot Road and one driveway on Stant on Avenue; a separate driveway provides access to the Pine Cone Apartments complex parcel. Servi ce and delivery vehicles access the site via an existing driveway on Stanton Avenue, and em ergency vehicles access the site via the south (main) driveway on Lake Chabot Road as well as the driveway on Stanton Avenue.

Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-7 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Topography The Project Site slopes upward to the northwest. There is an approximately 40-foot elevation change between the main driveway entrance on Lake Chabot Road at the southeast corner of the Project Site (elevation 168) to the northwest area along the north property line (elevation 208). Medical Helistop The Existing Eden Medical Center helistop1 is located in a surface parking lot at the northern area of the site, approximately 129 feet northwest of the Emergency Department entrance of the Existing Hospital. Surface parking and driveways separate the existing helistop from the Emergency Department entrance. The existing helistop is lo cated approximately 125 feet east of the nearest residential uses, an apartment complex that abuts the Project Site immediately north of the New Hospital site. Surrounding Area Characteristics The Project Site is located in the urbanized portion of Castro Valley, north of I-580. The immediate vicinity of the Project Site is compri sed predominantly of vari ous health and dental care services, including offices, laboratories, and convalescent facilities and residential uses. The pattern of development surrounding the Project Site is shown in Figure III-4 and is primarily a mix of residential uses that range from single -family detached units to low-rise apartment buildings, medical offices and medical support use, and commercial businesses. Uses immediately south of the Project Site include a skilled nursing facility, apartments, and a residence owned by Eden Medical Center and ma intained as a dormitory for trauma physicians. To the west, along and across Stanton Avenue, ar e apartments and single-family homes, medical offices, and a skilled nursing facility. To the north, between the Eden Medical Center and Somerset Avenue, are apartments, single-family homes, and along Lake Chabot Road to the north of the Site is a medical office building and a religious worship facility. To the east, along and across Lake Chabot Road, is a mix of apartmen ts, medical offices, medical services, and general commercial businesses. With the exception of the commercial and restaurant uses along Castro Valley Boulevard south of the Project Site, the more distant areas north, south, east and west of the Project Site are dominated by low-density residential uses. B. 2004 Plan In 2004, the Alameda County Community De velopment Agency (\"ACCDA\") received and proceeded initially to process an a pplication for an Eden Medical Center Replacement Acute Care Hospital Project (\"2004 plan\"). As described in the June 2004 Initial Study and Notice of Preparation (NOP), that the ACCDA prepared and published for the 2004 plan, the 2004 plan application envisioned development of a new 400,000 square-foot hospital with the existing 1 The term \"helistop\" is used in this document to denote a helicopter landing facility, used primarily for the drop off and pick-up of passengers. Other activitie s that might take place at a full heliport (such as helicopter storage, maintenance, or refueling) do not ta ke place at the existing he listop, nor would they ta ke place at the planned relocated helistop. III. Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-8 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 helistop relocated to the hospital roof; and a 60,000 square-foot ambulatory surgery center and medical office building. The 2004 plan also pr oposed an additional six-story parking structure and cooling towers for the facility's central utility plant to be located on the northern edge of the existing campus site. Similar to the Proposed Project, the 2004 plan included demolition of the existing Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital a nd several low-rise medical office buildings. However, the proposed site plan configuration of the 2004 plan did not require demolition of the existing Pine Cone Apartment complex which is required to accommodate the Project Site plan functionally and efficiently. Development of the 2004 plan concentrated nearly all of the new buildings into the northeast corner of the existing campus site, near Lake Chabot Road and single- family residences to the north. The 2004 plan did not proceed past the initial development application phase. The Proposed Project is separat e and distinct from the 2004 plan application. As indicated in the Alternatives chapter of this EIR (Chapter V), the 2004 Plan (or \"North Side Alternative\") has been rejected as infeasible. C. Compliance with Seismic Regulations All existing hospitals within the State of Califor nia are required to comply with the regulations developed by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD), as mandated by the Alquist Act, as amended in 1994 by SB 1953 to set current deadlines for compliance. The Alquist Act mandates that essential hospital f acilities remain operational after an earthquake and that they be able to provide full acute car e medical services. To meet this mandate requires the replacement or seismic retrofit of existing acute care facilities that do not meet current earthquake-resistant standards for hospitals, as mandated by State law. SB 1953 amended the Alquist Act to include specific deadlines for compliance. If a facility is to remain a general acute care hos pital facility beyond dates specified in SB 1953, it must have a comprehensive seismic evaluation re port and compliance plan to attain specified structural and nonstructural performance categor ies, which must be submitted to OSHPD in accordance with these regulations. OSHPD enforces bu ilding standards relate d to construction of acute care health facilities. Under OSHPD requireme nts, the construction of new hospitals must comply with the 2007 Building Code, 2003 Life Sa fety Code, and the 2003 Uniform Fire Code as amended for hospitals. However, local jurisdicti ons are preempted from the enforcement of all building standards published in the California Build ing Standards Code relating to the regulation of hospital buildings and the enforcement of ot her regulations adopted pursuant to the State Health and Safety Code and all other appli cable state laws, including plan checking and inspection of the design and details of the architectural, structural, mechanical, plumbing, electrical, and fire and panic safety systems, and the observation of construction (State Health and Safety Code Section 129680(b)). Certain health structures are subject to stringent requirements for life safety (i.e., fire, health, seismic cons iderations). Pursuant to SB 1953 and OSHPD requirements, each general acute care hospital fac ility must be at certain seismic performance category levels for structural and non-structural deficiencies by specified timeframes beginning in 2000 and continuing to 2030. III. Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-9 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Pursuant to SB 1953, the 54-year-old Eden Medical Center Hospital is not eligible to be licensed as an acute care hospital after January 1, 2013 , as it does not meet future State-mandated earthquake-resistant standards for hospitals. A pr imary objective of the Proposed Project is to replace the Existing Hospital with the New Hospital prior to the January 1, 2013 compliance date in SB 1953. The SMCCV Project would assure th at medical services, including Class II trauma helicopter service, would continue to be provide d by a licensed acute care hospital on the Existing Eden Medical Center Campus (as expanded for th e Proposed Project), without disruption, during construction and after completion of the New Hospital and transfer of operations from the Existing Hospital to the New Hospital. The 44-year-old Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospita l is an acute rehabilitation specialty hospital, which, like the Existing Hospital, is seismically obsolete, non-compliant with the new seismic code requirements and is not eligible to be li censed as an acute care hospital after January 1, 2013. The structure will be removed as part of the Proposed Project (see Demolition of Existing Structures , below). The Project Site also contains non-OSHPD structures, which are buildings that do not house OSHPD-regulated hospital functions (e.g., acute car e functions) and that are not subject to the same stringent building requirements or the amendment to SB 1953, but that are subject to currently applicable building codes. The non- OSHPD structures on the Existing Eden Medical Center Campus and in the Proposed Project are primarily the New MOB uses. D. Objectives of Proposed Project The County, in coordination with the Project Sponsor, SMCCV, has identified the following Project Objectives for the Proposed Project: New Hospital and Medi cal Office Building To replace the existing eight-story, 178-be d Existing Hospital with a new, modern, efficient, approximately 230,000 square foot and approximately 130-licensed-bed hospital with private, single-patient rooms in full compliance with SB 1953 deadlines and seismic safety requirements. Key hospital components in clude inpatient care, diagnostic treatment functions, emergency department with trauma services, a universal care unit and ancillary support services. To continue to meet the existing and future projected acute care needs of the Castro Valley community that the Existing Hospital and Eden Medical Center currently serves. To relocate the helistop to a site with a clear, proximate and direct connection to the New Hospital's Emergency Department, and at an elevation that is comparable to or only slightly higher than the entry to the Emergenc y Department. Such relocation is necessary to ensure that the hospital can continue to res pond appropriately to trauma emergencies during and after construction. III. Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-10 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 To continue to provide existing medical ser vices, including acute care, emergency, and helicopter services, without interruption or significant reduction in access during the periods of construction. To ensure that the New Hospital is an efficien t and clinically safe environment by use of the latest best practices in hospital design, including 1) all private inpatient rooms; 2) spatial layouts that promote the ability of staff to wo rk with patients and decrease time spent in paperwork and support tasks; 3) optimal departmental adjacencies that promote safe patient flow throughout the hospital; and 4) adjacent siting of the helistop and the New MOB. To simultaneously construct a new, approxi mately 80,000 square-foot, four-story New MOB above ground-level parking, with a direct physical connection to the New Hospital at each of the four levels. The New MOB will house an ambulatory surgery center and many of the hospital's administrative functions, as well as medical offices and/or an urgent care clinic. By locating hospital-orie nted physicians adjacent to th e hospital with direct hospital access, the New MOB will help the Proposed Project meet mission-critical needs for outpatient, inpatient, a nd ancillary services. To provide public parking below the New MOB to support the New Hospital walk-in Emergency Department. To design the facilities with patient safety as the highest priority. To provide a healing environment that enhan ces the health and well-being of the Alameda County and Castro Valley communities by provid ing integrated inpatient and outpatient care facilities and other medical services on a single campus. To provide convenient access to building and campus services through multiple points of entry to the New Hospital and the New MOB. The points of entry would be located to facilitate accessibility and ease of way-findi ng, incorporating site grade conditions. To ensure sufficient design flexibility to respond to changes in community needs, technology and delivery practices over time. To provide community health education services. To locate and operate the New Hospital, New MOB and related facilities on the Project Site with an awareness of and sensitivity toward th e surrounding communit y and environment. Site Design To utilize the Existing Eden Medical Center Campus (and adjacent Pine Cone Apartment complex parcel) for the New Hospital and related facilities and improvements. To utilize existing site topography to minimize grading. To optimize area and site traffic circulation by separating emergency transport, service vehicles, staff vehicles, and routine non-emer gency patient/visitor access and traffic flows. To provide direct emergency vehicle and pub lic access to the Emergency Department with surface parking adjacent to the Emergency Depa rtment, precluding the need to navigate through the parking garage. III. Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-11 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 To utilize the Laurel Grove Hospital site for additional surface parking. To provide adequate accessible parking, conveniently located adjacent to the main entry for patients and visitors. To design surface parking areas and gradients for pe destrian paths, to the extent practical in light of site constraints, with sensitivity to the needs of the elderly, those with limited mobility, and patients who would be unable to walk long distances and would need curbside access to outpatient, ancilla ry and other hospital services. To utilize the existing parking garage to provide structured parking for a substantial portion of the parking needs of the New Hospital and the New MOB. To improve parking access and efficiencies and vehicular circulation by providing direct onsite access to the parking garage. To incorporate feasible opportunities for sustai nable design, especially in the areas of energy use, building material selection, wa ter use, and control and re-use of demolition spoils. To construct the New Hospital and New MOB construction staging areas without substantially interfering with existing campus operations. E. Components of Proposed Project This section describes through text and graphics, the components of the SMCCV Project, which, combined with all parts of this chapter, cons titute the CEQA \"Project\" analyzed in this EIR.2 The Proposed Project is depicted largely by Figure III-5 , Proposed Site Plan and Circulation, and Table III-1 , Site and Operations Changes - Proposed Project Compared to Existing Conditions, which quantifies changes in operations and certa in physical conditions that will occur on the Project Site as a result of the Proposed Project. Modifications to the Proposed Pr oject Since Publi cation of the NOP After the County's publication of the May 5, 2008 NOP and Initial Study to the public, the Project Sponsor submitted to ACCDA modifications to its April 2, 2008 development application for the Proposed Project. Each of the modifications is described in greater detail throughout this section, as appropriate, and includes the following: Shifted New Hospital Location - The Proposed Project has shifted the New Hospital approximately 15 to 20 feet to the east, away from Stanton Avenue to better accommodate a greater landscape buffer along Stanton Avenue and safe and efficient truck circulation and a more functional utility yard. 2 CEQA Guidelines Section 15378 defines \"Project\" as \"the whole of the action\" whic h has the potential for resulting in physical changes in the environmental.

Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-13 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Concurrent New MOB Scenario - The Proposed Project anticipates constructing the New MOB concurrently with the New Hospital, wh ich will allow both facilities to be completed and operational at the same time. Completion of the New MOB with the New Hospital is necessary because the New MOB will include medi cal administrative services required to support the New Hospital. The NOP described development of the New MOB as a \"later phase of the Proposed Project after the New Hospital is completed and is operational.\" The Draft EIR analyzes both the concurrent MOB scenario (i.e., the Proposed Project) and, where appropriate, the subsequent MOB scenar io referred to as \"Subsequent New MOB Scenario.\" Planned Development District - As reflected in the NOP and Initial Study and subsequently in the Project Sponsor's revi sed development application, the Proposed Project seeks to establish a Planned Development district and zoning for the Project Site. None of the above modifications constitutes a subs tantial change to the Proposed Project or the less-than-significant environmental impacts or m itigation measures identified in the Initial Study. Proposed Site Plan Overview The Project Site Plan is presented as Figure III-5 . Overall changes from the Existing Site Plan presented in Figure III-4 include development of the New Hospital and MOB in the northwest portion of the site, demolition of the Existing Ho spital and Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital, which become surface parking and landscaping, de molition of small MOBs in the central area of the site (generally east of the New MOB) th at become circulation and landscaping, and demolition of the Pine Cone Apartments complex for the New Hospital construction. In addition, the helistop is shifted approximately 150 feet northeast of the existing location to accommodate development of the New MOB and ensure close pr oximity to the Emergency Department in the New Hospital. The existing parking structure and linear MOB along Lake Chabot Road (Lake Chabot MOB) will remain with the Proposed Pr oject, as will the existing surface parking area at the southeast area of the site. Each aspect of the Proposed Site Plan is discussed in greater detail below. Proposed Development New Hospital The approximately 230,000-sq.ft. New Hospital would have approximately 130 licensed beds (single patient rooms). The New Hospital would be positioned in the northwest portion of the SMCCV Project Site. This location is at a higher elevation than the Existing Hospital. Given the significant variation in topography across the Project Site (approximately 40 feet), the building would be six stories at the main lobby entry and Emergency Department entrances on the eastern side of the building, and would be seven stories at the at-grade loading dock and service support areas on the western side of the building (approximately 17 feet lower than the eastern side of the building). The building section is illustrated in Figure III-6 , New Hospital and New MOB Function by Floor, which shows the vertical plan for the New Hospital and MOB. The New Hospital would include a three-level base podium wi th four smaller levels, or \"tower,\" stacked above. Lobby areas would be located on each level. The three-level base podium of the New III.

Inpatient care units would be locat ed in the tower and are designed to allow windows in all patient rooms and efficient st aff support areas for the patient care units. An outdoor gathering and dining courtyard adj acent to the cafeteria would be located on the southeastern side of the building. The loadi ng dock and service area mentioned above also include a below-grade, outdoor central mechanical yard surrounded by a solid wall above grade. A living wall (a wall with vegetation on the surf ace) and landscaped berm is proposed along the west edge of the Project Site which will substa ntially screen the mechanical yard enclosure and loading dock area of the New Hospital from offsite views. Figure III-7 , Proposed Project Massing, illustrates the relationship and conceptual massing of the New Hospital and MOB. Overall, the New Hospital is designed to minimize potential effects to adjacent residential areas and to create an effi cient and functional hospital. The massing and design of the New Hospital is intended to minimize th e building's height while avoiding long walking distances within the building. (The lower the building is, in height or fewer stories, the longer and more spread-out the building configuration.) Th e Project Sponsor considered two key evaluating factors during the massing and design of the New Hospital: clinical fact ors and site factors. Clinical factors included departmental adjacencies, function and flow, and travel distances. Site factors included site circulation, overall site characteristics and massing, and shadow effects. Evaluating these factors, the Project Sponsor pr oceeded with the proposed building and site designs and layouts that achieve the following key components: Utilizes the existing sloped site topography to reduce the height of the building; Locates the tower element (nursing unit) as fa r away from Stanton Avenue as possible to minimize the shadow effect of the tower on adjacent residential uses; NEW HOSPITALNEW MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDINGNEW HELISTOP LOCATION MAIN ENTRYEXISTING LAKE CHABOT MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDINGCONNECTION TO GARAGE EXISTING PARKING GARAGEWALK-IN EMERGENCY LOCATION BELOW LOADING DOCKSCREEN WALL/ LANDSCAPING OUTDOOR MECHANICAL YARD OUTDOOR DININGLANDSCAPE FEATURE Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley . 207766 Proposed Project MassingSOURCE: Devenney GroupIII. Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-16 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Locates the tallest building elements to wards the center of the Project Site; Attaches the New MOB to the New Hospital a nd near the existing garage, but away from adjacent residential uses; Steps the New Hospital down from the tower to reduce the scale of the building to the north and west, towards adjacent residential uses; and Locates the central mechanical yard below grade to minimize operation noise perceived by nearby residential uses. Building massing and exterior materials and fe nestration (windows and glass facades) will be designed to avoid imposing facades, ensure privacy to patient rooms, reduce glare, as well as ensure energy efficiency (see Sustainability , below). Proposed floor heights accommodate complex mechanical and electrical support systems for high-tech equipment, facility access, and safety regulations. New Medical Office Building (MOB) An approximately 80,000 square-foot, fou r-story New MOB would be simultaneously constructed adjacent to the New Hospital. Part of the lower level of the New MOB will be parking, and the remainder of the building will contain medical service and office functions, described below. The parking would be dedicated to provide convenient public access to the New Hospital Emergency Department. Functions in the New MOB would include an Urge nt Care clinic (approx. 13,000 sq.ft.), an ambulatory surgery center (approx. 22,000 sq.ft. ), hospital management and administrative offices, physician offices, conference rooms, a nd other various health support offices (approx. 44,000 sq.ft.). As shown above, Figure III-6 shows how the four levels of the New MOB would connect to the New Hospital. The connection woul d be a covered, open-air bridge between the buildings at each above-ground leve l; the upper two bridge levels would be restricted to staff use. Operations and Building Program The Project Site will include the New Hospital and MOB. The New Hospital will be a modern and efficient general acute care hospital. The Ne w Hospital will provide inpatient, outpatient and trauma/emergency services along with hospital ancillary support services. The New MOB will include ambulatory surgery and urgent care cen ters, medical offices and hospital administrative support services. The inclusion of these services in the New MOB permits more clinical space in the New Hospital for necessary general acute care, critical care, neuroscience, women's and infants' health services and outpatient services. Specifically: The space and functions of the New Hospital and MOB determine the daily population on the Project Site. The New Hospital and MOB are not expected to substantially change the total number of patients, doctors, employees and visitors utilizing the Project Site compared III. Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-17 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 to existing conditions. However there would be a slight increase in population associated specifically with the New MOB.3 The New Hospital will be approximately 230,000 square feet, compared to 284,748 square feet in the Existing Hospital and Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital, resulting in a hospital space reduction of 54,748 square feet. 4 The resized hospital will meet current and future demand expected for these services. At project completion, the total MOB space on th e Project Site will be 112,664 square feet, compared to and existing 52,234 square feet. The net addition of 60,430 square feet of MOB space is necessary to attract more physic ians and provide more outpatient care at the Project Site. This additional physician and outpatient capacity is necessary to meet increasing demand for these services. In total, at project completion, the Pr oject Site's Hospital and MOB space will be approximately 342,664 square feet, compared to the Existing Hospital and MOB space of 336,982 square feet resulting in a net project site increase of approxi mately 5,682 square feet (2 percent). Table III-1 , \"Site and Operations Changes - Proposed Project Compared to Existing Conditions\", enumerates the changes that will o ccur on the Project Site by specific function. The Existing Hospital and Existing MOBs are disco nnected, inefficient, functionally obsolete, and would be prohibitively expe nsive to renovate to meet sei smic safety standards. In comparison, the New Hospital and MOB will meet new state seismic safety standards and will physically integrate inpatient , outpatient and physician func tions that will improve access, increase efficiency and flexibility of use, a nd will lower operating costs. The New Hospital includes several patient-centered care functions a nd takes advantage of advances in technology and improvements in access and quality of care. The New Hospital will also include a 34 station Universal Care Unit5 to better integrate clinical services and add flexibility by concentrating similar functions performed in multiple depa rtments through a single observation space. The Existing Hospital (general acute care) and Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital (acute rehabilitation) have an occupancy rate of less than 60 percent. In total, these facilities have 209 licensed acute care beds, with many in double occupancy rooms. The Ne w Hospital will feature all private rooms to permit greater flexibility in the management of admissions. Currently, gender matching and infection control i ssues prevent full utilization of double-occupancy rooms. Private rooms will eliminate these constraints and will substantially improve utilization of the New Hospital's 130 licensed beds. In addition, advances in treatment and pharmaceuticals have reduced the need for inpatient hospitalization while shifti ng significant hospital services to the outpatient setting. SMCCV has factored in th ese trends and efficiencies in planning the New Hospital and MOB. 3 The day-to-day patient volume associated with the Ne w Hospital will be approximately the same as the Existing Hospital and Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital that will be demolished. 4 Existing Hospital is approximately 235,500 square feet and Laurel Gr ove Hospital is 49,248 square feet. 5 The Universal Care Unit consolidates several vital services into one location such as, pre-admit testing, lab, pre-surgery, post-surgery recovery (except Level 1 anesth esia recovery), infusion therapy, some radiology and cardiology services, observation and patient e ducation and emergency department overflow.

Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-19 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Demolition of Existing Structures The Proposed Project requires the demolition of the following existing structures to accommodate the planned development. The Existing Hospital and Laurel Grove Reha bilitation Hospital have outlived their original use accord ing to state law and modern me dical developments and trends. Moreover, these facilities are unattract ive to patients and physicians. Existing Hospital - The Existing Hospital, like many hospitals in California, is particularly vulnerable to a seismic event due to its age (over 50 years). The Existing Hospital (approximately 235,500 sq.ft.) would remain open throughout construction and until the New Hospital is completed and operational, then these facilities would be closed and demolished. Eden Professional Offices - Four older one- and two-st ory Existing MOBs (totaling approximately 19,570 sq.ft.) north of the Existing Hospital would be demolished to facilitate construction of the New Hospita l and New MOB. These structures will be demolished at the onset of project construction which will occupy the site. Pine Cone Apartment Complex - The 42-unit Pine Cone Apartment complex (fronting Stanton Avenue at Nordell Avenue) would be demolished to facilitate construction of the New Hospital. The complex would be demolishe d at the onset of project construction. Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital - The one-story Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital (acute rehabilitation) is located at th e northeast corner of the Project Site and would be demolished. The building is approxi mately 45 years old and is non-compliant with California's seismic code requirements and, like the Existing Hospital, is subject to mandatory de-licensure by 2013 under SB 1953. Relocation of Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital Program . The Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital program (there are curre ntly 31 licensed beds, but an average daily census of only 19 patients) may be relocated to existing vacant space in the San Leandro Hospital or to another existing facility. The San Leandro Hospital is located approximately three miles northwest from the Project Site. Adequate programmatic capacity exists at San Leandro Hospital. The San Leandro Hospital facility was previous ly analyzed and sub sequently licensed for the full utilization of 122 beds, and the hospita l's overall average daily occupancy in 2007 was 44 percent. If San Leandro Hospital is selected to accommodate the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital program, the fourth fl oor of San Leandro Hospital, which housed its 29-bed skilled nursing program (sub-acute care) until 2007, would be converted for Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital's acute care rehabilitation program. Both programs are relatively small and if the Laurel Grove program was placed at San Leandro Hospital, it would essentially be equivalent to the previous program at that location. Therefore, such relocation would not result in significant environmental effects, particularly since the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital program would utilize an existing facility. In addition, San Leandro Hospital consists of two acute care buildings subject to SB 1953. Both buildings are compliant with California's seismic code requirements and eligible for unrestricted use past 2030. Any offsite location that is selected would have adequate existing capacity for relocation of the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital program or for its absorption into an existing program, and would be compliant with California's seismic code requirements. III. Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-20 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Some of the above structures contain asbestos-c ontaining materials and lead-based paint, which would be removed in accordance with all regul atory requirements prior to demolition. The Proposed Project will also require demolition of pa ving and other site materials to accommodate new circulation, parking and site development areas. The demolition of all buildings will be based on the Sustainability and Construction standards, as permitted, so that the recycling program throughout demolition and construction will allow 75 percent of debris materials to be recycled or reused. Concrete materials, in particular, not n eeded for the Project Site will be off-hauled from the Project Site for Caltrans recycled material reuse. Medical Helistop Relocation The Existing Hospital is currently served by a gro und level helistop as an element of the level II trauma service. The helistop is located in the northwest corner of the campus (see Figures III-3 and III-4 ) and experiences approximately 85 flights per year to transport patients to or from the Existing Hospital. The location of the New Hospital requires that the existing helistop be relocated. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has acknowledged to the Project Sponsor that it is in the process of conducting its aeronautical study of the re quested relocation, which will also require consistency review by the Alameda County Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) (FAA, 2008). The proposed location is approximately 150 feet northeast of the present helistop (see Figure III-5 ). The proposed helistop is currently an undeveloped earthen knoll. This knoll would be graded down approximately 13 feet (to an elevation approximately 5 feet higher than the existing pad) to provide for the necessary flight path obstruction clearances required by Caltrans Division of Aeronautics and to provide easy access via a moderately sloped ramp. The primary and secondary (from the southeast and the west, respectively) inbound and outbound helicopter flight paths would remain essentially the same as the existing routes that principally fly over major roads (e.g., Lake Chabot Road) and hospita l property (the six-story parking garage). The new helistop would be approximately 175 feet from the New Hospital's Emergency Department entrance. Existing emergency helicopter service to the Existing Hospital from the relocated helistop would continue uninterrupted during construction of the New Hospital. The frequency of use is expected to remain consistent with past trends of use (approximately 85 times per year) during construction and operation of the New Hospital. The new helistop location would be 140 feet fro m the nearest residential use, approximately 15 further than the existing helistop location. More detailed information about the helicopter f light paths and characteristics, frequencies and occurrences of the proposed flights, and medical transport helicopters anticipated to be used is presented and discussed in Section IV.E , Noise, and Appendix E.2 to this EIR. III. Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-21 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Access, Circulation and Parking Vehicular Access Access to the Project Site would be similar to the existing conditions described above and delineated in Figure III-4 . The existing main driveway from La ke Chabot Road would continue to be the main Project Site entrance for the patient s, visitors and staff. The proposed circulation plan in Figure III-5 allows for vehicular access to the ex isting parking garage from the Project Site; currently, there is no direct vehicular acc ess between the existing parking garage and the main portion of the Project Site. The existing pa rking garage entrance off Lake Chabot Road (north of the main entrance) will conti nue to be accessed by an existing driveway. Two new \"special use\" driveways would be pr ovided off Stanton Av enue. One special use driveway would serve the New Hospital's truck loading area and the other would serve as the ambulance access to the emergency department. An existing southern driveway on Stanton Avenue would be used principally for staff and hospital support traffic Consistent with current practice, emergency vehicles traveling along Stant on Avenue would be required to turn off their sirens given the nearby residences. In additi on, a second new access driveway is proposed on Stanton Avenue Along the south side of the New Hospital. This driveway would be used for support and delivery traffic. All existing and new access points would be landscaped and identified with the appropriate signage. Onsite Circulation The Proposed Project provides a main access road th at connects the Lake Cha bot Road entrance to the New Hospital and MOB passenger loading areas. Prior to entering the pa ssenger loading areas, a secondary circulation road provides access direc tly to the surface parking in front of the New Hospital and to the parking garage access. The Emergency Department w ould include a separate walk-in entrance and patient drop-off area betw een the New Hospital and the New MOB, with adjacent dedicated parking on a portion of th e ground floor of the New MOB. To minimize potentially dangerous cross traffi c, delivery/support traffic access would be limited to the new Stanton Avenue driveway dedicate d to the loading dock on the west end of the New Hospital. Pedestrian Access and Circulation The Project Site will provide walkable connec tions between all parking facilities and walk-in entrances to the New Hospital (see Figure III-8 ). The access road connecting Lake Chabot Road with the New Hospital and New MOB contains a si dewalk for pedestrian access. Given the steep grade change between the existing bus stops at th e foot of the main driveway at Lake Chabot Road to the New Hospital and New MOB, accessible pedestrian access would be along the Lake Chabot Road sidewalk to the existing parking st ructure elevator, which will access the fifth level of the parking garage, and will connect to the main entry areas of the New Hospital and MOB via the proposed bridge between the existing gara ge and the center area of the Project Site.

Sutter Medical Center, CirculationSOURCE: Devenney Group02 00 FeetIII. Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-23 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Parking The Proposed Project would maintain the existi ng six-story parking garage and existing surface parking areas in the southeast corner of the Pr oject Site, and fronting Lake Chabot Road. New surface parking areas would be created north of th e parking garage (on th e site of the Existing Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospita l, to be demolished), southeast of the New Hospital (on the site of the Existing Hospital to be demolished) and at grade beneath the New MOB. All parking on the Project Site would be accessed from the internal perimeter roadways described above. Overall, the Proposed Project will consolidate pa rking areas and allow direct vehicle connection between the main campus parking and the exis ting parking garage (which does not currently exist), which will increase the existing utiliza tion of the existing parking from as low as 80 percent to approximately 90 percent. The Proposed Project will provide approximately 1,239 parking spaces on the Project Site, which includes the approximately 461 parking spaces in th e existing six-story garage, and existing and new surface parking lots, including under the New MOB. The 1,239 parking spaces would be equivalent to the estimated parking demand of 1,228 spaces (which is based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) rates and staffi ng factors.) The total estimated parking demand reflects improved parking efficiencies and utiliza tion that are anticipated with improved garage access and site circulation on the Project Site. Th e Proposed Project supply would also exceed the calculated 816 spaces required by the Alameda County Zoning Ordinance . The Proposed Project would involve demolition and construction of a number of buildings, which would result in fluctuating onsite parking need s throughout Proposed Project development. During construction of the New Hospital and MO B, before the two existing hospitals are demolished, there could be a temporarily wo rst-case parking shortfall of approximately 300 parking spaces on the Project Site. This EIR also considers the potential for Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital to close and be demolished during the initial phase of Project constr uction rather than the last phase, as described under Development Phasing , below. If Laurel Grove Reha bilitation Hospital is demolished earlier, additional parking would be available thr oughout construction, which would eliminate or substantially reduce the temporary cons truction-period parking shortages. Potential temporary park ing shortages during construction w ould be addressed, in part, through implementation of construction-period TDM measures or other parking management mechanisms, such as valet, attendant or assisted parking. During construction, parking for construction workers would be provided off site, and a temporary shuttle system would transport workers to the Project Site (as discussed also under Sustainability, Construction, below). If Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital is demolished earlier (see Accelerated Demolition of Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital Scenario , below), additional onsite parki ng would become available, and most construction workers would park on site. Specific parking needs during development and at completion of the project are detailed in the parking discussion in Section IV.C, Transportation, Circulation, and Parking , in Chapter IV of this EIR. III. Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-24 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Site Development Landscaping/Screenin g and Open Space The Proposed Project landscape design would prov ide seating, privacy, interest, and views by including tree-lined main boulevards and small park-like areas available to Project Site users (although not restricted from general public acce ss). These areas would be designed to take advantage of long-range views from the hilltop areas of the Project Site. Figure III-9 , Landscape Site Plan, shows a preliminary distribution of new landscape elements proposed throughout the ground-level of the Project Site. As shown c onceptually, landscape elements would include garden landscape areas (for employees); native Oak tree mitigation areas; artwork; small self-contained water features; design paving; and and use of sustainable, drought-resistant plants. Two bioswale areas would be developed in the lower portions of the site. Adjacent to the New Hospital, a landscape area would be focused around the outdoor gathering and dining courtyard, along the northern property line at the adjacen t apartment building. There would also be landscaping on adjacent property where grading w ill occur for the relocated helistop. Also, a landscaped berm and living wall is proposed along the Stanton Avenue frontage along the New Hospital. The landscaped berm and living wall w ould consist of planting and landscape materials and would provide privacy/screening as well as operational noise reduction associated with the loading dock and outdoor mechanical yard opera tions proposed on the Stanton Avenue-facing side of the New Hospital. The living wall woul d be set back approximately 54 feet from the Stanton Avenue right of way and would be effec tively approximately 15 feet high, with a 12-foot high wall on top of a 3-foot high berm that would be built up along its base. The New Hospital would also include three r oof gardens: two (Roof Gardens A and B in Figure III-9 ) located directly outside of the second-leve l patient rooms, and one (Roof Garden C) located directly outside of the waiting area on the third level. These \"green roof\" spaces would consist of low level landscape elements and an approximately 10-f oot high living wall. Extensive landscaping would not be installed duri ng construction to avoid premature damage or subsequent removal due to ongoi ng construction activity. However, initial feature landscaping would be installed in early Phase 2, as shown in Figure III-10b , Phase 2 Plan. Project landscaping would be installed upon full completion of specific development areas; minimal interim planting is proposed since the majority of the Project Site will be in some phase of site development or construction or used for construction staging throughout development.

Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-26 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Site Coverage Development of the Proposed Project will shif t the location and distribution of paved (or \"impervious\") and unpaved (or \"pervious\", i.e., porous or semi-porous surfaces that permit water to enter the ground) areas throughout the Project Site. The proportion of unpaved area on the Project Site would not change with the Proposed Project compared to existing conditions (approxima tely 26 percent coverage, as detailed in Table III-1 ); however, the total unpaved area would increase approxi mately 10 percent or nearly 20,000 sq.ft. The proportion of paved or covered area (excludi ng buildings) on the Project Site would increase from existing conditions (from 55 to 61 percent coverage, as detailed in Table III-1 ), and the total paved of covered area (e xcluding buildings) would increase approximately 18 percent or nearly 76,300 sq.ft. (Also see Sustainability, Irrigation Water Conservation , below.) Utilities The Project would require the construction of ons ite and offsite utility infrastructure, such as water lines, electrical and gas lines, and stormw ater drainage facilities on site. Some existing utility infrastructure not needed for the new facilities would be abandoned in place. Improvements include a new sanitary sewer late ral from the New Hospital and MOB to the existing sewer main located in Stanton Avenue . Also, a comprehensive underground storm drain system would be constructed for the Proposed Project. The storm drain system would connect to the existing site storm drain system or a new storm drain system to be installed in Stanton Avenue. A new water main shall be provided for the New Hospital. The new service line shall extend between existing public water mains located in Stanton Avenue and Lake Chabot Road, providing a redundant source of domestic and fire water for the New Hospital and MOB. The existing water service main serving the Existing Ho spital is located in Stanton Avenue and will be abandoned upon demolition of the Existing Hospita l. Also, it is anticipated that the existing high pressure gas lines located in Stanton Avenue or Lake Chabot Road would continue to serve the Project Site. New electrical service shall be provided for the Proposed Project. Two cellular antenna are currently located on the ro of of the Existing Hospital. It is anticipated that the Proposed Project will relocate these fac ilities within the Proposed Project site prior to demolition of the Existing Hospital. Construction Activities Construction of the Proposed Projec t would require demolition, gradi ng, transport of materials, and building construction, and installa tion of new equipment and necessa ry structural components. The Project has been designed to minimize gradi ng by siting and designing new buildings with consideration given to the existin g site topography. However, the primary areas of grading will be to accommodate the New Hospital and MOB, and to fill the excavated area leftover after demolition of the Existing Hospital. Grading will also be re quired to create the relocated helistop, which will necessitate grading in areas off site. The offsite gr ading area will be on the property directly west of III. Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-27 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 the relocated helistop, generally along the north-s outh property line. This areas also would be landscaped after grading and construc tion of the helistop is completed. As discussed under Utilities , above, the Proposed Project would also involve the construction of utility infrastructure such as water lines, electri cal and gas lines, and stormwater drainage facilities on site and as necessary to connect to ad equate offsite facilities. Construction activities are anticipated to also include recycling ope rations for the processing of demolition debris suitable for reuse (see Sustainability, Construction, below). Construction of the New Hospital and MOB would involve drilled piers (engine-powered); the Proposed Project would not involve the use of driven (hammered) piles. While constr uction staging areas would be located within the Project Site where feasible, when necessary, construction vehicle access routes would be established. These routes would be signed and c onfigured to avoid conflict with emergency vehicle access routes and construction and open u tility trench areas. Throughout construction, the Project Sponsor would communicate construction tr affic routing to Project Site and the public. Construction worker parking and the provision of parking throughout development of the project are discussed under Parking, above. Sustainability The Proposed Project would incorporate sustaina ble elements in its design, construction and operations. In particular, the Project Sponsor is pursuing a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver certification level for the Proposed Project.6 Through an ongoing integrated design team process, the Project Spons or considers and evaluates each of the LEED credits applicable to the Project and how th e LEED element may be incorporated. Several sustainability measures and LEED goals that the Project Sponsor has identified include the following, which are discussed in greater detail below: Implementing an active education program at the New Hospital to showcase LEED and other sustainability measures of the Project to vi sitors of the hospital, while highlighting the importance of sustainability; Reducing construction waste dramatically by diverting the debris away from landfills through reuse and recycling; Reducing water usage throughout the hospital with low flow plumbing fixtures; Optimizing the energy performance of the New Hospital with the use of a virtual energy model during design; Minimizing Site occupants' exposure to toxic chemical emissions by using low VOC materials and implementing an indoor air quality management plan; Incorporating \"green roofs\" and other strate gies to reduce heat island effect (discussed under Landscaping/Screening and Open Space , above). 6 LEED is a Green Building Rating System developed by the U.S. Green Building Council. Silver is the second highest of four possible certification levels available for new construction an d renovation projects, based on a point- based scoring for specified pre-requisite sustainabl e elements (www.usgbc.org ). III. Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-28 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Site Development and Design Sustainable site development and design strate gies employed with the Proposed Project include developing the New Hospital on a previously devel oped site that is currently served by existing infrastructure, utilities and public transit. Other site design strategies include maximizing to the extent feasible the percentage of pervious a nd landscaped areas on the Project Site, implementing established best management practices (BMPs) (inc luding landscaping as an integral part of the onsite stormwater filtration) for stormwater ma nagement, minimizing grading where feasible, and using light-colored roof materials and roof gardens. Construction Sustainable construction strategies that the Project Sponsor proposes include deconstruction (versus demolition) of the Existing Hospital and the Laur el Grove Rehabilitation Hospital; recycling and reuse of concrete and metals from demolished stru ctures (as permitted) for Project Site work, road work and structures; adherence to an approved Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) (draft included as Appendix G1 to this EIR); and use of Lean Construction Methodology (i.e., promoting coordination, reduced changes, offsite fa brication). All c oncrete and meta l materials not needed for the Project Site would be off-hauled from the site for Caltrans recycled material reuse. Also, the Project Sponsor proposes to establish a constr uction debris recycling program throughout demolition and construction of the Proposed Proj ect which would assume 75 percent materials recycled or reused. (Also see Demolition of Existing Structures, above). In total, more than 50 percent of the construction materials reclaimed are not anticipated to leave the Project Site but to be reused for fill material. Additionally, during constr uction activities, construction workers will not be provided parking on site. Rather the construction wo rkers would be designated offsite parking and a shuttle bus would be provided to shuttle the workers to and from the work site. Operations Other sustainable measures regarding water effici ency and conservation and water treatment for offsite irrigation, and energy use through buildi ng mechanical systems and fixtures, architectural materials/coating selections and \"green roof\" areas would also be incorporated into the operations of the Proposed Project. Building Materials The SMCCV Project building materials would incl ude a combination of metal siding, masonry stone, pre-cast concrete, glass and structural steel curtain wall elements, laminated glass canopies, and mesh screenings around exterior mechanical systems. The Proposed Project will prioritize use of renewable and sustainable resources in selecting building materials. Irrigation Water Conservation The SMCCV Project would employ several water conservation measures that involve sustainable landscape practices, plant selection criteria, engineering methods and use of local native plant III. Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-29 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 sources and nurseries. Sustainable landscape practi ces include landscaping locally (by evaluating the site climate, exposure and topography); stockp iling and reusing controllers) irriga tion products; and using plants that will sustain with minimal water, pesticides, fertilizers, and pruning waste. The Proposed Project intends to limit the use of turf (lawn) areas on the Project S ite while balancing the County's stormwater goals and requirements; a bio-swale garden is proposed and will double as an engineering filtration function of onsite drainage. Development Phasing Proposed Project The Proposed Project would be developed over approximately 4.5 years, starting in mid-2009 with planned completion by end of 2013.7 The overall development sequence and schedule is summarized in below and entails four primary phases, described below and shown in Figures III- 10a through III-10d that follow. Phase 1: 2nd Quarter 2009 to 4th Quarter 2009 (6 months) - Demolish Eden Profession Offices (20,000 sq.ft) - Demolish Pine Cone Apartments Complex (42 units) - Demolish and relocate Helistop and pedest rian connection to Existing Hospital Phase 2: 3rd Quarter 2009 to 3rd Quarter 2012 (35 months) - Install Site Work (e.g., utilities, et c.) for the New Hospital and MOB sites - Construct New Hospital and MOB - Develop temporary accessible parking and ci rculation (at Eden Professional Offices location demolished in Phase 1) - Install Landscape Feature southwest of existing parking garage Phase 3a: 1st Quarter 2013 to 3rd Quarter 2013 (6 months) - Demolish Existing Hospital (after New Hospital and MOB open) - Demolish temporary accessible parking (constructed in Phase 2) Phase 3b: 1st Quarter 2013 to 4th Quarter 2013 (10 months) - Demolish Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital - Develop new surface parking and circul ation (at demolished Existing Hospital location) and landscape features - Develop new surface parking and land scaping (at demolished Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital location) 7 The Initial Study specified planned completion of the Proposed Project in 2015, which assumed development of the New MOB (referred to therein as \"New Future MOB\") afte r completion of the New Hospital. Both scenarios are analyzed in this EIR.

The Subsequent New MOB Scenario would exte nd the development period of the Proposed Project approximately 18 months (to 6 y ears total) to approximately mid-2015. Accelerated Demolition of Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital The potential for early closure and demolition of Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital is also considered in this EIR, primarily relative to the construction-period parking assessment; early demolition of the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hosp ital will substantially increase the available number of parking spaces on the Project Site throughout construction. Figures III-11a through III-11e show that the Project would still mainta in four primary development phases, but demolition of Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hosp ital (Phase 3b with the Proposed Project, as shown in Figure III-10d ) would occur in Phase 1, mid-2009. Proposed Parcelization The Project Site currently consists of five parcels (see Figure III-2 ). The Project Sponsor proposes to merge and re-subdivide these parcels to accommodate the reconfiguration of proposed development. The five existing parcels will be reconfigured into three parcels shown in Figure III-12a: parcels containing (1) the Existing Hospital and parking garage, (2) the New Hospital and MOB, and (3) Laurel Grove Rehab ilitation Hospital. Right-of-way dedications to the County will also occur during this initial mapping. Upon completion of the Project, the three constr uction-phase parcels will be reconfigured into two parcels shown in Figure III-12b: (1) the entire Project Site and (2) the New MOB. General Plan and Specific Plan Amendments and Zoning The Proposed Project involves combining the Stanton Lot and Pine Cone Apartment complex (see Figure III-2 ) with the Existing Hospital parcels to create the Project Site. To incorporate these two parcels into the Project Site, and to clarify related developm ent objectives and design policies relevant to the project, the Propo sed Project proposes amendments to the 1985 Castro Valley Plan (\"General Plan \") and to the 1993 Castro Valley Central Bu siness District Specific Plan (\"Specific Plan \"). The Stanton Lot and Pine Cone Apartment comp lex parcels are currently designated \"Medium Density Residential\" in the General Plan while the remaining majority of the Project Site (comprising the existing medical campus) is designated \"Office & Medical Office Commercial.\" DEMOLISH/ RELOCATE HELISTOPHELISTOP RELOCATION AREA SITE DEVELOPMENT AREADRAWING LEGEND SITE DEVELOPMENT AREA DEMOLITION DEMOLISH/ RELOCATE HELISTOP PROJECT SITE BOUNDARY DEMOLISH MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDINGS DEMOLISH APARTMENT BUILDINGS EXISTING HOSPITAL6 STORY PARKING STRUCTURE 3 STORY MEDICAL OFFICE MATERIALS BUILDINGDEMOLISH LAUREL GROVE HOSPITAL OFF-SITE GRADING UTILITIES BRIDGE SITEWORKPROJECT SITE BOUNDARYPROJECT SITE BOUNDARY LAKE RD.STANTON AVE.

Project Description Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project III-41 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 The Proposed Project proposes to amend the General Plan by : amending the General Plan land use map and designations for the Stanton Lot and Pine Cone Apartment complex parcels to \"Office & Medical Office Commercial,\" and amending General Plan policy language to accommodate hospital and associated land uses within the Project Site. The Project Site, other than the Stanton Lot a nd Pine Cone Apartment complex parcels, is currently within the boundary of the Specific Plan 's Subarea 4 - \"Lake Chabot Road - Hospital/Medical-Oriented Office and Retail.\" The Specific Plan 's Subarea 4 also constitutes the zoning for the portion of the Project Site that is currently within its boundary. The Proposed Project proposes to amend the Specific Plan by: changing the boundary of the Specific Plan's Subarea 4 to include the Stanton Lot and Pine Cone Apartment complex parcels. amending the Specific Plan's description of Subarea 4 to define the approximately 19-acre Project Site as the \"Lake Chabot Road Hospital Campus.\" providing consistency with goals for redevelopment of the \"E den Medical Center\" specified in the County's proposed Draft General Plan Update (January 2007) in particular. The Stanton Lot and Pine Cone Apartment complex parcels are currently zoned R-S-D-3 (Suburban Residential) while the remainder of the Project Site is zoned Su barea 4 as described above. The Proposed Project would create a Planned Developmen t zoning district for th e entire Project Site. The development standards and controls for the Pr oject Site (including arch itectural design review and approval) would be es tablished as part of the land us e and development plan adopted in connection with the new Planned Development z oning district for the Proposed Project. The Proposed Project would amend the \"Des ign Policies\" for Subarea 4 of the Specific Plan and the \"Impacts on Adjacent Development\" Section of the Specific Plan to establish this process for the Proposed Project. The Initial Study (and Project S ponsor's original development application to the County) anticipated that the C ounty would likely process the Propo sed Project pursuant to a Site Development Review, but also anticipated that a Planned Development zoning district may be the preferred and appropriate mechan ism. This EIR analyzes only the County's preferred proposal for Planned Development rezoning. The proposed amendments to the General Plan and the Specific Plan are considered part of the Proposed Project analyzed in this EIR. III.

Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV-1 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 CHAPTER IV Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures Introduction to the Environmental Analysis Overview The analysis provided in this EIR has been prepared in accordance with CEQA, as amended (Public Resources Code Section 21000, et seq.), and the State CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations sections 15000 through 15378). This chapter contains a discussion of 1) Environmental Setting (baseline conditions and regulatory background), 2) Environmental Impacts Analyses (direct, indirect or secondary, short-term, and cumulative) that could result from the Proposed Project, and 3) Mitigation Measures that would, to the extent possible, reduce or elim inate adverse impacts identified in this chapter. Scope of Analysis Throughout this EIR, the analysis addresses th e potential impacts of all activities that would result from development of the entire Project Site and during all development phases. Pursuant to Section 15358(b) of the CEQA Guidelines , the analysis focuses on the physical impacts that may result for the Proposed Project. Further, the anal ysis identifies the signi ficance criteria used to assess the significance of adverse environmental effects and reports the significance of impacts (both prior to and after implementation of mitiga tion). The analysis identifies, where appropriate and relevant, potential impacts specific to a certain phase or area of development, with mitigation measures also identified accordingly. This EIR addresses each environmental topic fo r which the Proposed Project could result in a physical environmental effect under CEQA. As i ndicated in the Chapter I, Introduction, the County prepared an Initial Study that narrowed the scope of environmental topics analyzed in this EIR. The scope of this EIR also considers co mments the County received in response to the NOP and Initial Study; comments pertaining to potentia l environmental effects of the Proposed Project under CEQA as well as the content of the document addressed. Thus, all such comments are addressed within the information and analysis presented throughout this document. Comment letters received in response to the NOP are provided as Appendix A to this EIR.) IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures Introduction to the Environmental Analysis Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV-2 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December r 2008 The analysis herein considers impacts that w ould occur during construction and during operation of the Proposed Project through buildout (Y ear 2014) and cumulative conditions (Year 2035). Although not required by CEQA, a 2015 interim year analysis is included to assess potential near-term traffic, air quality, and noise impacts that could result with initial phases of the Project. Environmental Baseline Overall, pursuant to Section 15125(a) of the CEQA Guidelines , this EIR measures the physical impacts of the Proposed Project against the \"base line\" of physical environmental conditions at and near the Proposed Project. The \"baseline\" is the combined circumstances existing around the time the NOP of the EIR was published, which is May 2008. In most cases, the baseline condition relevant to the environmental topic analyzed is described within each environmental topic section in Chapter IV. In some cases (such as Section IV.B, Aesthetics ; Section IV.C, Transportation, Circulation and Parking ; and IV.M, Population, Housing, and Employment ), discussion of the baseline condition is detailed or restated in the Impacts Analysis to provide the impact analysis in the most reader-friendly format and organization. In cases where the timing of the baseline condition used is substantially different from th e May 2008 baseline, the alternative baseline is described. This EIR presents a 2015 interim year analysis to assess near-term traffic and traffic-related air quality and traffic-related noise impacts associated with the Proposed Project and near-term development. The 2015 and 2035 baseline for ecasts are from the Alameda County Congestion Management Agency (ACCMA) Countywide Trav el Demand Forecasting Model, which captures the cumulative effects of future growth on the re gional roadways; the analysis of traffic-related air quality and traffic-related noise impacts are derived using the ACCMA model as well. The baseline also includes the policy and planni ng context for the Proposed Project. This is discussed in detail within Section IV.A, Land Use, Plans and Policies , which identifies any inconsistencies between the Proposed Project and applicable, currently adopted plans and policies. 1 Cumulative Analysis Context Pursuant to the requirements of CEQA, this EIR also evaluates potential cumulative impacts that may result with the Proposed Project. A cumulativ e impact occurs when the impact of two or more individual impacts, when considered toge ther, are substantial or compound or increase other environmental impacts. The cumulative analysis is intended to describe the \"incremental impact of the Proposed Project when added to other, closely related past, present, or reasonably foreseeable future projects\" that can result fro m \"individually minor but collectively significant projects taking place over a period of time\" (CEQA Guidelines Section 15355). A cumulative analysis discussion, including a defined geographic context and relevance of any past, present and 1 Information from draft plans, such as the Draft 2007 update of the Castro Valley Gene ral Plan that the County has not yet adopted, is provided where relevant for inform ational purposes and reasona bly foreseeable contexts. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures Introduction to the Environmental Analysis Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV-3 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 reasonably foreseeable projects, is provided for each environmental topic in Chapter IV, Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigati on Measures. The cumulative analysis year established for this EIR analysis is 2035, whic h is based on the ACCMA model, in addition to any specific related and nearby projects that the County has identified as \"reasonably foreseeable.\" Mitigation Measures As indicated above, Project-specific mitigation measures are identified throughout the EIR to reduce or eliminate adverse impacts of the Propo sed Project. The mitigation measures determined to be feasible and effective to reduce or avoid potentially significant impacts (1) will be included as part of the design, construction, and operations of the Proposed Project; (2) will be made conditions of approval for the Project; and (3) will be subject to the monitoring and reporting requirements of CEQA and the terms of the discretionary approvals for the Project. Significance Thresholds The analysis generally applies the significan ce criteria, and where indicated, thresholds established in Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines , as well as Sections 15064, 15064.5, 15065, 15382 of the CEQA Guideline s, to determine the significance of environmental effects. The County has also identified additional significance th resholds and criteria for shadow effects for which the CEQA Guidelines provide minimal guidance, and for local traffic effects. Impact Classifications The following level of significance classifi cations are used throughout this EIR: Significant (S) - The impact of the Proposed Project is expected to reach or exceed the defined threshold of significance. Feasible mitigation meas ures may or may not be identified to reduce the significant impact to a less-than-significant level. Potentially Significant (PS) - The impact of the Proposed Project may reach or exceed the defined threshold of significance, however it is not evident that, even in the theoretical worst-case conditions, a significant impact would occur. F easible mitigation measures may or may not be identified to reduce the potentially significan t impact to a less-than-significant level. Significant and Unavoidable (SU) - The impact of the Proposed Project reaches or exceeds the defined threshold of significance. No feasible mitigation measure is available to reduce the significant impact to a less-than-significant level. In these cases, feasible mitigation measures are identified to reduce the significant impact to th e maximum feasible extent, and the significant unavoidable classification is noted. Impacts are also classified as significant and unavoidable if a feasible mitigation measure is identified that w ould reduce the impact to a less-than-significant level, but the approval and/or implementation of the mitigation is not within the County of IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures Introduction to the Environmental Analysis Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV-4 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December r 2008 Alameda's or the Project Sponsor's sole control; as a result, in this situation, the EIR cannot presume implementation of the mitigation measure and the resulting less-than-significant impact level. Less than Significant (LTS) - The impacts of the Proposed Project either before or after implementation of feasible mitigation measures do not reach or exceed the defined threshold of significance. Beneficial Impact (B) - The impact of the Proposed Project would improve the environment, regardless of the defined threshold of sign ificance. Generally, no mitigation measures are required or identified. No Impact (N) - No noticeable adverse effect on the environmental would occur. Nomenclature of Impacts and Mitigation Measures Impact Statements This EIR identifies all impacts d by an abbr eviated designation that corresponds to the environmental topic addressed (e.g., \"HAZ\" for h azardous materials). The topic designator is followed by a number that indicates the sequence in which the impact statement occurs within the section. For example, \"Impact HAZ-1\" is the first (i.e., \"1\") hazardous materials impact identified in the EIR. All impact statements are presented in bold text. Mitigation Measures Each mitigation measure is numbered to corr espond with the impact that it addresses. Where multiple mitigation measures address a single impact, each mitigation measure is indicated by a lower-case letter. For example \"Mitigation Measu re HAZ-1a\" is the first (i.e., \"a\") mitigation identified to address the first (i.e., \"1\") hazardous materials impact (i.e., \"HAZ\"). All mitigation measure statements are presented in bold text. Mitigation Monitoring a nd Reporting Program During preparation of the Responses to Comments / Final EIR document after the public review and comment period for this Draft EIR, the C ounty will prepare a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program (MMRP), in compliance with Public Resources Code Section 21081.6 and CEQA Guidelines Section 15097. For each mitigation measure identified in the EIR, the MMRP will (1) list the measure, (2) identify the person( s) or body responsible for implementing each measures (3) identify the person(s) or body r esponsible for, and the timeframe, schedule and standards for, monitoring the effective implementation of each measure.

Land Use, Plans, and Policies This section examines the land use, plans and polic ies that are relevant to the SMCCV Project Site and the Proposed Project. Included are descr iptions of the land uses in the area, as well as applicable plans, policies and re levant ordinances. Also included in this section is a discussion of potential land use impacts or conflicts or incons istencies with applicable plans, policies and ordinances. Setting The Project Site is located within the urbanized portion of the Castro Valley Planning Area in unincorporated Alameda County. C onstruction and operation of the Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project (SMCCV Proj ect) would have the potential to conflict with the applicable plans and policies of the Castro Valley Planning Area and the County. This chapter describes the existing land uses on and in the vici nity of the Project Site and analyzes the Proposed Project's consistency with the current 1985 Castro Valley Plan (General Plan ), the current 1993 Castro Valley Central Business District Specific Plan (Specific Plan ), the Draft Castro Valley General Plan Update (2007 Draft General Plan Update ), which is proposed to update the 1985 General Plan , and, where applicable, the Alameda County Zoning Ordinance. Site Vicinity Land Uses The approximately 19-acre Project Site is located in the urbanized portion of the unincorporated community of Castro Valley in central Alameda County, north of the City of Hayward and east of the City of San Leandro. Castro Valley is divi ded into northern and southern sections by I-580. Lake Chabot Road and Redwood Road provide th e major north-south connections while Castro Valley Boulevard, the primary commercial corri dor, provides the major east-west connection. Land use within Castro Valley's approximate 6,000 acres of urbanized land is predominantly residential (roughly 54 percent). Approximately tw elve percent of the land area is devoted to parks and open space while an additional five per cent of the land is vacant. Approximately four percent of Castro Valley's land area is devoted to medical/dental services and industrial/auto- related uses (County of Alameda, 2007b). The immediate vicinity of the Project Site is comprised predominantly of a variety of health and dental care services including offices, laboratories and convalescent facilities and residential uses. Uses immediately to the south include a skilled nursing facility, apartments and a residence owned by Eden Medical Center and maintained as a dormitory for trauma physicians. To the west, along and across Stanton Avenue, are apartm ents and single-family homes, medical offices and a skilled nursing facility. To the north, betw een the Eden Medical Center and Somerset Avenue, are apartments and single-family homes and a religious facility fronting Lake Chabot Road. To the east, along and across Lake Chabot Ro ad, are a mix of apartments, medical offices, medical services and general commercial businesses. With the exception of the commercial and restaurant uses along Castro Valley Boulevard south of the Project Site, the more distant areas north, south, east and west of the Project Site are dominated by low-density residential uses. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures A. Land Use, Plans, and Policies Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.A-2 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Project Site Land Use The Project Site, which is mostly within the existing Eden Medical Center site boundary, is located in the northeastern portion of Castro Va lley's Central Business District along the major secondary road of Lake Chabot Road. The Eden Medical Center area is generally defined by Lake Chabot Road on the east and Stanton Avenue on the west, and is comprised of the Existing Hospital, Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital, the Eden Professional Medical Offices and the ancillary uses that support these facilities. The Eden Medical Center is identified as a prominent countywide medical facility and a significant component of Castro Valley's Central Business District and as a \"key feature\" of the 2007 Draft General Plan Update. The Project Site consists of five parcels that, in total, consist of approximately 19 acres. Three of the five parcels fall within Castro Valley's Centra l Business District and are currently being used as a part of the existing Eden Medical Center. The General Plan designates the land use classification for these parcels as \"Office & Medical Office Commercial.\" The Specific Plan, which governs the zoning within the Central Bu siness District, designates the zoning for these parcels as \"CV Central Business District, Suba rea 4 - Lake Chabot Road - Hospital/Medical- Oriented Office and Retail\" (Subarea 4). The Project Site also includes the remaining two parcels, the Stanton Lot and the Pine Cone Apartments parcels, which abut the current w estern boundaries of the Eden Medical Center and front Stanton Avenue. The Stanton Lot Parcel (t he existing northwestern-most parking lot) is currently occupied by a surface parking lot servi ng the existing Eden Medical Center. The Pine Cone Apartments Parcel (fronting Stanton Avenue at Nordell Avenue and not part of the existing Eden Medical Center) contains a 42-unit apartment complex. The General Plan designates the Stanton Lot Parcel and the Pine Cone Apartmen ts Parcel as \"Medium Density Residential.\" These parcels, which fall outside the Specific Plan area, are currently zoned R-S (CSU, D-3 1), Suburban Residential under the Alameda County Zoning Ordinance . Proposed Parcelization The Project Site currently consists of five parcels (see Figure III-2 ). The Project Sponsor proposes to merge and re-subdivide these parcels to accommodate the reconfiguration of proposed development. The five existing parcels will be reconfigured into three parcels shown in Figure III-12a : parcels containing (1) the Existing Hospital and parking garage, (2) the New Hospital and MOB, and (3) Laurel Grove Rehab ilitation Hospital. Right-of-way dedications to the County will also occur during this initial mapping. Upon completion of the Project, the three constr uction-phase parcels will be reconfigured into two parcels shown in Figure III-12b : (1) the entire Project Site and (2) the New MOB. 1 Conditional Second Unit, Overlay District to the R-S Zone to establish reside ntial density standards. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures A. Land Use, Plans, and Policies Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.A-3 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Regulatory Framework State The Alquist Hospital Facilities Seismic Safety Act of 1983 and Senate Bill 1953 The Alquist Act mandates that all existing hospitals within the state comply with the regulations developed by the California Office of Statewid e Health Planning and Development (OSHPD). The Alquist Act mandates that essential hospital f acilities remain operational after an earthquake and provide full acute care medical services. California State Senate Bill 1953 (SB 1953), adopted in February 1994, amends the Alquist Ac t to include specific d eadlines for compliance. If a facility is to remain a general acute care hosp ital facility beyond dates specified in SB 1953, it must have a comprehensive seismic evaluation re port and compliance plan to attain specified structural and nonstructural performance categor ies which must be submitted to OSHPD in accordance with these regulations. SB 1953 manda tes that each general acute care hospital facility must be at certain seismic performance cat egory levels for structural and non-structural building systems by specified timeframes to 2030. The existing Eden Medical Center would need to meet these standards to continue operations as a general acute care hospital facility beyond January 1, 2013. Local Plans and Policies 1985 Castro Valley Plan ( General Plan ) The SMCCV Project Site is located in the Castro Valley Planning Area, and as such, is subject to the land use regulations and planning policies included in the General Plan , adopted by the Alameda Board of Supervisors in April, 1985. The General Plan serves as a general policy guide for public and private decisions affecting devel opment of the Castro Valley Planning Area and was prepared as part of the County of Alameda General Plan . As described above, the General Plan designates the Stanton Lot Parcel and the Pi ne Cone Apartments Parcel as \"Medium Density Residential,\" which permits residential uses and developments with a density of 6.7 units per gross acre or more. The remaining three parcels w ithin the Project Site are designated as Office & Medical Office Commercial, which permits offices, clinics and smaller laboratories of dentists, optometrists, osteopaths, physicians and other medical professionals. The General Plan includes the following area-wide and general development goals and principles that are applicable to the SMCCV Project: To encourage improvement of properties and structures. To provide for the retail and services needs of residents. Objective 4 : To minimize the potentially adverse effects of environmental hazards on development; to ensure that all new devel opment is located, designed and constructed to minimize risks of property damage, personal injury, and loss of life resulting from an earthquake, landslide, flood, or major wildland or urban fire. Principle 4.3 : All structures should be designate d and constructed to withstand groundshaking forces of a minor earthquake without damage, of a moderate earthquake IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures A. Land Use, Plans, and Policies Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.A-4 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 without structural damage, and of a major earthquake without collapse. Critical and essential structures and facilities should be desi gned and constructed to remain standing and functional following a major earthquake. Principle 4.8 : All existing structures or features of structures which are hazardous in their potential to cause damage, injury or loss of life, or loss of critical and essential functions in the event of an earthquake, should be brought in to conformance with applicable and related safety (e.g., fire, toxic materials storage a nd use) standards, through rehabilitation, reconstruction, demolition, reduction in o ccupancy levels, or change in use. The General Plan includes the following Commercial Land Use goals and principles that are applicable to the SMCCV Project: Principle 1.8 : Commercial development should provide adequate buffering (e.g., use of walls, landscaping, setbacks), design measures (e.g., location of parking areas, loading facilities, storage facilities), and should regulat e on-site activities (e.g., hours, scheduling of deliveries) to minimize adverse impacts (e.g., noise, glare, odors) on adjoining residential areas. Principle 1.16 : Office and medical office uses should normally locate in areas in which these are the predominant existing use, including: Redwood Road, in the area generally extending from Redwood Court at the north to Grove Way at the south; and Lake Chabot Road, in the area generally extending from Castro Valley Boulevard at the south to Somerset Avenue at the north. Medical office commercial should be the pr incipal use in the Lake Chabot area. Principle 1.17 : Other commercial uses may be permitted in office and medical office commercial areas, provided that they are accessory to and do not preempt the principal uses. In addition to the above, applicab le goals and principles relating to Aesthetics; Transportation, Circulation Parking; Air Quality; and Water Quality; Hazardous Materials and Contamination; Public Services and Facilities; Utilities; and Popu lation and Housing are listed in their respective sections in this EIR. 1993 Castro Valley Central Business District Specific Plan ( Specific Plan ) While the General Plan is the most recently adopted planning document for the entire Castro Valley community, more specific and detailed pla nning relating to the Proposed Project has been adopted in the subsequent Specific Plan . The purpose of the Specific Plan is to \"guide future public and private actions within the Castro Valley Central Business District,\" which gene rally encompasses the area along Castro Valley Boulevard, southward to the I-580 and northward along Lake Chabot Road to include the Eden Medical Center (County of Alameda, 1993). The Specific Plan provides a comprehensive IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures A. Land Use, Plans, and Policies Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.A-5 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 framework for County policies and regulations regarding development, including land use, circulation, design, and infrastructure wi thin the Central Business District. The Specific Plan is an implementation measure for the General Plan and provides for more specific implementation measures and programs than those identified by the General Plan . The Specific Plan provides land use policies and regulations for 11 subareas within which four Land Use Groups (Land Use Groups A through D) are either permitted or prohibited. Three of the five parcels included in the SMCCV Project are located within Subarea 4 (Lake Chabot Road - Hospital/Medical-Oriented Office and Retail). This subarea, currently consisting of approximately 31.09 acres in 39 parcels, is dominated by the Eden Medical Center and associated medical offices. Policies for Subarea 4 identified by the Specific Plan include: Development Objective : Development in this subarea shall be orientated toward the existing concentration of medical and related facilities or adjacent high density residential development. Businesses and services which would benefit from proximity to the medical facilities such as medical laboratories or congr egate care facilities, and businesses which can draw clientele from hospital businesses are specifically encouraged. Development must reflect its location on a major community thoroughfare. Allowed Uses : Type C2 Offices [offices with a fairly even flow of clients where business is generally done by appointment], particularly medical and dental; hospitals, and Land Use Group D (High Density Residential) uses are allowed through the subarea. Other commercial uses which support either the medical or residential aspect of the area are allowed and encouraged. Full Service Restaura nts and Food Service Outlets, medical or dental laboratories, ambulance services, pharmacies, and flower and gift shops are specifically allowed. Except as provided above, Land Use Group A (Intensive Retail Commercial) and Land Use Group B (Low Volume, Predominantly Motor Vehicle-Oriented Retail and Service Commercial, Wholesale Commercial and Industrial) are prohibited in this subarea. Design Policies : Development in this subarea is gene rally auto-oriented, and individual developments are allowed. Parking should be lo cated to the rear of buildings to the extent possible; where this is not possible, parki ng should be screened from the street through landscaping. Special attention must be given to the subarea's location along a major community thoroughfare. The Specific Plan includes additional land use policies app licable to all subareas. The following policy, applicable to the SMCCV Project, is intended to protect adjacent development from adverse impacts: Impacts on Adjacent Development : Where commercial development is proposed for a property which abuts property planned or zone d for residential development there shall be ample buffering to protect the existing or futu re residential development from impacts of the commercial use, including but not limited to noise, dust, vibration, lighting, etc., such that these shall not exceed reasonably acceptable le vels at the property line. This protection shall be ensured through Site Development Re view or other procedures, and may include yards, landscaping, limits on hours of operati on, stepping or locating buildings away from the property line, or other such measures. Where high density residential development abuts areas planned or zoned for low density r esidential development, buffering shall be required commensurate with the likelihood of future high density development on the IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures A. Land Use, Plans, and Policies Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.A-6 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 adjacent property. Buffering may also be required between commercial uses, where appropriate. No development sh all be approved which has noise, light, or other similar impacts on adjacent or nearby residential or commercial development which cannot be conditioned or modified to reasonably acceptabl e levels. Land uses existing at the time of adoption of this plan which do not meet these policies are Nonconforming Uses. 2007 Draft Castro Valley General Plan Update Alameda County is currently undertaking a comprehensive update of the General Plan . The 2007 Draft General Plan Update serves as the blueprint for future growth and development in the unincorporated areas of the County. The 2007 Draft General Plan Update recognizes the central importance that the Eden Medical Center plays in the Castro Valley community and its economy. In response to the requirements of SB 1953 (di scussed above), the plan identifies planning goals and policies to ensure development of a modern and attractive professional medical district at the current location. The proposed initiatives, goals and policies applicable to the Project include: Key Initiative 11 : Lake Chabot Road Medical Distri ct: Allow the rebuilding of Eden Hospital so it can continue to provide high quality medical and emergency services in structures that can withstand earthquakes. Th e hospital and the citizens of Castro Valley should form a working committee to ensure that the new campus and surrounding sites create an attractive and functional medical district with medical offices, retail, restaurants, and supportive housing. Estab lish standards and guidelines to ensure that the medical facility construction and operation does not ne gatively impact the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Goal 4.8-1 : Upgrade and modernize Eden Medical Center in order to provide health services and jobs for the community. Design th e hospital site and surrounding sites in the Professional-Medical District to achieve th e community's goals for improving the area along Lake Chabot Road and to minimize an y negative effects on surrounding properties. Policy 4.8-1 : Modernize Eden Medical Center. Continue to modernize and upgrade Eden Medical Center so that it serves as a cataly st for health-related development around the hospital, provides jobs for Castro Valley resident s, and supports local retail and restaurants. Policy 4.8-2 : High Quality Design. Create a high-quality image on the Eden Medical Center site and on surrounding properties in th e district through d esign, landscaping, and maintenance. Policy 4.8-3 : Vibrant Medical District on Lake Chabot Road. Encourage medical office and commercial development on Lake Chabot Road that improves the area's appearance and creates a vibrant district with employment, restaurants, retail, and personal services. Policy 4.8-4 : Protect Surrounding Residential. Plan new development to minimize adverse effects on surrounding residential areas. Policy 4.8-5 : Medical-related uses and Local Services. Allow a variety of health-related professional and technical support uses, nursing homes, retail, restaurants, and services to meet the needs of employees and residents. In addition to the above, and as with the General Plan , applicable goals and principles relating to Aesthetics; Transportation, Circ ulation and Parking; Air Quality; Noise; Cultural Resources; IV.

Although the 2007 Draft General Plan Update has been analyzed in a Draft EIR dated April 2007, the final EIR was not certified as of the SMCCV Project application date. Therefore, although the 2007 Draft General Plan Update may serve as a guideline, the SMCCV Project remains subject to the existing land use designations and policies of the existing General Plan . Alameda County Zoning Ordinance The Alameda County Zoning Ordinance (Zoning Ordinance ) regulates land use and development of land within the County. The Zoning Ordinance includes identification of allowed land uses, development standards (e.g., lot size, building hei ght, setbacks, etc.), parking requirements, and the placement of signs. The SMCCV Project Site includes the Stanton Lot and the Pine Cone Apartments parcels, which fall outside the Specific Plan area. These parcels fall under the jurisdiction of the Zoning Ordinance , in which they are currently zoned R-S (CSU, D-3 2), Suburban Residential. The R-S district is inte nded to regulate and control the development of large building sites and various densities in harmony with the character of existing neighborhoods. Depending on the size of the bui lding site, one- two- and multiple-family dwelling units are permitted in this district along with field crop, orchard and garden uses (County of Alameda, 2008). Impacts and Mitigation Measures Significance Criteria The CEQA Guidelines Appendix G provides guidance for assessing the significance of potential environmental impacts. Relative to land use, a project would have a significant effect on the environment if it would: Physically divide an established community; Conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over the project (including, but not limited to, the general plan, specific plan, local coastal program, or zoning ordinance) adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect; or Conflict with any applicable habitat conserva tion plan or natural community conservation plan. The analysis below of land use impacts for the SMCCV Project addresses consistency with adopted land use plans and policies. The analysis is based upon a review of the aforementioned policies and plans that are applicable to the SMCCV Project and the Project Site. 2 Conditional Second Unit, Overlay District to the R-S Zone to establish reside ntial density standards. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures A. Land Use, Plans, and Policies Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.A-8 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 The Initial Study determined that the SMCCV Proj ect would not physically divide an established community as it would develop and maintain me dical facilities on parcels either containing or surrounded by other medical and compatible u ses, and would do so within the established boundaries of the Eden Medical Center, in add ition to a multifamily residential parcel that currently abuts the Project Site. This is a less- than-significant impact, and this topic is not analyzed in this EIR. In addition, the SMCCV Project Site is not located within any Habitat Conservation Plan, Natural Community Conservation Plan or other approved local, regional, or State habitat conservation plan. Therefore, the Proposed Project would have no impact on such plans, and this topic is not discussed further in this EIR. Impacts Impact LU-1: The Proposed Project, in cluding the proposed amendment to the General Plan and Specific Plan , and to the Zoning Ordinance for Planned Development District (PD) Zoning, would not conflict with adopted applic able land use plans and policies. (Less than Significant) The SMCCV Project proposes to develop a new seven -story, 130-bed acute care hospital, totaling approximately 230,000 square feet (New Hosp ital) and an approximately 80,000 square-foot, three-story medical office building (MOB) adj acent to the New Hospital. The SMCCV Project would include demolition of the 42-unit Pine Cone Apartment complex, the existing one-story Eden Medical Center Hospital, the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hosp ital and four existing medical office buildings. The Laurel Grove Reha bilitation services would be transferred to an existing offsite location, and the existing helis top would be relocated approximately 150 feet northeast. The SMCCV Project would also upgrade th e existing parking garage and provide direct vehicular access to the garage from the main campus area, and increase the total number of surface parking spaces in the location of the Laur el Grove Rehabilitation Hospital and Existing Hospital. Demolition and construction would be phased such that medical services would continue to be provided by a licensed acute car e hospital on the Eden Medical Center Campus during construction and thereafter, without disruption. To accommodate the demolition and construction, the SMCCV Project would involve amending the General Plan and Specific Plan primarily to permit medical hospital use on the Stanton Lot and the Pine Cone Apartments parcels and to clarify related development objectives and design policies relevant to the Project Site. The amendm ents would also specify that the development standards for the Project Site would be establishe d through the adoption of PD Zoning and a land use development plan. The SMCCV Project also would include a merger and re-subdivision of multiple parcels that would comprise the Project Site. General Plan Amendments As noted above, the Stanton Lot and Pine C one Apartments parcels are designated Medium Density Residential in the General Plan while the remaining majority of the Project Site is designated as Office & Medical Office Commercial. The SMCCV Project would amend the General Plan land use map and designations for the St anton Lot and Pine Cone Apartments IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures A. Land Use, Plans, and Policies Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.A-9 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 parcels such that the entire Project Site would be designated Office & Medical Office Commercial. The SMCCV Project also would amend the language of Principle 1.16 of the General Plan Commercial Land Use Policies to accommodate hospital and associated uses (including visitor amenities, parking facilities, laboratories and a central utility plant) along with the currently allowed medical o ffice use in the area along Lake Chabot Road from Castro Valley Road to Somerset Avenue to the north and bounded by Stanton Avenue to the west. Specific Plan Amendments To accommodate hospital and medical office uses, the SMCCV Project would amend the Specific Plan and the boundary of Subarea 4 to include the Stanton Lot and Pine Cone Apartments parcels, which currently lie outside the Castro Valley Central Business District. Further, the SMCCV Project proposes to amend the description of Subarea 4 to define the approximately 19-acre Project Site as the \"Lake Chabot Road Hospital Campus.\" Other proposed amendments to the Specific Plan will create greater consistency with the 2007 Draft General Plan Update 's goals for redevelopment of the Eden Medical Center. The amendments would include modifications to the development objectives, permitted uses and design policies in Subarea 4 as well as to the la nd use policy related to impacts to adjacent development. SMCCV proposes to include hosp ital and medical office facilities as well as encouragement of other medical-related or complementary uses among the development objectives for Subarea 4 (SMCCV, 2008). Proposed modifications to the allowed uses in Subarea 4 are intended to incorporate related u ses that support hospital and medical office uses as permitted. Additional permitted uses would includ e administrative offices, physicians' offices, clinics, laboratories, diagnostics/imaging, out-p atient surgery, emergency services, helistop, ambulance services, pharmacies, other employee, patient and visitor amenities (such as a cafeteria, restaurant, caf\u00e9, flower and gift s hop, etc.), and related improvements and facilities supporting operation of a modern, integrated me dical center, including a central utility plant (SMCCV, 2008). A Specific Plan amendment is also proposed to the \"Additional Land Use Policies\" to add language to specify that the development standards for the Project Site would be set forth in a land use and development plan adopted in c onnection with a Planned Development zoning district established in accordance with Section 17.18.010 of the Alameda County Zoning Ordinance. Such a Planned Development zoning district would supersede the standards in Section 17.42.020 of the Alameda County Zoning Ordinance. This would be consistent with the Specific Plan as a whole, which states that all policies and regulations of the plan take precedent over and replace the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance . To the extent that approval of the Specific Plan amendments and creation of a PD distri ct change development standards on the Project Site from existing conditions, those cha nges are analyzed throughout the this EIR, primarily in Section B, Aesthetics , related to building setbacks and heights as they affect shadow and views, and related to Section E., Noise, re lated to any location standards for operational activities (rooftop mechanical, loading, etc.). IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures A. Land Use, Plans, and Policies Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.A-10 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Approval of the Specific Plan amendment and Planned Development zoning district would result in an amendment to the Alameda County Zoning Ordinance such that the SMCCV Project Site would be rezoned from \"CV Central Business District, Subarea 4 - Lake Chabot Road - Hospital/Medical-Oriented Office and Retail\" (Subarea 4) and \"R-S\" (CSU, D-3 3), Suburban Residential to Planned Development District (\" PD district\"). PD districts are designed to encourage and accommodate the arrangement of a compatible variety of uses on suitable lands. Standards for this district generally refer to General Plan policies for guidance and, as noted above, the policies within the Specific Plan would supersede the standards in the Zoning Ordinance. The rezoning would require approval of a Land Use and Development Plan. Overall, the changes in the land use designation an d the rezoning that would occur as part of the Proposed Project would result in a loss of land z oned for residential use on the Project Site. As with the land use re-designation, the new zoning would result in land uses that are internally consistent (within the Project Site) and that w ould also be compatible with the surrounding land uses. While rezoning of a portion of the Project Site from residential to office and medical office/commercial use would preclude future resi dential uses from being developed on the site, such policy decisions would be weighed by decisi on-makers in the overall decision to approve or deny the SMCCV Project. In addition, the proposed amendments, including the land use re-designation and policy clarification would be consistent with the 2007 Draft General Plan Update . By re-designating the land use classification and zoning of the Stanton Lot and Pine Cone Apartments parcels, the SMCCV Project would effectively change the use and development standards set forth in the applicable plans that are intended to avoid or reduce adverse environmental effects. In addition, to the exte nt that adverse physical land use changes would occur as part of the proposed General Plan and Specific Plan amendments and rezoning, such impacts are discussed in their respective sections of this EIR. Policies The SMCCV Project is consistent with each of the applicable General Plan goals and principles discussed above under Local Plans and Policies . Specifically, the key purpose and objective of the Proposed Project is to achieve full seismic sa fety requirements of several buildings on the SMCCV Project campus, which will \"minimize risk s of personal and structural property damage or property collapse in the event of groundshaking forces of an earthquake and will structures into conformance with applicable and related safety ( General Plan General Development Policies, Objective 4, Principles 4.3 and 4.8). As discussed in detail in the Project Description (Chapter III) and in Section B, Aesthetics , the Proposed Project has incorporated several site planning and building design measures to provide adequate buffering and regulate onsite activities to minimize adverse effects on adjacent residences to reasonably acceptable levels and to regulate onsite activities (such as delivery trucks and loading/unloading, ambulance operations , noise, dust, vibration and lighting ( General Plan 3 Conditional Second Unit, Overlay District to the R-S Zone to establish reside ntial density standards. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures A. Land Use, Plans, and Policies Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.A-11 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Commercial Land Use Policies Principle 1.8). To summarize from those sections of the EIR, perimeter landscaping would be focused along the northern property line of the Project Site and along Stanton Area near adjacent residential uses. A 12-foot-tall \"living wall\" of planting and landscape materials, placed above a 3-foot-tall la ndscaped berm (for effectively 15 feet), would be introduced along the Stanton Avenue to addr ess privacy/screening. The living wall would also provide operational noise reduction associated with the loading dock and the outdoor, below grade, mechanical yard operations proposed on the Stanton Avenue-facing side of the New Hospital. The Proposed Project will adhere to th e Alameda County Lighting Guidelines to ensure lighting on the Project Site is sensitive to ne ighboring land uses and minimize energy use and aimed down with full-cut-off luminaries to avoid li ght spill to offsite areas Additionally, exterior glass on patient room windows would be dark, lo w-reflective glass to reduce interior light transmission to outside of the building. Mitiga tion measure and best construction management practices identified in this EIR also would mini mize noise, dust, and vibration effects during construction (see Sections D. Air Quality , and E. Noise ). From a broader perspective, the Proposed Project utilizes the existing sloped site top ographic to reduce the height of the building, locates the tower element (nursing unit) as far aw ay from Stanton Avenue (and towards the center of the Project Site) as possible to minimize the sh adow effect of the tower on adjacent residential uses; and steps the New Hospital down from the to wer to reduce the scale of the building to the north and west, towards adjacent residential uses. The Proposed Project proposes substantial landscap ing throughout all parking areas as well as the entire Project Site (see Figure III-9 , Landscape Site Plan) ( Specific Plan Policies for Subarea 4, Design Policies ). Lastly, the Proposed Project directly aligns with General Plan principles and Specific Plan polices that support use of medical and related faciliti es and medical office commercial in the Lake Chabot area ( General Plan Commercial Land Use Policies Principle 1.16; Specific Plan Policies for Subarea 4 ), as it maintains and enhances the existing medical center at the existing Eden Medical Center. Summary In summary, based on the above discussion of the proposed amendments to the General Plan and the Specific Plan and specific principles and policies in each, the SMCCV Project, which incorporates the aforementioned amendments to the General Plan and Specific Plan , is considered consistent with the land use plans and policies that are applicable to the site.4 Mitigation: None required. _________________________ 4 Although the proposed amendm ents are considered part of the Propos ed SMCCV Project, other approvals by ACCDA are required for the Proposed SMCCV Project, including Planned Developm ent Zoning and a phased subdivision map or lot line adjustment to merge, re-subdivi de and map multiple parcels that comprise the Proposed SMCCV Project Site. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures A. Land Use, Plans, and Policies Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.A-12 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Cumulative Impacts Impact LU-2: The Proposed Project, comb ined with past, present and reasonably foreseeable future projects, would not result in a significant cumulative impact to land use, plans and policies impact. (Less than Significant) Geographic Context and Other Projects The geographic context considered for the cumulative land use, plans and policies impacts includes the surrounding area that could have the potential to combine with the Proposed Project area and result in cumulative land use, plans and policies impacts. Given the nature of the potential impacts analyzed for this topic, the geographic scope w ould include the CV Central Business District Subareas 3 through 5, and the residential and mixed use areas extending north, east and west of the Project Site for approximately three blocks (the distance to Castro Valley Boulevard). Past projects in this area are included in the existing setting described in this section and in Chapter III, Project Description. Present project s would include any projects currently under construction within the geographic context area. None are identified as of preparation of this EIR. Reasonably foreseeable future projects are tho se that could be developed or occur in the geographic context area by 2030. Discussion As concluded in this section and in the Initial Study, the SMCCV Project would not result in any significant impacts resulting from physically dividing an established community or conflicting with any land use plan, policy or regulation ad opted for purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect. The Project Site is primarily self-contained within the Eden Medical Center, bound markedly by two roadway and clear historical boundaries on the north and south. Other development could not combine with the Prop osed Project to result in a cumulative effect on an established community. Similarly, because the Proposed Project does not result in a conflict with a land use plan, policy or regulation in manner that could result in a significant environmental effect, whether other present or fu ture development would have such a conflict, the effect would not combined to create cumulative \"conflict.\" In addition, past projects have, and present and reasonably foreseeable future projects would be, subject to development guidance contained within the General Plan, Specific Plan and/or the Alameda County Zoning Ordinance to ensure land use compatibly. Therefore, it is not anticipated that the SMCCV Project, when considered with other past, present or reasonably foreseeable future development in the area, would result in a cumulative impact with respect to land use, plans and policies. The SMCCV Project Site is not located within any conservation plan and thus could not combine with other projects to cause a significant. Thus, the Proposed Project would not result in a significant cumulative land use, plans and policies impact. Mitigation: None required. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures A.

Aesthetics This section examines the aesthetics setting of the Project Site and its immediate vicinity. Included are descriptions of the built environment and important viewsheds, as well as applicable plans and regulations. Also included in this secti on are a discussion of potential impacts to visual resources, and mitigation measures to reduce significant impacts (if any). Setting Visual Setting Overview The Project Site is located in an urbanized portion of the unincorporated community of Castro Valley in central Alameda County, north of the City of Hayward and east of the City of San Leandro. Project Site The Existing Hospital is eight stories and is locat ed in the central portion of the 18.97-acre Eden Medical Center, Castro Valley campus site, as depicted in Figure III-3 , Aerial of Existing Project Site and Surroundings. Other buildings on the Site include several low-rise medical office buildings, a 6-story parking garage and the si ngle-story Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital. Surface parking lots exist throughout the Site, with the largest in the southeast area of the Site. The Project Site slopes noticeably upward to th e northwest, from the main driveway entrance on Lake Chabot Road at southeast corner to the ma in floor of the proposed New Hospital - a change of approximately 45 feet in elevation. The existing helistop 1 is located in a surface parking lot and is approximately 150 feet northwest of the Emergency Department entrance of the Existing Hospital. Surface parking and driveways separate the existing pad from the Emergency Depa rtment entrance. The existing pad is also located approximately 125 feet east of the nearest residential uses, an apartment complex that abuts the Project Site immediately north of the New Hospital site. The public currently accesses the Site via two drivew ays on Lake Chabot Road and one driveway on Stanton Avenue. Service and delivery vehicles access the Site via an existing driveway on Stanton Avenue, and emergency vehicles access the S ite via the south (main) driveway on Lake Chabot Road as well as the driveway on Stanton Avenue. The Project Site includes two additional parcels, referred to herein as the Stanton Lot Parcel and the Pine Cone Apartments Parcel, which abut the current western boundaries of the Eden Medical Center campus. The Stanton Lot Parcel (the existi ng northwestern-most parking lot) is currently 1 The term \"helistop\" is used in th is document to denote a helicopter landing facility, used primarily for the drop off and pick-up of passengers. Other activities that might take place at a full heliport (such as helicopter storage, maintenance, or refueling) do not take place at the exis ting helistop, nor would they take place at the planned relocated helistop. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts and Mitigation Measures B. Aesthetics Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.B-2 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 occupied by a surface parking lot serving the existing Eden Medical Center. The Pine Cone Apartments Parcel (fronting Stanton Avenue at No rdell Avenue and not part of the existing Eden Medical Center) contains an existing 42-unit apartment complex. Uses surrounding the Project Site primarily include a mix of residential uses, medical offices and medical support use, and commercial businesses, most of which were constructed in the mid-to- late twentieth centuries in primarily contemporary architectural styles of the period. Uses immediately to the south include a skilled nursing facility, apartments and a residence owned by Eden Medical Center and maintained as a dormito ry for trauma physicians. To the west, along and across Stanton Avenue, are apartments and single-family homes, medical offices and a skilled nursing facility. To the north, between the Eden Medical Center and Somerset Avenue, are apartments, single-family homes and a religious f acility fronting Lake Chabot Road. To the east, along and across Lake Chabot Road, are a mix of apartments, medical offices, medical services, and commercial businesses. Views of the Project Site Views of the Project Site are available from each of its peripheral boundaries: Lake Chabot Road to the east, Renton Way and Congress Way to the s outh, Stanton Avenue to the west, and Somerset Avenue to the north. Project Vicinity and Views from the Project Site The Project Site vicinity is dominated by lo w- to mid-rise residential and commercial uses, roadways, and surface parking. Looking north from the Project Site are views of low-rise, single- and multi-family residential uses arranged in cul-de-sacs and accessed from Somer set Avenue and Sprague and Louise Courts. Looking west from the Project Site are views of low-rise, single family residential uses across Stanton Avenue. Views looking south from the Project Site include multi-family residential apartments and surface parking lots. Looking east from the Project Site are commercial uses along Lake Chabot Road, with views of the E astern Ridges towards Livermore in the distant background. The General Plan identifies the \"hill open space areas\" as the principal scenic resource of Castro Valley; there are views of the hills and ridges with natural vegetation surrounding Castro Valley from most roadways in the area. Applicable Plans, Policies, and Regulations Castro Valley General Plan The General Plan contains the following policies and princi ples that are intended to reinforce the identity and special character of the County, and improve the visual quality of the area of the Proposed Project: IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts and Mitigation Measures B. Aesthetics Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.B-3 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 General Development Policies a. Landform Principle 3.1 - In accord with other related Plan principles, all development should provide for maximum retention of natural topographic features, particularly those features which are highly visible from within the existing urban area. Grading should be designed to preserve, complement, and/ or blend with the natural contours and undulations of the land. e. Scenic and Aesthetic Qualities Principle 3.9 - New development should be planned and constructed to fit and take advantage of existing Site and area conditions: - Development should emphasize unique natural features, such as changes in levels, vistas, unusual landscaping, ro ck outcroppings, sloping terrain, etc. - Projects should be compatible, in design, use of materials and landscaping, with surrounding development. - To the extent possible, man-made features of local and communitywide significance should be incorporated into the project. - Structures should be sited, grouped and sh aped to complement one another and the natural landscape; to provide visual interest; and to create a sense of place within the project area. - To the extent possible, natural vegetation, and particularly large, mature trees, should be preserved. - Landscaping should be used to blend st ructures with the natural landscape. - New public and private streets should be designed and constructed to minimize the scarring effects of grading. - Streets should be landscaped and provided with lighting and street furniture in keeping with the overall scale and character of development. - Views of scenic areas and views from established scenic routes should be protected and enhanced. Principle 3.10 - Advertising signs should be restricted to commercial areas. The size, height, number and type of on-premise signs should be the minimum necessary to provide for identification of businesses. The design and location of business signs should be related to the type of activity they advertise, and should be compatible with the visual character of the area in whic h they are located. Billboards should be prohibited. Principle 3.12 - Scenic views from major pedestrian, bicycle and automobile routes should be protected wherever possible. Castro Valley Central Busin ess District Specific Plan The Specific Plan contains a Deign Review and Design Guidelines Program, the Castro Valley Central Business District Design Guidelines that shall be used by County staff and the Castro IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts and Mitigation Measures B. Aesthetics Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.B-4 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Valley Municipal Advisory Council (MAC)2 in evaluating the design of commercial development projects ( Specific Plan Policy 2.1). The Guidelines are primarily focused for commercial properties in the Central Business District (whi ch include the Project Site) and address Site landscaping; facades, windows and entries; roof forms, rehabilitation and remodeling; signs, graphics and awnings; and building materials a nd colors. These mandatory guidelines are waived only in certain circumstances, as is proposed by the Project, which would incorporate Site design standards and guidelines tailored to the Project Site through the establishment of Planned Development Zoning District. Impacts and Mitigation Measures The existing visual character of the Project Site and its surroundings is determined by the attributes of specific features and patterns that occur as a result of natural and/or cultural processes. Evaluation of potential project impacts on the existing visual character of the Site and its surroundings requires analysis of the visual characteristics of the Proposed Project and how those characteristics (separately or collectively) w ould affect the existing visual character of the Site and views of it from offsite locations. Significance Criteria The CEQA Guidelines Appendix G provides guidance for assessing the significance of potential environmental impacts. Relative to aesthetics, a project would have a significant effect on the environment if it would: Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista; Substantially damage scenic resources, including, but not limited to, trees, rock outcroppings, and other features of the built or natural environment which contribute to a scenic public setting; Substantially degrade the existing visual charact er or quality of the site and its surroundings or reduce adequate sunlight to residential uses; or Create a new source of substantial light or glare which would adversely affect day or nighttime views in the area or which would subs tantially impact other people or properties Assessing Scenic Vistas and Resources View corridors or \"viewsheds\" include the tota l field of vision from a specific vantage point. They are formed by physical elements (i.e., buildings, hills and ridges, etc.), that guide lines of sight and control view directions available to pe destrians and motorists. Public view corridors are areas in which views are available from publicly accessible vantage points, such as public streets, highways, parks, and other publicly-controlled spaces. Consistent with the Alameda County's 2 The Castro Valley Municipal Advisory Council advi ses the Alameda County Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors on community and land us e issues in Castro Valley. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts and Mitigation Measures B. Aesthetics Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.B-5 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 practice, public view corridors assessed in this EI R, for purposes of environmental analysis under CEQA, include \"scenic vistas or scenic resources.\" While defining \"scenic vistas and resources\" can be highly subjective, scenic vistas are view corridors that are most commonly considered to include elements of \"high scenic value\" or \"visual prominence,\" such as the ridges and hills ides that surround Castro Valley and are visible from most areas, as identified in the General Plan . Significance determinations consider the extent of adverse change that the Proposed Pr oject would cause by altering or obstructing public views of scenic vistas and resources. Photosimulati ons are used to assess the extent of change that would occur with the Proposed Project. Assessing Visual Character and Quality The assessment of \"visual character and quality\" is somewhat more subjective than that of \"scenic vistas and resources\" discussed above. Visual character and quality can depend greatly on individual preferences and the surrounding comparison context; whereas scenic vistas and resources can often be objectively defined based on a set of distinguishing physical characteristics. The analysis of visual charact er and quality in this EIR focuses on whether the Proposed Project would substantially degrade the ex isting visual character of the Project Site and vicinity. The significance determination considers wh ether the extent of change in the appearance of the area surrounding the Project Site would be substantially adverse, damaging, or degrading when compared to existing conditions. Impacts Effects on Scenic Vistas and Scenic Resources Impact AES-1: The Proposed Project would not adversely affect a scenic vista or substantially damage scenic resources. (Less than Significant) No scenic resources including, but not limited to, trees, rock outcroppings, and other features of the built or natural environment have been identifie d on the Project Site that would be affected by the Proposed Project. As discussed above, the General Plan identifies the \"hill open space areas\" as the principal scenic resource of Castro Valley. From the Project Site, views of the hillsides and ridges to the north and east. Views across the Project Site are also available from certain vantage points and limited by intervening urban development and topography. The Proposed Project would include an a pproximately 230,000 square-foot, 130-bed New Hospital that would be positioned in the northw est portion of the Project Site, at a higher elevation than the Existing Hospital. Given the si gnificant variation in topography across the Site, the building would be six stories at the main lobby and Emergency Department entrances on the eastern side of the building and would be seven stories at the at-grade loading dock and service support areas on the western side of the building (approximately 19 feet lower than the eastern side of the building). IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts and Mitigation Measures B. Aesthetics Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.B-6 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 The New Hospital would include a three-level base podium with four smaller levels, or \"tower,\" stacked above. The ground level, which would be open to grade on the east side, would contain entrances to the main entry and lobby. An outdoor gathering and dining courtyard from the cafeteria would be located on the southeastern side of the building. The lower or basement level, which would be open to grade on the west side, would include loading docks and a below-grade, outdoor central mechanical yard surrounded by a solid wall above grade. A living wall (a wall covered with vegetation) and landscaped berm is proposed along the west edge of the Project Site which will screen the mechanical yard enclos ure and loading dock area from vantage points offsite. The three-level base podium of the New Hosp ital would primarily contain diagnostic and treatment functions, with minor administrative support areas. The four upper levels, which would be the most visible from distant offsite locations , would contain the inpatient care units designed to include windows in all patient rooms. The Proposed Project also includes an approximately 80,000 square-foot, four-story New MOB adjacent to the New Hospital; the two buildings would be connected at each above-ground level via a covered, open-air bridge. Part of the lowe r level of the New MOB will be parking, and the remainder of the building will contain medical service and office functions. The New MOB will be approximately the same height as the three-level podium of the New Hospital and both buildings would be at approximately the same elevation. Figure III-7 , Proposed Project Massing, illustrates the relationship and conceptual massing of the New Hospital and New MOB. The massing and d esign of the New Hospital is intended to minimize the building's height while avoiding long walking distances within the building. The lower the building is, in height or fewer stori es, the longer and more spread-out the building configuration. This aligns with General Plan policies that address development on the Project Site that avoids adverse impacts to adjacent residen tial uses or public views across the Project Site. The Proposed Project utilizes the existing sloped site topography to reduce the height of the building and locates the tallest building elements (the New Hospital tower) towards the center of the Project Site. Proposed floor heights accommodate complex mechanical and electrical support systems for high-tech equipment, facility access, and safety regulations. The following evaluates changes that would occu r with the Proposed Project from two offsite viewpoints in the Project vicinity (Viewpoints A and B). Viewpoint locations chosen in collaboration with the Alameda County Community Development Agency (ACCDA) were selected because they are from publicly accessible lo cations or within heavily-traveled public road rights-of-way. A viewpoint location map is provided on Figure IV.B-1 , and views of the Project Site under existing and simu lated conditions are provided in Figures IV.B-2 and IV.B-3 on the following pages.

Aesthetics Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.B-10 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 include commercial uses at the intersection of C astro Valley Boulevard and Stanton Avenue, mid- range views include the upper four stories of th e Existing Hospital, and long-range views include a portion of the San Leandro Hills at Lake Chabot in the distance and that appear west of the Existing Hospital. The horizon does not appear a bove the urbanized deve lopment and vegetation in the close- and mid-range views, thus, while visi ble within this urbanized context, the views of the north hills from this viewpoint is not particularly notable or prominent. With the Proposed Project, close-range views woul d remain unchanged, and views of the Existing Hospital (which would be demolis hed) would be replaced with views of the New Hospital and New MOB in mid-range views. The upper stories of the New Hospital and New MOB, would be visible as new structures, and would create more visible building mass than the single building (the Existing Hospital) it would replace. 3 The Proposed Project would construct the New Hospital at the western portion of the Site which is approxi mately 19 to 20 feet higher in elevation than the central portion of the Site where the Existing Ho spital is located. As a result, the New Hospital and New MOB buildings would obscure more of th e hills visible in the distance. Because views of the northern hills, with are part of those th at surround Castro Valley, are available from most roadways in the area (as acknowledged in the General Plan) , views of this resource would continue to be visible from Viewpoint A as well as other nearby public locations and roadways. Further, the effect of the New Hospital and Ne w MOB on this viewpoint compared to existing conditions is not substantial, particularly since th e view is not particularly expansive or prominent given the urban development context that frames it. Therefore, the Proposed Project would not result in a significant impact to views or scenic resources from this public viewpoint. The impact would be less than significant. Viewpoint B, From Adobe Park on San Miguel Avenue-1 Viewpoint B shown in Figure IV.B-3 identifies westerly views of the Project Site from Adobe Park on San Miguel Avenue. Unde r existing conditions, close-range views include lawn areas of the Adobe Park playfield, mid-range views in clude multi-family residential uses and dense vegetation at the far end of Adobe Park, and long-range view s include the upper two-to-three stories of the Existing Hospital. The Proposed Pr oject would not change existing close-range or mid-range views from this Viewpoint B, howev er, views of the Existing Hospital would be replaced with views of the New Hospital in long -range views. No scenic or visual resource is visible within the context of the Proposed Pr oject from this viewpoint, thus none would be affected. Also, given the long distance, vegetati on, and development between this viewpoint and the Project Site, changes to the Project Site with the New Hospital and New MOB would be almost imperceptible. Therefore, the Proposed Proj ect would not result in a significant impact to views or scenic resources from this public viewpoint . The impact would be less than significant. 3 The appearance of the simulated New Hospital and New MOB is more prominent than would occur under actual condition; for purposes of this anal ysis, the simulated buildings are hi ghlighted so that the massing is distinguishable from the relatively ne utral tones and varied patterns cr eated by the surrounding development context. Actual architectural treatment of the building facades would avoid imposing facades and be compatible with (although not necessarily identical to) surrounding development. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts and Mitigation Measures B. Aesthetics Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.B-11 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Mitigation: None required. ___________________________ Effects on Visual Character or Quality Impact AES-2: The Proposed Project would change, but not substantially degrade, the existing visual character or quality of the Project Site and its surroundings upon completion. (Less than Significant) The Proposed Project would not substantially cha nge the overall visual character of the Project Site, which would continue to be a medical cam pus of similar scale, configuration and size as currently exists. The Eden Medical Center is a prominent, established institutional use in Castro Valley, and has been historically located in th is area in close context with residential and commercial uses. It is reasonable to determine that development of new Modern buildings and improved roadways and landscaping throughout the Project Site to replace existing aging facilities and infrastructure would improve the aesthetic visual character of the property. The Modern, seven-story New Hospital would include large portions of pre-cast concrete elements similar to existing buildings in the surrounding area, and would include glass and structural steel curtain wall elements, which would offer an overall architectural character more contemporary than found in the immediate proximity of the Site . However, this potential variation in appearance with the additional use of glass and steel in a well-designed and functiona l approach would not constitute a degradation of the existing visual character or quality of the Project Site of the surrounding area. Stanton Avenue Character The Existing Hospital is located toward the cen ter of the Project Site, and the New Hospital would be located closer to Stanton Avenue (see Figures III-4 and III-5 , which show the existing and proposed site plan). As a result, the visual character along Stanton Avenue at the Project Site would potentially change as a result of the New Hospital being more visible and prominent from this roadway, which is the interface between the Project Site mixed-density residential neighborhoods west of Stanton Avenue. From Stant on Avenue, existing street-level view of the Project Site is characterized of the three-stor y, 42-unit Pine Cone Apartments complex, which would be demolished for the Proposed Project. The apartment complex currently has a setback of approximately 25 feet from Stanton Avenue and fronts the street. Driveways serving the Project Site currently exist abutting the apartments. This would be replaced with views of a new landscaped berm and living wall along Stanton Avenue at the Project Site. The living wall would consist of planting and landscape materials that include native Redwood trees and accent plans, as well as a seat wall. As depicted in Figure III-9 , Landscape Site Plan, the living wall would be set back approximately 54 feet from Stanton Avenue right of way and provide screening as well as noise reduction of opera tions at the loading dock and outdoor central mechanical yard (which would also be surr ounded by a solid wall and located below grade) proposed on the Stanton Avenue-facing side of th e New Hospital. The wall would be effectively IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts and Mitigation Measures B. Aesthetics Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.B-12 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 approximately 15 feet high, with a 12-foot wall on top of a 3-foot high berm that would be built up along its base. The living wall would exte nd approximately 150 feet between the two northernmost Stanton Avenue driveways to the Proj ect Site and would be a visible change to the visual character along Stanton Avenue. The pr oposed loading dock and the above-grade wall around the below-grade mechanical yard would be partially visible from Stanton Avenue through these two driveways, which would remain unobstr ucted to ensure efficient emergency access if necessary and to avoid potential traffic delays on Stanton Avenue due to trucks potentially queuing at a gate. As depicted in Figure III-5 , Proposed Site Plan and Circulation, the New Hospital would have a substantial setback from Stanton Avenue livi ng wall. The above-grade wall around the below- grade mechanical yard wall would be set back approximately 25 feet from the Stanton Avenue living wall (79 feet from Stanton Avenue right-of-way). The westernmost facade of the New Hospital (three-level base podium in which the loading dock would be recessed) would be set back approximately 115 feet behind the Stanton Avenue living wall (169 feet from Stanton Avenue right-of-way). The New Hospital tower w ould be set back approximately 220 feet from the Stanton Avenue living wall (274 feet from Stanton Avenue right-of-way). Therefore, the upper floors of the New Hospital would likely be visible from close-in views from Stanton Avenue adjacent to the Project Site, as they w ould from most offsite viewpoints in the Castro Valley area (as is the Existing Hospital). With introduction of the substantial new land scaped elements (berm and living wall) along Stanton Avenue where the Pine Cone Apartment complex currently exist, the Proposed Project would not degrade the visual character of this area compared to existing conditions, even with opportunities for the loading area and the above-g rade wall around the below-grade mechanical yard to be viewed through two driveways that will be remain unobstructed for emergency access and traffic function along Stanton Avenue. Character and Quality of Proposed New Buildings As discussed previously, the Proposed Project w ill construct new Modern buildings and entail overall improvements to roadways, sidewalks, landscaping and other high-quality site amenities throughout the Project Site, which will replace existing aging facilities and infrastructure. The New Hospital is designed to avoid imposing facades, and the preliminary exterior building fa\u00e7ade materials - primarily glass and steel curtain walls - and proposed fenestration (windows, doors and other openings) have a Modern archit ectural vocabulary. The New Hospital would have a signature entry within a glass curtain wa ll element at the lobby areas on each level and a full spire element to emphasize the main entry, and an angled roof element. The New MOB would be a rectilinear four-story building with similar architectural vocabulary of steel and glass curtain walls similar to the New Hospital building. Overall, the Proposed Project would maintain the visual character of a relatively low-density medical campus within a residential and related commercial use area. However, new buildings a nd site improvements would create a noticeable change in the appearance of the Site, but woul d not degrade the existing visual character or quality of the surrounding area compared to existing conditions. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts and Mitigation Measures B. Aesthetics Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.B-13 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Summary In summary, the visual character of the Proj ect Site would be noticeable as viewed from a neighborhood-level scale, as well as from close-in, street-level points along Stanton Avenue, however, it would not substantially degrade the exis ting visual character or quality of the Site or its surroundings. The Proposed Project would deve lop substantial new structures (New Hospital and New MOB), replacing buildings that are in va rious stages of decline (Existing Hospital and New MOBs), and would improve common circula tion and surface parking areas that are highly visible from key public locations. Mitigation: None required. _________________________ Impact AES-3: The Proposed Project would temporarily reduce the existing visual character or quality of large areas within th e Project Site visible to adjacent residential uses. (Potentially Significant) The Project Site is visible from several close-in and distant locations given the relatively high elevation of the north and western portions of the Site compared to surround areas to the east and south. The Project Site would be readily visible from surrounding residences throughout the approximately 4.5 years (or up to 6 years under the Subsequent New MOB Scenario) that Project Site development (e.g., trenching and grading) and building demolition a nd construction activities would occur. Large areas of the Project Site would be dominated by construction activities at a given time, including demolition/deconstruction of the Existing Hospital and Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital, Site preparation and c onstruction of the New Hospital and New MOB, and grading and surfacing of new surface parki ng lots. Extensive landscaping would not be installed during construction to avoid prematur e damage or subsequent removal due to ongoing construction activity. However, initial feature land scaping would be installed in early Phase 2, as shown in Figure III-10b , Phase 2 Plan. Construction vehicle and equipment staging may also be located in visible areas of the Site during these large-scale activities. While current responsible construction management and c ontracting practices typically result in practices and operations that maintain \"neat\" and organized construction s ites, the duration and direct visibility of large areas of construction activities from residences and distant viewpoints by the public, would result in a potentially significant temporary impact. The following mitigation measure is identified to address this impact: Mitigation Measure AES-3: Construction Period Visual Improvements Plan. The Project Sponsor shall develop and impl ement a Construction Period Visual Improvements Plan (Plan) that would make visual improvements to construction zones within a given construction phase and between phases if the zone is not scheduled for construction activity and wo uld remain unused for a period of greater than six (6) months. Alameda County shall define the construction zones subject to this mitigation measure and shall consider the size of the area, the nature of the construction activity, and the proximity or visibility of the area to the public vantage points or residential uses. The Plan shall be implemented by the project contractor(s) IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts and Mitigation Measures B. Aesthetics Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.B-14 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 and must be approved by Alameda County. The intent of the Plan is to aesthetically improve portions of the Project Site th at would remain unimproved for an extended period and screen the construction zone from view by passersby along the public streets and sidewalks, or to make the zone usable for hospital employees, patients, and the public. Possible improvements in the Plan include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) The Project Sponsor shall clear a construc tion zone of construction debris and remove construction equipment whenever co nstruction is not anticipated for at least two weeks. 2) If a site is a construction zone, but no construction activities are scheduled for more than one month, the Project Spons or shall be responsible for regular garbage removal and watering of any existing landscaping. 3) The Project Sponsor shall remove or visu ally treat fencing around construction zones that front onto Stanton Avenue, and the northern and southern property line, in a manner deemed acceptable by Alameda County, to promote safety. 4) The Project Sponsor shall install all land scaping as early as possible to decrease visual impacts of construction, however the timing of installation shall be determined in accordance with the ov erall construction schedule to ensure landscaping is not damaged or removed due to ongoing subsequent construction phase activities. Significance After Mitigation: Less than Significant ________________________ Light and Glare Impact AES-4: The Proposed Project could in crease reflective surfaces at the Project Site, and therefore potentially increase glare aff ecting nearby residences and motorists. (Potentially Significant) Light The Proposed Project may increase the amount of ni ghttime lighting on the Project Site as a result of the architectural treatment of the New Hosp ital and New MOB, as well as the relative location the New Hospital relative to nighttime light-sens itive uses compared to the Existing Hospital. However, the Proposed Project would not substantially increase the total amount of nighttime lighting above levels typical of and comm only accepted for developed areas and for 24-hour medical campus facility. As with the existing Project Site, lighting will be provided along internal roadways and parking areas, pedestrian path, and building and service entr ies to buildings. In particular, there is the potential for vehicle headlights to cast light peri odically into the rear yards of single family residences immediately north of the new north parking lot proposed on the Laurel Grove IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts and Mitigation Measures B. Aesthetics Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.B-15 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Rehabilitation Hospital site after demolition. While not significant, this effect would be reduced with Mitigation Measure NOI-4(k) (construction of a solid wall north of the proposed parking lot). The highest lighting levels will occur at building entries and in parking areas to enhance safety. The New Hospital will include some decora tive exterior lights, such as LED lighting to accent the building edge. The Proposed Project will adhere to the Alamed a County Lighting Guidelines to ensure lighting on the Project Site is sensitive to neighboring land uses and minimize energy use. In addition, the Proposed Project's sustainability goals direct that outdoor lighting be limited to reduce light pollution. To achieve this, all lighting will be recessed or aimed down with full-cut-off luminaries to avoid light spill to offsite areas, as well as mo tion-controlled where feasible. The New Hospital would incorporate dark, low-reflective exterior glass on patient room windows to reduce interior light transmission to outside of the building. Further, the even distribution of low lighting levels across the Project Site is an important factor for safety and visibility of staff, patient and visitor safety. Glare Exterior treatment of the proposed structures has not been finalized as of preparation of this EIR. The New Hospital and New MOB in particular could create new source of light and glare if reflective exterior materials are utilized. Daytim e reflection can great glare when it reflects off flat and reflective building surfaces. This coul d adversely affect adjacent residences as well as local motorists, therefore, the Proposed Project would result in a potentially significant impact regarding potentially increased glare in a predominately residential area. The following mitigation measure is identified to address this impact: Mitigation Measure AES-4: Treat Reflective Surfaces . The Project Sponsor shall ensure application of low-emissivity coating on ext erior glass surfaces of all new structures to reduce visible light reflection on the exterior surface and prevent interior light from emitting brightly through the glass exterior. Significance After Mitigation: Less than Significant ________________________ Shadow Impact AES-5: The Proposed Project would change existing shadow effects but would not substantially degrade the existing visual char acter or quality of the site or its surrounding uses or reduce adequate sunlight to residential uses. (Less than Significant) CEQA Guidelines Appendix G does not identify potential shadow effects as an environmental impact, however, Alameda County has considered th at the Proposed Project's change in shadow patterns on existing residential uses immediately nor th of the Project Site, adjacent to the New Hospital and New MOB, could potentially result in adverse environmental effects and therefore IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts and Mitigation Measures B. Aesthetics Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.B-16 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 has included this shadow analysis in the EIR.4 The significance threshold considers whether the change in shadow cast by the Proposed Project would substantially degrade the existing visual character or visual quality of the site or its surrounding uses or reduce adequate sunlight to residential uses. To consider the potential changes in shadow cast from the Proposed Project, shadow studies were prepared for representative times of day (9:00 a.m., 12:00 noon, and 3:00 p.m.) during the following four times of year: Spring Equinox (March 21st), when shadows ar e midway through a period of shortening; Summer Solstice (June 21st), when the sun is at its highest and shadows are shortest; Autumn Equinox (September 21st), when shadows are midway through a period of lengthening; and Winter Solstice (December 21st), when the sun is at its lowest and shadows are longest. This analysis includes shadow studies for the seasons and hours when adjacent residential areas are most affected by shadows, under Existing Conditions ( Figures IV.B-4a , through IV.B-8a ) as well as the Proposed Project ( Figures IV.B-4b through IV.B-8b ). Under existing conditions, shadows are only cast be yond the boundaries of the Project Site by the one-story Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hosp ital in Spring and Autumn mornings (see Figures IV.B-4a and IV.B-5a) and all hours of the day in Winter (see Figures IV.B-6a, IV.B-7a, and IV.B-8a ). These shadows primarily occur at the nor theast corner of the Project Site. The worst-case existing shadow occurs in Winter, par ticularly when it extends northward onto single family rear yards and residences. During existing Winter morning conditions, most of the apartment building to the north of where the Ne w Hospital will be built is enveloped by shadow created by the apartment complex itself. With the Proposed Project, the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital w ould be demolished and replaced with a new surface parking lot, thus th e existing Winter shadows would no longer occur. New shadows would be cast beyond the boundaries of the Project Site from the New Hospital - both the podium and the tower - and at some times of year, the New MOB. The new shadows would fall on small areas on the southern edge of the existing apartment complex located immediate north of the new buildings during the morning hours throughout the year (see Figures IV.B-4b, IV.B-5b, and IV.B-6b ). During Winter months, shadows would fall on a small area of the apartments, including a central swimming pool area, throughout the day, and across the entire apartment complex in the morning (see Figures IV.B-6b, IV.B-7b, and IV.B-8b ). These worst-case Winter shadows are cast by both the New Hospital and the MOB in the mornings and only by the New Hospital the rest of the day as shadows shift eastward. However, as stated above, the apartment complex to the north is currently in shadow cast by the apartment 4 CEQA does identify that a significant environmental effect c ould potentially result if a proposed project creates new or increased shadow that, as a result, would adversely affect a protected biological habitat or species, for example. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts and Mitigation Measures B. Aesthetics Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.B-17 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 complex itself. Shadow cast by the Proposed Proj ect largely covers areas already in shadow and therefore does not substantially increase existing conditions. As discussed above, the Project Sponsor considered a number of factors during the process of designing the New Hospital. A key factor was the goal of minimizing the height of the building and its resulting shadow cast on adjacent residentia l uses to the north. Two draft building designs were considered that also proposed a tower atop a podium. Both designs included a 4-5-story, three-arm tower (in site plan view) situated at the east end of a two-story podium. However, the Project Sponsor continued to modify the building design in an effort to shift the tower further south and east, into the center portion of the Project Site. This shift is reflected in the design of the New Hospital. The New Hospita l also reflects a change to a two-arm tower layout. Compared to the proposed two-arm layout, the third-arm previously considered in both draft building designs would cast greater shadow on the residentia l apartments to the north because the third leg would extend further north and west atop the podium. The New Hospital design reflects the effort to mitigate potential shadow effects associated with initial design development stages of the building. In summary, the Proposed Project would not create substantial new shadow that would substantially degrade the existing surrounding visu al character or quality compared to existing conditions. As described in the Visual Setting , above, the overall character of the area surrounding the Eden Medical Center on the Project Site is a mix of residential uses, medical services, and commercial businesses. The surrounding ar ea is fully developed with buildings of various types, massing/height, and use. Developmen t of different use and buildings characteristics frequently exist adjacent to each other. The cha nge in shadows cast from the Project Site to residential uses to the north will not adversely a ffect the existing, established mixed use character of the Project Site or surroundings or the quality of the area's appearance. Nor would the Proposed Project substantially reduce adequate light to residential uses compared to existing conditions. The existing Winter shadow cas t by the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital on adjacent single family yards and residences w ould no longer occur as the structure would be demolished and replaced with a landscaped surf ace parking lot that would not cast shadow. Increased shadow affecting the existing apartment complex to the north of the New Hospital would be cast by the New Hospital in Winter mornings when the sun is low and shadows are naturally most pronounced ( Figure IV.B-6b ), but the effect would diminish so that it only affects the southeast area of the complex by noon ( Figure IV.B-7b ). Public common areas and light sensitive areas, such as the central swimming pool area, would not be in shadow cast by the Proposed Project in any times of year when this area would likely be in use. Furthermore, most of the apartment building is currently enveloped by shadow created by the complex itself during the Winter morning hours. Shadow cast by the Proposed Project largely covers areas already in shadow. Therefore, the new shadow would not substantially reduce adequate sunlight to th e residential property to impair its use. The shadow impact resulting from the Pr oposed Project would be less than significant. Mitigation: None required. ________________________ MARCH 20 9:00 AMEXISTING EDEN MEDICAL CENTEREXISTING M.O.B.EXISTING LAUREL GROVE HOSPITAL EXISTING PARKING GARAGE EXISTING M.O.B.

Environmental Setting, Im pacts and Mitigation Measures B. Aesthetics Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.B-28 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Cumulative Impacts Impact AES-6: The Proposed Project, co mbined with past, present and reasonably foreseeable future projects, would not result in a significant cumulative aesthetics impact. (Less than Significant) Geographic Context and Other Projects The geographic context considered for the cu mulative aesthetics impacts includes the surrounding area that could have the potential to combine with the Project Site area and result in cumulative aesthetics impacts. Given the nature of the pot ential impacts analyzed for this topic, the geographic scope would include the Castro Valle y Central Business District Subareas 4 through 5, and the residential and mixed use areas extendi ng north, east and west of the Project Site for approximately three blocks (the distance to Castro Valley Boulevard). Past projects in this area are included in the existing setting described in this section and in Chapter III, Project Description. Present projects would include any projects currently under construction within the geographic context area. None are identified as of preparation of this EIR. Reasonably foreseeable future projects are those that could be developed or occur in the geographic context area by 2030. Discussion There are no present projects under construction within the cumulative geographic context area in proximity to the Project Site that could result in a significant cumulative aesthetics effect. Also, reasonably foreseeable future projects would likely be redevelopment of small to medium parcels along the Central Business District corridor along Castro Valley Road, or potential redevelopment of commercial properties along Lake Chabot Road, between Castro Valley Road and the Project Site, including the redevelopmen t of nearby sites by the Eden Township Healthcare District, separate from the Proposed Project. All foreseeable development would be, subject to development guidance contained within the General Plan, Specific Plan and/or the Alameda County Zoning Ordinance . The County's site development review process will review projects against criteria that ensure aesthetic co mpatibility of the development with its setting. Therefore, it is not anticipated that the Proposed Project, when considered with other past, present or reasonably foreseeable future development in the area, would result in a cumulative impact with respect to aesthetics, particular as no speci fic future development of significant scale to combine effects with the Proposed Project is known. Thus, the Proposed Project would not result in a significant cumulative aesthetics impact. Mitigation: None required. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts and Mitigation Measures B.

Transportation, Circulation, and Parking1 Setting Existing Street and Highway System2 The project study area is served by regional and local roadways, as described below. Regional Access Interstate 580 (I-580) is an east-west freeway between US 101 in the North Bay city of San Rafael to I-5 near the city of Tracy in the Cent ral Valley. In Castro Valley I-580 is generally a ten-lane freeway with a 65 mph speed limit a nd an average annual average daily traffic volume (AADT) of about 200,000 vehicles per day (Ca ltrans, 2006). The Stanton Avenue/Strobridge Avenue Interchange provides the nearest access to the Project Site. Other access points in Castro Valley include ramps at Redwood Road, Center Street/Grove Way, and East Castro Valley Boulevard. Interstate 238 (I-238) is a four-lane east-west freeway that extends from I-580 west to I-880. At its I-580 terminus, I-238 turns southward and c ontinues as a state highway through Hayward and Union City to Fremont. I-238 has an AADT of 135, 000 vehicles (Caltrans, 2006) near the Project Site and a posted speed limit of 65 mph. Local Access Key local roadways that provide access to th e Project Site are described below. Castro Valley Boulevard is an east-west arterial that generally parallels I-580 through Castro Valley. It varies in width from four to six lanes through the project study area. Castro Valley Boulevard is designated as a part of the Me tropolitan Transportation System (MTS) by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC). Lake Chabot Road is a north-south arterial that extends from Castro Valley Boulevard in Castro Valley to Estudillo Avenue in San Leandro. It vari es in width from two to four lanes, with a four- lane cross section through the project study area. It has a posted 40 mph speed limit in the project study area. Stanton Avenue is a north-south two-lane collector that extends from Castro Valley Boulevard to Crest Avenue in Castro Valley. It has a posted 30 mph speed limit through the project study area. 1 This EIR section was prepared on the basis of informa tion and analysis findings co ntained a technical resource document (Fehr & Peers Transportation Consultants, Castro Valley Sutter Medical Center Project Traffic Study , November 2008. 2 For the purposes of this study, Stanton Avenue, Lake Ch abot Road, Redwood Road and other parallel roadways are assumed to be north-south oriented. Other roadways, su ch as Somerset Avenue, Castro Valley Boulevard and Norbridge Avenue, are assumed to be east-west oriented. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C.

It has a posted 25 mph speed limit through the project study area. Existing Traffic Conditions The traffic conditions in urban areas are affected mo re by the operations at the intersections than by the capacities of the local streets because traffic control devices (signals and stop signs) at intersections control the capacity of the street segments. The operations are measured in terms of a grading system called Level of Service (LOS ), which is based on average vehicle delay experienced at the intersections. That delay is a function of the signal timing, intersection lane widths and configuration, hourly traffic volu mes, pedestrian volumes, and parking and bus conflicts. Weekday morning (7:00 to 9:00 AM) and evening (4:00 to 6:00 PM) peak period intersection turning movement counts were conducte d at the study intersections in April 2008, while area schools were in normal session. Data concerning the existing intersection configurations and control were collected in the field. 3 Level of Service Analysis Methodologies As described above, the operation of a local roadway network is commonly measured and described using an LOS grading system, whic h qualitatively characterizes traffic conditions associated with varying levels of vehicle traffi c, ranging from LOS A (indicating free-flow traffic conditions with little or no delay experienced by motorists) to LOS F (indicating congested conditions where traffic flows exceed design capacity and result in long queues and delays). This LOS grading system applies to both signalized and unsignalized intersections. LOS A to C are generally considered satisfactory service levels, while the influence of congestion becomes more noticeable (though still considered acceptable) at LOS D. LOS E and F are generally considered to be unacceptable, though some jurisdictions a nd agencies consider LOS E to be acceptable. Signalized Intersections At the signalized study intersections, traffi c conditions were evaluated using the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) operations methodology (Transportation Research Board (TRB) 2000). The operation analysis uses various intersection characteristics (e.g., traffic volumes, lane geometry, and signal phasing/timing) to estimat e the average control delay experienced by motorists traveling through an intersection. Table IV.C-1 summarizes the relationship between control delay and LOS. Unsignalized Intersections For the unsignalized (all-way stop-controlled and si de-street stop-controlled) study intersections, traffic conditions were evaluated using the 2000 HCM operations methodology. With this methodology, the LOS is related to the total delay per vehicle for the intersection as a whole (for all-way stop-controlled intersections), and for each stop-controlled movement or approach only 3 The existing traffic count data sheets are provided in Appendix A of the Sutter Medical Center-Castro Valley Hospital Replacement Transpor tation Report, November 2008.

Most vehicles do not stop at all. Operations with minor delay. >10.0 and 15.0 B >10.0 and 20.0 Stable Operation or Minimal Delays: Generally occurs with good signal progression and/or short cycle lengths. More vehicles stop than with LOS A, causing higher levels of average delay. An occasional approach phase is fully utilized. Operations with moderate delays. >15.0 and 25.0 C >20.0 and 35.0 Stable Operation or Acceptable Delays: Higher delays resulting from fair signal progression and/or longer cycle lengths. Drivers begin having to wait through more than one red light. Most drivers feel somewhat restricted. Operations with increasingly unacceptable delays. >25.0 and 35.0 D >35.0 and 55.0 Approaching Unstable or Tolerable Delays: Influence of conges tion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays result from unfavorable signal progression, long cycle lengths, or high volume to capacity ratios. Many vehicles stop. Drivers may have to wait through more than one red light. Queues may develop, but dissipate rapidly, without excessive delays. Operations with high delays, and long queues. >35.0 and 50.0 E >55.0 and 80.0 Unstable Operation or Significant Delays: Considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. High delays indicate poor signal progression, long cycle lengths and high volume to capacity ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent occurrences. Vehicles may wait through several signal cycles. Long queues form upstream from intersection. Operations with extreme congestion, and with very high delays and long queues unacceptable to most drivers. >50.0 F >80.0 Forced Flow or Excessive Delays: Occurs with oversaturation when flows exceed the intersection capacity. Represents jammed conditions. Many cycle failures. Queues may block upstream intersections. SOURCE: Transportation Research Board, Special Report 209, Highway Capacity Manual , updated 2000. IV.

Tota l delay is defined as the total elapsed time from when a vehicle stops at the end of the queue until the vehicle departs from the stop line. This time includes the time required for a vehicle to travel from the last-in-queue position to the first-in- queue position. Table IV.C-1 summarizes the relationship between delay and LOS. Ramp Merge and Diverge Areas The location where the freeway mainline and an on- or off-ramp intersect is called a ramp junction. A ramp junction is an area where vehi cles compete for space as they either merge onto the freeway or diverge from the freeway. In merg e areas, upstream traffic competes with vehicles entering the freeway from the on-ramp, and in diverge areas exiting vehicles compete with vehicles continuing on the freeway in the outside lane. For the merge and diverge areas, LOS was calculated using the method from Chapter 25 of th e 2000 HCM. This method considers peak hour traffic volumes, free-flow speeds, percentage of h eavy vehicles, and the number of travel lanes, as well as the interaction between the merge and diverge areas and the freeway mainline. These factors are used to determine vehicle density, measured in passenger cars per mile per lane. Table IV.C-2 summarizes the relationship between vehi cle density and LOS for freeway ramp merge and diverge areas.

Transit Services The transit services in the project vicinity incl ude options such as AC Transit bus service, and BART trains. Each of these services is described below. Bus Service (AC Transit) AC Transit currently provides service to the Project Site vicinity via three routes. Each of these routes also provides service to the Castro Valley BART station. Specific route information is provided below: Route 80 buses run along Castro Valley Road, Norbridge Avenue, and Redwood Road in the project study area, with bus stops on Castro Valle y Boulevard at Lake Chabot Road. Service is provided between about 5:00 AM and 8:00 PM on weekdays, and between 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM on weekends. Buses run on 30 and 60 minute headways on weekdays and weekends, respectively. Route 84 buses run along Somerset Avenue, Norbri dge Avenue, and Redwood Road in the project study area, with bus stops on Somerset Av enue at Lake Chabot Road. Service is provided between about 5:00 AM and 9:00 PM on wee kdays, and between 8:00 AM and 9:00 PM on weekends. Buses run on 30 and 60 minute headways on weekdays and weekends, respectively. Route 87 buses run along Lake Chabot Road, Castro Valley Boulevard, Norbridge Avenue, and Redwood Road in the project study area, with a bus stop at the Project Site on Lake Chabot Road. Service is provided between about 8:00 AM a nd 4:00 PM on weekdays only, with 60-minute headways. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-9 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Rail Service (BART) BART provides regional rail service throughout the East Bay and across the Bay to San Francisco and the Peninsula. The closest BART station to the Project Site is the Castro Valley BART Station, located on Redwood Road at Norbridge Drive, about 1.5 miles from the Project Site. The Dublin-Pleasanton line provides ser vice at the Castro Valley BART Station. This line provides direct service to Oakland, San Francisco, and the San Francisco International Airport. The adjacent station at Bayfair is a transfer point for the Dublin-Pleasanton, Fremont and Richmond lines. Bicycle / Pedestrian Network Bicycle and pedestrian facilities can be classifi ed into several general types, including: Class I Paths - These facilities are located off-street and can serve both bicyclists and pedestrians. Recreational trails can be considered Class I facilities. Class I paths are typically 8 to 10 feet wide excluding shoulders and are generally paved. Class II Bicycle Lanes - These facilities provide a dedicated ar ea for bicyclists within the paved street width through the use of striping and appropriate signage. These facilities are typically 4 to 6 feet wide. Class III Bicycle Routes - These facilities are found along streets that do not provide sufficient width for dedicated bicycle lanes. The street is then designated as a bicycle route through the use of signage informing drivers to expect bicyclists. Sidewalks - The exclusive realm of pedestrians, sidewalks provide pedestrian access and circulation. Sidewalks can vary in width from 5 to 20 feet; wider sidewalks are typically found in heavily urbanized and downtown areas. In the vicinity of the Project site, class II bike lanes are provided on John Drive. The Alameda Countywide Bicycle Plan was adopted by the Alameda County Congestion Management Agency in October, 2006. The Plan proposes the addition of several bike facilities in Castro Valley that would provide improved connectivity to the existing network. Class II and Class III bicycle facilities are proposed along Redwoo d Road, Castro Valley Boulevard, Somerset Avenue, Lake Chabot Road, Heyer Ave nue, Cull Canyon Road, and Grove Way. Pedestrian facilities include sidewalks, crossw alks, and pedestrian signals. Sidewalks are provided on all of the existing roadways in the study area. Signalized intersections in the vicinity of the Project Site provide striped cros swalks and pedestrian signal heads. The Alameda County Pedestrian Master Plan for Unincorporated Areas, adopted in July 2006, addresses pedestrian-related issues in Castro Valle y. The plan identifies key pedestrian activity corridors in the study area including Castro Valley Boulevard, Redwood Road, Lake Chabot Road, and Somerset Avenue. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-10 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Impacts Discussion Approach to Analysis The transportation analysis was conducted for ty pical weekday AM and PM peak commute hour conditions at local intersections and on the regi onal roadway facilities. Those time periods are the most relevant for this analysis because traffi c volumes are generally the highest during those periods, and therefore, traffic and circulation conditions during the wee kday morning and evening commute hours are considered the most critical to evaluate in determining potentially significant impacts. In addition, standard traffic analy tical tools focus on the weekday peak hours or multiple-hour peak periods. Localized peaks may o ccur during other periods of the day or on the weekends depending upon the adjacent land uses, such as schools or entertainment uses, but those instances do not represent the best overall conditio n against which to judge potential impacts associated with the Proposed Project. The same reas oning applies to analysis of transit impacts, which were likewise judged in the context of average weekday peak-hour conditions. The Proposed Project would be developed in phases over a period of approximately 4.5 years, starting in mid-2009 with planned completion by the end of 2013 (buildout). (The Subsequent MOB Scenario, in which the New MOB would be developed after completion of the New Hospital, would require up to 6 years.) In cons ultation with Alameda County staff, three study horizon years were identified including Existing B aseline (existing traffic counts); 2015 Baseline; and 2035 Baseline. The Project buildout is anal yzed in all three study horizons because it represents reasonable worse case conditions from a transportation impact perspective. The six study scenarios are: Existing Existing with Project 2015 No Project 2015 With Project 2035 No Project 2035 With Project Significance Criteria Intersection Peak-Hour Level of Service The Proposed Project would have a significant impact on the environment if it would: Cause an increase in traffic which is substantial in relation to the traffic load and capacity of the street system (i.e., result in a substantial incr ease in either the number of vehicle trips, the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) on roads, or congest ion at intersections), or change the condition of an existing street (e.g., street closures, cha nging direction of travel) in a manner that would substantially impact access or traffic load and capacity of the street system, as defined below: at a study, signalized intersection, the proj ect would cause the level of service (LOS) to degrade to worse than LOS D (i.e., E); IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-11 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 at a study, signalized intersection where the level of service is LOS E, the project would cause the total intersection average vehicle delay to increase by four (4) or more seconds, or degrade to worse than LOS E (i.e., F); at a study, signalized intersection where the level of service is LOS E, the project would cause an increase in the average delay for any of the critical movements of six (6) seconds or more, or degrade to worse than LOS E (i.e., F); at a study, signalized intersection where the level of service is LOS F, the project would cause (a) the total intersection average vehicle delay to increase by two (2) or more seconds, or (b) an increase in average delay for any of the critical movements of four (4) seconds or more; or (c) the volume-to-capacity (\"V/C\") ratio exceeds three (3) percent (but only if the delay values cannot be measured accurately); At a study, unsignalized intersection the project would add ten (10) or more vehicles and after project completion satisfy the Caltrans peak hour volume warrant; a project's contribution to cumulative impacts is considered \"considerable\" (i.e., significant) when the project exceeds at least one of the intersection-related thresholds listed above in thresholds for years 2015 or 2035. Freeway Ramp Merge / Diverge Peak-Hour Level of Service At study ramp merge / diverge location, cause th e study location traffic density to deteriorate from LOS E to LOS F or increase the V/C ratio by more than three (3) percent for a location that would operate at LOS F without the Proposed Project (but only if the density values cannot be measured accurately). Roadway Segments The Proposed Project would have a significant effect on regional roadways if it would cause a roadway segment on the Metropolitan Transportation System to operate at LOS F or increase the v/c ratio by more than three percent for a roadwa y segment that would operate at LOS F without the Proposed Project. 5 The roadway analysis uses the 2015 and 2035 baseline forecasts from the Alameda County Congestion Management Ag ency (ACCMA) Countywide Travel Demand Forecasting Model, which capture the cumulative e ffects of future growth on the regional roadways. Transit The Proposed Project would have a significant e ffect on transit services if it would generate added transit ridership that would: Increase the average ridership on AC Transit lines by three percent at bus stops where the average load factor with the Proposed Pr oject in place would exceed 125 percent over a peak 30-minute period; 5 LOS and delay are based on the Highway Capacity Manual , Transportation Research Board, National Research Council, 1985, as required by the Alameda County CMA. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-12 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Increase the peak-hour average ridership on BA RT by three percent where the passenger volume would exceed the standing capacity of BART trains; or Increase the peak-hour average ridership at a BART station by three percent where average waiting time at fare gates would exceed one minute. Site Access and Circulation The Proposed Project would have a significant effect on the site access and circulation if it would increase traffic hazards to motor vehicles, bicycles, or pedestrians due to a design feature (e.g., sharp curves or dangerous intersections) that do es not comply with Caltrans design standards (as defined by the latest edition of the Caltrans Highway Design Manual ), or due to incompatible uses. For the purposes of this study, when Caltr ans design standards were unavailable or unclear, then other documents, such as A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets , the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), and other design manuals, were used (AASHTO, 2001; FHWA, 2000). Pedestrian Safety The Proposed Project would have a si gnificant effect on pedestrian sa fety if it would substantially increase traffic hazards to pedestrians due to introdu ction of incompatible uses or to a design feature (e.g., sharp curves or dangerous intersections) that does not comply with Caltrans design standards. Other Considerations The Proposed Project would have a significant effect on the environment if it would fundamentally conflict with adopted policies, plans, or programs supporting alternative transportation (e.g., bus turnouts, bicycle racks). Construction Period The Proposed Project would have a significant, though temporary, effect on the environment if it would result in interim significant impacts based on the criteria above during the construction period. For purposes of this analysis, the poten tial impacts resulting from phasing and staging of Proposed Project construction, and cumu lative construction, have been assessed. Local Plans and Policies Alameda County General Plan policies and other applicable plans and policies that pertain to the topics addressed in this section, and that appl y to the Proposed Project, are discussed in Section IV.A, Land Use, Plans, and Policie s. General Plan policies that are also significance criteria or contain a regulatory threshold, which the Proposed Project must meet, are addressed in this section. Additional local plans and policies relevant to transportation are also discussed throughout this section. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-13 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Planned Roadway Improvements Improvements are planned for some transportation modes in the study area, as described below. However, those improvements lacking final desi gn and full funding are not available to mitigate any deficient conditions in either the No Project or With Project condition. Roadway Improvements The following roadway improvements are curre ntly programmed for implementation by the County of Alameda in the study area: Signalize the Castro Valley Boulevard/Wister ia Avenue intersection. The project is scheduled within the next two years and woul d be funded with County traffic fees. The I-580/Redwood Road interchange on- and off-ra mps. This improvement project is fully funded; design is completed, and is expected to start construction in the near future. The following proposals have not been approved, and funding sources have not been identified, and therefore, the impact analysis for the pr oposed SMCCV Project does not take it into account: Road improvements on the Strobridge Avenue corridor (south of Castro Valley Boulevard) are under consideration. The County expects to have several design concepts defined in the near future. Changes in this area will requ ire coordination with both Caltrans and the Federal Highway Administration because I-580 is pa rt of the federal interstate system. As such, the timing of these changes can not be defined. One element of these changes may be installation of a traffic signal at the Strobridge Avenue/I-580 Westbound Off-Ramp intersection. Transit Improvements No funded transit service expansions are planned for the Project Site. Bicycle/Pedestrian Improvements The Alameda Countywide Bicycle Plan was adopted by the Alameda County Congestion Management Agency in October, 2006. The Plan proposes the addition of several bike facilities in Castro Valley that would provide improved connectivity to the existing network. Class II and Class III bicycle facilities are proposed along Redwoo d Road, Castro Valley Boulevard, Somerset Avenue, Lake Chabot Road, Heyer Ave nue, Cull Canyon Road, and Grove Way. The Alameda County Pedestrian Master Plan for Unincorporated Areas, adopted in July 2006, addresses pedestrian-related issues in Castro Valle y. The plan identifies key pedestrian activity corridors in the study area including Castro Valley Boulevard, Redwood Road, Lake Chabot Road, and Somerset Avenue. In addition, the Castro Valley General Plan acknowledges that there is a strong community desire to make central Castro Valley a more pedestrian friendly retail environment in order to change IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-14 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 the character and image of Castro Valley Boulevard (Goal 6.7-1). General Plan Goal 6.7-1 is intended to provide an enhanced pedestrian environment along Castro Valley Boulevard. Vehicle Trip Generation The Proposed Project would include replacement of the Existing Hospital (235,000 square feet) with the New Hospital of approximately the same size (230,000 square feet); construction of a new 80,000-square foot medical office building (New MOB); and demolition of four smaller one- story medical office buildings (MOBs), Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital (approximately 45,000 square feet), and a 42-unit apartment co mplex. The Proposed Project also includes additional parking supplied at the former Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital site (for employee use), at the former Existing Hospital site, and a vehicle bridge connecting the 5th level of the existing parking garage to the main campus. Th e existing medical center has approximately 995 usable parking spaces. The Proposed Project would increase that number to 1,239 parking spaces. Traffic generation at the Project Site would cha nge with the Proposed Project. Traffic reductions would occur because of the removal of existing uses, and traffic additions would occur because of the construction of additional facilities. The Ins titute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), Trip Generation, 7th Edition provides vehicle trip gene ration information for the residential uses and the MOB uses. Using ITE vehicle trip generation rates for the hospital-related uses is not appropriate because while the Proposed Project would construct 230, 000 square feet of New Hospital, it would demolish about 280,000 square feet of Existing Ho spital (Eden Medical Center Hospital is about 235,000 square feet and Laurel Gr ove Rehabilitation Hospital is about 45,000 square feet). Using a rate based on square footage or number of be ds would lead to the New Hospital generating less traffic than what currently exists. Employment a nd patient characteristics were evaluated to better understand the implications of the demolition of the Existing Hospital uses and the construction of the New Hospital. As shown in Table IV.C-5 , the hospital-related employment and outpatient/emergency room populati on levels that exist today at the two existing hospitals will be similar to those in the futu re with the New Hospital. The decrease in hospital-related employment leve ls for the day shift (about 63 staff) could translate to a reduction in commute period traffic. The increased day shift patient activity (about 41 patients) would likely increase mid day vehicl e trips. While this study's focus is on the commute periods, no reductions to reflect the net reduction in day shift population were made to hospital-related vehicle trips. Taking this approach ensures that the offsite intersection analysis presents a conservative estimate of traffic impacts i.e., the hospital-related trips are already on the roadway today. As shown in Table IV.C-6 , the Proposed Project is expected to generate approximately 1,780 net new daily trips, 125 AM peak hour trips (112 inbound and 13 outbound) and 184 PM peak hour trips (33 inbound and 151 outbound).

IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-16 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Project Trip Distribution/Assignment The directions of approach and departure for the Proposed Project are based on a distribution pattern developed using existi ng traffic data as well as the ACCMA Regional Travel Demand Model. This method considers roadway capacity, trip type, and the locations of major attractions and sources of trip productions. A bout 60 percent of the site-generated traffic was distributed to the west, 21 percent to the north, 16 percent to th e east, and 3 percent locally to the south. The vehicle trip distribution pattern at the Project Site is shown in Appendix C.1 ( Figure 7 ) and takes into consideration the location of new parking sp aces at the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital site and the garage connection to the main campus parking area. Trips generated by the Proposed Project were assigned to the roadway system based on the direction of approach and departure as described above. The peak hour project trip assignment is shown Appendix C.1 ( Figure 8 ). The negative trips on Figure 8 represent the net trips that would be subtracted with the removal of the Pine C one Apartment Complex. In general, trips were assigned to the most direct route to the Project Site. Intersection Impacts Existing With Project Volumes The analysis of intersection impacts followed the process typically used by the County to prepare environmental analyses. Impacts under Existing With Project conditions were analyzed by layering the net new peak hour project vehicle trips onto the existing peak hour baseline volumes. Project trips were distributed and assigned at study intersections as described above. 2015 and 2035 Baseline Volumes The main inputs to the 2035 forecasting pro cess were the model outputs from the standard Alameda County Congestion Management Agen cy (ACCMA) regional travel demand model (with land use as received) and the existing traffic counts. The ACCMA model produces roadway segment volumes. These forecasted segment volumes were used as an input into the \"Furnessing\" process, which \"grows\" existing turning movement volumes to reflect increases in roadway segment volumes. Both ACCMA models for 2005 and 2035 were run. The 2005 model generally corres ponds to the existing level of development within the project study area. The growth between 2005 and 2035 was determined on a \"screenline\" basis, looking at the followi ng sets of parallel roadway movements: Somerset Avenue and Castro Valley Bo ulevard, east of Lake Chabot Road Castro Valley Boulevard, Strobridge Ave nue and Redwood Road, north and northeast of I-580 Stanton Avenue, Lake Chabot Road, and Redwood Road, north of Somerset Avenue IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-17 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Directional growth rates from 2005 to 2035 for each segment were determined by looking at the overall volume growth between the two model runs across each screenline. The roadway segment growth between the 2005 and 2035 models was th en added to the existing turning movements based on the existing proportions between le ft-turn/through/right-turn movements for all approaches of each study intersection. The 2015 Baseline traffic volumes were then de termined by linear interpolation between the existing and 2035 traffic volumes. 2015 and 2035 Baseline Roadway/Intersection Improvements Two roadway improvements were assumed for the Year 2015 and 2035 Baseline scenario. The new on- and off-ramps were assumed to be comp lete at the Redwood Road interchange. This improvement project is fully funded; design is co mpleted, and construction is currently expected to start within the next 6 to 12 months. The County also intends to signalize the Castro Valley Boulevard/Wisteria Street intersection. This signa lization is intended to improve both vehicle and pedestrian flows through the intersection. The project is likely to be constructed within the next two years and would be funded with County traffic fees. Roadway improvements on Strobridge Avenue (sout h of Castro Valley Boulevard) have been discussed for a number of years, and the County ex pects to have several design concepts defined in the next six months to a year. Changes in th is area will require coordination with both Caltrans and the Federal Highway Administration because I-580 is part of the federal interstate system. As such, the timing of these changes can not accurately be defined. In addition, while County traffic fees have been identified as a funding source, the fees for this improvement have not been secured. Thus, these changes are not included in the analysis. The County is working with the community to creat e a safe, comfortable and attractive pedestrian street for downtown Castro Valley. The intent is to calm the traffic environment by reconfiguring traffic lanes and providing on-street parking with bicycle lanes while maintaining adequate traffic capacity; and to create a pedestrian environment that encourages shopping, dining and entertainment. Phase I will include Castro Va lley Boulevard between Redwood Road and San Miguel Avenue. These changes were not included in the analysis because these projects would not change the vehicle capacity along Castro Valley Boulevard. Analytical Methodology The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodologies were used for the analysis of traffic operation at intersections and at ramp merge / di verge locations. For all intersections, the 2000 HCM Operations method was applied, using th e Synchro computer software program. The Highway Capacity Software (HCS) was used to evaluate the ramp merge / diverge locations. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-18 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Existing With Project Conditions - Project Impacts Traffic generated by the Proposed Project was assi gned to the local roadways and intersections as described above. See Appendix C.1 ( Figure 9 ) which illustrates the Existing With Project intersection traffic volumes. No roadway im provements were assumed to be in place under Existing With Project conditions. Also, no adjust ments were made to optimize traffic signal timings at the study intersections since no full y funded mechanism or program exists to do so. Table IV.C-8 shows changes in levels of service (and average vehicle delay) due to SMCCV Project-generated traffic at study intersecti ons under Existing and Existing With Project conditions. The following intersection would oper ate at an unacceptable level of service: #15 Castro Valley Boulevard/Wisteria Street would continue to operate at LOS F during the PM peak hour for the unsignalized southbound approach The southbound approach at this unsignalized in tersection would operate at LOS F during the PM peak hour under Existing conditions. The southbound approach would continue to operate at LOS F during the PM peak hour with the addition of project traffic. The projected volumes at this intersection would meet peak hour traffic signal wa rrants with and without project traffic. This would be a significant impact because the intersec tion would operate at an unacceptable level, the project would add ten or more project trips to th e intersection peak hour flow, and the intersection would meet the peak hour signal warrant (Wa rrant 3) without and with the project. Ramp merge and diverge operations were evalua ted for existing with Propose Project conditions at the I-580 ramp junctions at Strobridge Avenue and Castro Valley Boulevard. The results are presented in Table IV.C-7 . The I-580 ramp merge/diverge areas are expected to operate acceptably prior the addition of project traffic, and continue to operate acceptably with the addition of Project traffic.

Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-20 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Impact TRANS-1: The LOS F conditions at the unsignalized intersection of Castro Valley Boulevard /Wisteria Street (#15) calculated for the PM peak hour under existing baseline conditions, would worsen with the addition of traffic generated by the Proposed Project. The Project-generated increases would add 15 PM peak hour vehicles to the intersection. (Significant) Mitigation Measure TRANS-1: The Project Spo nsor shall install traffic signals at the unsignalized Castro Valley Boulevard / Wister ia Street intersecti on. The signals shall have actuated controls. Installation of tr affic signals shall in clude traffic signal equipment with optimized signal phasing and timing (i.e., allocation of green time for each intersection approach), and coordina tion with signal phasing and timing of adjacent signalized intersection s. Traffic signal e quipment shall include pedestrian signal heads (with adequate time for pedestrians to cross the streets). Signal installation shall meet County design standards and be subjec t to the review and approval of the County. The County intends to signalize the Castro Valley Boulevard/Wisteria Avenue intersection. The signal is likely to be installed within the next two years and would be funded with County traffic fees. The AM and PM peak hour traffic volume project contributions at this intersection are 10 and 15 vehicles respectively. Significance after Mitigation: Less than Significant _________________________ Table IV.C-9 shows levels of service (and average ve hicle delay) under mitigated conditions.

See Appendix C.1 (Figures 10 and 11) for figures showing the 2015 Without Project and With Pr oject intersection traffic volumes. Roadway improvements include the new on- and off-ramp s at the Redwood Road interchange and the installation of a traffic signal at Castro Valley Boulevard/Wisteria Street. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-21 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Impact TRANS-2a: Intersection Impact - The Pr oposed Project would add traffic to study intersections during the AM and PM peak ho urs and would increase average vehicle delay at most of the intersections. Three of the signalized study intersections would operate at LOS E, below the acceptable LOS D threshold, wi thout and with Project traffic, however, the added vehicle delay caused by the Proposed Project would not trigger a significant impact. (Less than Significant) The forecasted 2015 intersection turning movement volumes in conjunction with the estimated SMCCV Project generated traffic were used to evaluate intersection operations for the 2015 scenario. Table IV.C-10 shows the changes in levels of service (and average vehicle delay) due to SMCCV Project generated traffic at study in tersections under 2015 c onditions. All but three study intersections are projected to operate at ac ceptable levels in the 2015 No Project and With Project scenarios. The three intersections project ed to operate at unacceptable levels include: Castro Valley Boulevard/Strobridge Avenue /Stanton (intersection #8) would operate at LOS E during the AM peak hour Castro Valley Boulevard/Lake Chabot Road (intersection #9) would operate at LOS E during the AM peak hour and LOS E during the PM peak hour Castro Valley Boulevard/Redwood Road (inter section #12) would operate at LOS E during the PM peak hour These three intersections would continue to operate at the same LOS levels with the Proposed Project. The change in vehicle delay, howev er, would not trigger a significant impact. Mitigation: None required. _________________________ Impact TRANS-2b: Freeway Merge / Diverge Impact - The Propose Project would add traffic to the freeway merge and diverge lo cations during the AM and PM peak hours. While one location is expected to operate at an unacceptable LOS F condition, the Project's traffic does not change the calculated density. With no change in calculated density, the added vehicles from the Proposed Project would not trigger a significant impact. (Less than Significant) Ramp merge and diverge operations were evalua ted for 2015 no project and with project conditions at the I-580 ramp junctions at Strobridge Avenue and Castro Valley Boul evard. The results are presented in Table IV.C-10 . All ramp junctions, except fo r the I-580 westbound diverge area during the AM peak hour, are expected to operate acceptably during the AM and PM peak hours for no project and with project c onditions. During the AM peak hour, the I-580 westbound diverge segment at Strobridge Avenue is expected to ope rate at LOS F prior to the addition of Project traffic, and continue to operate unacceptably with the addition of project traffic. SMCCV Project traffic at this ramp junction however, does not in crease the V/C ratio more then 3 seconds during the AM peak hour; nor, does the added tr affic change the calculated density. IV.

Ther efore, the Proposed Project impacts would be less than significant. The Proposed Project would not have a si gnificant impact on the Castro Valley Boulevard/Redwood Road intersec tion (#12) under the 2035 Baseline scenario b ecause the addition of project traffic would not cause the change in intersection delay to excee d any of the significance thresholds used in this study. Therefore, the pr oject impacts would be less than significant. The Proposed Project would not have a significant impact on the LOS E and F conditions at the unsignalized Somerset Avenue/Wisteria Street intersection (#14) under the 2035 Baseline scenario because the addition of Project t traffi c would not cause the volumes to satisfy Caltrans peak hour volume warrant. Therefore, the Proj ect impacts would be less than significant. Ramp merge and diverge operations were eval uated for 2035 no project and with project conditions at the I-580 ramp junctions at Strobr idge Avenue and Castro Valley Boulevard. The results are presented in Table IV.C-13 . All ramp junctions, except for the I-580 westbound merge and diverge areas during the AM peak hour, are expected to operate acceptably during the AM and PM peak hours for no project and with project conditions. During the AM peak hour, the I-580 westbound merge segment at Castro Valley Boulevard and diverge segment at Strobridge Avenue are expected to operate at LOS F prior to the addition of project traffic, and continue to operate unacceptably with the addition of project traffic. Proposed Project traffic at these ramp junctions however, does not increase the V/C ratio more then 3 percent during the AM peak hour; nor, does the Proposed Project traffic change the calculated density. _________________________ Impact TRANS-3a: The signalized intersectio n of Castro Valley Boulevard/Strobridge Avenue/Stanton Avenue (#8) would operate at LOS F under 2035 No Project conditions. The intersection would continue to operate at LOS F with the addition of Proposed Project traffic and the Project traffic would increa se the westbound approach delay by more than four seconds during the AM peak hour.

No feasible mitigation measures are currentl y available, however the County is currently studying alternatives to address traffic fl ow on Strobridge Avenue, south of Castro Valley Boulevard and anticipates selection of a preferred alternative in approximately March 2009. If prior to the County's appr oval of the Proposed Project the County identifies any circulation improvements that would improve traffic flow through this area to acceptable levels, the Project Sponsor shall pay its fair share contribution to the improvements in accordance with the County's normal procedure for payment of impact fees and prior to the issuance of the first building permit for New Hospital. Because the County has no existing plan, program, or design to mitigate this impact, implementation of an improvement is uncertain, a nd therefore the impact is considered significant and unmitigated. Also, if the improvements affect th e operation of ramps to and/or from Interstate 580, the improvement will require both Caltrans and Federal Highway Administration approval and the impact would also therefore be cons idered to remain significant and unavoidable. Significance after Mitigation: Significant and Unavoidable _________________________ Impact TRANS-3b: The signalized intersection of Castro Valley Boulevard/Lake Chabot Road (#9) would operate at LOS F during the AM peak hour under 2035 No Project conditions. The intersection would continue to operate at LOS F during the AM peak hour and LOS E during the PM peak hour with the addition of Project traffic. This is a significant impact because the Proposed Project would increase the total intersection average delay by more than two seconds during the AM peak hour. (Significant) Mitigation Measure TRANS-3b: Re-stripe the existing southbound approach shared through-left turn lane to be a shared through-right turn lane. IV.

Optimize traffic signal timings to allow for protected left-turn phasing. Optimization of traffi c signal timing shall include determination of allocation of green time for each intersection approach in tune with the relative traffic volumes on those approaches, and coordination with signal phasing and timing of adjacent intersections. Prior to the issuance of the first building permit for New Hospital, the Project Sponsor shall pay the County's traffic impact fee for the re-striping and traffic signal changes described above, in accordance with the County's normal procedure for payment of impact fees. After implementation of these measures, the inter section would operate at an acceptable LOS C in the AM peak hour and LOS D in the PM peak hour. Significance after Mitigation: Less than Significant _________________________ Impact TRANS-3c: The westbound approach the unsignalized intersection of Strobridge Avenue/I-580 westbound off-ramp (#10) would operate at LOS F during the AM peak hour and LOS E during the PM peak hour under 2035 No Project conditions. The westbound approach would continue to operate at LOS E and F conditions respectively, with the addition of Proposed Project traffic. This is a significant impact because the intersection would operate at an unacceptable level, the pr oject would add ten or more project trips to the intersection peak hour flow, and the intersection would meet the peak hour signal warrant (Warrant 3) without and with the project. (Significant) Mitigation Measure TRANS-3c: Install a traffic signal at the unsignaliz ed Strobridge Avenue/I-580 westbound off- Ramp. Installation of traffic signals shall include the traffic signal equipment with optimized signal phasing and timing (i.e., allocation of green time for each intersection approach), and coordination with signal phasing and timing of adjacent signalized intersections. Signal installation shall meet Caltrans design standards and be subject to the review a nd approval of Caltrans and the County. In addition to the signal, re-stripe the westbound left-turn lane to be a shared left-right-turn lane. Prior to the issuance of the first buildin g permit for New Hospital, the Project Sponsor shall pay the County's traffic impact fee for the traffic signal and re-striping improvements described above, in accordance with the County's normal procedure for payment of impact fees. After implementation of these measures, the inter section would operate at an acceptable LOS B in the AM and PM peak hours. The traffic si gnal addition to the freeway ramp signal requires Caltrans approval and thus its implementation is not certain and the impact is therefore considered to remain significant and unavoidable.

The intersection would continue to operate at LOS E with the addition of Project traffic. This is a signif icant impact because the Proposed Project would increase the total intersection average delay by more then four seconds during the PM peak hour. (Significant) Mitigation Measure TRANS-3d: Optimize traffic signal timings and change cycle length to 120 seconds during the AM and PM peak hour for the St robridge Avenue/I-580 EB Ramps/Gary Drive intersection. Optimization of traffic signal timing shall include determination of green time allocation for each intersection approach relative to the approach traffic volumes. Prior to the issuance of the first buildin g permit for New Hospital, the Project Sponsor shall pay the County's traffic impa ct fee for the traffic signal and cycle length timing changes to the freeway ramp signal described above, in accordance with the County's normal pr ocedure for payment of impact fees. After implementation of these measures, the inter section would operate at an acceptable LOS D in the AM and PM peak hours. The traffic signa l and cycle length timing changes to the freeway ramp signal require Caltrans approval and thus its implementation is not certain and the impact is therefore considered to remain significant and unavoidable. Significance after Mitigation: Significant and Unavoidable _________________________ Table IV.C-14 shows levels of service (and average ve hicle delay) under mitigated conditions. As shown, the above-described significant impacts at Castro Valley Boulevard/Strobridge Avenue/John Street Valley Drive (#11) would be mitigated to acceptable levels of service after implementation of the identified measures, but impacts at Castro Valley Boulevard/ Strobri dge Avenue/Stanton Avenue (#8) would remain significant and unavoidable.

Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-30 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Transit Impacts Impact TRANS-4: The Proposed Project would generate demand for alternative transportation service for the area. (Less than Significant) As described in the Setting , AC Transit Route 80, Route 84 and Route 87 provide bus service to the area around the Project site, but only Route 87 has a stop at the Project Site. The Route 87 has an average headway of 60 minutes. The Castro Va lley BART station is about 1.5 miles from the Project site. At this time, no funded transit ser vice expansions are planned for the project area. The future transit trips generated by the Proposed Project are likely to remain similar to current conditions. The hospital staffing le vels are expected to decrease by 10 to 15 percent, which will be off-set by increased employee activities at the New MOB. Patients (to both the New Hospital and the New MOB) are unlikely to use transit in the Castro Valley area. There are opportunities to use transit in the urban core such as downt own Oakland with its many bus routes passing by medical facilities. In Castro Valley only one r oute passes the site and it operates on 60-minute headways during most of the day. An impact occurs to the transit system, either AC Transit or BART, if any of the following three items occur: The addition of Proposed Project transit trips increases the average ridership on AC Transit lines by 3 percent at bus stops where the averag e load factor with the project in place would exceed 125 percent over a peak 30-minute peak hour The addition of Proposed Project transit trips increases the peak hour average ridership on BART by 3 percent where the passenger volume would exceed the standing capacity of BART trains The addition of Proposed Project transit trips in creases the peak hour average ridership at a BART station by 3 percent where average waiting time at fare gates would exceed 1 minute. The Proposed Project is not expected to add add itional riders to the transit system because the overall hospital staffing levels are expected to decrease after project completion and the transit service frequency is not sufficient to meet patient needs. Thus, the Proposed Project impact on AC Transit and BART would be less than signifi cant. The Project Site plan does identify a bus transit pullout at the New Hospital and New MOB entrances. This amenity can be used by AC Transit or other bus operator should bus/s huttle service be provided in the future. Mitigation: None required. ______________________________ IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-31 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Alternative Transportation Impacts Impact TRANS-5: The Proposed Project woul d potentially fundamentally conflict with adopted policies, plans, or programs supportin g alternative transportation modes (e.g., bus turnouts, bicycle routes). (Potentially Significant) Alternative Transportation Policies and Plans AC Transit, the provider of bus transit service in the Project study area, has established goals related to transit service. These goals are documen ted in the Short Range Transit Plan (FY 2001 to FY 2010). Some of the major goals of AC Transit include: Provide High Quality, Useful Transit Service for Customers in the East Bay (Goal #1) Plan and Advocate for the Funding and Implementation of Future Projects (Goal #4) Under this last goal, there are several sub-goals that relate to this Project Site. These sub- goals are: - Work with Local agencies to make transit usage as safe, secure, reliable, and quick as possible and to promote transit u sage in the planning process. - Promote \"Transit First\" development prac tices and increased funding for transit through transit mitigation f unding for new developments. BART, the provider of rail transit in the project st udy area, has established goals related to transit service. These goals are documented in the 1999 BA RT Strategic Plan. Some relevant goals of BART include: Maximize regional transit access, convenien ce, and ease of use through effective coordination among transit providers. (B ART Customer Experience: Goal 2) Strategies: work with transit partners to im prove feeder service for customers; support the development of incentives to spur further improvements in the quality of transit connections. Encourage and facilitate improvement access to and from our stations by all modes. (Transit Travel Demand: Goal 3) Strategies: Improve access via taxis, shuttles, bu ses, walking, bicycles, and other transit; In partnership with the communities it serves, BA RT's properties will be used in ways that first maximize transit ridership and then bala nce transit-oriented development goals with community desires. (Land Use and Quality of Life: Goal 1) Strategies: Prepare BART Station Access Gu idelines, and prepare TOD Guidelines for BART station areas. Based on the significance criteria, the project would conflict with adopted policies, plans, or programs if the design of the project does not support multi-modal transportation modes, IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-32 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 including transit, bicycles, and pedestrians, or if it conflicts with planned transit, bicycle, or pedestrian improvements. Sidewalks are provided onsite, c onnecting the various parking areas with the building frontages. Painted crosswalk treatments are provided to highli ght the pedestrian travel path at locations where pedestrian paths cross circulation roads. The access road connecting Lake Chabot Road with the New Hospital and New MOB contains a si dewalk for pedestrian access. Given the steep grade between the existing bus stops at the foot of the main driveway at Lake Chabot Road to the New Hospital and New MOB, accessible pedestrian access would be along the Lake Chabot Road sidewalk to the existing parking structure elevat or, which will access the 5th level of the parking garage which meets the main entry areas. Bicycle parking facilities (enclosed, racks, showers, lockers) are not shown on the most current site plan ( Appendix C.1 - Figure 6 ). It is recommended that at a minimum the project provide bicycle parking in the vicinity of th e building access to both the New Hospital and the New MOB. Mitigation Measure TRANS-4: Provide bicycle parking in the vicinity of the building access to both the New Hospital and the New MOB. Significance after Mitigation: Less than Significant ______________________________ Site Access and Circulation Impacts Impact TRANS-6: The Proposed Project wo uld not increase the potential for conflicts among different traffic streams. (Less than Significant) Significance Criteria The Proposed Project would have a significant impact on the environment if it would \"substantially increase traffic hazards to motor vehi cles, bicycles, or pedestrians due to a design feature (e.g., sharp curves or dangerous intersec tions) that does not comply with Caltrans design standards, or incompatible uses (e.g., farm equipment).\" For the purposes of this study, the design of the Proposed Project is judged to have a significant impact if the project incorporates design elem ents that do not comply with Caltrans design standards, as defined by of the Caltrans Highway Design Manual (HDM) (5th Edition). When Caltrans design standards are unavailable or unclear, other documents are used as necessary, such as the American Association of State Highwa y and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (M UTCD), and other design manuals. For any roadway cross-sections, the Caltrans Highway Design Manual recommends the use of AASHTO standards for city and county roadways that are not under the jurisdiction of Caltrans. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-33 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 New Hospital and New Medical Office Building The draft site plan for the Proposed Project is shown in Figure III-5 , Proposed Site Plan and Circulation, in Chapter III (Project Description) . The three existing Project Site access driveways would remain, and the Proposed Project would construct two new \"special use\" driveways on Stanton Avenue. One special use driveway woul d serve the New Hospital's truck loading area and the other would serve as the ambulance access to the emergency department. Intersection operations at the three existing site driveways are currently at acceptable levels and this will continue in the future with the Pr oposed Project. Based on existing observations the delivery driveway for the New Hospital will likely serve between 15 and 30 trucks per day, and fewer than 5 of these trucks will be greater than 45 feet in length. These trucks are currently using Stanton Avenue to access the Proposed Site. Ther e will be no change in truck access associated with the Proposed Project. The delivery drivew ay and three truck bays are sufficient to accommodate trucks up to 65 feet with dock access maneuvering occurring on site. The Proposed Project includes several circulation components that will redirect traffic from Stanton Avenue to Lake Chabot Road. These incl ude a redistribution of parking supply from the Stanton Avenue frontage to the Lake Chabot Road frontage, building orientation toward the Lake Chabot Road corridor, and a vehicle connection be tween the upper level of the parking structure and the main campus surface parking. There are about 200 parking spaces located behi nd the Existing Hospital that are most easily accessible via the Stanton Avenue driveway. These spaces will be eliminated with the New Hospital and New MOB. New parking supplies will be provided in front of the New Hospital, facing Lake Chabot Road, and on the site of th e existing Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital. These new parking supplies will be more easily acces sible from Lake Chabot Road. As a result, site-generated traffic is expected to shift from the Stanton Avenue corridor to the Lake Chabot Road corridor. This shift was account ed for in the driveway analysis. The Proposed Project will provide a vehicle and pe destrian connection between the 5th level of the parking garage and the main campus circulation ro ad. This connection will substantially reduce vehicle congestion on the Project Site as drivers will have direct access to all parking supplies within the site i.e., they will not need to use Lake Chabot Road to drive between parking areas. The Proposed Project provides an access road that connects the signalized Lake Chabot Road entrance to the New Hospital and New MOB pass enger loading areas. Prior to entering the passenger loading areas, a secondary circulation road provides access dir ectly to the surface parking in front of the New Hospital and to the parking garage access. This circulation pattern reinforces the Lake Chabot Road signalized acc ess, and simplifies driving and parking patterns for site users. Recommended Improvements for Consideration During Project Review The access and circulation system for the New Hospital and New MOB are generally acceptable. The following recommended improvements should be considered during Proposed Project review: IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-34 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Given the site's grade differences, evaluate sight distance characteristics at the internal site intersections along the circulation roads to ensure adequate sight lines. Review the landscape and hardscape plans to ensu re adequate sight lines at internal site intersections. Emergency Department Access and Circulation The Emergency Department (ED) would be locat ed at the north side of the New Hospital. Ambulances would enter onto the site from Stan ton Avenue at the Northwest driveway. They would proceed to the ambulance bays that will be located along the Site's circulation road and would back into the ambulance bays to load/unload patients. The ambulance bays would provide space for simultaneous loading/un loading of four ambulances. The ED walk-in area would be located at the Nort heast side of the New Hospital. The ED walk-in area would provide 18 parking spaces adjacent to the ED. These spaces would have short parking duration and would serve as the primary pick- up/drop-off area for ED patients and visitors. Truck Access and Circulation Truck loading docks would be located on the west side of the New Hospital along the Stanton Avenue frontage. Access to and from the loadi ng docks would be provided from Stanton Avenue. All truck turnaround maneuvers would be accommod ated within the loading areas. The Project Sponsor's civil engineer provided plans showing th at maneuvers would occur on site. The largest trucks accessing the site would be 18 -wheeler (65-foot long) trucks. Based on existing observations the delivery driv eway for the New Hospital will likely serve between 15 and 30 trucks per day, and fewer than 5 of these trucks will be greater than 45 feet in length. The delivery driveway and three truck bays are sufficient to accommodate trucks up to 65 feet in length. Three additional truck loading spaces would be provided for single-unit delivery trucks. Trucks will continue to use the Stanton Avenue corridor for access as they do today. The truck access driveway will be about 35-foot wide and be designed as a street with curb, gutter, and ADA-compliant ramps. This design will cl early distinguish the access driveway from the pedestrian walkway along Stanton Avenue. Neighborhood Traffic Intrus ion and Traffic Calming The Proposed Project would generate additional tra ffic, but the project also incorporates several onsite circulation changes that will redirect exis ting and future traffic from the Stanton Avenue driveway to the signalized Lake Chabot Road driveway. This is consistent with existing General Plan policies that development on the Project Site shall minimize adverse effects on surrounding residential areas ( Policy 4.8-4). These changes include redistribution of parking supply from the Stanton Avenue frontage to the Lake Chabot Road frontage, building orientation toward the Lake Chabot Road corridor, and a vehicle connection be tween the upper level of the parking structure and the main campus surface parking. In addition, the Pine Cone Apartments will be demolished and associated existing traffic removed from the Stanton Avenue corridor. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-35 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 As a result of the Project Site changes, the Pr oposed Project will increase AM and PM peak hour traffic on Stanton Avenue by fewer than 5 vehi cles north of the Project Site, and about 10 vehicles south of the Project Site. These chang es will not be noticeable to the residents and businesses along the Stanton Avenue corridor. Mitigation: None required. ______________________________ Required Congestion Management Program Evaluation The Alameda County Congestion Management Program (CMP) requires the assessment of development-driven impacts to regional roadways . Because the project would generate more than 100 \"net new\" PM peak-hour trips, the CMP re quires the use of the Countywide Travel Demand Forecasting Model to assess the impacts on regional roadways near the Project Site during the PM peak hour. The CMP and Metropolitan Transpor tation System (MTS) roadways in the project vicinity identified in NOP comments by ACCMA (May 9, 2008 letter) include I-580, I-238, Castro Valley Boulevard, SR 238/Mission Boulevard, I-880, Crow Canyon Road, A Street, B Street, Lewelling/East Lewelling Boulevard, Foothill Boulevard and East 14th Street. 6 Operations of the MTS freeway and surface street segments were assessed using a volume-to- Please note that the ACCMA does not have a policy for determining a threshold of significance for Level of Service for the Land Use Analysis Program of the CMP. Professional judgment should be applied to determine the significance of project impacts (Please see chapter 6 of the 2007 CMP for more information). ACCMA Roadway Analysis Study Area ACCMA requested freeway and surface street segments in Castro Valley and other areas of Alameda County be analyzed. The complete list of freeway and roadway segments from the NOP letter was included in the analysis. The follo wing 14 directional freeway and 23 directional roadway segments were analyzed: I-580 (6 segments) I-238 (4 segments) I-880 (4 segments) Castro Valley Boulevard (6 segments) Mission Boulevard (4 segments) East 14th Street (2 segments) Lewelling Boulevard (2 segments) Foothill Boulevard (2 segments) A Street (2 segments) 6 Note that the roadway segments included in this evalua tion are not based on an asse ssment of the Project trip distribution or application of screening criteria to dete rmine if the Project would contribute enough new trips to warrant analysis. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-36 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 B Street (3 segments) Crow Canyon Road (2 segments) Traffic Forecasts The ACCMA model was used to forecast 2015 and 2030 traffic volumes on the MTS roadway system. The forecasts for the MTS system diffe r from the intersection forecasts previously discussed in the following aspect: The intersection forecasts use the output of the ACCMA model and the existing intersection counts to \"Furness\" future inte rsection turning movement. The MTS roadway analysis reports the outputs of the ACCMA m odel directly on a roadway segment level. Due to the difference in the future volume de velopment, the results from the two analyses are not directly comparable. The results of the ACCMA model were used to forecast the No Project condition for 2015 and 2030. Project trips were manually distributed to the MTS roadway segments (including both freeways and surface streets) identified above using the project trip distribution. The distribution of project trips onto the MTS segments results in the With Project volumes for 2015 and 2030. Analysis Method Operations of the MTS freeway and surface str eet segments were assessed based on volume-to- capacity (V/C) ratios. For freeway segments, a per-lane capacity of 2,000 vehicles per hour (vph) was used. This capacity is consistent with th e 2007 Congestion Management Plan documents. For surface streets, a per-lane capacity of 800 vehi cles per hour was used. Roadway segments with a V/C ratio greater than 1.0 are assigned LOS F. Significance Criteria According to the significance criteria presented prev iously, the addition of project traffic causes a significant impact on an MTS roadway segment if: The addition of Proposed Project traffic causes a segment's operation to degrade to LOS F. (Therefore, for purposes of this analysis, an impact will be identified if the addition of project traffic causes the V/C ratio to increase to greater than 1.0.) The addition of Proposed Project trips causes the V/C ratio to increase by more than 3 percent on a segment that already operates at LOS F without the project traffic. Analysis Results The addition of Proposed Project trips (under both 2015 and 2030 cond itions) would not cause any of the studied roadway or freeway segment to degrade to LOS F or increase the V/C ratio of a segment already operating at LOS F by more than three percent. Detailed tables are provided in Appendix C.2 and include all data for 2015 and 2030 forecast years. The Proposed Project would not cause a significant impact on any MTS roadway segments. IV.

Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-37 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Mitigation: None required. ______________________________ Construction Period Impacts7 Impact TRANS-7: Proposed Project construction would temporarily affect traffic flow and circulation, parking, and pedestrian safety. (Potentially Significant) During the construction period, temporary and in termittent transportation impacts would result from truck movements as well as construction worker vehicles to and from the Project Site. The construction-related traffic would result in a te mporary reduction to the capacities of project area streets because of the slower movements and larger turning radii of construction trucks compared to passenger vehicles. Given the nearby I-580 freew ay ramps, use of local roadways would be limited. Truck traffic that occurs during the peak commute hours (7:00 to 9:00 AM and 4:00 to 6:00 PM) could result in worse levels of service and higher delays at local intersections than during off-peak hours. Construction activity on the Proposed Project is antic ipated to begin in 2009 and would continue through 2013. Constructio n activities include those associated with site preparation and building construction. Site preparation includes all of th e activities required to allow construction on the individual areas of the project. Major components of site preparation would involve removal of existing structures, removal of contaminated soil material, deposition of clean fill, grading of the site, and construction of necessary infrastructure. A variety of equipment would be required for the site preparation stage, including bulldozer s, grading machines, cranes, and dump trucks, which would be responsible for th e removal and deposition of cut and fill material on the site. Building construction involves the assembly of build ings on the site. Major elements of building construction would include drilled piles to s upport the building founda tion, constructing the building frame, pouring concrete, a nd completing the interior of each building. Given the limited available area on the Project Site, it is anticipa ted that only construction vehicles and equipment would be stored onsite. Construction activities by phase are desc ribed below, consistent with the Development Phase description the Project Description (Chapter III). Available onsite parking supply within any phase would vary as sub-phases of work are comple ted; thus parking supply is stated for the range of supply that occurs throughout each phase. Phase 1: 2nd Quarter 2009 to 4th Quarter 2009 (6 months) - Demolish Eden Professional Offices (20,000 sq.ft) - Demolish Pine Cone Apartments Complex (42 units) - Demolish and relocate Helistop and pedest rian connection to Existing Hospital 7 This section was prepared on the basis of preliminar y estimates of construction pha sing, duration, materials and equipment staging, and road closures provided by the Project Sponsor in June 2008. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-38 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 The available onsite parking supply duri ng construction Phase 1 will vary between 841 and 849 parking spaces. Table IV.C-16 shows there will be a parking short fall throughout Phase 1. Phase 2: 3rd Quarter 2009 to 3rd Quarter 2012 (35 months) - Install Site Work (e.g., utilities, etc. ) for the New Hospital and New MOB sites - Construct New Hospital and New MOB - Develop temporary accessible parking a nd circulation (at Eden Professional Offices location demolished in Phase 1) - Install Landscape Feature southwest of existing parking garage The available onsite parking supply duri ng construction Phase 2 will vary between 838 and 886 parking spaces. Table IV.C-17 shows there will be a parking short fall at various sub-phases of Phase 2. Phase 3a: 1st Quarter 2013 to 3rd Quarter 2013 (6 months) - Demolish Existing Hospital (after New Hospital and New MOB open) - Demolish temporary accessible parking (constructed in Phase 2) Phase 3b: 1st Quarter 2013 to 4th Quarter 2013 (10 months) - Demolish Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital - Develop new surface parking and circul ation (at demolished Existing Hospital location) and landscape features - Develop new surface parking and land scaping (at demolished Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital location) The available onsite parking supply duri ng construction Phase 3 (Phase 3a and 3b) will vary between 814 and 1,239 parking spaces. Table IV.C-18 shows there will be a parking short fall at various sub-phases of Phase 3. The Project Sponsor has indicated that construc tion workers will not be provided parking on site. Rather the construction workers would be designate d off site parking and a shuttle bus would be provided to shuttle the workers to and from the work site. The estimated number of parking spaces needed to accommodate the construction workers will vary during the construction period. Typically, 100 to 200 parking spaces will be n eeded to accommodate the construction activity during each phase with up to 250 sp aces needed for short periods of time during Phase 2, which is construction of the New Hospital and New MOB. The construction activities, including the site preparation and the building construction, are expected to generate varying levels of truck activity.

Similar to construction workers, the number of trucks is expected to vary as the construction activity varies. For example, the highest number of trucks would be required for the removal and deposition of soil at the site. Anothe r activity requiring a large number of trucks is pouring floors of each building, which entails a daily influx of cem ent mixer trucks. As construction phases conclude, fewer trucks would be required because deliveries would only be required intermittently. The Project Sponsor provided information relating to truck activity. The number of daily truck trips associated with the project varies greatly. Typi cally, the number of truck trips to the site will range from 2 to 10 trucks per day throughout the construction period. There will be periods when truck activity will peak at about 50 trucks per da y. These periods would occur over concentrated 1 to 2 month periods during major activities such as site excavation and concrete pours for the new buildings. The medical activities within the Project Site will continue to operate duri ng construction, and the available parking supply for medical-related uses wi ll need to be maintained and monitored to ensure adequate parking is available to patients, visitors, and staff. If insu fficient onsite parking is available, the New Hospital intends to provide o ffsite staff parking with a shuttle service to the Project Site. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-41 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Parking analysis methodology used to determine pa rking supply and demand at the Project Site is described in detail, below. This section provi des a summary of the medical-related parking demand during construction (construction worker parking will be provided off site) and compares that demand to the expected onsite supply to iden tify the adequacy of the parking supply to meet demand during construction. The Lake Chabot Medical Office and the Eden Medical Plaza have parking easements for 113 and 47 parking spaces, respectively. Thus, the s ite must provide 160 parking spaces to comply with these easements. Using the survey-deriv ed peak parking demand rates discussed under Impact TRANS-7, below, the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital has a parking demand of about 40 spaces and the Existing Hospital has a 584 space demand. Table IV.C-16 shows that there will be parking sp ace deficit during Phase 1 construction. A combination of valet parking and offsite staff parking will be needed during this construction phase to accommodate the site's parking demand. Table IV.C-17 shows similar parking deficits during Phase 2 construction. Table IV.C-18 shows the parking deficits that coul d occur during Phase 3 construction. During this phase the Existing Hospital will be demolishe d and new parking supp lies constructed. In addition, the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital will be demolished and re placed by parking. Accelerated Laurel Grove Reha bilitation Hospital Demolition As discussed in the Project Description (Chapter III), this EIR considers a construction phasing scenario in which the Laurel Grove Rehabilitati on Hospital would be closed and demolished in Phase 1, instead of Phase 3 (see Figure III-11a through III-11d ). Early demolition of the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital will substantia lly increase the number of parking spaces on the Project Site starting the latter part of Phase 1 and throughout construc tion: approximately 193 additional new parking spaces would be available which would eliminate pa rking deficits shown in Tables IV.C-16 through IV.C-18 . The following Mitigation Measu re TRANS-6 would apply to the Proposed Project, as well as with the accelerated demolition of Laur el Grove Rehabilitation Hospital scenario: Mitigation Measure TRANS-7a: Prior to the issuance of the first building permit for each phase of the Proposed Project, the Proj ect Sponsor and construction contractor shall meet with the appropriate County age ncies to determine traffic management strategies to reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, traffic congestion and the effects of parking demand by construction workers during construction of this project and other nearby projects that could be simultaneously under construction. The Project Sponsor shall develop a construction man agement plan for review and approval by the County. The plan shall include at least the following items and requirements: A set of comprehensive traffic control measures, including scheduling of major truck trips and deliveries to avoid peak tr affic hours, detour signs if required, lane closure procedures, signs, cones fo r drivers, and designated construction access routes. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-42 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Notification procedures for adjacent property owners and public safety personnel regarding when major deliveries, detours, and lane closures will occur. Location of construction staging areas for materials, equipment, and vehicles (must be located on the Project Site). Identification of haul routes for movement of construction vehicles that would minimize impacts on vehicular and pedest rian traffic, circulation and safety; and provision for monitoring surface stree ts used for haul routes so that any damage and debris attributable to th e haul trucks can be identified and corrected by the Project Sponsor. Temporary construction fences to contain debris and material and to secure the site. Provisions for removal of trash generate d by project construction activity. A process for responding to, and tracking, complaints pertaining to construction activity, including identification of an onsite complaint manager. Provisions for monitoring surface street s used for truck routes so that any damage and debris attributable to the trucks can be identified and corrected. Construction worker transportation demand management (TDM) program to encourage workers to carpool or use alternative transportation modes in order to reduce the overall number of vehicle trips associated with construction workers. The program should also include provis ions for offsite construction worker parking with shuttle service between the offsite parking and the Project Site. Hospital staff TDM program to encourage staff to carpool or use alternative transportation modes in order to redu ce onsite parking demand. The program should also include provisions for onsite valet parking and, if insufficient onsite supply is available, offsite staff parking with shuttle service between the offsite parking and the Project Site. Mitigation Measure TRANS-7b: If Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital is not demolished prior to Phase 2 to allow for co nstruction period parking onsite, the Project Sponsor and construction contractor shall meet with the appropriate County agencies to explore the feasibility and level of neighborhood support for the County to implement a construction-period Residentia l Parking Permit (RPP) program in the residential neighborhood adjacent to the Proj ect Site on Stanton Avenue. If a RPP program is determined to be feasible and has substantial neighborhood support, the County shall implement the program. The Project Sponsor shall pay for implementation of the RPP program. This recommendation is made because of the hospital's proximity to the neighborhood , not because hospital-related parking activities occur in the residential neighborhood. The RPP would restrict on-street parking by non-residents to less than two hours during the weekdays. If the RPP program is implemented, it should be pr ior to construction of the New Hospital. Significance after Mitigation: Less than Significant ______________________________ IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C. Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-43 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Evaluation of Project's Propo sed Parking Supply (Non-CEQA) Courts have determined that parking supply a nd unmet parking demand created by a project need not be considered a significant environmental effect under CEQA unless it would cause significant secondary effects,. However, as a matte r of policy, Alameda County wants to ensure during its review of the Proposed Project, that the provision of parking spaces would result in minimal adverse effects to project occupants and visitors, and that any secondary effects (such as on air quality due to drivers searching fo r parking spaces) will be minimized. 8 Therefore, although not required by CEQA, this EIR provi des information about the relation between proposed parking supply and estimated park ing demand and County code requirements. Existing Parking Conditions Off-Street Parking A survey of off-street parking was conducted on Fe bruary 20, 2008. The available parking supply that day was 995 parking spaces. The existing pa rking demand was measured each hour between 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM by counting the occupied parking spaces. The number of parked vehicles (demand) were c ounted and compared to the number of parking spaces (supply) to determine the parking occupancy. Table IV.C-19 shows the average weekday parking demand and accumulation for the site, which shows that campus-wide peak-parking demand occurs around 11:00 AM, with a peak ob served demand of approximately 770 parked vehicles. Overall, about 77 percent of parking spaces are occupied during the peak parking period. The main campus parking and Lake Chabot MOB pa rking are well utilized during this peak hour, while the parking garage and Laurel Grove Re habilitation Hospital parking supply is under- utilized. The practical capacity of the main campus park ing is 80 to 85 percent because the main campus parking supply is dispersed into several parki ng areas around the Existing Hospital site and it is physically separated from the existing parking garage i.e., drivers must use Lake Chabot Road to circulate between the two parking areas. The prac tical capacity of the site's parking can be increased to about 90 percent if the main campus parking areas are consolidated and a vehicle connection is provided between the main campus parking and the existing parking structure. Parking occupancy above the practical capacity requires that vehicles search, circulate and wait for vacant spaces. This is not only an inconveni ence, but also can cause congestion and potential blockage of vehicles waiting for available spaces. 8 A Court of Appeal decision (regarding a challenge to San Francisco's treatment of parking as a social, not physical, effect) held that parking is not part of the permanent ph ysical environment, and that parking conditions change over time as people change their tr avel patterns.

Transportation, Circulation, and Parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.C-45 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 On-Street Parking On-street parking in the vicinity of the Project Site was also monitored on February 20th. A total of 110 parking spaces were monitored during the day. As shown in Table IV.C-19 , parking spaces on the street are well-utilized during the da y with 75 to 90 spaces occupied at various times of the day. After 5:00 PM the number of o ccupied spaces dropped to about 60. This is an indication that on-street parking is being used by area businesses. The survey team did not observe any hospital-related users parking on the st reet and walking to the Existing Hospital. This is likely due to the availability of onsite pa rking and the long walking distance between the Existing Hospital and the on-street parking. Parking Demand The Eden Medical Plaza has an easement for 47 pa rking spaces on the Project Site. In addition, the Lake Chabot Medical Building has a 113 parking space easement. These parking spaces are required to be maintained after th e Project Site is developed. The New MOB's parking demand wa s derived from the Institute of Transportation Engineers publication Parking Generation 3rd Edition. The pa rking demand rates in this publication were derived from 24 parking surveys co nducted for clinic, medical, and dental uses. The peak parking demand rates derived from these surveys are: 3.04 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet (33rd percentile) 3.61 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet (median percentile) 4.34 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet (85th percentile) These rates are applied to the building's gross s quare footage of 80,000 square feet, and to provide a conservative analysis the 85th percentile is used in this study. So, the peak parking demand is estimated to be 347 spaces ( 80 \u00d7 4.34 spaces) for the New MOB. The New Hospital parking need was derived b ased on employment (approximately 470 doctors and non-doctors), patient (approxima tely 192 patients), and visito r (approximately 250 visitors) data provided by the Project Sponsor. Factors were applied to the provided data to estimate how many parked cars would be on site at one time dur ing a typical day shift (see Appendix C.1 to this document). The following assumptions were used to determine that the New Hospital parking demand would be 614 parking spaces af ter project completion in 2014. 5 percent staff off site (due to meetings, vacation, sick, etc.) 1.1 staff per car (average auto occupancy for all staff combined) 1.3 visitors per patient 65 percent of patients are on site at the same time 65 percent of visitors are on site at the same time 30 percent of all visitors arrive with a patient 1.5 visitors per car IV.

Off-Street Parking Requirements Per County Code For purposes of determining minimum parking needs, the Alameda County Code analyzes medical office use in terms of square footage and hospital use in terms of a combination of square footage, staffing and beds. The Code's minimu m parking requirement for office use (including medical office) is one parking space for every two hu ndred fifty square feet of floor area. (Section 17.52.930). In calculating parking requirements under the County Code \"floor area includes floor area of space used for service to the public as customers, patrons, clients or patients or occupied by tenants of the offices in the case of an offi ce building. The 80,000 square foot New MOB will have a floor area of about 70,000 square feet. Section 17.52.930 would require about 280 parking spaces for the new medical office building. The current Code (Section 17.52.910) requirement for a hospital is two spaces, plus one for each four patient beds (except those patient beds designated as \"long term care beds\" by the State Department of Public Health may be computed as one per six patient beds), plus one for each staff doctor, plus one for each one thousand square feet of gross floor area in the main building or buildings. Section 17.52. 910 would require about 376 spaces for the New Hospital. The term \"staff doctor\" is not defined in the Code. It was interpreted broadly for purposes of this calculation, which was based on approximately 13 0 licensed beds, 105 doctors (45 staff doctors and 60 doctors with privileges) and 236,000 gsf. As indicated in Table IV.C-21 , the Project Site is required to provide 816 parking spaces to meet County Code requirements. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures C.

Recommendations The following recommendations are presented for the County's consideration to address parking effects on surrounding areas. Specifically, these recommendations, subject to County approval, would help ensure that the provision of park ing spaces in conjunction with measures to reduce parking demand would result in minimal adverse e ffects to project occupants and visitors, and surrounding neighborhoods (where there are no rest rictions on on-street parking and on-street parking is free). These recommendations also would help ensure that any secondary effects (such as on air quality due to drivers searching for parking spaces) would be minimized. The following strategies are recommended to en sure adequate parking supply and optimal parking utilization. Evaluate the feasibility of implementing an automated parking space counting system into the existing parking garage. Electronic chang eable message signs should be installed at parking entrances to inform drivers of the lo cation and number of available parking spaces. This would maximize utilization of all parki ng facilities, and reduce excessive circulation and driver frustration within the parking garage. Designate and clearly sign or delineate parking areas for either employees or patients and visitors. Employees should be assigned to the La urel Grove parking area and secondarily to the parking spaces at the southern end of the site. Provide preferential parking for employee carpools to reduce overall parking demand, regularly monitor carpool parking demand a nd modify the parking carpool supply if necessary. The proposed off-street parking supply of 1, 239 spaces at completion of the Proposed Project would be adequate to satisfy the es timated project parking demand and satisfy the Alameda County Code requirements. _________________________ IV.

Air Quality This section addresses the impacts of the Proposed Project on ambient air quality and the exposure of people, especially sensitive individuals, to unhealthful pollutant concentrations of the type and quantity of emissions that would be generated by construction and operation of the Proposed Project. This section considers the effects of emissions of criteria air pollutants, toxic air contaminants and greenhouse gases by the Proposed Project. The analysis of criteria pollutant emissions focuses on whether the Proposed Project would cause an exceedance of a state ambient air quality standa rd or an exceedance of a threshold set forth by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD). The analysis of toxic air contaminants evalua tes the health risks from exposure to toxic air contaminants (TACs) related to the Proposed Pr oject. Health risks would result from exposure to toxics, primarily from inhalation 1 of airborne toxics that would be emitted as a result of the construction or operation of the Proposed Project . The incremental risk of cancer and the hazard of other adverse health effects from exposure to non-carcinogenic substances emitted from the Proposed Project are reported. The potential adver se public health effects are associated with exposure to TACs, which are believed to have health impacts but for which there are no corresponding quantitative ambient air quality standards. The analysis of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) focuses on the sources and amounts of such gases emitted by the Proposed Project and on consid eration of ways to mitigate those emissions. Setting Regulatory Setting Established federal, state, a nd regional regulations provide the framework for analyzing and controlling air pollutant emissions and thus general air quality. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) is responsible fo r implementing the programs established under the federal Clean Air Act, such as establishing a nd reviewing the federal ambient air quality standards and judging the adequacy of State Implementation Plans (SIP). However, the US EPA has delegated the authority to implement many of the federal programs to the states while retaining an oversight role to ensure that the pr ograms continue to be implemented. In California, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) is responsible for establishing and reviewing the state ambient air quality standards, developi ng and managing the California SIP, securing approval of this plan from US EPA, and identifying TACs. CARB also regulates mobile emissions sources in California, such as construc tion equipment, trucks, and automobiles, and oversees the activities of air quality management districts, which are organized at the county or regional level. An air quality management dist rict is primarily responsible for regulating 1 Although people can be exposed to toxi c substances by other pathways, such as ingestion in food or drinking water or skin contact, for the Proposed Project the only substan tive exposure pathway for members of the public would be by inhalation of gaseous or particulate emissions. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-2 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 stationary emissions sources at facilities within its geographic areas and for preparing the air quality plans that are required under the federal Cl ean Air Act and California Clean Air Act. The BAAQMD is the regional agency with regulator y authority over emission sources in the nine county San Francisco Bay Area (Bay Area), which includes all of San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, and Napa counties and the southern half of Sonoma and southwestern half of Solano counties. The regulatory setting for each of the three classes of air pollutants, criteria pollutants, TACs and GHGs, is discussed below. Regulatory Setting for Criteria Pollutants As required by the federal Clean Air Act passed in 1970, the US EPA has identified six criteria air pollutants that are pervasive in urban envir onments and for which state and national health- based ambient air quality standards have been est ablished. EPA calls these pollutants criteria air pollutants because the agency has regulated th em by developing specific public health- and welfare-based criteria as the basis for setting permissible levels. Ozone (O 3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), particulate matter (PM), and lead are the six criteria air pollutants. Ozone (O 3) Ozone is a respiratory irritant and an oxidant th at increases suscep tibility to respiratory infections and that can cause substantial damage to vegeta tion and other materials. Ozone is not emitted directly into the atmosphere, but is a secondary ai r pollutant produced in the atmosphere through a complex series of photochemical reactions invo lving reactive organic gases (ROG) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). ROG and NOx are known as precursor compounds for ozone. Significant ozone production generally requires ozone precursors to be present in a stable atmosphere with strong sunlight for approximately three hours. Ozone is a regional air pollutant because it is not emitted directly by sources, but is formed downwind of sources of ROG and NOx under the influence of wind and sunlight. Ozone concentrations tend to be higher in the late spring, summer, and fall, when the long sunny days combine with regi onal subsidence inversions to create conditions conducive to the formation and accumulation of secondary photochemical compounds, like ozone. Ground level ozone in conj unction with suspended particul ate matter in the atmosphere leads to hazy conditions generally termed as \"smog\". Carbon Monoxide (CO) Carbon monoxide, a colorless and odorless gas is a non-reactive pollutant that is a product of incomplete combustion and is mostly associat ed with motor vehicles. High carbon monoxide concentrations develop primarily during winter when periods of light wind combine with the formation of ground level temperature inversi ons (typically from the evening through early morning). These conditions result in reduced disper sion of vehicle emissions. Motor vehicles also exhibit increased carbon monoxide emission rates at low air temperatures. When inhaled at high concentrations, carbon monoxide combines with hemoglobin in the blood and reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. This resu lts in reduced oxygen reaching the brain, heart, IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-3 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 and other body tissues. This condition is especi ally critical for people with cardiovascular diseases, chronic lung disease or anemia. Nitrogen Dioxide (NO 2) Nitrogen dioxide is an air quality concern becau se it acts as a respiratory irritant and is a precursor of ozone. Nitrogen dioxide is produced by fuel combustion in motor vehicles, industrial stationary sources (such as industrial activ ities), ships, aircraft, and rail transit. Sulfur Dioxide (SO 2) Sulfur dioxide is a combustion product of sulfur or sulfur-containing fuels such as coal and oil, which are restricted in the Bay Area. Its hea lth effects include breathing problems and may cause permanent damage to lungs. SO 2 is an ingredient in acid rain (acid aerosols), which can damage trees, lakes and property. Acid aer osols can also reduce visibility. Particulate Matter (PM) PM-10 and PM-2.5 consist of part iculate matter that is 10 micr ons or less in diameter and 2.5 microns or less in diameter, respectively. A mi cron is one-millionth of a meter, or less than one- 25,000th of an inch. For comparison, human hair is 50 microns or larger in diameter. PM-10 and PM-2.5 represent particulate matter of sizes that can be inhaled into the air passages and the lungs and can cause adverse health effects. Particulate matter in the atmosphere results from many kinds of aerosol-producing industrial and agricultura l operations, fuel com bustion, and atmospheric photochemical reactions. Some sour ces of particulate matter, such as demolition and construction activities, are more local in nature, while others, such as vehicular traffic, have a more regional effect. Very small particles (PM-2.5) of certain substances (e.g., sulfates and nitrates) can cause lung damage directly, or can cont ain adsorbed gases (e.g., chlorides or ammonium) that may be injurious to health. Particulates also ca n damage materials and reduce visibility. PM-10 emissions in the Proposed Project area are mainly from urba n sources, dust suspended by vehicle traffic and secondary aer osols formed by reactions in the atmosphere. Particulate concentrations near residential sources generally are higher during the winter , when more fireplaces are in use and meteorological conditions prevent the dispersion of directly emitted contaminants. Lead Leaded gasoline (curren tly phased out), paint (houses, cars), smelters (metal refineries), and manufacture of lead storage batteries have been the primary sources of lead released into the atmosphere. Lead has a range of adverse neurotoxi c health effects; children are at special risk. Some lead-containing chemical s cause cancer in animals. Some criteria air pollutants are considered regi onal in nature, some are considered local, and some have characteristics that are both regional and local. Air pollutants are also characterized as \"primary\" and \"secondary\" pollutants. Primary pollutants are those emitted directly into the atmosphere (such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxi de, lead particulates, and hydrogen sulfide). Secondary pollutants are those formed through chemical reactions in the atmosphere; these IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-4 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 chemical reactions usually involve primary polluta nts, normal constituents of the atmosphere, and other secondary pollutants. Ozone is a secondary air pollutant produced in the atmosphere through a complex series of photochemical reactions involving ROG and NOx. ROG and NOx are known as precursor compounds for ozone. Ozone is a regional air pollutant because its precursors are transported and diffused by wind concurrently with ozone production. Ambient CO concentrations normally are consid ered a local effect and typically correspond closely to the spatial and temporal distributions of vehicular traffic. Wind speed and atmospheric mixing also influence CO concentrations. Under i nversion conditions, CO concentrations may be distributed more uniformly over an area out to some distance from vehicular sources. Ambient Air Quality Standards Regulation of criteria air pollutants is achieved through both national and state ambient air quality standards and emissions limits for individual sources. Regulations implementing the federal Clean Air Act and its subsequent amendments established national ambient air quality standards (national standards) for the six criteria pollutant s. California has adopted more stringent state ambient air quality standards for most of the crite ria air pollutants. In addition, California has established state ambient air quality standards for sulfates, hydrogen sulfide, vinyl chloride, and visibility-reducing particles. Because of the uniqu e meteorological problems in the state, there is considerable diversity between state and federal st andards currently in effect in California, as shown in Table IV.D-1 . The table also summarizes the related health effects and principal sources for each pollutant. The ambient air quality standards are intended to pr otect the public health and welfare, and they incorporate an adequate margin of safety. They are designed to protect those segments of the public most susceptible to respiratory distress, known as sensitive receptors, including asthmatics, the very young, the elderly, people weak from other illness or disease, or persons engaged in strenuous work or exercise. Healthy adults can to lerate occasional exposure to air pollution levels somewhat above the ambient air quality standards before adverse health effects are observed. Attainment Status Under amendments to the federal Clean Air Act, U.S. EPA has classified air basins or portions thereof, as either \"attainment\" or \"non-attain ment\" for each criteria air pollutant, based on whether or not the national standards have been achieved. The California Clean Air Act, which is patterned after the federal Clean Air Act, also re quires areas to be designated as \"attainment\" or \"non-attainment\" for the state standards. Thus, ar eas in California have two sets of attainment / non-attainment designations: one set with respect to the national standards and one set with respect to the state standards. The Bay Area is currently designated \"non-atta inment\" for state 1-hour and 8-hour ozone standards, the national 8-hour ozone standard and for the state PM-10 and PM-2.5 standards. The Bay Area is \"attainment\" or \"unclassified\" with r espect to the other ambient air quality standards. Table IV.D-1 also shows the attainment status of the Bay Area with respect to the national and state ambient air quality standards for different criteria pollutants. IV.

Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-6 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Air Quality Plans The 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments require that regional planning and air pollution control agencies prepare a regional Air Quality Plan to ou tline the measures by which both stationary and mobile sources of pollutants can be controlled in order to achieve all standards specified in the Clean Air Act. The 1988 California Clean Air Act also requires development of air quality plans and strategies to meet state air quality standa rds in areas designated as non-attainment (with the exception of areas designated as non-attainment for the state PM standards). Maintenance plans are required for attainment areas that had previous ly been designated non-attainment in order to ensure continued attainment of the standards. Air quality plans developed to meet federal requirements are referred to as State Implementation Plans. For state air quality planning purposes, the Bay Area is classified as a serious non-attainment area for ozone. The \"serious\" classification triggers various plan submittal requirements and transportation performance standards. One such requirement is that the Bay Area update the Clean Air Plan (CAP) every three years to refl ect progress in meeting the air quality standards and to incorporate new information regardi ng the feasibility of control measures and new emission inventory data. The Bay Area's record of progress in implementing previous measures must also be reviewed. Bay Area plans are pr epared with the cooperation of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), and the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG). On January 4, 2006, the BAAQMD adopted the most recent revision to the CAP - the Bay Area 2005 Ozone Strategy (BAAQMD, 2006). The control strategy for the 2005 Ozone Strategy is to implement all feasible measures on an expeditious schedule in order to reduce emissions of ozone precursors and consequently reduce ozone leve ls in the Bay Area and reduce transport to downwind regions. In April 2005, CARB established a new eight-hour average ozone state standard of 0.070 ppm. The new standard took effect in May 2006. The one-hour state standard was also retained. The San Francisco Bay Area has not attained the stat e eight-hour standards and will be taking action as necessary to address those standards as appropria te once the planning requirements have been established. The BAAQMD is beginning the process to prepare the 2009 Bay Area Clean Air Plan . This Plan will: Update the Bay Area 2005 Ozone Strategy in accordance with the requirements of the California Clean Air Act to implement \"all feasible measures\" to reduce ozone; Consider the impacts of ozone control measures on particulate matter, air toxics, and greenhouse gases in a single, integrated plan; Review progress in improving air quality in recent years; and Establish emission control measures to be adopted or implemented in the 2009 -2012 timeframe. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-7 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 The current designation of the Bay Area as non-atta inment with respect to the national 8-hour ozone standard is based on the now defunct 0.08-ppm 8-hour standard. In April 2004, the U.S. EPA designated the Bay Area as a \"marginal\" non-attainment area according to five classes of non-attainment areas for ozone, which range from marginal to extreme. Marginal non- attainment areas were not required to prepare atta inment demonstrations for the 8-hour standard though other planning elements were required. The Bay Area was to address all requirements of the national 8-hour standard in subsequent doc uments. However, effective May 27, 2008, the U.S. EPA lowered the national 8-hour standard fro m 0.08 to 0.075 ppm. EPA is expected to issue final designations based upon the new 0.075 ppm st andard by March 2010, after which planning requirements on non-attainment areas will be imposed. BAAQMD Rules and Regulations The BAAQMD is the regional agency responsible for rulemaking, permitting, and enforcement activities affecting stationary sources in the Bay Area. Specific rules and regulations adopted by the BAAQMD limit the emissions that can be ge nerated by various uses and/or activities, and identify specific pollution reduction measures that must be implemented in association with various uses and activities. These rules regulate not only emissions of the six criteria air pollutants, but also toxic emissions and acutely hazardous non-radioactive materials emissions. Emissions sources subject to these rules are regulated through the BAAQMD's permitting process and standards of operation. Through th is permitting process, including an annual permit review, the BAAQMD monitors generation of stationary emissions and uses this information in developing its air quality plans. Any sources of st ationary emissions constructed as part of the Proposed Project would be subject to the BAAQMD Rules and Regulations . Both federal and state ozone plans rely heavily upon stationary source control measures set forth in BAAQMD's Rules and Regulations. With respect to the construction phase of the Pr oposed Project, applicable BAAQMD regulations would relate to portable equipment (e.g., Portland concrete batch plants, and gasoline- or diesel- powered engines used for power generation, pu mps, compressors, pile drivers, and cranes), architectural coatings, and paving materials. Equipment used during Proposed Project construction would be subject to the requirements of BAAQMD Regulation 2 (Permits), Rule 1(General Requirements) with respect to por table equipment unless exempt under Rule 2-1-105 (Exemption, Registered Statewide Portable Equipment); BAAQMD Regulation 8 (Organic Compounds), Rule 3 (Architectural Coati ngs); and BAAQMD Regulation 8 (Organic Compounds), Rule 15 (Emulsified and Liquid Asphalts). With respect to the operational phase of the Proposed Project, BAAQMD Regulation 2, Permits would apply to sources in the mechanical yard proposed as part of the Proposed Project. Regulatory Setting for Toxic Air Contaminants TACs are regulated under both state and federal la ws. Federal laws use the term \"Hazardous Air Pollutants\" (HAPs) to refer to the same types of compounds that are referred to as TACs under IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-8 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 state law. Both terms encompass essentially th e same compounds. Under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, 189 substances are regulated as HAPs. With respect to state law, in 1983 the California legislature adopted Assembly Bill 1807 (AB 1807), which establishes a process for identifyi ng toxic air contaminants and provides the authority for developing retrofit air toxics control measures on a statewide basis. Air toxics in California may also be regulated because of another state law, the Air Toxics \"Hot Spots\" Information and Assessment Act of 1987, or Assembly Bill 2588 (AB 2588). Under AB 2588, TACs from individual facilities must be quantifie d and reported to the local air pollution control agency. The facilities are then prioritized by the local agencies based on the quantity and toxicity of these emissions, and on their proximity to areas where the public may be exposed. High priority facilities are required to perform a Hea lth Risk Screening Assessment (HRSA), and if specific risk thresholds are exceeded, they are requi red to communicate the results to the public in the form of notices and public meetings. Depe nding on the health risk levels, emitting facilities can be required to implement varying levels of risk reduction measures. CARB identified over 729 TACs, including the 189 federal HAPs, under AB 2588. BAAQMD is responsible for administering federal and state regulations re lated to TACs. Under federal law, these regulations include National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) and Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) for affected sources. BAAQMD also administers the state regulati ons AB1807 and AB 2588 which were discussed above. In addition, the Agency requires that ne w or modified facilities that emit TACs perform air toxics screening analyses as part of the permit application. TAC emissions from new and modified sources are limited through the air toxi cs new source review program, which superseded the BAAQMD Risk Management Policy, in BAAQMD Regulation 2, Rule 5 for New Source Review of Toxic Air Contaminants. Sources must use the Best Available Control Technology for Toxics (T-BACT) if an individual source cancer risk of greater than 1 in a million, or a chronic hazard index greater than 0.20, is id entified in health risk modeling. Regulatory Setting for Greenhouse Gases Various gases that are classified as atmospheri c greenhouse gases (GHGs) play a critical role in determining the Earth's surface temperature. Solar radiation enters Earth's atmosphere from space, and a portion of the radiation is absorbed by the Earth's surface. The Earth re-radiates this energy back toward space, but the properties of the radiation change from high-frequency solar radiation to lower-frequency infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases, which are transparent to solar radiation, are effective in absorbing infrared radi ation. As a result, this radiation that otherwise would have escaped back into space is now retain ed in the atmosphere, and results in a warming of the atmosphere. This phenome non is known as the greenhouse effect. The accumulation of GHGs has contributed to an increase in the temperature of the earth's atmosphere and contributed to global climate change. The principal greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), nitrous and water vapor (H 2O). Carbon dioxide is the reference gas for climate change because it is the predominant GHG emitted. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-9 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Thus far, the approach to addressing the emis sion of GHGs has been through environmental regulations enforced through air quality laws. At the time of writing, there are no state or federal regulations that set ambient air quality emissi ons standards for greenhouse gases. Policies and guidance are being developed by the various le vels of governments to help assess the issue and set voluntary standards for early action. Federal Regulatory Setting for Climate Change The federal Clean Air Act (CAA) requires the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to define national ambient air quality standards (na tional standards) to protect U.S. public health and welfare. The CAA does not specifically regulate GHG emissions; however, the U.S. Supreme Court has determined that GHGs are pollutants that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act. No federal regulations set ambient ai r quality emissions standards for GHGs, at the time of writing. The U.S. EPA annually publishes the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks for estimating sources of GHGs, which is generally co nsistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology developed in its Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The IPCC was established by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). State Regulatory Setting for Climate Change Assembly Bill 1493 (Pavley) In September 2002, Governor Gray Davis si gned Assembly Bill 1493 (Pavley) requiring the development and adoption of regulations to achieve \"the maximum feasible reduction of greenhouse gases\" emitted by noncommercial passen ger vehicles, light-duty trucks, and other vehicles used primarily for personal transportation in the State. Executive Order S-3-05 In 2005, in recognition of California's vulnerabilit y to the effects of climate change, Governor Schwarzenegger established Executive Order S-3-05, which sets forth a series of target dates by which statewide emissions of GHG would be progressively reduced, as follows: By 2010, reduce GHG emissions to 2000 levels; By 2020, reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels; and By 2050, reduce GHG emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels. Assembly Bill 32 (California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006) In 2006, Assembly Bill 32, the California Gl obal Warming Solutions Act was codified as California Health and Safety Code Division 25.5, Sections 38500, et seq. AB 32 requires CARB to design and implement emission limits, regulations, and other measures, such that feasible and cost-effective statewide GHG emissions are reduced to 1990 levels by 2020, which represents an approximate 25 percent reduction in emissions. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-10 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 California Climate Action Team (CAT) In response to Executive Order Executive Orde r S-3-05, the Secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA) created the Climate Action Team (CAT), which published the Climate Action Team Report to G overnor Schwarzenegger and the Legislature in March 2006 (Cal EPA, 2006). The 2006 CAT Report identifies strategies that the State could pursue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These are strategies that could be implemented by various State agencies to ensure that the Governor 's targets are met and can be met with existing authority of the State agencies. The CAT Report provides GHG emission reduction strategies, which include the following: Climate Change Standards. AB 1493 (Pavley) required the state to prepare and adopt regulations that achieve the maximum feasi ble and cost-effective reduction of climate change emissions emitted by passenger vehicl es and light duty trucks. Regulations were adopted by CARB in September 2004. Green Buildings Initiative. Executive Order, S-20-04 (CA 2004), sets a goal of reducing energy use in public and private buildings by 20 percent by the year 2015, as compared with 2003 levels. The Executive Order and re lated action plan spell out specific actions state agencies are to take with state-owned and state-leased buildings. The order and plan also discuss various strategies and incentives to encourage private building owners and operators to achieve the 20 percent target. Vehicle Climate Change Standards. AB 1493 (Pavley) required the state to prepare and adopt regulations that achieve the maximum feasible and cost-effective reduction of climate change emissions emitted by passenger ve hicles and light duty trucks. Regulations were adopted by CARB in September 2004. Diesel Anti-Idling. In July 2004, CARB adopted a measure to limit diesel-fueled commercial motor vehicle idling. Building Energy Efficiency Standards in Place and in Progress. Public Resources Code 25402 authorizes the California Energy Commission (CEC) to adopt and periodically update its building energy efficiency standard s (that apply to newly constructed buildings and additions to and alterati ons to existing buildings). Appliance Energy Efficiency Standards in Place and in Progress . Public Resources Code 25402 authorizes the Energy Commission to adopt and periodically update its appliance energy efficiency standards (that apply to devices and equipment using energy that are sold or offered for sale in California). Fuel-Efficient Replacement Tires & Inflation Programs . State legislation established a statewide program to encourage the production and use of more efficient tires. Measures to Improve Transportation Energy Efficiency. Builds on current efforts to provide a framework for expanded and new initiatives including incentives, tools and information that advance cleaner transportation and reduce climate change emissions. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-11 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 CARB Early Action Measures In June 2007, CARB directed staff to pursu e 37 Recommended Early Actions for reducing GHG emissions under the California Global Warmi ng Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32). The broad spectrum of strategies to be developed - includi ng a Low Carbon Fuel Standard, regulations for refrigerants with high global warming potentials, guidance and protocols for local governments to facilitate GHG reductions, and green ports - reflects the seriousness of the threat of climate change and the need for action as soon as possible (CARB, 2007a). In addition to approving the 37 GHG reduction strategies, CARB directed staff to further evaluate early action recommendations made at the June 2007 meeting, and to report back to CARB within six months. The general sentimen t of CARB suggested a desire to try to pursue greater GHG emissions reductions in California in the near-term. CARB staf f has evaluated all 48 recommendations submitted by several stakeholder and several internally-generated staff ideas, which were published in the Draft List of Early Action Meas ures To Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions In California Recommended For Board Consideration in September 2007 (CARB, 2007a). In December 2007, CARB approved a greenhouse gas emissions limit for 2020 and adopted regulations requiring mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases for large facilities. An inventory of the State's 1990 emissions using a variety of data sources, including inputs related to fuel combustion, industrial processes, and agricultural practices is estimated to be 427 million tons carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2e). Preliminary estimates indicate that 2020 emission projections in California could be 600 million metric tons of CO 2e if no actions are taken to reduce greenhouse gases. This means that California must prevent 174 million metric tons of CO 2e from being emitted by 2020 in order to meet the 1990 level as required by AB 32. The 44 Recommended Early Actions have the poten tial to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 42 million metric tons of CO 2e emissions by 2020, representin g about 25% of the estimated reductions needed by 2020. The 44 measures address various sectors, including fuels, transportation, forestry, agriculture, education, energy efficiency, commercial, solid waste, cement, oil and gas, electricity, and fire suppression. CARB staff released a Pr oposed Scoping Plan in October 2008 (discussed below) to develop pr ograms and measures to address the remaining emissions reductions necessary to reach the total of 174 million metric tons of CO 2e by 2020. CARB also adopted mandatory reporting regulati ons requiring annual reporting from the largest industrial and commercial stationary sources in the state that generate more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. This reporti ng limit is consistent with European Union reporting limits. Cement plants, oil refineries, electric generating facilities / providers, co- generation facilities, and hydrogen pl ants and other stationary combustion sources that emit more than 25,000 metric tons of CO 2 per year, make up 94% of the point source CO 2 emissions in California (CARB, 2007b). Although CARB has established a reporting limit, at the current time, there has been no guidance from CARB, BAAQMD, State Clearinghouse or other resource agency applicable to the IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-12 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Proposed Project on the relation between AB 32 and CEQA, and how GHG emissions should be evaluated in an EIR. Office of Planning and Research (OPR) Technical Advisory on CEQA and Climate Change The Governor's Office of Planning and Resear ch (OPR) is in the process of developing guidelines for the mitigation of GHG emissions or the effects of GHG emissions under CEQA, following Senate Bill 97. OPR is required to pr epare and transmit these guidelines by July 1, 2009 for certification and adoption by January 1, 2010. In the interim, a June 2008 Technical Advisory (OPR, 2008) provides informal guidan ce for public agencies as they address the issue of climate change in their CEQA documents. The June 2008 Technical Advisory from OP R offers recommendations for identifying GHG emissions, determining significance under CEQA, and mitigating impacts. It states that lead agencies under CEQA should develop their own approach to performing a climate change analysis, for projects that generate GHG emis sions. The approach should be consistent for analyzing all such projects, and analyses shoul d be performed based on the best available information. If a lead agency determines that GHGs may be generated by a proposed project, the agency is responsible for quantifying estimated GHG emissions by type and source. The June 2008 Technical Advisory also states that the lead agency must assess whether project emissions are individually or cumulatively significant a nd implement strategies to avoid, reduce, or otherwise mitigate the impacts of those emissions when impacts are potentially significant. Regional agencies can attempt to reduce GHG em issions through their planning processes, according to the OPR Technical Advisory. Regional transportation planning agencies can adopt plans and programs that address congestion relief and reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT), for example. CARB Climate Change Proposed Scoping Plan (October 2008) In October 2008, CARB made public a Climat e Change Proposed Scoping Plan (CARB, 2008e) to be presented for approval in December 2008 out lining the State's strategy to achieve the 2020 greenhouse gas emissions limit. pursuant to AB 32. The Proposed Scoping Plan was developed by CARB in coordination with the Climate Acti on Team (CAT). It proposes a comprehensive set of actions designed to: reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions in California, improve the environment, reduce dependence on oil, diversify our energy sources, save energy, create new jobs, and enhance public health The measures in the Scoping Plan, once approved, will be developed over the next two years and be in pl ace by 2012. The Scoping Plan expands the list of nine Early Action Measures into a list of 39 Recommended Actions. These measures are presented in Table IV.D-2 below. CARB Preliminary Draft Staff Proposal, October 2008 CARB is taking the first step toward developing recommended statewide interim thresholds of significance for GHGs that may be adopted by local agencies for their own use, in its October 2008 Preliminary Draft Staff Proposal Recommended Approaches for Setting Interim Significance Thresholds for Greenhouse Gases under the Californ ia Environmental Quality Act (CARB, IV.

The proposal does not attempt to address every type of project that may be subject to CEQA, but instead focuses on common project typ es that, collectively, are responsible for substantial GHG emissions - specifically, industrial, residential, and commercial projects. CARB is developing these thresholds in these sectors to advance climate objectives, streamline project review, and encourage consistency and uniform ity in the CEQA analysis of GHG emissions throughout the State. Finalized thresholds are not expected until 2009. CARB staff's objective in this proposal is to deve lop a threshold of significance that will result in the vast majority (~90% statewide) of the GHG emissions from new industrial projects being subject to CEQA's requirement to impose feas ible mitigation. CARB believes this can be accomplished with a threshold that allows small projects to be considered insignificant. CARB staff used existing data for the industrial sector to derive a proposed hybrid threshold. The threshold consists of a quantitative threshold of 7,000 metric tons of CO 2 equivalent per year (MTCO2e/year) for operational emissions (excl uding transportation), and performance standards for construction and transportation emissions. These performance standards have not yet been developed. Castro Valley Plan (1985) The 1985 Castro Valley General Plan (County of Alameda Planning Commission, 1985) contains the following general goals, objectives and principl es that would be applicable to air quality: To conserve energy and resources; To reduce to acceptable levels the severity of those environmental hazards, which are man- induced or intensified; and To reduce exposure to environmental hazards. Objective 3 : To conserve and protect significant environmental, energy, archaeological and historical resources; to minimize the adverse and disruptive effects of development on these resources. Principle 3.7 : Uses and activities producing air pollution which would result in unacceptable health conditions should be prohibited. Principle 3.8 : A pattern of urban development should be encouraged which will allow for decreased dependency on the private autom obile and for increased use of alternative transportation modes (walking, bicycling, transit use, etc.). Draft Castro Valley General Plan (2007) The 2007 Draft Castro Valley General Plan Update (2007 Draft General Plan Update ) (County of Alameda, 2007). The 2007 Draft General Plan Update proposes the following air quality goals, policies and actions that would apply to the Proposed Project: Goal 11.2-1 : Improve air quality and meet all fe deral and state ambient air quality standards by reducing the generation of polluta nts from stationary and mobile sources and by appropriate siting and design of sensitive land uses. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-15 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Policy 11.2-1 : Promotion of alternate travel modes to reduce air pollution. Promote pedestrian, bicycle, and transit modes of travel to reduce air pollutant emissions from automobiles. Policy 11.2-5 : Air quality requirements for construction/demolition activities. Reduce combustion emissions and release of suspende d and inhalable particulate matter during construction and demolition phases. Action 11.2-1 : Requirements for air quality analyses for environmental review. In environmental review documents analyzing air quality, comply with the Regional Air Quality Plan's assumptions used for population an d vehicle miles traveled and be consistent with the Clean Air Plan Transportation Control Measures. Action 11.2-5 : BAAQMD's dust abatement approach. Require sponsors of individual development projects requiring site devel opment and/or environmental review to implement the BAAQMD's approach to dust abatement through cond itions of approval. This calls for \"basic\" control measures that shoul d be implemented at a ll construction sites, \"enhanced\" control measures that should be impl emented in addition to the basic control measures at construction sites greater than four acres in area, and \"optional\" control measures that should be implemented on a case-by-case basis at construction sites that are large in area, located near sensitive receptors or which, for any other reason, may warrant additional emissions re ductions (BAAQMD, 1999). Physical Setting Climate and Meteorology Atmospheric conditions such as wind speed, wind direction, and air temperature gradients interact with the physical features of the landscape to determine the movement and dispersal of air pollutants. The Project Site is located in an urbanized portion of the unincorporated community of Castro Valley in central Alameda County and is within the boundaries of the Bay Area Air Basin. The climate of the Bay Area is determined larg ely by a high-pressure system that is almost always present over the eastern Pacific Ocean o ff the West Coast of North America. During winter, the Pacific high-pressure system shifts southward, allowing storms to pass through the region. During summer and fall, emissions gene rated within the Bay Area can combine with abundant sunshine under the restraining influences of topography and subsidence inversions to create conditions that are conducive to the forma tion of photochemical pollutants, such as ozone and secondary particulates, such as nitrates and sulfates. Existing Air Quality Criteria Air Pollutants The BAAQMD and CARB operate a regional monitoring network that measures the ambient concentrations of the six criteria air pollutants within the Bay Area. Existing and probable future levels of air quality in Castro Valley can generally be inferred from ambient air quality measurements conducted by the BAAQMD at its nearby monitoring stations. There are no monitoring stations located within Castro Valley. The San Leandro station (located approximately 1.5 miles to the northwest of the Project Site) is the nearest station to the Project Site and can be IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-16 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 considered to be representative of the air quality in the vicinity of the Project Site. This station monitors ozone concentrations in the area. Ozone data is also provided for the La Mesa Station in Hayward, which is located 4.3 miles southeast of the Project Site. There is no BAAQMD or CARB station that monitors carbon monoxide and PM c oncentrations that can be considered to be representative of concentrations in the area of the Proposed Project. Since both carbon monoxide and particulate matter are local pollutants, data from the Fremont Chapel Hill station (located approximately 20 miles south of Castro Valley) or the Livermore station (located approximately 18 miles to the east) would not be considered repr esentative of actual concentrations in the area of the Proposed Project. Table IV.D-3 shows a five-year summary of monitoring data for ozone from the two stations. The table also compares th ese measured concentrations with state and federal ambient air quality standards. Table IV.D-4 shows trends in regional exceedances of the federal and state ozone standards. Because of th e number of exceedances, ozone is the pollutant of greatest concern in the Bay Area. Bay Area counties experience most ozone exceedances during the period from April through October.

SOURCE: CARB, 2008c, Air Quality Trend Summaries , . Motor vehicle transportation, including automob iles, trucks, transit buses, and other modes of transportation, is the major contributor to re gional air pollution. Stationary sources were once important contributors to both regional and local pollution. Their role has been substantially reduced in recent years by pollution control programs, such as those of the BAAQMD. Any further progress in air quality improvement now focuses heavily on transportation sources. Based on the data shown in Table IV.D-3 , there have been occasion al exceedances of the state 1-hour and 8-hour and just one exceedance of the fede ral 1-hour ozone standard in the vicinity of the Project Site over the last five years. 2003 reported the most number of exceedances. The principal sources of ozone precursors ROG and NOx in the Bay Area include on-road motor vehicles (approximately 35 percent for ROG and 48 percent for NOx), other mobile sources (approximately 22 percent for ROG and 39 percent for NOx), solvent evaporation (approximately 19 percent for ROG), fuel combustion (approximately 9 percent NOx), cleaning and surface coating (approximately 9 percent ROG) and pe troleum production and marketing (approximately 6 percent for ROG). Bay Area emissions of the ozone precursors ROG and NOx are expected to decrease by approximately 21 and 39 percent, respectively, between 2006 and 2020 largely as a result of the State's on-road motor vehicle emission control program (California Air Resources Board, 2006). The Bay Area has a significant motor vehicle population and these projected reductions are based on an increased number of vehicles meeting more stringent emission standards entering the fleet, the use of cleaner burning gasoline by all vehicl es, and the increased use of diesel or alternative fuels. Reductions would also result from the use of improved evaporative emission control systems, computerized fuel injection, engine management systems, cleaner gasoline and the Smog Check program. ROG and NOx emissions from other mobile and stationary sources are IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-18 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 also projected to decline as more stringent emission standards and control technologies are adopted and implemented. The Bay Area has been in attainment and has not experienced any exceedances of state and federal ambient carbon monoxide standards in the last five years. Currently, on-road motor vehicles are responsible for approximately 64 and 68 percent of the carbon monoxide emitted within the San Francisco Bay Area and Alameda County, respectively (California Air Resources Board, 2006). Total carbon monoxide emissions ar e expected to decrease within the county by approximately 38 percent between 2006 and 2020 primarily due to attrition of older, high polluting vehicles, improvements in the overall automobile fleet, and improved fuel mixtures (California Air Resources Board, 2006). The Bay Area does experience exceedances of the st ate PM-10 and PM-2.5 standards on a fairly regular basis. However, site-specific informati on on particulate matter concentrations in the Proposed Project area is not available. Contributor s to PM concentrations in the Proposed Project area are primarily urban sources, such as dust suspended by vehicle traffic, and secondary aerosols formed by reactions in the atmosphere . Particulate concentrations near residential sources generally are higher during the winter, when more fireplaces are in use and meteorological conditions prevent the dispersion of directly emitted contaminants. Direct PM-10 emissions in Alameda County are expected to increase by approximately 12 percent between 2006 and 2020 (California Air Resources Board, 2006). This increase would be primarily fugitive dust from increased vehicle miles traveled (VMT) as well as additional stationary sources (such as industrial activities) and area sources (such as construction and demolition, road dust and other miscellaneous processes). Fugitive dust refers to particulate matter not emitted from a duct, tailpipe or stack, which becomes airborne due to the forces of wind, man's activity, or both. Activities that generate fugitive dust include vehi cle travel over paved and unpaved roads, brake wear, tire wear, soil cultivation, off-road vehicles, any vehicles operating on open fields or dirt roadways, or wind erosion of exposed surfaces, st orage piles at construction sites, etc. PM-2.5 emissions in Alameda County are projected to rema in steady over the same period (California Air Resources Board, 2006), as the reduction in emi ssions from on-road and off-road engines would be offset by an increase in their activity and also an increase in industrial growth. The national and state standards for nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and lead are being met in the Bay Area, and the latest pollutant trends suggest that these standards will not be exceeded in the foreseeable future. Toxic Air Contaminants The ambient background of TACs is the combin ed result of many diverse human activities, including gasoline stations, automobiles, dry cl eaners, industrial operations, hospital sterilizers, and painting operations. In general, mobile sources contribute more significantly to health risks than do stationary sources. Both BAAQMD and CA RB operate a network of monitoring stations that measure ambient concentrations of certain TACs that are associated with strong health- related effects and are present in appreciable con centrations in the Bay Area, as in all urban areas. Ambient concentrations of TACs are similar th roughout the urbanized areas of the Bay Area. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-19 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Of the pollutants for which monitoring data are av ailable, benzene and 1,3-butadiene (which are emitted primarily from motor vehicles) account for over one half of the average calculated cancer risk (BAAQMD, 2007). Benzene levels have declined dramatically since 1996 with the advent of Phase 2 reformulated gasoline. The use of reform ulated gasoline also appears to have led to significant decreases in 1,3-butadiene. Due larg ely to these observed reductions in ambient benzene and 1,3-butadiene levels, the calcul ated network average cancer risk has been significantly reduced in recent years. Based on 2003 ambient monitoring data, the BAAQMD reported a calculated lifetime cancer risk fro m measured concentrations of TACs, excluding diesel particulate matter, to be 143 in one million averaged over all Bay Area locations (BAAQMD, 2007). This is 53 percent less than what was observed in 1995 (BAAQMD, 2007). There is growing evidence that indicates that e xposure to emissions from diesel-fueled engines, about 95 percent of which come from diesel-fueled mobile sources, may result in cancer risks that exceed those attributed to other measured TACs. In 1998, OEHHA issued a health risk assessment that included estimates of the cancer potency of diesel particulate matter (DPM). Because DPM cannot be directly monitored in the ambient air, however, estimates of cancer risk resulting from diesel PM exposure must be based on concentration estimates made using indirect methods (e.g., derivation from ambient meas urements of a surrogate compound). Based on CARB estimates of the population-weighted aver age ambient DPM concentration for the Bay Area, and the best-estimate cancer potency fact or adopted by OEHHA, the approximate cancer risk associated with exposure to diesel PM for 2003 is about 500 to 700 in one million (BAAQMD, 2007). CARB has conducted monitori ng studies throughout California, measuring DPM levels in the ambient air, based on which, CARB has estimated that, in the San Francisco Bay Area, the number of cancer cases from lifetime exposure to DPM is about 480 cases per million persons (CARB, 2008d). Greenhouse Gases The California Energy Commission reports that Calif ornia is the 12th to 16th largest emitter of CO 2 in the world and produced 492 million metric tons of CO 2e in 2004 (California Energy Commission, 2006). Consumption of fossil fuels in the transportation sector was the single largest source of California's GHG emissions in 2004, accounting for 40.7% of total GHG emissions in the state. This category was followed by the el ectric power sector (including both in-state and out-of-state sources) (22.2%) and the industrial sector (20.5%). Methane, a highly potent GHG, results from off-gassing associated with agricultural practices and landfills. The increased concentration of GHGs in the atmosp here has been linked to global warming, which can lead to changes in climate. Some of the potential resulting effects in California of global warming may include loss in Sierra snow pack an d threats to water supplie s, sea level rise, more extreme heat days per year, more high ozone days, more large forest fires, and more drought years (CalEPA, 2006). Globally, climate change has th e potential to impact numerous environmental resources through potential, though uncertain, impacts related to future air temperatures and precipitation patterns. The projec ted effects of global warming on we ather and climate are likely to vary regionally, but are expected to include the following direct effects (IPCC, 2001): IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-20 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Higher maximum temperatures and more hot days over nearly all land areas; Higher minimum temperatures, fewer cold days and frost days over nearly all land areas; Reduced diurnal temperature range over most land areas; Increase of heat index over land areas; and More intense precipitation events. Also, there are many secondary effects that are projected to result from global warming, including global rise in sea level, impacts to agriculture, ch anges in disease vectors, and changes in habitat and biodiversity. While the possible outcomes a nd the feedback mechanisms involved are not fully understood, and much research remains to be done, the potential for substantial environmental, social, and economic con sequences over the long term may be great. Sensitive Land Uses Some persons are considered more sensitive than others to air pollutants. The reasons for heightened sensitivity may include health prob lems, proximity to the emissions source, and duration of exposure to air pollutants. Land uses such as schools, hospitals, and convalescent homes are considered to be relatively sensitive to poor air quality because the very young, the old, and the infirm are more susceptible to respirator y infections and other air-quality-related health problems than the general public. Residential area s are considered sensitive to poor air quality because people are often at home for extended periods. Recreational land uses are moderately sensitive to air pollution, because vigorous exer cise associated with recreation places a high demand on the human respiratory system. Uses surrounding the Project Site primarily include a mix of residential uses, medical offices and medical support use, and commercial businesses. Uses immediately to the south include a skilled nursing facility, apartments and a residence owned by Eden Medical Center and maintained as a dormitory for trauma physicians. To the west, along and across Stanton Avenue, are apartments and single-family homes, medical offices and a skilled nursing facility. To the north, between the Eden Medical Center and Somerset Avenue, are apartments, single-family homes and a religious facility fronting Lake Chabot Road. To the east, along and across Lake Chabot Road, are a mix of apartments, medical offices, medical services, and commercial businesses. Impacts and Mitigation Measures Significance Criteria In accordance with Appendix G of the CEQA Guideline s, the impact of the Proposed Project on air quality would be considered significant if it would: Conflict with or obstruct implementation of the applicable air quality plan; Violate any air quality standard or contribute substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation; Result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any nonattainment pollutant; IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-21 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Expose sensitive receptors to substan tial pollutant concentrations; or Create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people. Criteria Air Pollutants BAAQMD significance criteria guidelines are also u sed to determine the significance of potential air quality impacts from criteria air pollutants. On a project level, construction-related criteria air pollutant emissions are typically considered l ess than significant if appropriate mitigation is followed to minimize particulate matter emissions . According to the guidelines, a project would have a significant impact on air quality if the development and operation of the project would produce total criteria pollutant emissions (stationary and mobile sources) equal to or greater than the BAAQMD thresholds of 80 pounds per day (lb/day) for ROG, NO X, or PM 10. Also, CO analysis would be necessary if: vehicle emissions of CO would exceed 550 lb/day; project traffic would affect intersections or roadway links operating at level of service (LOS) D, E, or F or would cause a decrease in LOS to D, E, or F; or project traffic would increase traffic volumes on nearby roadways by 10%or more, unless the increase in traffic volume is less than 100 vehicles per hour. A project would have a significant impact if it contributed to an increase in CO above the state standard of 9 parts per million (ppm) averaged over 8 hours, and 20 ppm for 1 hour (BAAQMD, 1999). In accordance with the BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines , a project that would individually have a significant impact on air quality would also be considered to have a significant cumulative air quality impact (BAAQMD, 1999). Toxic Air Contaminants The significance of health risks from the Propo sed Project depends upon the increased likelihood of contracting cancer from exposure to the TACs. For purposes of this EIR, a project would have a significant effect on the environment if it would exceed the criteria listed below: Exceed the BAAQMD recommended standard of significance by exposing receptors to TAC emissions that could result in a cancer risk greater than 10 cancer cases per one million people exposed for a lifetime. According to the BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines , any project with the potential to expose sensitive receptors (including residential areas) or the gene ral public to substantial levels of TACs would be deemed to have a significant impact, either fro m a risk of cancer or from other adverse health effects. The significance threshold of 10 in one million for the maximum lifetime cancer risk has been established by several regulations and agencies, including the regulation under AB 2588, as well IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-22 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 as Proposition 65, both of which require public notif ication if the incremental risk equals or exceeds 10 in one million. BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines also recommend that the cancer risk significance threshold for a project be 10 in a million. Greenhouse Gas Emissions The increased concentration of GHGs in the atmos phere has been linked to global warming which can lead to climate change. The constructi on and operation of the Proposed Project would contribute to GHG emissions. At the time of writing, there are no state or federal regulations that set ambient air quality emissions standards for green house gases. Also, at this time few, if any, cities, counties or agencies stat ewide have adopted final signifi cance criteria for evaluating a project's contribution to climate change. In October 2008, CARB released Recommended Approaches for Interim Significance Th resholds For Greenhouse Gases under CEQA (CARB, 2008b) which proposes separate industrial and reside ntial/commercial approaches to determining significance However, this draft staff proposal does not offer specific performance standards for most construction or operation categories. Thus, th ere remain no finalized criteria for determining the impact of the emissions of greenhouse g ases by a project. For the Proposed Project, two considerations are identified in evaluating whether project emissions could conflict with the state goals for reducing GHGs. The Governor's Office of Planning and Research (OPR) has asked the California Air Resources Bo ard to \"recommend a method for setting thresholds of significance to encourage consistency and uniformity in the CEQA analysis of GHG emissions\" throughout the state because OPR has recognized that \"the global nature of climate change warrants investigation of a statewide threshold for GHG emissions.\" 2 In the interim, OPR's June 2008 technical advi sory for addressing climate change through CEQA review offers informal guidance on the step s that lead agencies should take to addr ess climate changes in their CEQA documents, in the absence of statewide thresholds. OPR will develop, and the California Resources Agency will certify and adopt amendments to the CEQA Guidelines on or before January 1, 2010, pursuant to Senate Bill 97. The informal guidelines in OPR's technical advisory provide a basis for determining proposed project's contribution of GHG emissions and the project's contribution to global climate change. In the absence of adopted statewide thresholds, OPR recommends the following approach for analyzing GHG emissions: 1. Identify and quantify the project's GHG emissions; 2. Assess the significance of the impact on climate change; and 3. If the impact is found to be significant, identify alternatives and/ or mitigation measures that would reduce the impact to less than significant levels. 2 Governor's Office of Planning and Research. Technical Advisory- CEQA and Climate Change: Addressing Climate Change to the California E nvironmental Quality Act (CEQA) Revi ew. June 19, 2008. This document is available online at the Offi ce of Planning and Research 's website at: www.opr.gov. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-23 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Based on a review of recent publications and ac tions from CARB and OPR's technical advisory (CARB 2007a, and 2007b; Governor's Office of Planning and Research, 2008), two considerations will be used to evaluate whether the project emissions could conflict with the State goals for reducing GHG emissions. Each is discussed in the impacts analysis below. The considerations include: A. The project's potential conflicts with the 39 Recommended Actions identified by CARB in its October 2008 Climate Change Proposed Scopi ng Plan, which includes nine Early Action Measures. B. The relative size of the project in comparis on to the statewide estimated greenhouse gas emission reduction goal of 169 million metric tons of CO 2e by 2020 and in comparison to the size of major facilities that are required to report GHG emissions (25,000 metric tons of CO 2e per year)3; and GHG impacts are considered to be exclusively cumulative impacts; there are no non-cumulative greenhouse gas em ission impacts from a climate change perspective (CAPCOA, 2008). Methodology Criteria Pollutants For construction phase impacts, BAAQMD does not require quantification of construction emissions, but recommends that significance be b ased on a consideration of the control measures to be implemented (BAAQMD, 1999). Constructi on impacts are discussed qualitatively and the applicable BAAQMD recommended dust abatement measures are identified. The exposure of nearby sensitive receptors to elevated levels of PM and other criteria emissions from construction of the Proposed Project would extend over approximately 4.5 years (and up to 6 years under the Subsequent New MOB Scenario). Therefore, although the BAAQMD does not require a detailed quantification of construction emissions, criteria pollutant emissions from the construction of the Proposed Project have been quantified usi ng URBEMIS 2007 (version 9.2.4) Air Pollution Emission Model and presented in this section. Operational criteria air pollutant emissions generated from traffic and area sources (such as natural gas combustion in Proposed Project build ings for space and water heating, landscaping) were modeled using the URBEMIS 2007 and traffic su rvey data and projections of future traffic prepared for the Proposed Project. Total Propo sed Project emissions are compared to the BAAQMD operational significance threshold of 80 pounds per day for ROG, NO X and PM 10. Localized carbon monoxide impacts at intersections in the vicinity of the Proposed Project area have been estimated using the BAAQMD's methodology for manual calculation of CO concentrations and compared to the ambient air quality standard. 3 The State of California has not provided final guidanc e as to quantitative significance thresholds for assessing the impact of greenhouse gas em issions on climate change a nd global warming concerns. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-24 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Toxic Air Contaminants The exposure of sensitive receptors to toxic ai r contaminant emissions that result from the construction activities is also discussed in detail. Project construction emissions were calculated using the URBEMIS model based on construction phasing information provided by the Project Sponsor. Subsequent dispersion modeling and estimat ion of health risks for construction-related DPM was conducted using the AERMOD dispersi on model (US EPA, 2004). Meteorological data from the BAAQMD's Chabot Monitoring Station for the years 1990 through 1992 was used to prepare hourly meteorological data for use in AERMOD and urban dispersion coefficients were used in the modeling. All mode ling was conducted following a protocol that satisfies the analysis requirements of CEQA and BAAQMD Regulation 2, Rule 5 for New Source Review of Toxic Air Contaminants. Impacts and Mitigation Measures Construction Emissions Impact AIR-1: Construction and demolition activities associated with new development under the Proposed Project would generate and expose sensitive receptors to short-term emissions of criteria pollutants, including su spended and inhalable particulate matter and equipment exhaust emissions. (Potentially Significant) Construction related emissions of fugitive dust and criteria polluta nts would be short term, but have a potential to cause adverse effects on local ai r quality. Construction is expected to begin in mid 2009 and expected to last through 2013. The Proposed Project would involve the demolition of the 235,000 square foot Existing Hospita l and the 49,000 square feet Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital to allow for the constructi on of a 230,000 square feet New Hospital. An approximately 80,000 square-foot Medical Office Building (New MOB) is also planned east of and adjacent to the New Hospital. To accommodate the development of the Proposed Project, the Existing Hospital, the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital, approximately 19,500 square feet of MOB (Eden Professional Offices) and the 42-un it Pine Cone Apartment Complex fronting Stanton at Nordell Avenue would be demolished at different times during the Proposed Project's construction period. In addition, the Proposed Pr oject would relocate the existing helipad located in the northwest corner of the campus to a lo cation 150 feet northeast of the present pad. The proposed helipad location is currently an undevelo ped earthen knoll. This knoll would be graded down approximately 13 feet to an elevation approx imately 5 feet higher than the existing pad. The medical center would continue to provide uninterrupted medical service on site during implementation of the Proposed Project. Project-related construction activities would include site preparation, earthmoving and general construction. Construction of the several diffe rent components of the Proposed Project would take place according to the general schedule prov ided in the discussion of Construction Phasing in Chapter III, Project Description. The emissions generated from these construction activities include: IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-25 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Dust (including PM 10 and PM 2.5) primarily from \"fugitive\" sources (i.e., emissions released through means other than through a stack or tailpipe) such as soil disturbance; Combustion emissions of criteria air pollutants (ROG, NO x, CO, SO x, PM 10) primarily from operation of heavy equipment construction mach inery (primarily diesel fueled), portable auxiliary equipment and construc tion worker automobile trips (primarily gasoline fueled); Combustion emissions of TACs from oper ation of heavy equipment construction machinery, portable auxiliary equipment a nd construction traffic (discussed under Impact AIR-2 below); and Evaporative emissions (ROG) from asphalt pavi ng and architectural coating applications. Construction-related fugitive dus t emissions would vary throug hout constructio n, depending on the level and type of activity, silt content of th e soil, and the weather. The BAAQMD approach to analyses of fugitive dust emissions from constructi on is to emphasize implementation of effective and comprehensive dust control measures rather than detailed quantification of emissions. BAAQMD considers any project's construction related impacts to be less than significant if the required dust-control measures are implemented. Without these BAAQMD measures, the impact is generally considered to be significant, par ticularly if sensitive land uses are located in the project vicinity. In the case of the Proposed Proj ect, residential land uses are located as close as 60 feet to the north and west of the Project Site . Therefore, with the implementation of Mitigation Measure AIR-1a that lists the measures recomme nded by the BAAQMD for sites larger than 4 acres and close to sensitive receptors, the impact of fugitive dust emissions would be considered less than significant. Construction activities would also result in the emission of criteria pollutants ROG, NO X, CO, SO X and PM 10 from equipment exhaust, construction-re lated vehicular activ ity and construction worker automobile trips. Emission levels for construction activities would vary depending on the number and type of equipment, duration of u se, operation schedules, and the number of construction workers. Criteria pollutant emissions of ROG and NO x from these emission sources would incrementally add to the regional atmo spheric loading of ozone precursors during construction of the Proposed Project. BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines do not require quantification of these emissions and do not provide a signifi cance threshold for the evaluation of significance of the impact. The Guidelines recognize that cons truction equipment emits ozone precursors, but indicate that such emissions are included in the emission inventory that is the basis for regional air quality plans and are therefore not expected to impede attainment or maintenance of ozone standards in the Bay Area (BAAQMD, 1999). Neve rtheless, due to the size of the Proposed Project and extended duration of construction activ ities, construction emissions for the Proposed Project have been quantified using URBEMIS 2007 and the construction schedule provided by the Project Sponsor. Construction emissions we re estimated for both the Concurrent Build Scenario (wherein the New Hospital and New MOB would be built simultaneously) and the Subsequent Build Scenario (wherein the constr uction of the New MOB would take place after the construction of the New Hospital is completed) .

There are no applicable significance criteria for the quantitative evaluation of construction emissions , however, daily emissions estimates for both scenarios are less than the BAAQMD 80 pounds per day significance criteria for operational emissions of ROG, NO x and PM 10 and are therefore considered less than significant. Mitigation Measure AIR-1b would further reduce the impact of construction emissions of criteria pollutants and TACs on regional and local air quality. Mitigation Measure AIR-1a: During construction, the Project Sponsor shall require the construction contractor to implement the following measures required as part of BAAQMD's basic, and enhanced dust cont rol procedures required for sites larger than four acres and close to sensitive receptors. These include: a) Water all active construction areas at least twice daily. Watering should be sufficient to prevent airborne dust from leaving the site. Increased watering frequency may be necessary whenever wind speeds exceed 15 miles per hour. Reclaimed water should be used whenever possible. b) Cover all trucks hauling soil, sand, an d other loose materials or require all trucks to maintain at least two feet of freeboard (i.e., the minimum required space between the top of the load and the top of the trailer). c) Pave, apply water three times daily, or apply (non-toxic) soil stabilizers on all unpaved access roads, parking areas and st aging areas at construction sites. d) Sweep daily (with water sweepers using reclaimed water if possible) all paved access roads, parking areas and staging areas at construction sites. e) Sweep streets (with water sweepers using reclaimed water if possible) at the end of each day if visible soil material is carried onto adjacent paved roads. f) Hydroseed or apply (non-toxic) soil stab ilizers to inactive construction areas (previously graded areas inac tive for one month or more). g) Enclose, cover, water twice daily or a pply (non-toxic) soil stabilizers to exposed stockpiles (dirt, sand, etc.). h) Limit traffic speeds on unpaved roads to 15 miles per hour. i) Limit the amount of the disturbed area at any one time, where feasible. j) Pave all roadways, driveways, sidewalks, et c. as soon as feasible. In addition, building pads should be laid as soon as possible after grading unless seeding or soil binders are used. k) Replant vegetation in disturbed areas as quickly as feasible. l) Suspend excavation and grading activity when winds (instantaneous gusts) exceed 25 mph. m) Designate a person or persons to monito r the dust control program and to order increased watering, as necessary, to prev ent transport of dust offsite. Their IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-28 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 duties shall include holidays and weekend periods when work may not be in progress. The name and telephone number of such persons shall be provided to the BAAQMD prior to the start of construction as well as posted on site over the duration of construction. Mitigation Measure AIR-1b: To further mitigate less-than-significant Project-level impacts, additional measures related to the 2007 CARB off-road diesel rule on equipment exhaust emissions from construc tion equipment shall be required in the Proposed Project's construction contracts to comply with the following measures: a) Prohibit the use of conventional cutb ack asphalt for paving to restrict the maximum VOC content of asphalt emulsion. Diesel portable generators less than 50 horsepower shall not be allowed at the construction site, except for those used by welders.4 b) All diesel-fueled engines used for on- and offsite construction activities shall be fueled only with ultralow sulfur diesel, which contains no more than 15 ppm sulfur. c) All construction diesel engines used for on- and offsite activities that have a rating of 100 hp or more shall meet, at a minimum, the Tier 2 California Emission Standards for Off-Road Compressi on-Ignition Engines as specified in California Code of Regulations, Title 13, section 2423(b)(1) unless it is certified by the construction contractor that such engine is not available for a particular item of equipment. In the event a Tier 2 engine is not available for any off-road engine larger than 100 hp, that engine shall be a Tier 1 engine. In the event a Tier 1 or Tier 2 engine is not available for any off road engine larger than 100 hp, that engine shall be equipped with a CARB Level 3-verified diesel emission control device (e.g., catalyzed diesel particulate filter), unless the engine manufacturer or the construction contractor certifies that the use of such devices is not practical for specific engine types. In the event that a CARB Level 3 verified diesel emission control device is not practical for the specific engine type, then the engine shall be equipped with a CARB Level 1- or 2-verified control device (e.g., diesel oxidation cata lyst), unless the engine manufacturer or the construction contractor certifies th at such devices are not available for the engine in question. For purposes of this condition, the use of such devices is \"not practical\" if, among other reasons: 1. The construction equipment is intended to be on site for ten (10) days or less. 2. The use of the diesel emission control device is excessively reducing normal availability of the construction equipment due to increased downtime for maintenance, and/or reduced power output due to an excessive increase in backpressure. 3. The diesel emission control device is ca using or is reasonably expected to cause significant engine damage. In the event that the use of a diesel emission control device is to be terminated, the construction contractor shall be required to inform the Project's construction manager within 10 days prior to such termination. 4 Welding trucks have self-contained units with generators less than 50 horsepower. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-29 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 d) Construction equipment shall be properly tuned and maintained in accordance with manufacturers' specifications. e) Best management construction practices shall be used to avoid (or limit) unnecessary emissions (e.g., trucks and vehicles in loading and unloading queues shall turn their engines off when not in u se, and to the extent practical, all diesel heavy construction equipment shall not remain running at idle for more than five minutes). f) Use alternative fueled equipment when feasible (such as ULSD, CNG, biodiesel, water emulsion fuel, and electric). The co nstruction contracts shall require each contractor and subcontractor to consid er this measure and adopt it for their work unless they can demonstrate to th e Project construction manager the inapplicability or infeasibility of the measure to their specific work, or can provide mitigation measures with equivalent or better effectiveness. This information shall be reported as part of the Mitigation Monitoring Reporting and Compliance Program. g) Use onsite power when feasible to redu ce reliance on portable generators. The construction contracts shall require ea ch contractor and subcontractor to consider this measure and adopt it for th eir work unless they can demonstrate to the Project construction manager the inapplicability or infeasibility of the measure to their specific work, or can provide mitigation measures with equivalent or better effectiveness. This information shall be reported as part of the Mitigation Monitoring Reporting and Compliance Program. Significance after Mitigation: Less than Significant. _________________________ Short-Term TAC Emissions Impact AIR-2: Activities associated with Pr oposed Project construction would generate short-term emissions of TACs, including susp ended and inhalable particulate matter and equipment exhaust emissions, during the term of construction. (Less than Significant) Assumptions The primary TAC emission created during construction is diesel particulate matter (DPM), mainly from construction equipment and trucks th at are involved in construction activities. For the purpose of analyzing DPM emissions from the Proposed Project, it was assumed that all off- road PM2.5 exhaust would be DPM. Constructi on is currently estimated to take between approximately 4.5 years (or up to 6 years under the Subsequent New MOB Scenario)l, as detailed in Chapter III, Project Description, under Development Phasing . To ensure a conservative analysis that would address a worst-case scenario of construction duration, this analysis assumes that total DPM emissions from all activities incl uding off-road equipment used on site, would total a maximum of approximately 2,000 pou nds (or one ton or less) in total. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-30 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 This analysis also assumes that if a longer cons truction schedule was chosen over a shorter more condensed schedule that the total mass emissi ons over the entire construction phase would be equal. This is based on the assumption that the same amount of equipment would be used regardless of the construction duration, and that extending or shifting a particular construction phase would result in the emissions occurring over a longer time period but would not increase total construction emissions. Specifically, whethe r the New MOB is constructed currently with the New Hospital, or after the New Hospital is completed - thereby extending the construction phase by approximately 18 months, the total emissions would be the same. DPM Emissions and Cancer Risk Cancer risk is directly proportional to the concen tration of a given TAC in the air. In addition, concentrations of air pollutants are directly pro portional to the amount of a pollutant emitted from a source over a given time period. Therefore, assuming all other factors (e.g. subsequent ), such as meteorology and site configuration) remain c onstant, estimated concentrations are directly proportional to the amount of pollution emitted. Since the total amount of DPM emitted will remain constant no matter which New MOB scenario is implemented, it can be assumed that total dosage will be the same regardless. For the pur pose of this analysis it was assumed that construction would occur over a worst-case six year construction phase (mid-2009 through 2015) and therefore annual average DPM emissions woul d be approximately 333.5 pounds per year. The annual emissions rate of 333.5 pounds was input into the USEPA dispersion model AERMOD to determine the average DPM concentr ations at sensitive receptors throughout the six-year construction period. Construction emis sions were modeled as a series of line sources covering the construction area with a release height of five meters. GIS was used to determine the geographic location of the sources as well as the approximate location of existing sensitive receptors surrounding the Project Site. Receptors were modeled at ground level to de termine worst-case exposure. Elevations for receptors and sources were derived from the USGS Hayward 7.5 minute digital elevation model (DEM) using AERMAP, an accessory program to AERMOD (US EPA, 2004). Meteorological data from the BAAQMD's Chabot Monitoring Station for the years 1990 through 1992 was used to prepare hourly meteorological data for use in AERMOD. This station is approximately 1.5 miles northwest of the Project Site and is representative of conditions at the Project Site. Opaque cloud cover data from the San Francisco Airport was used to supplement this data for use in AERMOD. The maximum incremental cancer risk from exposure to DPM was calculated following the guidelines established by California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA, 2003) in conjunction with the BAAQMD' s Health Risk Screening Analysis (HRSA) Guidelines (BAAQMD, 2005). Modeling results were used to determine the av erage concentration of DPM in the air during construction activities. The BAAQMD recommended 80 th percentile adult breathing rate of IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-31 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 302 L/kg-day was used in the equation and the ex posure frequency and duration were assumed to be 350 days per year and six years respectively. The inhalation absorption factor was assumed to be 1. To determine incremental cancer risk the est imated dose through inhalation was multiplied by cancer potency slope factor for DPM, 1.1 (mg/kg-day) -1. It should be noted that the cancer potency slopes established by OEHHA were determined based on a minimum exposure duration of nine years. There is a large degree of uncertainty regarding cancer risk from short-term high exposures versus long-term lower exposures (O EHHA, 2003). Since cancer risk was evaluated for a six-year period there is some uncertainty in the actual cancer risk that would result from DPM emissions generated during cons truction of the Proposed Project. The maximum annual average concentration of DP M over the six years of construction at the nearby sensitive receptors was estimated to be approximately 0.13 micrograms per cubic meter. Based on this concentration maximum incremental ca ncer risk to sensitive r eceptors in the area of the Proposed Project would be approximately 3.5 in one million. The AERMOD modeling report and figures showing cancer risk isopleths near the Project Site from construction are included in Appendix D.1. Since the maximum incremental cancer risk to n earby sensitive receptors will be less than 10 in one million, the impact from construction on ex isting offsite receptors would be less than significant. Mitigation: None required. Operational Emissions Impact AIR-3: The Proposed Project would result in increased long-term emissions of criteria pollutants from vehicular traffic to and from the Project Site and other onsite sources. (Less than Significant) The Proposed Project would result in an increase in criteria air pollutant emissions from a variety of emissions sources, including stationary sources (e.g., water heaters and landscape maintenance) and mobile on-road sources (e.g., automobile and truck trips). Table IV.D-7 summarizes Project-generated mobile and stationary emissions of criteria pollutants for the Proposed Project in the year 2015 (worst-case buildout year assumed for air quality) and compares them with significance threshold emission levels. The Proposed Project would result in approximately 1,780 net new vehicl e trips per day. This assumes that the traffic generated by the proposed New Ho spital would be the same as the level of traffic generated by the Existing Hospital and the Laurel Grove Reha bilitation Hospital combined. Therefore, the net increase in vehicle trips stated is due to the c onstruction of the New MOB after trips reduced due to the demolition of the Eden Professional Offices an d the Pine Cone Apartments is taken into IV.

Based on the traffic impact analysis prepared by Fehr & Peers consultants (and presented in Section IV.C of this EIR), URBEMI S 2007 (version 9.2.4) was used to estimate the Proposed Project's operational emissions of criteria air pollutants. Table IV.D-7 shows the emissions associated with the increased vehicle tr ip generation for an average weekday. Reduced emissions may be attributed to a large degree to the increased efficiencies gained through the circulation improvements that create direct access from the main campus to the parking garage and less circulation to locate available parking. As indicated in Table IV.D-7 , Project-related mobile emissions in the year 2015 would not exceed the significance thresholds for ROG, NOx or PM-10. Therefore, the operational impact of Pr oject emissions from increase in vehicular trips and area sources associated with the Proposed Proj ect would be less than significant. Detailed URBEMIS 2007 model outputs for Project operation are provided in the Appendix D.2 to this EIR. Mitigation: None required. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-33 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Carbon Monoxide Concentrations Impact AIR-4: Mobile emissions generate d by Project traffic would increase carbon monoxide concentrations at intersections in the Proposed Project vicinity. (Less than Significant) In addition to the project's regional contributio n to the total pollution burden, project-related traffic may lead to localized \"hot spots\" or areas with high concentrations of carbon monoxide concentrations around stagnation points such as major intersections and heavily traveled and congested roadways. In addition to increasing ex isting traffic volumes, project-related traffic could cause existing non-project traffic to travel at slower, more polluting speeds. While ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide are expected to decline, on average, in future years because emission controls on new vehicles will reduce CO emission rates faster than vehicle travel increases, local CO emissions and concentra tions might increase under conditions of intense development and increasing travel leading to \"hot spots\". However, as the Proposed Project would replace an existing hospital with a new hospital of approximately the same size, the trips generation due to the existing and new hospitals has been assumed to be the same. The minimal increase in da ily and peak hour vehicle trips is due to the demolition of the existing Pine Cone apartm ents and the Eden Professional Offices and construction of the 80,000 square feet New MOB. The net increase in vehicle trips generated by the Proposed Project is estimated at 1,780 daily trips, 125 a.m. and 184 p.m. trips. These trips would be distributed over the local roadway network surrounding the Project Site and no single intersection would experience all the trips. This mi nimal level of traffic increase is not expected to lead to violations of the CO standard as am bient concentrations in the area are well below the state and national ambient air quality standards. Background concentrations of carbon monoxide are projected to decline progressively compared to existing conditions in 2015 (and 2035) due to improvements in the automobile fleet, attrition of older, high-polluting vehicles, and improved fuel mixtures. Such reductions would more than offset any effects of increase in traffic due to the Proposed Project and cumulative development. Thus, Project-related and cumulative traffic would have a less than significant impact on local carbon monoxide concentrations. Mitigation: None required. Greenhouse Gas Emissions Impact AIR-5: The Proposed Project would contribute incrementally to global climate change but would not conflict with the State's plans to achieve the goals of reducing greenhouse gases. (Less than Significant) The Proposed Project would contribute to global climate change as a result of emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily CO 2, emitted by trucks and earthm oving equipment associated with IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-34 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 construction activities. As of the date of th is analysis neither the BAAQMD, CARB nor any federal agency has finalized an emission rate criterion for CO 2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions for the purposes of identifying a signifi cant contribution to global climate change. Pursuant to Senate Bill 97, the Governor's O ffice of Planning and Research (OPR) is in the process of developing CEQA guidelines \"for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions or the effects of greenhouse gas emissions.\" OPR is requi red to \"prepare, develop, and transmit\" the guidelines to the Resources Agency on or before July 1, 2009. The Resources Agency must certify and adopt the guidelines on or before January 1, 2010. In the interim, the California Air Pollution Control Officers Association (CAPCOA) has prepared a white paper that considers options for evaluating and addressing greenhou se gas emissions under CEQA (CAPCOA, 2008). This document identifies 11 different significance threshold possibilities that could be used to assess the significance of impacts relative to greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis detailed below applies Threshold 2.3 of the CAPCOA wh ite paper, titled CARB Reporting Threshold, as well as other considerations pertinent to compliance with AB 32. In lieu of any official regulatory directive or precedent for identifying significant greenhouse gas emissions, a project could be deemed to have a significant air quality impact if it would conflict with the state goal of reducing greenhouse gas emi ssions in California to 1990 levels by 2020, as set forth by the timetable established in AB 32, California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006. If a project complies with the state's st rategies to reduce greenhouse gasses to the level proposed by the governor, it follows that the proj ect would have a less than significant cumulative impact to global climate change. If a project does not or cannot comply with reduction strategies, the applicant can alternatively reduce its cumula tive contribution to greenhouse gas emissions to less than significant levels by contributing to ava ilable regional, state, national, or international mitigation programs, such as reforestation, tree planting, or carbon trading. As with other individual relatively small projects (i.e., projects that are not major facilities such as cement plants, oil refineries, electric genera ting facilities/providers, co-generation facilities, hydrogen plants or other stationary combustion sources that emit more than 25,000 metric tons of CO 2e/yr), the project-specific emissions from the Proposed Project would not be expected to individually have an impact on global climate change (AEP, 2007) if emissions were less than this amount and the primary concern would be wh ether the Proposed Project would be in conflict with the state goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Project-related emissions of greenhouse gases were calculated using CARB's URBEMIS2007 model as well as the General Reporting Protocol of the California Climate Action Registry, and latest global warming potentials of the Inter governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The URBEMIS inputs and numerical results are provided in the Appendix D.2 to this EIR. Estimated Project-related greenhouse gas emissions are presented in Table IV.D-8 . Emissions are presented for the proposed uses to be built by the Proposed Project; the existing uses to be removed to accommodate this development and the net change in emissions due to the Proposed Project. The detailed calculations and assumptions leading to these estimates are presented in the Appendix D.3 to this EIR. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D.

A. Potential conflicts with 39 Recommended Actions identified in CARB's October 2008 Climate Change Proposed Scoping Plan With regard to Item A, the Proposed Project do es not pose any apparent conflict with the most recent list of Recommended Actions from CARB. The Proposed Project would incorporate a range of sustainable elements in its design, construction and operations. Sustainable site development and design strategies include de veloping the New Hospital on a previously developed site that is currently served by existi ng infrastructure, utilities and public transit. Other site design strategies include maximizing the per centage of pervious and landscaped areas on the Project Site to the extent feasible; implementi ng established best management practices (BMPs) for stormwater management, including landscaping as an integral part of the onsite stormwater filtration; minimizing grading where feasible; and using light-colored roof materials. Sustainable construction strategies that the Pr oject Sponsor proposes include deconstruction (versus demolition) of the Existing Hospital and the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital; use of low VOC architectural coatings in construction a nd maintenance of building; recycling and reuse of concrete and metals from demolished structures (as permitted) for Project site work, road work and structures; and use of Lean Construction Meth odology (i.e., promoting coordination, reduced IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-36 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 changes, offsite fabrication). A ll concrete and metal materials not needed for the Project Site would be off-hauled from the site for Caltrans recy cled material reuse. Also, the Project Sponsor proposes to establish a construction debris -recycling program throughout demolition and construction of the Proposed Project, which would assume 75 percent materials recycled or reused. In total, more than 50 percent of the c onstruction materials generated are not anticipated to leave the Project Site but be reused for fill material. Additionall y, during construction activities, construction employees will be solicited to carpool to Castro Valley and will then be transported to the Project Site from a central offsite parking location via shuttles. Other sustainable measures regarding water effici ency and conservation and water treatment for offsite irrigation, energy use (through building mechanical systems and fixtures, architectural materials/coating selections and possible incorpora tion of a partial \"green roof\") and reduction of motor vehicle trips anticipated with improved ga rage access and site circulation on the Project Site. B. Relative size of the project in comparison to the statewide estimated GHG reduction goal of 169 million metric tons of CO2e by 2020 a nd to the size of major facilities required to report GHG emissions (25,000 metric tons of CO 2e per year) With regard to Item B, Proposed Project operations would generate a net increase of 1,533 metric tons of CO 2e/yr (including emissions from vehicle trip s, space heating and indirect emissions from use of electricity and solid waste disposal). The Proposed Project would not be classified as a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, as operational emissions would only be about 6 percent of the lower reporting limit, 25,000 metric tons of CO 2e/yr.Compared to the overall state reduction goal of approximately 174 million metric tons CO 2e/yr, the maximum greenhouse gas emissions for the Proposed Project (1,533 metric tons CO 2e/yr) amounts to 0.002 percent of the state goal, which would not conflict with the state's ability to meet the goals of AB 32. The above review of indicates that the Proposed Project would not conflict with state goals in AB 32 and emissions of greenhouse gas emis sions would be less-than-significant. Mitigation: None required. _________________________ Cumulative Impacts Impact AIR-6: The Proposed Project togeth er with past, present and reasonably foreseeable future development in the area could result in long-term traffic increases and could cumulatively increase regional air pollutant emissions and conflict with or obstruct implementation of the Bay Area 2005 Ozone Strategy. (Less than Significant) Locally, emissions from Proposed Project sources would be combined with emissions from other sources, primarily area traffic (local streets and freeways) from existing and future development in the greater project area. Although cumulative traffic volumes would increase by 2035, the effect of this increase would be partly offset by the reduction in emissions on a grams-per-mile IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures D. Air Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.D-37 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 basis. As previously stated (Impact AIR-4), this is due to attrition of older, high polluting vehicles, improvements in the overall automobile fl eet, and improved fuel mixtures (as a result of on-going state and federal emissions standard s and programs for on-road motor vehicles). Cumulative impacts on carbon monoxide concentrations at local intersections in 2035 would be less than significant as the worst-case carbon m onoxide concentrations at all the analyzed intersections would be below the corresponding ambient standards. Table IV.D-7 shows that the operational emissions of ROG, NOx and PM-10 due to Proposed Project-related traffic, stati onary and area sources estimate d based on the CARB model URBEMIS 2007 would be less than the signi ficance criteria of 80 pounds per day. According to the BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines , for any project that would individually have a less than significant air quality impact, such as the Proposed Project, the significance of cumulative impacts would be determined based on the consistency of the project with local and regional air quality plans (i.e., the Castro Valley General Plan and the Bay Area 2005 Ozone Strategy ). Inconsistency would indicate a significant cumulative air quality impact. Alameda County is in the process of comprehensively updating the 1985 Castro Valley General Plan and conducting the requisite environmenta l review under CEQA. The population and VMT projections for the 2007 General Plan Update EIR analysis assumes all the planned development in Castro Valley, including the Proposed Project , and has been submitted by the City to ABAG, whose projections form the basis of the Bay Area 2005 Ozone Strategy . The Ozone Strategy therefore accounts for the emissions from the Proposed Projects and lays out control measures to achieve the ozone standards. Therefore, the General Plan is considered to be consistent with the 2005 Ozone Strategy and this would represent a less than significant cumulative impact. Mitigation: None required. _________________________ References - Air Quality Association of Environmental Professionals (AEP), Alternative Approaches to Analyzing Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Global Climate Change in CEQA Documents, June 28, 2007.

Noise This section describes the existing noise environm ent and the potential impacts associated with the implementation of the Proposed Project. It analyzes potential noise impacts caused both during the construction and operational phases of the Proposed Project on the ambient noise environment. Projected increases in the noise levels in the Project Site vicinity can be expected from change in traffic conditions, relocation of parking areas, relocation of various mechanical systems used at the medical facility, and construc tion operations. The incremental change in noise levels experienced by the receptors in the Project Site vicinity is evaluated against standards in the Alameda County Noise Ordinance to determine whether changes in the ambient noise environment would be significant. Background information on environmental acoustics, including definitions of terms commonly used in noise analysis, is provided below. Setting Technical Background Sound is mechanical energy transmitted by pressu re waves through a medium such as air. Noise is defined as unwanted sound. Sound is characterized by various parameters that include the rate of oscillation of sound waves (frequency), the speed of propagation, and the pressure level or energy content (amplitude). In particular, the sound pressure level has become the most common descriptor used to characterize the loudness of an ambient sound le vel. Sound pressure level is measured in decibels (dB), with zero dB corresponding roughly to the threshold of human hearing, and 120 to 140 dB corresponding to the threshold of pain. Sound pressure fluctuations can be measured in units of hertz (Hz), which correspond to the frequency of a particular sound. Typically, soun d does not consist of a single frequency, but rather a broad band of frequencies varying in le vels of magnitude (sound power). When all the audible frequencies of a sound are measured, a sound spectrum is plotted consisting of a range of frequency spanning 20 to 20,000 Hz. The sound pressu re level, therefore, constitutes the additive force exerted by a sound corresponding to the sound frequency/sound power level spectrum. The typical human ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies of the audible sound spectrum. As a consequence, when assessing potential noise im pacts, sound is measured using an electronic filter that de-emphasizes the frequencies belo w 1,000 Hz and above 5,000 Hz in a manner corresponding to the human ear's decreased sens itivity to low and extremely high frequencies instead of the frequency mid-range. This met hod of frequency weighting is referred to as A- weighting and is expressed in units of A-weighted decibels (dBA).1 Frequency A-weighting follows an international standard methodology of frequency de-emphasis and is typically applied to community noise measurements. 1 All noise levels reported herein reflect A- weighted decibels unless otherwise stated. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-2 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Noise Exposure and Community Noise An individual's noise exposure is a measure of the noise experienced by the individual over a period of time. A noise level is a measure of noise at a given instant in time. However, noise levels rarely persist consiste ntly over a long period of time. Rather, community noise varies continuously with time with respect to the contributing sound sources of the community noise environment. Community noise is primarily th e product of many distant noise sources, which constitute a relatively stable background noise exposure, with the individual contributors unidentifiable. The background noise level changes throughout a typical day, but does so gradually, corresponding with the addition and subtraction of distant noise sources such as traffic and atmospheric conditions. What makes community noise constantly variable throughout a day, besides the slowly changing background noise, is the addition of short duration single event noise sources (e.g., aircraft flyovers, motor vehicles, sirens), which are readily identifiable to the individual. These successive additions of sound to the co mmunity noise environment varies the community noise level from instant to instant requiring the measurement of noise exposure over a period of time to legitimately characterize a community noise environment and evaluate cumulative noise impacts. This time-varying characteristic of e nvironmental noise is described using statistical noise descriptors. The most frequently used noise descriptors are summarized below: L eq: The equivalent sound level is used to describe noise over a specified period of time, typically one hour, in terms of a single numerical value. The L eq is the constant sound level, which would contain the same acoustic energy as the varying sound level, during the same time period (i.e., the average noi se exposure level for the given time period). Lmax: The instantaneous maximum noise level me asured during the measurement period of interest. Lmin: The instantaneous minimum noise level me asured during the measurement period of interest. Lx: The sound level that is equaled or exceeded x percent of a specified time period. The L 50 represents the median sound level. DNL: The energy average of the A-weighted sound levels occurring during a 24-hour period, and which accounts for the greater sensitivity of most people to nighttime noise by weighting noise levels at night (\"penaliz ing\" nighttime noises). Noise between 10:00 PM and 7:00 AM is weighted (penalized) by adding 10 dBA to take into account the greater annoyance of nighttime noises. CNEL: Similar to the DNL, the Community Noi se Equivalent Level (CNEL) adds a 5-dBA \"penalty\" for the evening hours between 7:00 PM and 10:00 PM in addition to a 10-dBA penalty between the hours of 10:00 PM and 7:00 AM SEL: Sound Exposure Level (SEL) is the energy -based sum of the noise experienced during a single noise event, and is typically 10 dB higher than the L max for aircraft noise. The SEL is the building block of the cumulative noise descriptors, L dn and CNEL. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-3 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 SENEL: Single Event Noise Exposure Level (SENEL) is used throughout the HMMH Technical Report. The SENEL is the California equivalent of the SEL. They are essentially the same and for the purposes of this EIR, the SEL and the SENEL are interchangeable. The L dn and CNEL are primarily used for transporta tion noise analysis. These descriptors are well correlated with public annoyance due to transporta tion noise sources and are used in this analysis, along with the L max and SEL, for determining the noise eff ects of the relocation of the helistop. Traffic noise is also described using the L dn and hourly noise descriptors. L dn and CNEL are also used for noise/land use compatibility assessments. The SEL metric can be used to gain a fuller understanding of noise exposur e related to helicopter operations. When describing helicopter noise, the SEL measures the sound of a helicopter take off or landing. An outdoor SEL is about 25 dB higher than the SEL inside a typical home with windows closed; with the windows open, the outdoor SEL is about 15 dB higher than the indoor SEL. SEL data help assess the effect s of helicopter noise on sleep. Effects of Noise on People The effects of noise on people can be placed into three categories: Interference with activities such as speech, sleep, and learning - The thresholds for speech interference indoors are about 45 dBA if the noise is steady and above 55 dBA if the noise is fluctuating. Outdoors, the thresholds ar e about 15 dBA higher. Interior residential standards for multi-family dwellings are set by the State of California at 45 DNL. The standard is designed for sleep and speech prot ection and most jurisdictions apply the same criterion for all residential uses. Subjective effects of annoyance, nuisance, a nd dissatisfaction - Based on attitude surveys used for measuring the annoyance felt in a co mmunity for noises intruding into homes or affecting outdoor activity areas, the main causes for annoyance are interference with speech, radio and television, house vibrations, and interference with sleep and rest. The DNL as a measure has been found to provide a valid correlation of noise level and the percentage of people annoyed. Three aspects of community noise are most important in determining subjective response - the leve l of sound, the frequency composition or spectrum of the sound, and the variation of sound level with time. Physiological effects such as hearing loss or sudden startling - While physical damage to the ear from an intense noise impulse is rare, a degradation of auditory acuity can occur even within a community noi se environment. Hearing loss o ccurs mainly due to chronic exposure to excessive noise, but may be due to a single event such as an explosion. Natural hearing loss associated with aging may also be accelerated from chronic exposure to loud noise. Environmental noise typically produces effects in the first two categories. Workers in industrial plants generally experience noise in the last cate gory. There is no completely satisfactory way to measure the subjective effects of noise, or the corresponding reactions of annoyance and IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-4 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 dissatisfaction. A wide variation exists in the in dividual thresholds of annoyance, and different tolerances to noise tend to develop based on an individual's past experiences with noise. Thus, an important way of predicting a human r eaction to a new noise environment is the way it compares to the existing environment to which one has adapted: the so called \"ambient noise\" level. In general, the more a new noise exceeds the previously existing ambient noise level, the less acceptable the new noise will be judged by t hose hearing it. With regard to increases in A-weighted noise level, the following relationships occur: Except in carefully controlled laboratory experiments, a change of 1 dBA cannot be perceived; Outside of the laboratory, a 3-dBA change is considered a just-perceivable difference; A change in level of at least five dBA is required before any noticeable change in human response would be expected; and A 10-dBA change is subjectively heard as a pproximately a doubling in loudness, and can cause adverse response. These relationships occur in part because of the logarithmic nature of sound and the decibel system. The human ear perceives sound in a non- linear fashion; hence the decibel scale was developed. Because the decibel scale is based on logarithms, two noise sources do not combine in a simple additive fashion, rather logarithmically. For example, if two identical noise sources produce noise levels of 50 dBA, the combined sound level would be 53 dBA, not 100 dBA. Noise Attenuation Stationary point sources of noise, including sta tionary mobile sources such as idling vehicles, attenuate (lessen) at a rate of 6 to 7.5 dBA pe r doubling of distance from the source, depending on the topography of the area and environmental c onditions (i.e., atmospheric conditions and noise barriers, either vegetative or manufactured, etc. ). Widely distributed noise, such as a large industrial facility spread over many acres or a street with moving vehicles, would typically attenuate at a lower rate, approximately 4 to 6 dBA. Noise Sources and Levels Transportation sources, such as automobiles, trucks , trains, and aircraft, are the principal sources of noise in an urban environment. Along major transportation corridors, noise levels can reach 80 DNL, while along arterial streets, noise levels typically range from 65 to 70 DNL. Industrial and commercial equipment and operations also c ontribute to the ambient noise environment in their vicinities. Noise within the Eden Medical Center campus and in its immediate vicinity is due to sources that are commonly found in an urban environment. Vehi cular traffic on major arterials (such as Castro Valley Boulevard) and on minor streets (such as Lake Chabot road and Stanton Avenue) as well as noise associated with the operation of the Ex isting Hospital (e.g., mechanical ventilation IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-5 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 equipment, delivery trucks, a nd emergency vehicles and helicopters accessing the campus) form the primary sources of noise at the Project Site. Noise from distant I-580 was also audible at times and during lulls in local traffic. Noise from ac tivities associated with the retail, commercial and business establishments in the area would be secondary. To provide the basis for evaluating potential impa cts of the Proposed Project on the nearest noise- sensitive uses - those located directly north of the New Hospital site and west, along Stanton Avenue. ESA undertook noise measurements on the Pr oject Site in the areas where substantial construction activities would occur. Four (4) long-term (24-hour) measurements were taken during mid-week at different locations of the Project Site. The monitoring locations and a summary of the results of the measurements are listed in Table IV.E-1 . Figure IV.E-1 shows the location of the four long-term monitoring sites.

SOURCE: Environmental Science Associates, 2008. Sensitive Receptors Human response to noise varies considerably from one individual to another. Effects of noise at various levels can include interference with sleep, concentration, and communication; physiological and psychological stress; and hear ing loss. Given these effects, some land uses are considered more sensitive to ambient noise levels than others. In general, residences, schools, hotels, hospitals, and nursing homes are considered to be the most sensitive to noise. Commercial and industrial uses are consid ered the least noise-sensitive.

To the east, along and across Lake Chabot Road, are a mix of apartments, medical offices, medical services, and commercial businesses. Regulatory Framework Federal, state, and local agencies regulate diffe rent aspects of environmental noise. Federal and state agencies generally set noise standards fo r mobile sources such as aircraft and motor vehicles, while regulation of stationary sources is left to local agencies. Local regulation of noise involves implementation of general plan policies and noise ordinance standards. Local general plans identify general principles intended to guide and influence development plans; local noise ordinances establish standards and procedures for addressing specific noise sources and activities. Noise issues relevant to the Proposed Project are addressed in Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations , Alameda County General Plan policies and the Alameda County Noise Ordinance standards. Federal Federal guidance concerning the evaluation of airc raft noise is contained in 14 CFR Part 150, \"Airport Noise Compatibility Planning\", December 1984, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Order 1050.1E, \"Environmental Impacts: Policies and Procedures\", June 2004, FAA Order 5050.4B, \"National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Implementing Instructions for Airport Actions\", April 2006, and FAA's \"Envir onmental Desk Reference for Airport Actions\", October 2007. These documents establish the aircraft noise anal ysis methodology and significance threshold for federal actions that have an aviation noise co mponent. While the proposed helistop relocation is not a federal action, the guidance contained in these FAA documents is considered to be the industry standard for performing aircraft noise analyses. These documents require the use of the most recent version (7.0) of the FAA-approved Integrated Noise Model (INM), require the use of DNL (or CNEL in California) for describing cumulative noise exposure, recommend the Sound Exposure Level (SEL) and Maximum Level (Lmax) for quantifying single event noise, and require the use of the A-weighted scale for describing environmental noise. The documents also establis h 65 CNEL as the threshold of significance for determining impacts on noise sensitive land uses (e.g., homes, schools, and churches) and a change of 1.5 decibels in CNEL over noise sens itive uses as a trigger for a more detailed noise analysis when comparing the future no action altern ative to the future proposed action alternative. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-8 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 State of California State law (California Health & Safety Code, Section 46000-46001) declares that excessive noise is a hazard to public health and safety and a llows cities and counties to adopt and enforce regulations that are more stringent than state st andards. State regulations include requirements for the construction of new hotels, motels, apartm ent houses, and dwellings other than detached single-family dwellings that are intended to limit the extent of noise transmitted into habitable spaces. These requirements are collectively known as the California Noise Insulation Standards and are found in California Code of Regulations , Title 24 (known as the Building Standards Code), Part 2 (known as the California Buildi ng Code), Appendix Chapters 12 and 12A. For limiting noise transmitted between adjacent dwelling units, the noise insulation standards specify the extent to which walls, doors, and floor ce iling assemblies must block or absorb sound. For limiting noise from exterior sources, the noise insulati on standards set forth an interior standard of DNL 45 dBA in any habitable room and, where such units are proposed in areas subject to noise levels greater than DNL 60 dBA, require an acoustical analysis demonstrating how dwelling units have been designed to meet this interior standard. If the interior noise level depends upon windows being closed, the design for the structure must also specify a ventilation or air-conditioning system to provide a habitable interior environment. Title 24 standards are enforced through the building permit application process in most jurisdictions. The California Office of Noise Control has issu ed land use compatibility guidelines that were developed to assist local agencies' preparation of general plan noise elements. Under these guidelines, establishing residences, churches, libra ries, hospitals, and schools in areas exceeding 70 dB CNEL is normally unacceptable. These facilities are conditionally acceptable in areas that measure between 60 and 70 dB CNEL. Professi onal and commercial office buildings are normally unacceptable in areas exceeding 75 dB CNEL, and are conditionally acceptable in areas that measure between 67 dB and 77 dB CNEL. Th ese guidelines, however, can be modified to reflect sensitivities of individual communities to noise. There are no unique noise requirements for hospitals . Noise mitigations required inside hospitals for internally generated noise are addressed by th e California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD). Exterior noise that h as impacts five feet or more beyond the hospital exterior would not be within OSHPD purvi ew and would conform with Alameda County standards discussed below. California Title 21 Division of Aeronautics, Noise Standards , states the following (in accordance with Article 3, Chapter 4, Part 1, Division 9, Public Utilities Code, Regulation of Airports) to provide noise standards governing the operation of aircraft and aircraft engines for all airports operating under a valid permit issued by the Department of Transportation: The level of noise acceptable to a reasonable person residing in the vicinity of an airport is established as a CNEL value of 65 dB for purpo ses of these regulations. This criterion level has been chosen for reasonable persons resi ding in urban residential areas where houses are of typical California construction and may ha ve windows partially open. It has been selected with reference to speech, sleep and comm unity reaction. As in the Federal criteria, no compatibility criteria have been established for A-weighted single event noise metrics such as SENEL or Lmax. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-9 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Alameda County The Alameda County General Plan Noise Element contains goals, objectives and implementation programs for the entire County to provide its residents with an environment that is free from excessive noise and promotes compatibility of land uses with respect to noise. The Element does not explicitly state what the acceptable outdoor noi se level is for the backyards of single-family homes or common outdoor spaces of multi-family housing projects but it recognizes the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) noise level standards for residential land uses. These standards are an exterior Ldn of 55 dBA and an interior Ldn of 45 dBA. (The DNL measurement, which also includes a 10dB weighting for night-time sound, is approximately equal to the CNEL for most environmental settings.) The Noise Element also references noise and land use compatibility standards developed by an A ssociation of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) sponsored study. The Alameda County Noise Ordinance (Chapter 6.60 of the Alameda County General Code, October 2006) establishes acceptable exterior noi se standards for land uses, allowing higher levels of noise for commercial properties than for residential uses, schools, hospitals, churches, or libraries. As shown in Table IV.E-2 below, the Noise Ordinance standards require that noise levels received at residential uses be limited to 50 dBA during the daytime (7 AM to 10 PM) and to 45 dBA during the nighttime (10 PM to 7 AM). The Noise Ordinance does not apply to noise associated with construction if such activities ta ke place between 7 AM a nd 7 PM on weekdays or between 8 AM and 5 PM on weekends (Alameda County General Code, Sections 6.60.050 and 6.60.070). The standards in the Noise Ordinance augment the requirements of the Alameda County Building Code, which establishes standards fo r interior noise levels consistent with the noise insulation standards in the California State Building Code, using the A weighted decibel scale (dBA). The Building Code est ablishes a standard of 45 dBA inside of new residential construction and requires acoustic an alysis to show that new structures have been designed so that interior noise levels attributable to exterior s ources do not exceed 45 dB in any habitable room.

IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-10 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Table IV.E-2 shows the number of cumulative mi nutes that a particular external noise level is permitted, as well as the maximum noise allowed under the Alameda County Noise Ordinance . Section 6.60.070 of the Noise Ordinance excludes noise from emergency work and from the operation of aircraft due to emer gency work and to federal preemption. Therefore, these standards would not be applicable to project noise ge nerated due to hospita l helicopter operations. These Noise Ordinance standards augment the requirements of the Alameda County Building Code, which establishes standards for interior noi se levels consistent with the noise insulation standards in the California State Building Code, as discussed above. The Alameda County Zoning Ordinance (Section 17.42.020 of the Alameda County General Code) restricts noise from commercial activities by prohi biting any use that would generate a noise or vibration that is discernible withou t instruments beyond the property line. This performance standard does not apply to transportation activit ies or temporary construction work. The Proposed Project proposes to amend the Specific Plan (as discussed in the Project Description in Chapter III, and in Section IV.A, Land Use, Plans and Policies ), such that the development standards adopted pursuant to the Planned Developmen t district zone and land use de velopment plan would supersede the performance standards in Section 17.42.020 of the Zoning Ordinance. The 1986 Alameda County Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) Policy Plan provides guidance through Heliport Siting Guidelines for heliports/he lipads and that also apply to helistops; the following are relevant to the siting (relocati on) of a helipad as it pertains to noise: The ALUC recognizes a heliport noise impact zone down to 60 CNEL. Within the noise impact zone, land u se compatibility standards adopted in Table I (Land Use Compatibility for Community Noise Environments, California Office of Noise Control, 1976) shall be applied to evaluate the suitability of heliport siting. The ALUC discourages establishment of a heliport if existing or planned residences or other noise-sensitive uses would fall within the 60-65 CNEL range. Residences and other noise- sensitive uses should not be located within the 65 CNEL. No noise-sensitive uses should be exposed to 80+ dBA (single noise event). The above guidelines also apply to helistop facilities. Castro Valley General Plan (1985) The 1985 Castro Valley General Plan contains the following general goals, objectives and principles that would be applicable to noise: To prevent and suppress undesirable noise; To reduce to acceptable levels the severity of those environmental hazards, which are man- induced or intensified; and To reduce exposure to environmental hazards.

Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-11 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Objective 5 : To prevent and suppress undesirable le vels, frequencies and duration of noise to minimize noise impacts on sensitive uses. Principle 5.1 : Land uses should be located and im provements designed and constructed such that the following noise standards are achieved: - The interior noise environment of all residential uses, schools, hospitals and convalescent homes, and similar health care /residential facilities shall not exceed 45 DNL. - The exterior noise level of all residential uses, schools, libraries, churches, hospitals, convalescent homes, and other similar hea lth care/residential facilities shall not exceed 60 DNL. - The exterior noise levels of commercial and office uses, and of playgrounds and neighborhood parks shall not exceed 70 DNL. - The exterior noise level of industrial uses a nd of active outdoor recreation areas, such as golf courses, riding stables, sports grounds, etc., shall not exceed 75 DNL. Principle 5.2 : New development should not be permitte d if the proposed uses and activities would result in the interior and/or exterior noise standards, cited in Principle 5.1 above, being exceeded. Principle 5.3 : To the extent feasible, noise should be reduced at the source or so contained as to minimize the need for noise barriers and to allow greater flexibility in the use of adjoining sites. Principle 5.4 : Noise control measures should be used along freeways and major arterials where needed to maintain acceptable noise environments in adjoining areas. Principle 1.8 : Commercial development should provide adequate buffering (e.g., use of walls, landscaping, setbacks), design measures (e.g., location of parking areas, loading facilities, storage facilities), and should regulat e onsite activities (e.g., hours, scheduling of deliveries) to minimize adverse impacts (e.g., noise, glare, odors) on adjoining residential areas. Draft Castro Valley General Plan (2007) The proposed noise goals, policies and actions that would apply to the Proposed Project include: Goal 11.1-1 : Protect residents and workers in Castro Valley from noise that affects comfort and health. Reduce noise to within established noise limits to the maximum extent feasible; curtail the increase of noise levels in the future; and mitigate noise impacts on sensitive uses through siting and design. Policy 11.1-1 : Siting of Noise-Sensitive Uses. Avoid siting new noise-sensitive uses in areas with projected noise levels greater than 70 dBA. Where such uses are permitted, require incorporation of mitigation measures to ensure that interior noise levels are acceptable. Policy 11.1-2 : Traffic Speeds and Noise Standards. Limit traffic speeds to levels that do not produce noise in excess of established County noise standards. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-12 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Action 11.1-1 : Noise Mitigation Measures and Project Planning. Require the incorporation of noise mitigation measures in Project Site planning and design to meet County noise standards, including measures such as: - Orienting building openings, decks, and out door open space areas associated with sensitive land uses (residential, schools, hos pitals, convalescent homes, parks, etc.) away from I-580 and arterial roads; - Double pane or triple pane windows; and - Construction of perimeter sound walls. Action 11.1-3 : Mitigation Requirements for New Noise Sensitive Uses. Require that applicants for new noise-sensitive development in areas subject to noise levels greater than those established by the County obtain the services of a professional acoustical engineer to provide a technical analysis and design of mitigation measures. Action 11.1-4 : Requirements for Placement of HVAC Systems. Require placement of fixed equipment, such as air conditioning units and c ondensers, inside or in the walls of new buildings or on roof-tops of central units in order to reduce noise impacts on any nearby sensitive receptors. Action 11.1-6 : Short-Term Noise Impacts of Construc tion. Develop standard conditions of approval applicable to all construction project s to reduce the short-term impacts of noise generated by construction equipment and traffic. Vibration Vibration consists of oscillatory waves that ra diate along the surface of the earth and downward into the earth, potentially resulting in effects th at range from human annoyance to structural damage. Some common sources of ground-borne vibration are mining operations, including quarrying and blasting, railways and highways, industrial facilities, heavy-duty vehicles on rough roads, and construction activities such as blasting, pile-driving and operating heavy earth-moving equipment. As vibrations travel outward from the s ource, they excite the particles of rock and soil through which they pass and cause them to oscillate by a few ten-thousandths to a few thousandths of an inch. Differences in subs urface geologic conditions and distance from the source of vibration will result in different vibra tion levels characterized by different frequencies and intensities. In all cases, vibration amplitudes will decrease with increasing distance. There are several different methods that are used to quantif y vibration. The peak particle velocity (PPV), typically measured in inches per second, is de fined as the maximum inst antaneous peak of the vibration signal. The PPV is most frequently used to describe vibration impacts to buildings. The root mean square (RMS) amplitude is most frequent ly used to describe the affect of vibration on the human body. The RMS amplitude is defined as the average of the squared amplitude of the signal. Decibel notation (VdB) is commonly used to measure RMS. The decibel notation acts to compress the range of numbers required to describe vibration. Vibration energy spreads out as it travels through the ground, causing the vibration level to diminish with distance away from the source. High frequency vibrations reduce much more rapidly than low frequencies, so that low fre quencies tend to dominate the spectrum at large IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-13 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 distances from the source. Discontinuities in th e soil strata can also cause diffractions or channeling effects that affect the propagation of vibration over long distances. When vibration encounters a building, a ground-to-foundation coupling loss will usually reduce the overall vibration level, however, under certain circum stances, the ground-to-foundation coupling may also amplify the vibration level due to structural resonance of the floors and walls. Human response to vibration is difficult to quantify. Vibration can be felt or heard well below the levels that produce any damage to structures. Th e duration of the event has an effect on human response, as does frequency. Generally, as the duration and vibration frequency increase, the potential for adverse human response increases. While people have varying sensitivities to vibrations at different frequencies, in general th ey are most sensitive to low-frequency vibration. Vibration in buildings may be perceived as mo tion of building surfaces or rattling of windows, items on shelves, and pictures hanging on walls. In extreme cases, the vibration can cause damage to buildings. Vibration of building components can also take the form of an audible low-frequency rumbling noise, which is referred to as ground-borne noise. Ground borne noise is usually only a problem when the originating vibr ation spectrum is dominated by frequencies in the upper end of the range (60 to 200 Hz), or when foundations or utilities, such as sewer and water pipes, connect the structure and the source. A vibration level that causes annoyance will be well below the damage threshold for normal buildin gs. The background vibration velocity level in residential areas is usually around 50 VdB. The vi bration velocity level threshold of perception for humans is approximately 65 VdB. A vibration velocity level of 75 VdB is the approximate dividing line between barely per ceptible and distinctly perceptible levels for most people. Ground-borne vibration is almost never annoyi ng to people who are outdoors. Although the motion of the ground may be perceived, without the effects associated with the shaking of a building, the motion does not provoke the same adverse human reaction. In addition, the rumble noise that usually accompanies the building vibr ation is perceptible only inside buildings. Sensitive receptors for vibration include structur es (especially older masonry structures), people (especially residents, the elderly and sick), and vibration sensitive equipment. Ground borne Vibration Regulations There are no widely adopted standards for accepta ble levels of ground vibration generated by construction activities. However, the U.S. De partment of Transportation has identified a \"vibration damage threshold\" of 0.2 inch per second for the protection of \"fragile\" buildings, generally, older structures with plasters walls and ceilings (Federal Transit Administration, 2006). For non-fragile residential buildings, a structur al damage criterion of 2.0 inches per second has been established (Caltrans, 2002). The FTA threshold for human annoyance due to ground-borne vibration is 80 RMS (FTA, 2006). IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-14 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Impacts and Mitigation Measures Significance Criteria The Proposed Project would result in a significant noise impact if it would: Result in exposure of persons to, or genera tion of, noise levels in excess of standards established in the local General Plan or noise ordinance or applicable standards; Result in exposure of persons to or gene ration of excessive ground borne vibration or ground borne noise levels; Result in a substantial permanent increase in ambient noise levels in the project vicinity above levels existing without the project; For a project located within an airport land u se plan or, where such a plan has not been adopted, within two miles of a public airport or public use airport, would the project expose people residing or working in the project to excessive noise levels; For a project within the vicinity of a private airstrip would the project expose people residing or working in the project area. Exceed an interior SENEL of 80 dB (i.e., exteri or SENEL of up to 95 dB) due to a helicopter overflight at night, and therefore have a measurable effect on awakening and sleep disturbance. Construction Noise The Alameda County Noise Ordinance does not provide quantitative thresholds for the analysis of construction noise impacts. The exterior noise sta ndards contained in the ordinance do not apply to noise sources associated with construction, provided construc tion activities take place between 7 AM and 7 PM on weekdays or between 8 AM and 5 PM on weekends. Therefore, the significance of construction noise impacts have b een evaluated based on distance to the nearest sensitive receptors to the construction activity, th e existing noise levels at the receptors and the duration of construction activity. An increase of 5 dBA over existing ambient noise levels at receptors would be considered significant particul arly since construction activities are expected to take place over an extended period: approximate ly 4.5 years (or up to 6 years under the Subsequent New MOB Scenario, as detailed in the Project Description in Chapter III, under Development Phasing ). Project and Cumulative Traffic Noise Noise from traffic would not be regulated by the local general plan and noise ordinance. Therefore, the significance of increase in noise levels due to project and cumulative traffic has been evaluated based on guidance from Caltrans. A ch ange in noise levels of less than 3 dBA is not discernible to the general population; an increase in average noise levels of 3 dBA is considered barely perceptible, while an increase of 5 dBA is considered readily perceptible to most people (Caltrans, 1998). Therefore, traffic noise would be considered significant if the IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-15 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Project individually, or in comb ination with traffic from other projects in the area increases ambient noise levels along roadways in the Project vicinity above existing ambient noise levels by greater than 5 dBA. Operational Noise For long-term operational impacts, such as mechanical noise from stationary sources, Alameda County Noise Ordinance standards, which are presented in Table IV.E-2 would apply to the Proposed Project. Therefore, based on the first and third criteria listed above, operational noise from stationary sources that would exceed the values presented in Table IV.E-2 would be considered to result in a significant impact to the noise environment. Helicopter Noise Based on the land use compatibility standards a dopted in Table I (Land Use Compatibility for Community Noise Environments, California Office of Noise Control, 1976) of the 1986 ALUC Policy Plan, the Proposed Project would be considered to have a significant impact if the proposed relocation of the helistop would result in existing or planned residences or other noise- sensitive uses being located within the 60-65 CNEL range. Helicopter overflight at night also can have a significant impact if noise levels exceed an interior SENEL of 80 dB (i.e., exterior SENEL of up to 95 dB) which can be a measurable effect on awakening and sl eep disturbance. Vibration Based on criteria published by U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), a threshold of 0.2 inches per second is used for the protection of \"fragile\" buildings. For non-fragile residential buildings, a structural damage criterion of two inches per second has been used. For the analysis of human annoyance due to ground-borne vibration, the FTA threshold of 80 RMS has been used. Methodology Construction Noise The analysis of construction noise focuses on th e loudest phases of construction such as pile drilling, excavation and exterior finishing. Ty pical noise levels generated during these phases have been obtained from publishe d sources and used in the assessment of impacts at the nearest sensitive receiving land uses. Traffic Noise Traffic noise from project and cumulative traffic has been estimated based on traffic data provided by Fehr & Peers (presented in Section IV .C of this EIR) using a spreadsheet based upon algorithms from the Federal Highway Administra tion's Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model (FHWA-RD-77-108). IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-16 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Operational Noise The analysis of operational noise, primarily from rooftop HVAC equipment, the mechanical yard and the relocated loading dock is based on the November 2008 noise report prepared by Sparling noise consultants for the Proposed Project. The Sparling report has been included as Appendix E.1 to this EIR. Helicopter Noise The Integrated Noise Model (INM), Version 7.0, has been used to quantify helicopter noise exposure in the vicinity of the existing and pr oposed helistop locations. The INM is the FAA- approved noise model for quantifying aircraft noise. The model input requires information specific to the helistop including the total number of helicopter operations, the flight paths used to access the helistop, the specific helicopter types, and the time of day at which the operations occurred. The INM works by defining a network of grid points at ground level. It then selects the shortest distance from each grid point to each flight track and computes the noise exposure generated by each helicopter (or aircraft) operation, along each flight track. Corrections are applied for atmospheric acoustical attenuation, acoustical shieldi ng of the engines by the helicopter itself, and speed variations. The noise exposure levels fo r each operation are then summed at each grid location. The cumulative noise exposure levels at all grid points are then used to develop CNEL contours for selected values (e.g., 65 dB CNEL). Using the results of the grid point analysis, noise contours of equal noise exposure can then be plotted. The INM includes the ability to model the effects of changes in ground elevations (te rrain), but does include the ability to account for shielding or reflectivity of noise from buildings or other structures CNEL contours have been prepared for the existi ng and proposed helistop locations. Title 21 of the California State Aeronautics Regulations specifies the use of CNEL for quantifying cumulative aircraft noise exposure. CNEL is the 24- hour average sound level in decibels with an additional weighting placed on evening (7:00:00 PM - 9:59:59 PM) and nighttime (10:00:00 PM - 6:59:59 AM) operations to account for the in creased sensitivity people have to noise events during these hours. The CNEL contours generated for this analysis ar e based on specific data provided in a project memorandum entitled Eden Medical Center, Helicopter Noise Analysis Data Request -- Response , prepared by Heliplanners, dated June 1, 200 8, (included as Appendix E.2 to this EIR). The information in the memorandum was obtaine d through discussions with operators, hospital staff and hospital activit y logs. The detailed assumptions of he licopter operations and fleet mix, time of day for operations and flight tracks are included in Appendix E.2. Vibration The vibration analysis for the Proposed Project has been conducted using guidance from the Federal Transit Administration's Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment (FTA, 2006). The FTA Assessment provides vibration levels ge nerated by typical construction equipment at a IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-17 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 reference distance of 25 feet. The vibration leve ls experienced at the nearest sensitive uses are estimated based on a propagation formula deve loped for point sources under normal propagation conditions. Impacts Construction Noise Impact NOI-1: Construction activities would in termittently and temporarily generate noise levels that would exceed the Alameda County Noise Ordinance. (Significant) The Proposed Project would involve the replacement of the 235,000 square feet Existing Hospital and the 49,000 square feet Laurel Grove Rehab ilitation Hospital with a 230,000 square feet New Hospital. A new approximately 80,000 square-foot Medical Office Building (New MOB) is also planned east of and adjacent to the New Hospita l. To accommodate development proposed by the Project, the Existing Hospital, the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hosp ital, approximately 19,500 square feet of medical office buildings (MOB) (Eden Professional Offices) and the 42-unit Pine Cone Apartment Complex fronting Stanton at Nordell Avenue would be demolished at different times during the construction period. In addition, the Project would relocate the existing helistop located in the northwest corner of th e campus to a location 150 feet northeast of the present stop. The proposed helistop location is curre ntly an undeveloped earthen knoll. This knoll would be graded down approximately 13 feet to an elevation approximately five feet higher than the existing pad. The medical center would continue to provide uninterrupted medical service on site during implementation of the project. Duri ng the construction period, a wide variety of construction and demolition equipmen t would be used, and material would be transported to and from the site by trucks. Construction-related noise le vels at and near locations on the Project Site would fluctuate depending on the particular type , number, and duration of use of various pieces of construction equipment. The effect of c onstruction noise would de pend upon the level of construction activity on a given day and the relate d noise generated by that activity, the distance between construction activities and the nearest noi se-sensitive uses, and the existing noise levels at those uses. Table IV.E-3 shows typical noise levels generated by construction of commercial buildings. Table IV.E-4 shows noise levels generated by individu al construction equipment. As both tables show, the noisiest phase of construction would be during pile driving a nd pile drilling which could generate noise levels of approximately 80-105 L eq at 50 feet. Impact pile driving is not proposed as part of project construction. Drilling is an alternative method of pile installation where a hole is drilled into the ground up to the requ ired elevations and concrete is then cast into it. Based on preliminary soil studies conducted for the Project Site, it has been determined that drilling is a viable method for installation of piles at the site. Pile drilling would be used for the lower foundations of the New Hospital and New MOB, and this method generally produces noise levels approximately 10-15 dBA lower than pile driving; noise levels are comparable to that created by construction cranes. Table IV.E-5 summarizes the total number and duration of pile drilling activity for each building. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E.

The Subsequent MOB Scen ario would involve a separate 8-week period of pile drilling. SOURCE: SMCCV, 2008. During demolition phases, it could be expected that jackhammers, front loaders, and trucks would be the major noise sources. During excavation, excavators, bulldozers, front loaders removing material and trucks hauling excavated materials away would be expected to be the major noise sources. During foundation and building constructi on, concrete mixers, concrete pumps, cranes, generators, pumps, and other power tools (including pile drilling) are expected to be used. The main noise sources associated with exterior finish ing would be operation of concrete mixers and pumps for application of stucco material to th e building exterior. Truck movements for material delivery and hauling would also lead to an incr ease in roadside noise levels over the construction period. Duration of Noisy Construction Activities The average noise levels experienced by nearby receptors would vary by construction phase, depending on the equipment used (as shown in the preceding tables) and the duration of the activity. Overall construction of the Proposed Project is estimated to take approximately 4.5 years (or up to 6 years under the Subsequent New MO B Scenario). However, construction activities would occur intermittently and temporarily ove r the duration of construction, periodically increasing the ambient noise levels in the vicinity. In particular, construction activities that generate relatively high noise levels would not occur for the full duration of construction. Noisy activities would occur at times within the 4.5-y ear (54-month) construction period (described under Development Phasing in the Project Description in Chapter III) as follows: Twelve months (2nd Quarter 2009 through 1st Quarter 2010) to: - Demolish Eden Profession Offices; - Demolish Pine Cone Apartments Complex; - Demolish Existing Helistop and pedestrian connection between Existing Garage and Existing Hospital; - Construct (grading) New Helistop; and - Prepare (e.g., grade, trench) New Hospital and New MOB sites IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-20 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Two months (3rd Quarter 2011) to: - Construct (e.g., pile drilling) Ne w Hospital and New MOB foundations Six months (from 1st Qu arter through 2nd Quarter 2013) to: - Demolish Existing Hospital and Laur el Grove Rehabilitation Hospital Under the Subsequent New MOB Scenario in wh ich the New MOB would be constructed after the New Hospital is completed, pile drilling for the New MOB foundation would occur for an additional two months (as indicated in Table IV.E-5 ) at the end of the Proposed Project's construction duration, during 4t h Quarter 2013 into 1st Quarte r 2014. The demolition and site preparation required for the New MOB area woul d have occurred concurrent with the site preparation for the New Hospital. Under the scenario in which demolition of the La urel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital would occur sooner in the construction process, the demoliti on could occur over one month in mid-2009 ore early 2010 (compared to at a later period in early 2013 with the Proposed Project). The overall duration of noisy construction activities would not be extended; early demolition would occur within the period of initial demolition and site preparation described above for the Proposed Project. Noise Reduction over Distance Noise from construction activity generally decreases at a rate of 6.0 to 7.5 dBA per doubling of distance. Construction associated with the Project could take place as close as 60 feet from the nearest existing residential sensitive receptors in th e Stanton Acres Apartments to the north of the New Hospital site. Uses in the New Hospital, which would be completed approximately three years after the start of construction, would al so be considered a sen sitive noise receptor and would be subject to construction noise associated with the demolition of the Existing Hospital and Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital in subseque nt phases. Under the Subsequent New MOB and Accelerated Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospita l Scenarios, the New Hospital uses only would be subject to noisy construction activities associat ed with demolition of the Existing Hospital and pile drilling for the New MOB. As construction activities would only occur during daytime hours, construction noise could also be disruptive to lo cal businesses. This analysis focuses on impacts to nearest residential and commercial uses that are sensitive to noise, as well as the New Hospital uses. Conservatively assuming an attenuation of six dBA per doubling of distance, unmitigated construction noise levels could be as high as 87 to 89 dBA, Leq at the nearest residential receptors during the Project's noisiest constructi on phases of pile drilling, excavation and exterior finishing. At noise levels above 85 dBA, norma l conversation is extremely difficult. Other noise- sensitive uses located within a pproximately 500 feet of construction activities could also be substantially affected, depending on the presence of intervening barriers or other insulating materials. Intermittent noises are more disturbing an d annoying to many people than a constant noise. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-21 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 The existing noise level monitored near the Stant on Acres Apartments is 60 dBA. As noise levels during Project construction (87 to 89 dBA) woul d be well above the existing noise level at the nearest sensitive uses, construction noise levels from the Project construction, although temporary and intermittent, would be a significant impact. To reduce noise impacts to nearby sensitive recep tors during the prolonged construction period of approximate 4.5 years (or up to 6 years under the Subsequent MOB Scenario), the Project Sponsor will be required to implement and co mply with the following mitigation measures throughout the duration of construction activity: Mitigation Measure NOI-1a: Implement Best Management Practice for Construction Noise. To reduce daytime noise impacts due to construction, the Project Sponsor shall require construction contractors to implement the following measures: (a) Hold a preconstruction meeting with the job inspectors and the general contractor/onsite manager to confir m that noise measures and practices (including, but not limited to, construc tion hours, neighborhood notification, and posted signs) are completed. (b) To the extent feasible, schedule the noisiest construction activities during times that would have the least impact on ho spital and adjacent residential land uses. This would include restricting typical demolition and exterior construction activities to the hours of 7:00 am to 7:00 pm on weekdays. However, certain planned construction activities that affect hospital operations (e.g., activities that affect site access, etc.) would need to be scheduled during times that would be least disruptive to those existing hospital functions. (c) Any construction activity proposed to occur outside of the standard hours of 7:00 am to 7:00 pm Monday through Friday for special activities shall be evaluated on a case by case basis, with criteria including the proximity of residential uses. No construction activi ty shall occur on Sundays or federal holidays. (d) Equipment and trucks used for projec t construction shall utilize the best available noise control techniques (e.g., improved mufflers, equipment redesign, use of intake silencers, ducts, engine enclosures and acoustically attenuating shields or shrouds, wherever feasible). (e) Impact tools (e.g., jack hammers, paveme nt breakers, and rock drills) used for project construction shall be hydrauli cally or electrically powered wherever possible to avoid noise associated wi th compressed air exhaust from the Proposed Project. (f) Avoid use of pneumatically powered tools. However, where use of pneumatic tools is unavoidable, an exhaust muffler on the compressed air exhaust shall be used; this muffler can lower noise levels from the exhaust by up to about 10 dBA. External jackets on the tools themselves shall be used where feasible, and this could achieve a reduction of 5 dBA. Quieter procedures shall be used, such as drills rather than impact equipment, whenever feasible. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-22 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 (g) Construction contractors, to the maximum extent feasible, should be required to use \"quiet\" gasoline-powered comp ressors or other electric-powered compressors, and use electric rather than gasoline or diesel powered forklifts for small lifting. (h) Stationary noise sources, such as tempor ary generators, shall be located as far from adjacent receptors as possible, a nd they shall be muffled and enclosed within temporary sheds, incorporate insulation barriers, or other measures to the extent feasible. (i) Erect temporary plywood noise barriers around the construction site, to shield adjacent uses. (j) Implement \"quiet\" pile driving technology (such as pre-drilling of piles, the use of more than one pile driver to shorten the total pile driving duration), where feasible, in consideration of geotechnical and structural requirements and conditions. (k) Utilize noise control blankets on the building structure as the building is erected to reduce noise emission from the site. If necessary, use quilted noise control blankets on or within existing hospital buildings specifically to shield extremely sensitive areas. (l) Prohibit trucks from idling along resi dential streets serving the construction site. (m) Spotters or flaggers in clear view of the operator may be used instead of backup beepers to direct the backing operation of mobile equipment when there is no public access to a construction site. This is allowed, if approved by OSHA, per the requirements of Title 8, Section 1592 of the California Administrative Code. (n) Monitor the effectiveness of noise a ttenuation measures by taking noise measurements. Mitigation Measure NOI-1b: Construction Complaint Manager. The Project Sponsor shall employ a Construction Complaint Manager who is qualified in conflict resolution, mediation, and public relations and has detailed knowledge of the construction activities. The Project Sponsor shall empower the Construction Complaint Manager to act constructively to minimize noise disturbances to the existing hospital and adjacent residences. The Alameda County Public Works Department shall be informed who the Co nstruction Complaint Manager is and a regular meeting schedule shall be establishe d between the County and the City to ensure ongoing communication and issue resolution. The Construction Complaint Manager shall be available 24-hours per day throughout the duration of construction activity at any time that construction activity is taking place to listen, and respond to, and track complaints from neighbors' and hospital staff; to monitor compliance with Best Management Practices for noise reduction; and to identify possible additional noise reduction practices when warranted. Specific job responsibilities shall include: IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-23 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 (a) Holding a preconstruction meeting with the job inspectors and the general contractor/onsite project manager to co nfirm that noise mitigation and practices (including neighborhood notification, po sted signs, etc.) are completed; (b) Posting signs on site pertaining to up-coming construction days and hours, and complaint procedures indicating who to notify in the event of a problem; (c) Maintaining a listing of telephone numbers (during regular construction hours and off-hours); (d) Providing email contact information and email updates about construction activities for neighbors who request such updates; (e) Providing web-cam capability that shall be available to the public and shall show progress on the process, along with additional information, such as descriptive narratives. This information shall be updated on a regular basis but the frequency of the updating will vary by stage of the project; (f) Monitoring and addressing complaints regarding trucks which go off of established construction traffic routes; (g) Notifying neighbors within 300 feet of the project construction area at least 30- days in advance of pile-drilling and/or other extreme noise-generating activities and/or planned off-hour construction activities, and informing them about the estimated duration of the activity; and (h) Managing dispute resolution methods a nd associated cost responsibility for all construction related complaints and follow-up processes and implementation, which shall be incorporated into all Co ntractor Agreements. All bid specs shall include Dispute Resolution costs, as the contractor's responsibility, when permitted and appropriate. Mitigation Measure NOI-1c: Construction Management Plan. The Project Sponsor shall prepare a construction management plan that addresses the noise impacts of construction activities. The Plan shall include Mitigation Measures NOI-1 and NOI-2. The construction management plan must be in the form of a written document and must be completed prior to the initiation of project demolition or construction. Implementation of the above mitigation measur es would reduce the construction noise levels associated with the Proposed Project to the extent feasible, however, noise levels, although temporary, will remain significant due to the inte rmitted overall duration of construction activities of approximately 4.5 years (or up to 6 years under the Subsequent New MOB Scenario), the close proximity of sensitive noise receptors, and limitations of the best management practices in the above mitigation measures to reduce noise levels to within acceptable levels. The impact will remain significant and unavoidable. Significance After Mitigation: Significant and Unavoidable _________________________ IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-24 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Impact NOI-2: The Proposed Project would generate excessive ground borne vibration or ground borne noise levels that could adversel y affect sensitive receptors in the project vicinity. (Significant) The Proposed Project could generate ground borne vibration primarily during the construction phase of the project. Vibration from construction is caused by general construction equipment operations, and is usually high est during pile driving (not proposed for the project), soil compacting, jack hammering and demolition activ ities because they result in blows or impacts onto the ground surface, producing vibration waves that radiate along the surface of the earth and downward into the earth, potentially resulting in e ffects that range from annoyance to structural damage. While vibration may be sometimes noticeab le outdoors, it is almost exclusively an indoor problem. Although it is conceivable for gr ound-borne vibration from construction projects to cause building damage, the vibration from cons truction activities is almost never of sufficient amplitude to cause even minor cosmetic damage to buildings. The primary concern is that the vibration can be intrusive and annoying to bui lding occupants. Annoyance from vibration often occurs when the vibration exceeds the threshold of perception by even a small margin. Generally, as the duration and vibration frequency increas e, the potential for adverse human response increases. A vibration level that causes annoyance would be well below the damage threshold for normal buildings. Ground borne vibration from activities that involve \"impact tools\" can produce significant vibration. While impact pile driving is not pr oposed, the Proposed Project will use drilled shaft foundation to support the proposed buildings. A dr illed shaft foundation would be constructed using caisson drills, which can result in peak par ticle velocities of up to 0.089 inches per second at a distance of 25 feet. Criteria published by USDOT establishes a threshold of 0.2 inches per second for the protection of \"fragile\" buildings (gen erally, older structures with plasters walls and ceilings). For non-fragile residential buildings, a structural damage criterion of 2 inches per second has been established (Caltrans, 2002). The nearest existing buildings to the Proposed Project are approximately 60 feet from the proposed building perimeter. At this distance ground-borne vibration from caisson drills would be reduced to 0.022 PPV. These resultant vibration leve ls would not result in structural damage to existing adjacent structures as they would be well below the damage threshold for non-fragile buildings. Intense vibration levels can also result in interfe rence or annoyance impacts to occupants of the nearby residences and the Existing Hospital, wh ich will be in operation during the construction period. Vibration impact criteria published by USDOT relative to these land uses are established in terms of VdB. For frequent events, a criteri on of 72 VdB has been established, while for infrequent events a criterion of 80 VdB has b een established. These nuisance vibration thresholds were established for operations of permanent transportation (commuter rail) projects. Because construction would be temporar y (caisson drilling would occur over approximately eight weeks as detailed in Table IV.E-5 ), the infrequent criterion would apply. Table IV.E-5 shows that approximately 880 total piles will be drilled ove r a period of approximately 8 weeks for the foundations of the New Hospital and New MOB ( 680 piles for the New Hospital and 200 piles IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-25 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 for the New MOB). Under the Subsequent Ne w MOB Scenario, the duration of pile drilling activity would be extended to as much as 16 week s since the New MOB would not be constructed until after completion of the Alternative's New Hospital. Caisson drilling can result in typical vibrations of 87 VdB at a distance of 25 feet. The nearest residences to the Project's vibration generating construction activities are approximately 60 feet to the north. At this distance, ground-borne vi bration from caisson drilling would be reduced to 79 VdB, compared to the annoyance threshold of 80 VdB. Other vibration-inducing construction equipment, such as loaded trucks, jackhammers and bulldozers would generate lesser vibration levels at this distance of 78, 71 and 50 VdB, respectively. Mitigation Measures NOI-1a through NO I-1c shall apply to Impact NOI-2. In conclusion, the above analysis indicates that the vibration levels experienced at the property line of the nearest receptors would exceed the thr esholds for human annoyance but are unlikely to exceed the threshold for potential damage to adjacent buildings. Mitigation Measure NOI-1, measure \"j\" (i.e., Implement \"quiet\" pile driving technology, such as pre-drilling of piles, where feasible, in consideration of geotechnical and st ructural requirements and conditions) would apply and reduce construction-related vibration impacts at nearby structures and sensitive receptors. However, the impact would remain significant and unavoidable because it is unlikely that these measures would be capable of reducing vibration le vels, even with use of caisson drilled piers, to below the level of human annoyance. Significance After Mitigation: Significant and Unavoidable _________________________ Project Operational Noise Impact NOI-3: Noise from Project-generate d traffic would not significantly increase roadside ambient noise levels. (Less than Significant) Upon buildout of the New Hospital and associated buildings, one of the sources of operational noise associated with the Proposed Project that could generate noise impacts would be from the change in vehicular circulation on the local ro adway network surrounding the Project Site. The Proposed Project would replace two hospitals (t he Existing Hospital and the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital) totaling an area of approx imately 280,000 square feet with a 230,000- square-foot New Hospital. While hospital-relate d employment would actually reduce with the construction of the New Hospital, there would be a minimal increase in patient numbers. Overall, the total hospital-related population at the site w ould remain approximately the same. Therefore, the traffic analysis for the project determined that as a conservative analysis, the hospital elements of the project (demolition of the Laur el Grove Rehabilitation Hospital and the Existing Hospital and construction of the New Hospital) w ould be assumed to produce no change in level of traffic generated. As a result, the focus of th e traffic analysis was on the impacts of change in IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-26 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 traffic conditions due to the demolition of the Pine Cone Apartments and Eden Professional Offices and construction of 80, 000-square-foot New MOB. The traffic study for the Proposed Project analyzed 16 intersections in the vicinity of the Project Site to analyze the impacts of change in tra ffic conditions due to the Proposed Project: To assess the significance of the change in traffic noise due to the Proposed Project, roadside PM peak-hour noise levels were estimated for ex isting, existing plus project, 2015 baseline, 2015 plus project, 2035 baseline and 2035 plus project conditions al ong those roadway segments most affected by the project using data from the Traffic Report prepared by Fehr & Peers. These segments were chosen for analysis as they were found to experien ce the greatest percent increase in traffic due to the Proposed Project. The worksheets showing the traffic noise analysis are presented in Appendix E.3. The modeling results indicated that the Proposed Project would not lead to five dBA or greater increase in noise over the existing to tal ambient noise level at any of the analyzed roadway segments under all analyzed scenarios. This is because the net increase in vehicle trips generated by the Proposed Project is very minima l (estimated at 1,780 daily trips, 125 AM and 184 PM trips). These trips would be distributed over the local roadway network surrounding the Project Site and no single intersection would experience the noise increase associated with all these trips. Since the increase in ambient noise fro m the addition of project and cumulative traffic would be below three dBA, this increase would barely be perceivable over the baseline total ambient noise level. Therefore, this would be less than significant impact. Mitigation: None required. _________________________ Impact NOI-4: Operational noise sources gene rated by rooftop HVAC equipment, the new mechanical yard, ambulance sirens, and north su rface parking lot for the Proposed Project could exceed Alameda County Noise Ordinance standards. (Potentially Significant) Rooftop HVAC Systems Once operational, a major source of noise would be from the operation of mechanical equipment associated with the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems of project buildings. Rooftop mechanical equipment cons ists of ventilation air handling units and miscellaneous exhaust fans. There is at least 100 feet between any rooftop equipment the nearest residential property line. Operation of HVAC e quipment would be subject to Noise Ordinance standards shown in Table IV.E-2 . As final equipment is selected during detailed mechanical design of the New Hospital and New MOB, the Project Sponsor would select equipment of recent manufacture and select quiet type equipment, st rategically orient equipment and sound screen on the roof, and incorporate silencers, as Sparling noise consultants recommend in its November 2008 report (provided as Appendix E.1 to this EIR), which specifies preliminary not-to-exceed sound power levels to ensure compliance with Noise Ordinance standards. In addition, noise analyses would be conducted, as required in M itigation Measure NOI-4 below, to ensure the Noise Ordinance standards are met at adjacent r esidential property lines, ensuring the impact from rooftop HVAC systems would be less than significant. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-27 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Mechanical Yard A below-grade, outdoor central mechanical yard surrounded by a 12-foot high acoustically- treated wall is proposed at the northwest corner of the New Hospital. The yard would be two levels below grade covered by an open grate platfo rm. The mechanical yard is planned to contain two emergency generators, three chillers, three c ooling towers, three boilers, and twelve pumps. The nearest residential property lines to the mechan ical yard are 65 feet due north and 195 feet due west. A landscaped berm and living wall w ould be developed along the Stanton Avenue frontage along the New Hospital. The living wall would consist of planting and landscape materials and would provide privacy/screening as well as some level of noise reduction of operations associated with the loading dock and outdoor mechanical yard located on the Stanton Avenue-facing side of the New Hospital. The livin g wall would be set back approximately 54 feet from Stanton Avenue right of way and would be effectively approximately 15 feet high, with a 12-foot wall on top of a 3-foot high berm that would be built up along its base. Based on a preliminary selection of mechanical equipment and noise information provided by manufacturers, long term noise impacts from the m echanical yard on near by sensitive receptors were investigated. Without operation of emerge ncy generators in the mechanical yard, the existing estimated daytime and nighttime noise levels at the nearest residential property line were 64 dBA and 58 dBA, respectively. With operation of the emergency generators in the mechanical yard, the resultant daytime and nighttime noise level at the nearest residential property lines from all equipment in the mechanical yard could be up to 81 dBA. The proposed emergency generators at the Proposed Project will operate at a maximum noise level of 65 dB at 20 feet during periodic testings. Testing would occur at the same hours as currently occurs for the Existing Hospital and is scheduled at times to cause minimal disruptio n to patients and hospital operations. Testing of the emergency generators would occur once per month for 30 minutes, 6:00 AM to 6:30 AM. Three times a month, the generators will run with no load for 15 minutes, 6:00 AM to 6:15 AM. Once every three years, the emergency generators would operate a 2-hour test at load levels ranging from 25 to 75 percent capacity. As discussed above, the Project Sponsor would select equipment that would be located in the mechanical yard that is quiet type equipment of recent manufacture; preliminary specific not-to- exceed sound power levels are identified to ensure compliance with Noise Ordinance standards at adjacent residential property lines (see Appendix E.1 to this EIR). In summary, the estimated daytime and nighttime noi se levels received by the nearest residential properties to the north and the west, with a nd without operation or testing of emergency generators, would exceed the Alameda County exte rior noise limits for residential uses. This would constitute a significant impact. Implemen tation of Mitigation Measure NOI-4 presented below would reduce the impact associated with noi se from the mechanical yard to a less than significant level. Emergency Sirens Emergency vehicle sirens are another noise source associated with the New Hospital activity. The average number of ambulances visits to the emerge ncy department is not expected to increase due IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-28 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 to the Proposed Project. Therefore noise impacts associated with emergenc y sirens would remain the same as existing levels. Although ambulance sire n noise level is loud, typically about 90 dBA, noise generated by emergency vehicles is not cons idered to be a nuisance considering the urgent and imperative nature of the opera tions and is not subject to the local noise standards. The use of ambulance sirens (and lights) for emergency cases is guided by the State Highway Patrol and Department of Motor Vehicles and is a necess ary \"request\" for the right-of-way from other drivers. With the relocation of the main hosp ital, emergency vehicle access route within the Project Site would be adjacent to existing reside ntial receptors at the Stanton Acres Apartments north of the New Hospital's ambulance entry. Howe ver, it is operational practice that sirens are not used as the ambulance approaches the hospital as critical cases are typically stabilized by that time. Therefore, the proximity of the emerge ncy vehicles' access route to sensitive receptors would not constitute an impact. North Surface Parking Lot The Proposed Project would result in a new approximately 193-space surface parking lot where the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital currently ex ists, in the northeast corner of the Project Site, along the north property line. The parking lot would be developed adjacent to the rear yards of two single family lots to the north. This lot would be used for employee parking. The Project proposes substantial landscaping along the north perimeter of the parking lot, as shown in Figure III-9 , Landscape Site Plan. Operation of the parking lot would be typical of the use, including engine starts, door closures, ve hicle alarms, and people talking. While the noise associated with the proposed hospital parking lo t is not expected to exceed acceptable levels established in the Noise Ordinance, implementation of Mitigation Measure NOI-4 presented below would reduce noise levels from the north surface parking (as well as less-than-significant light and glare effects discussed under Impact AES-4 in Section IV.A, Aesthetics ). Mitigation Measure NOI-4: To comply with the Alameda County exterior noise standards, the following measures shall be incorporated into the detailed design and operation of the Proposed Project: Rooftop HVAC and Mechanical Yard (a) Quiet type cooling towers shall be used which would reduce noise levels at the source by about 12 dB over standard cooling towers. (b) A sound barrier shall be installed around the yard to reduce noise levels between 8 to 15 dB depending on the location of the equipment and the elevation of the source relative to the barrier. (c) Provide an acoustical enclosure ar ound the emergency generators. These enclosures reduce noise from the genera tors by approximately 30 to 35 dB over emergency generator with just a weather enclosure. (d) Exhaust stacks of emergency generators shall be equipped with muffler(s) to reduce the noise from the stack to 68 dBA at 3 feet from the stack since the sound barrier is not effective in reducing th e stacks' noise. Given the height of the stack, noise reduction is not expected from the sound barrier. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-29 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 (e) Acoustic shrouds shall be placed at th e boilers' blowers to reduce their noise by approximately 5 dB. (f) The surface of the sound barrier facing the yard and building fa\u00e7ade and roof overhang facing the yard shall be covered with sound absorptive material. The sound absorptive material on the building fa\u00e7ade shall start at an elevation -18 feet up to +12 feet (aligning with the top of sound barrier). The sound absorptive material on the sound barrier shall be placed between elevations -6 feet and +12 feet (top of sound wall). (g) Conduct a noise analysis of final rooftop equipment selections to ensure that the Noise Ordinance requirements are met at the surrounding properties. Noise control strategies such as selection of quiet equipment, the use of sound traps (silencers) on air moving devices, enclosures for specific equipment, and the positioning of sound barriers shall be incorporated as the design and the selection of mechanical equipment is refined to ensure compliance with the Noise Ordinance daytime and nighttime limits. Emergency Sirens (h) As is practical, request emergency vehicl e drivers continue to maintain existing operational practice that emergency vehicles shall not operate emergency sirens along Stanton Avenue, north of Castro Valley Boulevard, when approaching the New Hospital. North Parking Lot (i) Inform in writing, owners of adjacent residential properties of complaint procedures associated with noise in th e north parking area and indicating who to notify in the event of a problem. (j) Post signs onsite and visible to parkin g lot users stating that the hospital has residential neighbors and that activity in the parking lot shall be kept to a minimum (e.g., no loud music or conversation). (k) Construct a solid wall or landscaped hedge immediately north of the new surface parking lot proposed on the previous Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital site. The wall shall extend the eas t-west length of the parking lot and be a minimum 6 foot tall and of solid material. Landscaping proposed as part of the Project may be incorporated on, within or on either side of the wall. Significance After Mitigation : Less than Significant. _________________________ Impact NOI-5: Operational noise sources gene rated by delivery trucks at the relocated loading dock of the Proposed Project wo uld exceed Alameda County Noise Ordinance standards. (Significant) Operational noise would occur from the arrival, de parture, and loading/unloading of goods from delivery trucks associated with hospital operations . The existing loading dock is located at the southwestern fa\u00e7ade of the Existing Hospital build ing approximately 150 feet from the residents IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-30 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 at the Eden Terrace Apartments. The future loading dock is lo cated on the west side of the New Hospital, south of the mechanical yard. At the new location, the single family homes along Stanton Avenue would be the closest sensitive r eceptors at approximately 150 feet from the new loading dock. Loading Dock Activity and Noise Levels Delivery trucks' use of the existing dock were counted on Monday April 21, 2008 and Tuesday May 22, 2008 to establish a frame of reference for the number of visiting trucks per day. The number ranged between 18 trucks on Monday and 24 trucks on Tuesday. The majority of the delivery trucks were in the range of 25-feet long. One 53-foot long was counted on Monday and two 53-foot trucks were counted on Tuesday. Noi se levels used in the model for 53-foot trucks were 75 dBA and 70 dBA for the 25-foot trucks at el evations of 12 feet and 10 feet, respectively. The reference distance for the noise level was 50 feet. (A detailed observation log of truck monitoring conducted by Sparling noise consultants is provided in Appendix E.1 to this EIR.) The length of delivery trucks and the frequency of delivery truck activity at the New Hospital would be similar to existing operations described above for the Existing Hospital. Predicted noise levels from delivery trucks idling at the loadi ng dock of the Proposed Project range between 60 dBA and 65 dBA, which would exceed Alameda County Noise Ordinance standards. Noise levels were modeled as point sources and for a worst case scenario of three trucks idling and parked at the loading dock at any time. Since the closest residential uses are located a pproximately 150 feet from the new loading dock, the actual noise levels perceived at this distance would be less than the predicted levels that would occur at the 50 foot reference distance used in the noise prediction model. Applying noise attenuation properties of 6.0 to 7.5 dBA per doubli ng of distance (discussed under Impact NOI-1), estimated future noise levels at the residential uses located at 150 feet could actually be reduced to between approximately 51 dBA and 62 dBA (compared to 60 dBA and 65 dBA), although still exceeding the Noise Ordinance standards. 2 Noise Reduction Measures Consistent with the Sparling noi se consultant's recommendation in its November 2008 report, the Proposed Project incorporates a 15-foot-high living wall and berm along the west property line along Stanton Avenue. The Sparling noise report ( Figure 1 in Appendix E.1 ) also recommends absorptive material on the underside of the west-fa cing building overhang and fa\u00e7ade, a solid side wall on the south side of the loading dock, and a solid cover extended over the trucks at the loading dock - all of which woul d have noise reduction properties. However, the Proposed Project does not incorporate a solid retractable barrier gate at the 30-foot- wide driveway from Stanton Avenue near the lo ading dock, as described in Potential Mitigation Measure NOI-5b. The Sparling report indicates th at such a gate would reduce noise levels associated with truck activity at the loading do ck (60 dBA and 65 dBA) to within the County's 2 Predicted 60 dBA and 65 dBA at 50 feet, further reduced by approximately 6.0 dBA at 100 feet, then reduced by an additional approximately 3.5 dBA at 50 feet, for a total reduction over 150 feet from the noise source. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-31 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Noise Ordinance standards for nearby residen tial uses (50 dBA, for a maximum cumulative 30 minutes in any one-hour time period in daytime, as shown in Table IV.E-2 ). Sparling finds that without the gate, predicted noise levels at neighboring properties would be between 50 and 55 dBA. Alameda County Public Works determined that the gate proposed by the Sparling report would adversely impact roadway operations a nd emergency vehicle access along Stanton Avenue due to trucks potentially queuing at a gate. While the County acknowledges that a feasible gate could be designed to address these adverse effects, such a design would create adverse secondary effects of onsite circulation and truck maneuverability within the service and loading area; such a design would accommodate at least one truck off Stanton Avenue while queued at the gate. The gate (as recommended by Sparling noise consultant s) is described below since it would reduce the significant impact to less than significant, howev er, because the mitigation measure is not feasible and could not be implemented, it is not identif ied as a required mitigation measure due to its potential secondary effects. To further reduce noise levels from the loadi ng dock, operational measures are included in Mitigation Measure NOI-5 (in addition to the d esign measures identified above). To meet the Noise Ordinance standards, these operational measures would have to reduce noise levels perceived at the nearby residential uses by 10 to 15 dBA (or 1.0 to 12 dBA if noise reduction over distance is considered). Although implementati on of the loading dock operational measures in Mitigation Measure NOI-5 would reduce the duratio n, incidence, and overall level of noise to some degree, their effectiveness cannot be quantif ied with certainty. Specifically, it can not be assumed that the operational measures can be impl emented consistently gi ven the variation of delivery truck operations, such as truck size and le ngth, duration of loading activity, or special requirements for certain truck types, such as refri gerated loads that must run for extended periods, even during loading/unloading. The Noise Or dinance accounts for the cumulative duration of time that a noise may occur - allowing higher thres holds for shorter durations of time. Predicted noise levels from delivery trucks accessing the lo ading dock (ranging from an estimated 51 dBA to 65 dBA) would only be permitted for a total of one minute per hour during daytime, as shown in Table IV.E-2. The Project Sponsor indicates th at delivery trucks currently remain at the loading dock for generally 30 minutes or less. In summary, predicted noise levels received by r esidential properties to the west of the Project Site would exceed the Noise Ordinance requirement s, even with implementation of loading dock operational measures included in Mitigation Measu re NOI-5 and without a solid retractable barrier gate. Therefore, the impact from noise levels resulting from relocation of the loading dock, without incorporation of a solid retractable barrier gate at the 30-foot-wide driveway from Stanton Avenue, would be significant and unavoidable. Mitigation Measure NOI-5a: The following measures shall be incorporated into the detailed design and operation of the loading dock of the Proposed Project: Design (a) A solid sound barrier shall be located along the south side of the loading dock and covered with sound absorptive material. The sound absorptive material on the side wall sound barrier shall be pla ced between elevations -6 feet and IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-32 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 +12 feet (top of south sound wall). (See Figure 1 in the Sparling Noise Report, 11/24/08; Appendix E.1 of the Draft EIR.) (b) The surface of the building fa\u00e7ade and underside of the roof overhang facing the loading dock shall be covered with sound absorptive material. The sound absorptive material on the building fa\u00e7ade shall start at an elevation -18 feet up to +12 feet (aligning with the top of the side sound barrier along the south side of the loading dock). (See Figure 2 in the Sparling Noise Report, 11/24/08; Appendix E.1 of the Draft EIR.) Operations (c) An onsite hospital Loading Dock Operations Complaint and Enforcement Manager shall be designated. (d) Information pertaining to non-emergency commercial loading hours shall be posted onsite and visible from the Stanton Avenue driveway nearest the loading dock. The sign shall also include a listi ng of telephone numbers both for the Alameda County Community Developmen t Agency (ACCDA) and the Loading Dock Operations Complaint and Enforcement Manager. (e) One or more signs shall be posted in the loading dock area, and visible to delivery truck drivers, specifying the following: 1) As feasible, all delivery trucks that do not require motors be run continuously while loading/unloading shall turn motors off during loading/un loading; 2) Delivery trucks not in the loading/unloading process shall not idle motors within the loading dock area; 3) Hours of day when non-emergency deliveries can be received at the loading dock; and 4) That the hospital has residential neighbors and that loading dock operations shall be conducted as quietly as feasible. Significance After Mitigation: Significant and Unavoidable. As discussed above, the following mitigation meas ure was considered to have adverse potential secondary effects. Thus, the Proposed Project does not adopt the measure, and the impact will remain significant and unavoidable with implem entation of Mitigation Measure NOI-5a, above: Mitigation Measure NOI-5b: Mitigation Considered but De termined to have Adverse Secondary Effects - A solid retractable barrier gate shall be installed across the 30- foot-wide driveway from Stanton Avenue loca ted closest to the loading dock of the New Hospital. The gate shall be designed a nd installed pursuant to the specifications in Figure 2 provided in the Sparling Noise Report, 11/24/08, prepared for the Proposed Project (Appendix E.1 of the Draft EIR); the gate shall be a minimum 12 foot tall, weigh a minimum 2.5 pounds/sq.ft, be no more then 6 inches above ground level, and provide no less than an 18 inch overlap with the side walls. The gate shall incorporate a sensor to trigger the gate to open automatically when a delivery vehicle approaches the driveway to enter or exit. Noise measurements shall be taken during operation of the loading dock to ensure that the noise levels associated with truck IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-33 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 activity at the loading is within the Count y's Noise Ordinance standards with the gate closed. Measurements shall be taken at th e property line of the residential lot located closest to the loading dock. _________________________ Impact NOI-6: The relocation of the existing helistop would not result in any new or increased noise impacts to the nearby sensi tive receptors. (Less than Significant) This impact addresses the effects directly associated with noise from helicopters operating at the helistop. (The effect of noise from helicopters in flight is addres sed in Impact NOI-7.) The existing helistop is located at ground level on the north side of the Project Si te at an estimated elevation of 215 feet mean sea level (msl). The future helistop is planned to be locate d approximately 150 feet northeast of the existing helistop with an estimated elevation of 223 feet msl. Using the INM, the 65 db CNEL contours have been prepared for the ex isting and proposed helistop locations and are shown on Figure IV.E-2 . Both the existing and future 65 dB CNEL contours remain entirely on hospital property and each encompass approximately 0.2 acres of land. As with existing conditions, noise levels would continue to be below 65 dB CN EL at locations outside of the immediate vicinity of the helistop, including the nearest sensitive receptors (residences to the north and west and a church to the north. As shown on Figure IV.E-2, the existing and future contours are equal in size because the total operations, time of day and helic opter types operating at the New Hospital are not expected to change as a result of the modifications to the Project Site. The shape of the contours does differ slightly between the two lo cations due to the slight change in the approach and departure tracks in the immediately vicinity of the helist op. In summary, the 65 dB CNEL contour resulting from the Proposed Project will remain completely co ntained on the Project Site and will not increase in area to encompass residential areas or other nearby sensitive land uses. Thus, the Proposed Project would not result in a significant impact to existing residences in the project vicinity. The impact would be less than significant. Mitigation: None required. _________________________ Impact NOI-7: Helicopter overflights at night would result in a continuation of possible awakenings and sleep disturbanc e and/or annoyance of some residents, and slight shift in nearby residents impacted. (Significant) The relocation of the existing helistop could resu lt in a potential change or increase in the number of people that might be awakened by noise generated from helicopt er operations (i.e., overflights). In 1997, the Federal Interagency Committee on Aviation Noise (FICAN) generated a dose-response curve to predict awakening, based on aircraft noise levels experienced inside a home. The \"FICAN 1997\" curve provides a conserva tive estimate of the \"maximum percent of the exposed population expected to be behavior ally awakened,\" or the \"maximum % awakened. The FICAN 1997 curve represents a reasonable me thod to associate the Sound Exposure Level (SEL) of an overflight event with the poten tial for sleep disturbance. SEL is the same Future Helistop Existing Helistop Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley . IV.E-2 Future 65 dB CNEL ContoursSOURCE: ESA Airports, GlobeXplorer (04-01-07)IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-35 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 measurement as Single Event Noise Exposure Le vel (SENEL) used in California to describe single event noise levels, in this case to best represent noise exposure related to helicopter operations and sleep. When describing helicopter noise, the SENEL measures the sound of a helicopter take off or landing. According to the FICAN report, an interior SENEL of about 80 dB would correspond to a maximum awakening rate of about 10 percent. This assessment assume s that an interior SENEL of 80 dB (i.e., exterior SENEL of up to 95 dB) due to a helicopter overflight at night would have a measurable effect on awakening a nd sleep disturbance. Regardless of the SENEL (or SEL) level applied, it is acknowle dged that a small percentage of resident s in the vicinity of a helistop might be awakened and/or highly annoyed by any helic opter operation at one time or another. For the sleep disturbance assessment, the Augusta 109, the loudest helicopter that regularly operates at the existing helistop, was modeled along the arrival flight tracks. Helicopter arrivals are louder than helicopter departures. One arrival was modeled separately along each of the modeled four arrival paths to the existing and future helistop locations to develop 95 dB SENEL contours for the existing and future helistop locations, as shown in Figures IV.E-3 and IV.E-4 . These contours encompass the area where, acco rding to the FICAN report, the maximum awakening rate would be 10 percent. With th e relocation of the helistop, the 95 dB SENEL contours would shift approximately 100 feet nor th and east (as the existing helistop would be relocated north and east). As a result, compari ng the existing and future 95 dB SENEL contour maps in Figures IV.E-3 and IV.E-4 , approximately 20 additional residences (single family) to the northeast of the Project Site would be included within the contour and 10-15 residences (single family and a portion of an apartment complex) to the southwest of the Project Site would no longer be included within the contour; the effect would be shifted slightly to the northeast but would not be significantly increased. Nevertheless, because the impact would significantly affect approximately 20 residences not previously significantly impacted to the northeast of the Project Site, and even though the maximum percent of e xposed population expected to be behaviorally awakened would not increase substantially from ex isting conditions, the impact is considered significant. Measures identified below in Mitiga tion Measures NOI-7 would be implemented to reduce the impact, however, the impact would remain significant. Measures that restrict helicopter flights, even during nighttime, woul d be infeasible to implement given helicopter flights involve emergency care situations; rest ricting flights would preclude the hospital from meeting its mandated standard of care. Mitigation Measure NOI-7: The following measures shall be implemented to the extent feasible to minimize significant sleep awakenings or disturbance to residents: (a) The Project Sponsor shall prepare a Helicopter Operations Plan, or update/modify its existing Plan, that sha ll specify the following and be submitted to the ACCDA and the Alameda County Airport Land Use Commission: 1) All helicopter operations flight paths co nsistent with those described in the EIR, or detailed more specifically by Caltrans, unless safety precautions require a diversion from any of the flight paths.

Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-38 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 2) The primary approach and departure pa th is the least disruptive flight path (arrive from east and depart to west) and shall be utilized as much as feasible. Alternate and secondary flight paths shall be utilized only if the primary approach and departure path is not desirable due to safety considerations. 3) All pilots shall be routinely informed of the Helicopter Operations Plan and specifically informed to ensure that optimum arrival and departure flight procedures are followed for ea ch helicopter type that serves the Project Site. Pilots would be instructed in the use of the primary and secondary approach and departure path. 4) A log of helicopter activity shall be maintained which shall include a detailed record of the type of trip, and date and time of arrival and departure. If a diversion from prescribed flight paths occurred as discussed above, the reason for diversion shall be recorded in the log. (b) The Project Sponsor shall designate an onsite Helicopter Operations Complaint Manager whose contact information for reg istering complaints shall be made publicly available. The Loading Dock Operations Complaint and Enforcement Manager shall respond to any noise compla ints about helicopter overflights, and shall investigate noise complaints, which may include consultation with a noise engineer or a site assessment, noise mo nitoring of the affected property Significance After Mitigation: Significant and Unavoidable. _________________________ Impact NOI-8: Interior noise levels within the New Hospital building, especially in rooms used for overnight use such as patient wa rds, could exceed DNL 45 dBA, the Title 24 interior noise standard for hosp itals. (Potentially Significant) Based on existing noise measurements conducted at the Project Site, exterior noise levels along the northern facades of the New Hospital would be in the range of 60 dBA, DNL. Along the western fa\u00e7ade of the New Hospital, noise fro m existing sources is about in ce rtain parts of the Project Site are as high as DNL 67 dBA. In order to meet the interior noise standard of 45 DNL dBA, building construction would need to reduce exterior noise levels by as much as 22 dBA from the external facades of the building. Conventional contemporary building c onstruction method s and materials decrease outdoor noise by 12-18 dB (with partially open windows), which woul d not be adequate to meet the interior noise standard for hospitals. Therefore, this would be a significant impact. Mitigation Measure NOI-8: To comply with the interior noise standards of Title 24 and achieve an interior noise level of less than 45 dBA, noise reduction in the form of sound-rated assemblies (i.e., windows, exterior doors, and walls) shall be incorporated into project building design. Final reco mmendations for sound-rated assemblies will depend on the specific building designs and layout of buildings on the site and shall be determined during the design phase. Significance after Mitigation: Less than Significant. _________________________ IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E. Noise Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.E-39 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Cumulative Impacts Impact NOI-9: The Proposed Project, together with past, present and reasonably foreseeable projects future development in the area would not result insubstantial cumulatively increase in noise levels. (Less than Significant) Noise from cumulative development in the area would primarily occur from increases in motor vehicle traffic. As with the Proposed Project traffic, cumulative traffic noise levels in the project area were estimated using traffi c data provided by Fehr & Peers and a spreadsheet based upon algorithms from the FHWA's Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model (see Appendix E.3). Even with the addition of Proposed Project and cu mulative traffic, noise levels along roadway segments in the Project vicinity would not in crease by greater than 5 dBA over existing noise levels. Therefore, this increase would not be perceptible over the total noise levels along these segments. Traffic noise forms one component of the total noise environment. An increase in traffic noise of 5 dBA would not necessarily translat e to an increase of 5 dBA in the total ambient noise environment. When the resultant noise levels from Proposed Project and cumulative traffic along these segments is logarithmically added to the existing monitored noise levels, the increase would be less than 5 dBA and hence, less than significant. Noise associated with construction and operations (including helicopter activity) are site specific. There are no existing or reasonably foreseeable projec ts major projects in the Project vicinity that would generate construc tion noise over the next 4.5 or 6 years (during construction of the Proposed Project) that could combine with the Proposed Project's effects and substantially worsen the significant construction noise effect iden tified for the Project. Similarly, there are not existing or foreseeable major projects nearby, par ticularly along Stanton Avenue near the Project Site, that would combine with the Proposed Pr oject's effects and substantially worsen the significant operational (loading dock) noise identif ied for the Project. No existing or reasonably foreseeable projects have been identified that w ould create significant cumulative helicopter noise effects on the areas immediately adjacent to the Project Site. In summary, the Proposed Project, when consid ered with all past, present and reasonably foreseeable projects in the vicinity, would not result in a significant cumulative noise impact. Mitigation: None required. _________________________ IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures E.

Cultural Resources This chapter identifies the existing cultural r esources within the Project Site for the SMCCV Project. This chapter reviews the federal, stat e, and local regulations pertaining to cultural resources within the region, and describes project -related impacts to those cultural resources as well as mitigation measures to reduce po tentially significant impacts. Information used in the preparation of this sec tion was obtained from a records search, which was conducted at the Northwest Information Center of the California Historical Resources Information System at Sonoma State University on April 22, 2008 (File No. 07-1504). During the records search, the following sources were reviewed: the California Inventory of Historical Resources (OHP, 1976), California Historical Landmarks (OHP, 1990), California Points of Historical Interest (OHP, 1992), and Historic Properties Directory Listing (OHP, 2007). The Historic Properties Directory includes listings of the National Register of Historic Places and the California Register of Historical Resources, and the most recent listings of California Historical Landmarks and California Points of Historical Interest. The 1941 U.S. Geographical Survey 15-minute quadrangle map was also reviewed. The archaeological component of this section w as completed by Heidi Koenig, who has an M.A. in cultural resources management, is a registered professional archaeologist, and has eight years of archaeological experience throughout California. Ms. Koenig meets the Secretary of Interior's professional qualification standards for archaeologists.

Mr. Brewster meets the Secretary of Interior's professional qualification standards for architectural historians. Setting Prehistoric Background A framework for the interpretation of prehistory in the San Francisco Bay and North Coast Range region is provided by Fredrickson (1974), who di vided human history in California into three broad periods: the Paleoindian period, the Archai c period, and the Emergent period. This scheme used sociopolitical complexity, trade networks, popul ation, and the introduc tion and variations of artifact types to differentiate cultural units. The significance of prehistoric sites rests partly on their ability to help archaeologists explain the r easons for cultural changes in different places and at different times in prehistory. The scheme, w ith minor revisions (Fre drickson, 1994), remains the dominant analytical framework for prehisto ric archaeological research in this region. The Paleoindian period (10,000 to 6000 B.C.) was characterized by small, highly mobile groups occupying broad geographic areas. During the Ar chaic period, consisting of the Lower Archaic period (6000 to 3000 B.C.), Middle Archaic period (3000 to 500 B.C.), and Upper Archaic period (500 B.C. to A.D. 1000), geographic mobility may have continued, alt hough groups began to establish longer-term base camps in localities that afforded exploitation of a more diverse range of resources. The addition of milling tools, obsidian and chert concave-base points, and the IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures F. Cultural Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.F-2 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 occurrence of sites in a wider range of envir onments suggests that the economic base was more diverse. By the Upper Archaic, mobility was bei ng replaced by a more sedentary adaptation in the development of numerous small villages, and the beginnings of a more complex society and economy began to emerge. During the Emergent pe riod (A.D. 1000 to 1800), social complexity developed toward the ethnographic pattern of la rge, central villages where political leaders resided, with associated hamlets and specialized ac tivity sites. Artifacts associated with the period include the bow and arrow, small corner-notched points, mortars and pestles, and a diversity of beads and ornaments (Fredrickson, 1994; Gerike et al., 1996). Ethnographic Background The Project Site area is within the traditional terr itory of the Costanoan people, also referred to as Ohlone, Mutsun, and Rumsun (Levy, 1978:485-4 95). These people, collectively referred to by ethnographers as Costanoan, were actually distinct sociopolitical groups that spoke at least eight languages (as different as Spanish is from Fren ch) of the same Penutian language group. The Costanoan occupied a large territory from San Francisco Bay in the north to the Big Sur and Salinas Rivers in the south. The primary so ciopolitical unit was the tribelet, or village community, which was overseen by one or more chiefs. The Project Site area is in the greater Chochenyo language area and was occupied by the lisyan tribelet (Levy, 1978:485). Economically, the Costanoan engaged in hunting an d gathering. Their territory encompassed both coastal and open valley environments that containe d a wide variety of resources, including grass seeds, acorns, bulbs and tubers, bear, deer, elk, an telope, a variety of bird species, and rabbit and other small mammals. The Costanoan acknowledged private ownership of goods and songs, and village ownership of rights to land and/or natural resources; they appear to have aggressively protected their village territories, requiring mone tary payment for access rights in the form of clamshell beads, and even shooting trespassers if caught. After European contact, Costanoan society was severely disrupted by missionization, disease, and displacement. Historical Background The SMCCV Project is within the former 26,723-acre Rancho San Lorenzo granted to Guillermo Castro in 1841 and 1843. While C astro's adobe was located in present-day Hayward, the area of Castro Valley was utilized for its sheltered valley with excellent cattle-grazing lands. In just a few years following the Gold Rush, Castro lost all of his land to American squatters and a gambling addiction. He ultimately moved with most of hi s family to South America while his remaining land was sold at auction and split into smaller parcels. Beginning in the 1850s, redwood trees in the hills no rth of Castro Valley were cut for lumber and hauled down Redwood Road to Castro Valley Road to the San Francisco Bay for shipment. Euroamericans slowly began to settle the valley area and in 1864 the first Castro Valley school was established. Early settlers included James Harv ey Strobridge, who supervised construction of the Central Pacific Railroad through the Sierra Ne vada mountains, and Michael Stanton, another railroad supervisor who ow ned 120 acres including part of the current project area. In 1880 the first business in Castro Valley\u2014the Exchange \u2014was established as a road stop along Redwood IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures F. Cultural Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.F-3 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Road. Chicken farms began to prosper in the vi cinity and by 1925 Castro Valley became the second largest producer of poultry and eggs in California (Hoover et al., 2002:17; http://www.mycastrovalley.com/history). One of Castro Valley's more notable sites in the Pr oject Site vicinity is the Stanton House, which is included on the State Historical Resour ces Inventory (SHRI) and has been designated as California Registered Historical Landmarks (C HL). The Stanton House was built by the Mattox family in 1860 and purchased in 1871 by early Castro Valley resident and railroad man Michael Stanton and his wife Mary. The original purchase included the house and 500 acres of land from Mattox located along Mattox Road (now Lake Chabot Road). In 1873, the Stantons bought an additional 120 acres in the vicinity of where Eden Hospital now stands. Streets in Castro Valley named for the Stanton family include Anita Avenue, John Street, and Stanton Avenue. The house, which is the oldest surviving residence in Cast ro Valley, was moved to its current location on Norbridge Avenue from its original site near th e intersection of Lake Chabot Road and Castro Valley Boulevard in the 1970s. (http://www. mycastrovalley.com/history/page06.html). According to newspaper accounts, the house was moved in August 1978 to the corner of Norbridge Avenue and Strobridge Avenues by previous owners who wanted to build offices on the site of the original house. The house was rest ored by two attorneys who agreed to move the structure, and it is now home to eight professional offices (Oakland Tribune, 2007). The population surged during the 1930s when a new water supply was established. Following World War II and through the 1970s Castro Va lley's character slowly changed from an agricultural-based community to a suburban neighborhood. Development of Eden Township Hospital By the late 1940s the population of Eden To wnship, including Castro Valley, Hayward, San Leandro, San Lorenzo, and parts of Union City and Oakland, had become large enough to support a full-facility hospital. The Eden Township Health care District (ETHD) was formed in June 1948 by the residents of Castro Valley, Hayward, Sa n Leandro and San Lorenzo, to build and operate Eden Township Hospital as it was known then. By late 1949 and November 1952, respectively, the proposed hospital's first bond issues totali ng more than $2 million were approved, and additional state and federal funds were obtai ned for construction of the new hospital. Property along Lake Chabot Road belonging to the Stanton family, as well as the former Wally Glass Pigeon Ranch and Riding Stables, was acquired for the new Eden Medical Center. Although groundbreaking took place in November 1951, it quickly became clear that population growth in the area was even greater than anticip ated, and would require a larger hospital. The outbreak of the Korean War fueled much of the new growth, as military personnel, defense workers and their families flooded into the region. In response, the District added to its original plan for a five-story structure with space for 149 licensed beds, resulting in a revised blueprint for a seven-story, 254-bed facility. Eden Township Hospital officially opened its doors to the public on November 15, 1954. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures F. Cultural Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.F-4 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 The new hospital focused on general medicine, surg ery, pediatrics, and obstetrics. Throughout the 1950s, Eden regularly set and exceeded its own reco rds for births. Local papers would report the birth records results, under headlines such as \"Ede n Hospital Breaks All Records.\" Within a few years after opening, Eden reported more admissions and births than any East Bay hospital, and more newborns than any San Francisco hospital. (www.edenmedcenter.org/about/about_history.html) Eden's first expansion started in 1957, with ot her major additions occurring in the early 1970s and mid-1980s, which included a new intensiv e care unit and a 24-hour physician-staffed emergency department, additions for physical th erapy, laboratory, radiology and radiation therapy, surgery and recovery areas, and confer ence rooms to accommodate Eden's growing use as a community gathering place. In 1986, the Al ameda County Board of Supervisors designated Eden as the trauma center for southern Alameda County. A new trauma center opened in January 1987, staffed 24 hours a day by teams of surgeons, nurses and technicians. By the end of its first year, Eden's trauma center had treated more than 1,150 patients. The trauma center's value was most evident when more than 40 earthquake survivors of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake were treated. Eden's performance under intense pressure following the earthquake won regional and natio nal attention, and earned the thanks of the community. That influence and regard led to Eden's designation by the White House to care for the president of the United States and other dignitaries when traveling in the vicinity. Since 1989, Eden has served more than 24,000 trauma victims and their families, and has helped thousands of others through outreach programs to reduce trauma-related injuries and deaths. (www.edenmedcenter.org/about/about_history.html) The managed care revolution hit the region's hosp itals in the 1990s, leading to many hospital mergers or closures. In 1997, Eden Ho spital affiliated with Sutter Health. Records Search and Survey Results The records search reveal ed that three surveys for cultural resources have been conducted within a one-half mile radius of the Project Site area (Busby, 2005; Watts and Mayfield, 1981; William Self Associates, 1998). No recorded archaeological resources are located within a one-half mile radius of the Project Site area. No archaeological survey of the Project Site was conducted since the entire area is developed with buildings, pavement, or landscap ing, and only a small portion of native soils is visible. Historical research and a site survey of the pr operty by an ESA architectural historian in May, 2008, identified that Eden Hospital, which ope ned in 1954, meets the minimum age threshold (50 years) for eligibility for listing in the Nationa l and California Registers. However, archival research did not reveal that Eden Hospital meet s any of the criteria for listing to the CRHR, as described below. Opened in 1954, Eden Hospital was one of sev eral hospitals established to supply care for residents of Alameda County. Additions to the hospital over the past 30 years have included an IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures F. Cultural Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.F-5 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 intensive-care unit, an emergency department, and a trauma unit. Although Eden Hospital was built at a time when this area of Alameda County was semi-rural, and is currently an important community asset, its presence alone does not appear to have contributed significantly to the historic or cultural heritage of Castro Valley. Research did not reveal that the hospital is significantly associated with any important histor ic events or important individuals, such as important medical discoveries. Although the fact that Eden Hospital broke birthing records in the 1950s was noteworthy at the time, and was indicativ e of the rapid post-war population growth in the area, the building itself no longer conveys these pa rticular historical associations due to the numerous additions and alterations since the 1950s. The building does not embody any distinctive characteristics of a type of constructi on or artistic style or period, and does not appear to yield any important historical information. Th e recent additions and alte rations to the hospital have also compromised the original physical inte grity of the 1950s structure. Therefore, Eden Hospital does not meet any of the criteria for listi ng to the CRHR, and would not be considered a historic resource for California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) purposes. Native America n Consultation On April 21, 2008, a sacred lands search request was submitted to the Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC) on for the Sutter Medical Ce nter project area. A response from the NAHC was received on April 25, 2008. The records search of the sacred lands file failed to indicate the presence of Native American cultural resources in the Project Site area. The NAHC provided a list of Native American contacts that might have fu rther knowledge of the vicinity with respect to cultural resources. Each person or organization id entified by the NAHC was contacted by letter on April 28, 2008. No response has been received as of this writing. Correspondence is provided in an appendix at the end of this report. Paleontological Resources Paleontological resources are the fossilized remains of plants and animals, including vertebrates (animals with backbones), invertebrates (e.g., sta rfish, clams, ammonites, and coral marine), and fossils of microscopic plants and animals (micro fossils). The age and abundance of fossils depend on the location, topographic setting, and particular geologic formation in which they are found. Fossil discoveries not only provide a historic record of past plant and animal life, but may assist geologists in dating rock formations. Often, fo ssil discoveries constrain the time period and the geographic range of flora or fauna. On a regional scale, fossilized plants, animals a nd microorganisms are prevalent throughout the East Bay. Many of the hills in the east bay are made up of sedimentary bedrock that is known to contain a wide range of fossils, including radiol arians, mullusks, diatoms, foraminifers and non- marine vertebrates. In addition, even geological ly young fluvial deposits have been known to contain fresh water mullusks and extinct late Pl eistocene vertebrate fossils (Graymer, 2000). Two geologic formations underlie the Project Site : alluvial/colluvial deposits and the Panoche Formation (Fugro West Inc., 2008). The alluvial a nd colluvial deposits contain both Pleistocene IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures F. Cultural Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.F-6 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 stream sediments and material that has eroded from upslope sources. The Panoche Formation is considered the bedrock and consis ts of marine sandstones and shales. Exploratory borings at the site have encountered the Panoche Formation an ywhere from a few feet to 30 feet below the ground surface and also revealed the presence of conglomerate-rich layers (Fugro West Inc, 2008). According to review of geologic unit descriptions and queries of the UCMP database, both Pleistocene stream sediments and the Pa noche formation would potentially contain paleontological resources. Within the Panoc he Formation there are 116 locations with documented invertebrate fossil finds , one of which also contained a vertebrate fossil, though none of these finds occurred in the vicinity of the s ite location (UCMP, 2008). Numerous vertebrate fossils have been found within Pleistocene alluvial sediments in the East Bay, though there are no records of such finds in the Project Site vicinity (Graymer, 2000; UCMP, 2008). Regulatory Setting This section briefly describes federal, state, and local regulations, permits, and policies pertaining to cultural resources and wetlands as they apply to the Proposed Project. Numerous laws and regulations requi re federal, State, and local agencies to consider the effects a project may have on cultural resources. These laws and regulations stipulate a process for compliance, define the responsibilities of the va rious agencies proposing the action, and prescribe the relationship among other involved agencies (e.g., State Historic Preservation Office and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation). The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended; CEQA; and the California Register of Historical Resources, Public Resources Code (PRC) 5024, are the primary federal and St ate laws governing and affecting preservation of cultural resources of national, State, regional, and local significance. Federal First authorized by the Historic Sites Act of 1935, the National Register of Historic Places (National Register) was established by the NHPA of 1966, as \"an authoritative guide to be used by federal, State, and local governments, priv ate groups and citizens to identify the Nation's historic resources and to indicate what proper ties should be considered for protection from destruction or impairment\" (Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 36 Section 60.2). The National Register recognizes both historic-period and prehistoric archaeological properties that are significant at the national, state, and local levels. To be eligible for listing in the National Regist er, a resource must be significant in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering, or culture. Districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects of potential significance must meet one or more of the following four established criteria (U.S. Department of the Interior, 1995): a) Are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures F. Cultural Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.F-7 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 b) Are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; c) Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type , period, or method of construction or that represent the work of a master, or that po ssess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or d) Have yielded, or may be likely to yield, info rmation important in prehistory or history. Unless the property possesses exceptional significance, it must be at least fifty years old to be eligible for National Register listing (U .S. Department of the Interior, 1995). In addition to meeting the criteria of significance, a property must have integrity. Integrity is defined as \"the ability of a property to convey its significance\" (U.S. Department of the Interior, 1995). The National Register recognizes seven qualities that, in various combinations, define integrity. To retain historic integrity a property must possess sev eral, and usually most, of these seven aspects. Thus, the retention of the specific aspects of integrity is paramount for a property to convey its significance. The seven factors that define integrity are location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association. State The State of California implements the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) through its statewide comprehensive cultural resource surv eys and preservation programs. The California Office of Historic Preservation (OHP), as an office of the California Department of Parks and Recreation, implements the policies of the NHPA on a statewide level. The OHP also maintains the California Historic Resources Inventory. Th e State Historic Preservation Officer is an appointed official who implements historic preservation programs within the state's jurisdictions. California Register of Historical Resources The California Register of Historical Resources (California Register) is \"an authoritative listing and guide to be used by state and local agenci es, private groups, and citizens in identifying the existing historical resources of the state and to indicate which resources deserve to be protected, to the extent prudent and feasible, from substa ntial adverse change\" (California PRC Section 5024.1[a]). The criteria for eligibility to the Calif ornia Register are based on National Register criteria (PRC Section 5024.1[b]). Certain res ources are determined by the statute to be automatically included in the California Regist er, including California properties formally determined eligible for, or listed in, the National Register of Historic Places. To be eligible for the California Register, a preh istoric or historical-period property must be significant at the local, state, and/or federal le vel under one or more of the following criteria: a) Is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of California's history and cultural heritage; b) Is associated with the lives of persons important in our past; IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures F. Cultural Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.F-8 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 c) Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of construction, or represents the work of an important creative individual, or possesses high artistic values; or d) Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history. For a resource to be eligible for the California Register, it must also retain enough of its character or appearance (integrity) to be recognizable as a historical resource and to convey the reason for its significance. A historic resource that does not retain sufficient integrity to meet the National Register criteria may still be eligible for listing in the California Register. The California Register consists of resources th at are listed automatically as well as those that must be nominated through an application and public hearing process. The California Register automatically includes the following: California properties listed on the National Regist er and those formally determined to be eligible for the National Register California Historical Landmarks from No. 770 onward California Points of Historical Interest that have been evaluated by the OHP and have been recommended to the State Historical Resources Commission for inclusion on the California Register Other resources that may be nominated to the California Register include: - Historical resources with a significance rating of Category 3 through 5 (i.e., properties identified as eligible for listing in the National Register, the California Register, and/or a local jurisdiction register) - Individual historical resources - Historical resources contributing to historic districts - Historical resources designated or listed as local landmarks, or designated under any local ordinance, such as a historic preservation overlay zone California Environmental Quality Act CEQA, as codified at PRC Sections 21000 et seq., is the principal statute governing the environmental review of projects in the state. CEQA requires lead agencies to determine if a SMCCV Project would have a significant effect on archaeological resources. As defined in PRC Section 21083.2, a \"unique\" archaeological resource is an archaeological artifact, object, or site about which it can be clearly demonstrated that , without merely adding to the current body of knowledge, there is a high probability that it meets any of the following criteria: Contains information needed to answer importa nt scientific research questions and there is a demonstrable public interest in that information Has a special and particular quality such as being the oldest of its type or the best available example of its type IV.

Cultural Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.F-9 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Is directly associated with a scientifically rec ognized important prehistoric or historic event or person In addition, the CEQA Guidelines define a historical resource as: (1) a resource in the California Register; (2) a resource included in a local register of historical resources, as defined in PRC Section 5020.1(k) or identified as significant in a historical resource survey meeting the requirements of PRC Section 5024.1(g); or (3) any object, building, structure, site, area, place, record, or manuscript that a lead agency determin es to be historically significant or significant in the architectural, engineering, scientific, economic , agricultural, educational, social, political, military, or cultural annals of California, provide d the lead agency's determination is supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record. If a lead agency determines that an archaeological site is a historical resource, the provisions of PRC Section 21084.1 and CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5 would apply. If an archaeological site does not meet the CEQA Guidelines criteria for a historical resource, then the site is to be treated in accordance with the provisions of P RC Section 21083 regarding unique archaeological resources. The CEQA Guidelines note that if a resource is neither a unique archaeological resource nor a historical resource, the effects of the Proposed Project on that resource shall not be considered a significant effect on the environment (CEQA Guidelines Section 15064[c][4]). Local Plans and Polices Castro Valley General Plan (1985) The General Development Policies section of the Castro Valley General Plan lists the following relevant principles regarding cultural resources: General Development Policies To the maximum extent possible, all historical and archaeological resources, including but not limited to those listed on the State and National Registers, should be preserved and maintained. Site preparation and construction activities s hould allow for adequate identification and, where appropriate, preservation of historic and archaeological artifacts and features. 2007 Draft Castro Valley General Plan The Community Character and Design element of the Draft 2007 Castro Valley General Plan Update (Alameda County, 2007a) proposes additio nal goals and policies regarding cultural resources: Protect historic sites and structures and other cultural resources that help to maintain the special character and identity of Castro Valley and represent important physical connections to the community's past.(Goal 5.4-1) Protect and preserve Federal and State-desi gnated historic sites and structures and properties that are deemed eligible for d esignation to the maximum extent feasible. Enhance the maintenance of key historic stru ctures such as the Stanton House, Strobridge IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures F. Cultural Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.F-10 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 House, and the Adobe Arts Center, and ensure that they remain or are relocated to attractive and prominent settings consistent with their character and history. (Policy 5.4-1) Establish appropriate strategies to protect lo cal cultural resources that do not qualify for designation as historic resources but still refl ect Castro Valley's history and traditions. (Policy 5.4-2) Integrate consideration of historical and cu ltural resources into the development review process to promote early resolution of conflic ts between cultural resources preservation and other community goals and objectives. (Policy 5.4-3) Balance preservation goals with goals for in fill development and go als for renovation and improved appearance of commercial areas within Castro Valley In the review of applications, the level of requirements should be established with a clear understanding of public and private responsibilities. Property owne rs may be required to preserve historic resources that qualify for federal or state d esignation, even where there is a significant diminution in property value relative to th e maximum intensity allowed under zoning. (Policy 5.4-4) Impacts and Mitigation Measures Significance Criteria Based on policy and guidance provided by Alameda County and CEQA (PRC \u00a721001 and CEQA Guidelines ), an effect of the Proposed Project would be considered significant if it causes one or more of the following impacts: a) Cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource as defined in \u00a7 15064.5 b) Cause a substantial advers e change in the significance of an archaeological resource pursuant to \u00a7 15064.5 c) Directly or indirectly destroy a unique paleontological resource or site or unique geologic feature d) Disturb any human remains, including t hose interred outside of formal cemeteries Impacts Historical Resources Impact CUL-1: The Proposed Project could result in the demolition of existing structures that are not considered historical resource as defined in \u00a7 15064.5. (Less than Significant) As described in the setting section, while Eden Hospital meets the minimum age threshold for potential listing in the federal and state registers, it does not meet any of the criteria for listing due to a lack of historical and architectural significance and a loss of physical integrity from numerous additions to the structure over the past 50 years. As such, Eden Hospital would not be considered an historic resource for CEQA purposes, and the proposed demolition of Eden IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures F. Cultural Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.F-11 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Hospital and replacement with surface parking woul d result in a less-than-significant impact to historical resources as defined in CEQA Section 15064.5. Mitigation: None required. ____________________________ Archaeological Resources Impact CUL-2. Although unlikely, it is possible that previously unknown buried archaeological remains could be present within the Project Site, and the Proposed Project would result in damage to or destruction to significant archaeological remains. (Potentially Significant) While no recorded cultural resources are located w ithin a one-half mile radius of the Project S and Native American consultation failed to in dicate the presence of Native American cultural resources in the Project Site area, previously unr ecorded resources could exist anywhere in Castro Valley including the Project Site. The Project S ite may also contain significant historic-period artifacts associated with the original Stanton Hou se and property of the late 1800s. Accidental discovery during project construc tion and damage of such resources, if present, could cause a substantial adverse change in the significan ce of an archaeological resource pursuant to \u00a7 15064.5, which would be considered a signifi cant impact. Mitigation Measure CUL-2, below, would reduce potentially significant impact s to a less-than-significant level. Mitigation Measure CUL-2: If historic-period or prehistoric cultural materials are unearthed during ground-disturbing activities, all work in the immediate vicinity halt until a qualified archaeologist can assess the significance of the find. Prehistoric materials might include obsidian and chert flaked-stone tools (e.g., projectile points, knives, scrapers) or toolmaking debris ; culturally darkened soil (\"midden\") containing heat-affected rocks, artifacts, or shellfish remains; and stone milling equipment (e.g., mortars, pestles, handsto nes, or milling slabs); and battered-stone tools, such as hammerstones and pitted st ones. Historic-period materials might include stone, concrete, or adobe footings and walls; filled wells or privies; and deposits of metal, glass, and/or ceramic refuse. If the find is determined to be potentially significant, the archaeologist, in consultation with the County and appropriate Native American group(s), will de velop a treatment plan. All work in the immediate vicinity of the unanticipated discovery shall cease until the qualified archaeologist has evaluated the discov ery, or the treatment plan has been implemented. Significance after Mitigation: Less than Significant. ____________________________ IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures F. Cultural Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.F-12 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Paleontological Resource Impact CUL-3: Construction of the Proposed Project could potentially result in the destruction of a unique paleontologica l resource. (Potentially Significant) Based on information about the geologic units underlying the Project Site, records of known fossil sites, depth to bedrock, and project elem ents, paleontological resources may be encountered during the construction phases of the proposed projec t. In the event a paleontologic resource is encountered during project activities, implementation of Mitigation Measure CUL-3, below, would reduce potentially significant impacts to less than significant. Mitigation Measure CUL-3: If paleontological resources, such as fossilized bone, teeth, shell, tracks, trails, casts, mo lds, or impressions are discovered during ground-disturbing activities, work shall stop in that area and within 100 feet of the find until a qualified paleontologist can assess the significance of the find and, if necessary, develop appropriate treatment measures in consultation with Alameda County. Significance after Mitigation: Less than Significant. ____________________________ Human Remains Impact CUL-4. In the unlikely event that human remains were discovered during ground- disturbing activities, including those interred outside of formal cemeteries, the Proposed Project could inadvertently damage human remains. (Potentially Significant) Mitigation Measure CUL-4: If human remains are encountered unexpectedly during construction excavation and grading activiti es, State Health and Safety Code Section 7050.5 requires that no further disturban ce shall occur until the County Coroner has made the necessary findings as to origin and disposition pursuant to PRC Section 5097.98. If the remains are determined to be of Native American descent, the Alameda County Coroner has 24 hours to notify the NAHC. The NAHC will then identify the person(s) thought to be the Most Likely Descendent, who will then help determine what course of action should be taken in dealing with the remains. Significance after Mitigation: Less than Significant. ____________________________ Cumulative Impacts Impact CUL-5: The Proposed Project, co mbined with past, present and reasonably foreseeable future projects, would not result in a significant cumulative cultural resources impact. (Less than Significant) Geographic Context and Other Projects The geographic context considered for the cu mulative cultural resources impacts includes the surrounding area that could have the potential to combine with the Project Site and result in IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures F. Cultural Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.F-13 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 cumulative aesthetics impacts. Given the nature of the potential impacts analyzed for this topic, the geographic scope would include the CV Central Business District Subareas 3 through 5, and the residential and mixed use areas extending north, east and west of the Project Site for approximately three blocks (the distance to Castro Valley Boulevard). Past projects in this area are included in the existing setting described in this section and in Chapter III, Project Description. Present project s would include any projects currently under construction within the geographic context area. Reasonably foreseeable future projects are those that could be developed or occur in the geographic context area by 2030. Discussion There are no known past, present and reasonably for eseeable future projects that could combine with the impacts of the Proposed Project to fo rm a significant cumulative impact to cultural resources. Past projects which have or may have affected cultural resources in the Project Site area include conversion of previously undeveloped open space first to agricu ltural uses in the late eighteenth and early twentieth centuries, and later to residential, commercial, or institutional uses, especially during the Post-War period of th e 1950s - 1970s. These development activities and their associated effects on cultural resources occurre d not only in Castro Valley during the Post- War period, but the entire Bay Area as well. It is unknown whether development on the Project Site in the 1950s for the Existing Hospital, speci fically, contributed directly to the removal or damage of cultural resources, as archival resear ch revealed no records of such potential occurrences or recorded cultural s ites in the vicinity. While it is known that Eden Hospital was built on a portion of the Stanton family farmland th at had been acquired in 1871, the relocation of the 1860 Stanton House from Lake Chabot Road to its current location on Norbridge Avenue in 1973 was not a direct result of hospital expansions, but rather, was a result of proposed office development along Castro Valley Boulevard. Rega rdless, the relocation of the Stanton House from the Project Site helped to preserve a part of Castro Valley history th at otherwise would have been lost to Post-War growth. While there are no known present or reasonably for eseeable projects in the City of Castro Valley other than the proposed project which may signifi cantly impact cultural resources, other projects would be required to adhere to the same sta ndard mitigation measures for accidental discovery as would the proposed project. As such, no signi ficant cumulative impacts to cultural resources associated with the proposed project are anticipated. Mitigation: None required. __________________________ IV.

Biological Resources This chapter identifies the existing biological r esources within the Project Site for the SMCCV Project. This chapter reviews the federal, state, and local regulations pertaining to biological resources within the region, and describes project-re lated impacts to those biological resources as well as mitigation measures to reduce potentially si gnificant impacts. Information used in the preparation of this section was obtained from existing biological reports, the California Department of Fish and Game's (CDFG's) California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB, 2008), California Native Plant Society (CNPS) Electronic Inventory (CNPS, 2008), U.S. Fish and Wildlife's Official List of Federal Endangered and Threatened Species (USFWS, 2008), reconnaissance-level field surveys, and standard biological literature. A field survey of the SMCCV Project Site was conducted by an ESA biologist on May 20, 2008 to identify biological resources within the Proj ect Site as well as potential habitat for special- status species. Setting Regional Setting The Planning Area is located in the Bay Area-Delta Bioregion (as defined by the State's Natural Communities Conservation Program). This Bioregion is comprised of a variety of natural communities, which range from salt marshes to chaparral to oak woodlands. The substantial diversity of vegetation and wildlife found in Al ameda County is a reflection of the region as a whole. Such relatively high levels of diversity are the result of topographic and micro-climate variety. This diversity in combination with th e rapid pace of development in the region, has resulted in a relatively high degree of endangerment for local flora and fauna. Project Site The Project Site is approximately 18.97 acres lo cated in Castro Valley. The Project Site is entirely within an urban environment. It is located approximately one-third mile north of Interstate 580 and is bounded by Lake Chabot Road to the east, Renton Way and Congress Way to the south, Stanton Avenue to the west, and So merset Avenue to the north. The Project Site is approximately 1.2 miles southeast of a portion of th e East Bay hills that are dominated by annual grassland and oak woodland. The Project Site is al so approximately 1.6 miles southeast of Lake Chabot. Vegetation Communities, Wild life Habitats, and Wetlands Habitat classifications below are based on Ca lifornia Wildlife Habitat Relationships (CDFG, 2005). IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures G. Biological Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.G-2 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Urban Urban vegetation typically consists of tree groves, landscaped strips along streets, shade trees and shrub cover. Vegetation is typically a mix of native and exotic species and is maintained at regular intervals. The majority of the vegetation w ithin the Project Site can be classified as urban. Urban vegetation within the Project Site consists of lawns and landscaping between buildings and bordering parking lots. Planted tree species include ash ( Fraxinus sp .), American sycamore (Platanus willow ( Salix babylonica ), as well as several additional ornamental tree species. Shrub and ground cover sp.), and turfgrass, as well as additional ornamental species. Trees and shrubs provide perching and nesting habitat for birds, while manicured grass lawns can be utilized by common species of wildlife that are tolerant of mowing practices, such as California urban areas, species richness and diversity tend to be low. The abunda nce of trees and shrubs within the Project Site, however, did provide habitat for a variety of bird species. all observed within the urban vegetation portion of the Project Site during ESA's May 20, 2008 site visit. Annual grassland A small amount of annual grassland (approximately 0.5 acre) would be impacted by the Proposed Project. The grassland within the Project Site is composed of non-native grasses, and is dominated by wild oats ( ) and orchard grass ( Dactylis glomerata A variety of herbaceous species are include native coffeeberry ( Rhamnus californica ) and coast live oak, non-native pine and western larch (Larix occidentalis ). Annual grasslands can provide refuge for co mmon reptiles such as western as mourning dove ( Zenaida macroura Thomomys bottae ), California ground squirrel IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures G. Biological Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.G-3 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 (Spermophilus beecheyi ), and western harvest mouse ( Reithrodontomys megalotis ), commonly forage within disturbed grasslands. These small rodents may attract raptors, including red-tailed size of this grassland, as well as its relative isolation from other grassland areas likely limits its value for wildlife. Special-Status Species A number of species with the potential to occur in the vicinity of the Project Site are protected pursuant to federal and/or State endangered sp ecies laws, or have been designated Species of Special Concern by the CDFG. In addition, Section 15380(b) of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines provides a definition of rare, endangered or threatened species that are not included in any listing 1. Species recognized under these terms are collectively referred to as \"special-status species.\" For the purposes of this EIR, special-status species include: Plant and wildlife species listed as rare, threaten ed or endangered under the federal or State endangered species acts; Species that are candidates for listing under either federal or State law; Species formerly designated by the USFWS as Species of Concern or by CDFG as Species of Special Concern; Species protected by the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703-711); Species such as candidate species that may be considered rare or endangered pursuant to Section 15380(b) of the CEQA Guidelines . Appendix F provides a comprehensive list of th e special status species that have been documented or have the potential to occur in th e area of the Project Site. This list was obtained using information from the California Natural Diversity Database (CDFG, 2008), California Native Plant Society Electronic Inventory (CNPS, 2008), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS, 2008). Based on ESA's review of the bi ological literature of the region, previous documents (Alameda County, 2004a ) and reconnaissance-level surveys of the Project Site, all of these species were eliminated from further evalua tion because (1) the Project Site area or the immediate area does not provide suitable habitat, or (2) the known range for a particular species is outside of the Planning Area and/or the immediate area. The reasoning behind the determination for each species is discussed in A ppendix F. Species with a low potential are not expected to occur within the Project Site. The developed, urbanized Project Site does not provide habitat for any endangered, threatened, rare, or special status plant or animal species. Ho wever, there is a potential for birds to nest in landscaped vegetation within the Project Site. Ac tively nesting birds (including birds, parts of 1 For example, vascular plants listed as rare or endangered or as List 1 or 2 by the CNPS are considered to meet Section 15380(b). IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures G. Biological Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.G-4 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 birds, nests, and eggs) are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and California Fish and Game Code Sections 3503 and 3503.5. Regulatory Setting This section briefly describes federal, state, and local regulations, permits, and policies pertaining to biological resources and wetlands as they apply to the Proposed Project. Special-Status Species Federal Endangered Species Act The USFWS, which has jurisdiction over plants, wildlife, and most freshwater fish, and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), which has jurisdiction over anadromous fish, marine fish, and mammals, oversee implementation of the Federal Endangered Species Act (FESA). Section 7 of the Act mandates that all federal agencies consult with the USFWS and NMFS to ensure that federal agencies actions do not jeopa rdize the continued existence of a listed species or destroy or adversely modify critical habitat fo r listed species. A federal agency is required to consult with USFWS and NMFS if it determines a \"may effect\" situation will occur in association with the project. The FESA prohibits the \"take\"2 of any fish or wildlife species listed as threatened or endangered, including the destructi on of habitat that could hinder species recovery. Under Section 9 of the FESA, the take prohibition applies only to wildlife and fish species. However, Section 9 does prohibit the removal, possession, damage or destruction of any endangered plant from federal land. Section 9 also prohibits acts to remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy an endangered plant species in nonfed eral areas in knowing violation of any state law or in the course of criminal trespass. Candidate species and species that are proposed or under petition for listing receive no protection under Section 9 of the FESA. Section 10 of the FESA requires the issuance of an \"incidental take\" perm it before any public or private action may be taken that would potentiall y harm, harass, injure, kill, capture, collect, or otherwise hurt (i.e., take) any individual of an Endangered or Threatened species. The permit requires preparation and implementation of a habita t conservation plan that would offset the take of individuals that may occur, incidental to implementation of the project by providing for the overall preservation of the affected species through specific mitigation measures. 2 \"Take,\" as defined in Section 9 of the FESA, is broadly defined to include inte ntional or accidental \"harassment\" or \"harm\" to wildlife. \"Harass\" is further defined by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as an intentional or negligent act or omission which creates the likelihood of injury to wildli fe by annoying it to such an extent as to significantly disrupt normal behavioral patterns which include, but are no t limited to, breeding, feeding, and sheltering. \"Harm\" is defined as an act which actually kills or injures wildlif e. This may include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing esse ntial behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding or sheltering. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures G. Biological Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.G-5 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act The federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S. Code [USC], Section 703, Supplement I, 1989) states that without a permit issued by the U.S. Depa rtment of the Interior, it is unlawful to pursue, hunt, take, capture, or kill any migratory bird. This act encompasses bi rds as well as bird nests and eggs. California Environmental Quality Act The intent of the CEQA, under which this EIR is being prepared, is to maintain \"high-quality ecological systems and the general welfare of the pe ople of the state.\" It is the policy of the state to \"prevent the elimination of fish or wildlife sp ecies due to man's activities, ensure that fish and wildlife populations do not drop below self-perpe tuating levels, and preserve for future generations representations of all plant and animal communities and examples of the major periods of California history.\" CEQA forbids pub lic agencies to approve projects that will harm the environment until and unless the agency has ad opted all feasible mitigation for that harm. (Public Res. Code section 21002, 21081, subdivision a.).3 California Endangered Species Act Under the California Endangered Species Act (CESA), CDFG has the responsibility for maintaining a list of threatened and endangered sp ecies (California Fish and Game Code Section 2070). CDFG also maintains a list of \"candidate sp ecies,\" which are species formally noticed as being under review for addition to either the lis t of endangered species or the list of threatened species. In addition, CDFG maintains lists of \"sp ecies of special concern,\" which serve as \"watch lists.\" Pursuant to the requirements of CESA, an agency reviewing a proposed project within its jurisdiction must determine whether any state-lis ted endangered or threatened species could be present on the Project Site and determine whethe r the proposed project could have a potentially significant impact on such species. In addition, CDFG encourages informal consultation on any proposed project that may impact a candidate species. CEQA Guidelines Section 15380 Although threatened and endangered species are prot ected by specific federal and State statutes, CEQA Guidelines Section 15380(b) provides that a species not listed on the federal or State list of protected species may be considered rare or endangered if the species can be shown to meet certain specified criteria. These criteria have b een modeled after the definition in the FESA and the section of the California Fish and Game Code dealing with rare or endangered plants or animals. This section was included in the CEQA Guidelines primarily to deal with situations in which a public agency is reviewing a project that may have a significant effect on, for example, a \"candidate species\" that has not yet been listed by either the USFWS or CDFG. Another example is, CDFG interprets Lists 1A, 1B, and 2 of the California Native Plant Society's Inventory of Rare and Endangered Vascular Plants of California to consist of plants that, in a majority of cases, would qualify for listing as rare, threatened, or endangered. Thus, CEQA provides an agency with 3 CEQA also provides that a project might be approved in spite of residual, unmitigated significant impacts, by adoption of a statement of overriding social and economic considerations in situat ions where mitigations or alternatives are deemed infeasible. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures G. Biological Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.G-6 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 the ability to protect a species from a project's potential impacts until the respective government agencies have an opportunity to designat e the species as protected, if warranted. California Native Plant Protection Act State listing of plant species began in 1977 w ith the passage of the California Native Plant Protection Act (NPPA), which directed CDFG to car ry out the legislature's intent to \"preserve, protect, and enhance endangered plants in this state.\" The NPPA gave the California Fish and Game Commission the power to designate native plants as endangered or rare and to require permits for collecting, transporting, or selling such plants. The California Endangered Species Act expanded upon the original NPPA and e nhanced legal protection for plants. CESA established threatened and endangered species cate gories, and grandfathe red all rare animals\u2014 but not rare plants\u2014into the act as threatened sp ecies. Thus, there are three listing categories for plants in California: rare, threatened, and endangered. California Fish and Game Code Under Section 3503 of the California Fish and Ga me Code, it is unlawful to take, possess, or needlessly destroy the nest or eggs of any bird, except as otherwise provided by this code or any regulation made pursuant thereto. Section 3503.3 of the California Fish and Game Code prohibits take, possession, or destruction of any birds in the orders Falconiformes (hawks) or Strigiformes (owls), or of their nests and eggs. Fish and Game Code Sections 3511, birds; 4700, mammals; 5050, reptiles and amphibians; and 5515, fish) allows the designation of a species as Fully Protected. This is a greater level of protection than is afforded by the California Endangered Species Act, since such a designation means the listed species cannot be taken at any time. Jurisdictional Waters Including Wetlands Waters of the United States The term \"waters of the United States,\" as defi ned in the Code of Federal \u00a7 328.3[a]; 40 CFR \u00a7 230.3[s]), refers to: 1. All waters which are currently used, were used in the past, or may be susceptible to use in interstate or foreign commerce, including all wa ters which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide; 2. All interstate waters incl uding interstate wetlands; 3. All other waters such as intrastate lakes, rive rs, streams (including intermittent streams), mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairi e potholes, wet meadows, playa lakes, or natural ponds, the use, degradation, or destru ction of which could affect interstate or foreign commerce including any such waters: which are or could be used by interstate or foreign travelers for recreational or other purposes; or IV.

All impoundments of waters otherwise define d as waters of the United States under the definition; 5. Tributaries of waters identified in paragraphs (1) through (4); 6. Territorial seas; and 7. Wetlands adjacent to waters (other than wate rs that are themselves wetlands) identified in paragraphs (1) through (6). 8. Waters of the United States do not include prior converted cropland. Notwithstanding the determination of an area's status as prior c onverted cropland by any other federal agency, for the purposes of the Clean Water Act, the final authority regarding Clean Water Act jurisdiction remains with EPA (33 CFR 328.3[a][8]). Wetlands are ecologically productive habitats that su pport a rich variety of both plant and animal life. The importance of wetlands has increased due to their value as recharge areas and filters for water supplies and to their widespread filling an d destruction to enable urban and agricultural development. In a jurisdictional sense, there are two commonly used definitions of a wetland, one definition adopted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and a separate definition, originally developed by USFWS, which has b een adopted by the agencies in the State of California that have regulatory authority over we tlands. Both definitions are presented below. Federal Wetland Definition Wetlands are a subset of \"waters of the United States\" and receive protection under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). Wetlands are defined as those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequenc y and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalen ce of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetland determination under the federa l wetland definition adopted by the USACE requires the presence of three factors: (1) wetland hydrology, as defined above under point 2, (2) plants adapted to wet conditions, and (3) soils that are routinely wet or flooded [33 CFR \u00a7 328.3(b)]. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in 2001 (January 8, 2001: Solid Waste Agency of Northwestern Cook County v. United States Army Corps of Engineers et al.) that certain isolated wetlands do not fall under the jurisdiction of the CWA. This decision was further clarified in the more recent Supreme Court case, Rapanos v. United States (2006) (U.S. EPA 2007). California Wetland Definition CDFG has adopted the Cowardin et al. definition of wetlands (Cowardin, 1979). The federal definition of wetlands requires three wetland iden tification parameters to be met, whereas the Cowardin definition can be satisfied under some circumstances with the presence of only one parameter. Thus, identification of wetlands by CD FG consists of the union of all areas that are IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures G. Biological Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.G-8 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 periodically inundated or saturated, or in whic h at least seasonal dominance by hydrophytes may be documented, or in which hydric soils are present. The CDFG does not normally assert jurisdiction over wetlands unless they are subject to Streambed Alteration Agreements (California Fish and Game Code Sections 1600-1616) or they support state-listed endangered species. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U. S. Environmental Protection Agency The USACE and EPA regulate the discharge of dredge d or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands, under Sections 404 and 401 of the CWA. Projects that would result in the placement of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States require a Section 404 permit from the USACE. Based on the Supreme Court ruling (SWANCC) concerning the CWA jurisdiction over isolated waters (January 9, 2001), non-navigable, is olated, intrastate waters based solely on the use of such waters by migratory bird s are no longer defined as waters of the United States. Jurisdiction of non-navigable, isolated, in trastate waters may be possible if their use, degradation, or destruction could af fect other waters of the Unites States, or interstate or foreign commerce. Jurisdiction over such other waters are analyzed on a case-by -case basis. Impoundments of waters, tributaries of waters, and wetlands adjacent to waters should be analyzed on analyzed on a case-by-case basis. A more recent Supreme Court case, Rapanos v. United States (2006), also questioned the definition of \"waters of the Unit ed States\" and the scop e of federal regulatory jurisdiction over such waters, but left open the question as to whether the CWA extends to those waters and wetlands that have a 'significant nexus ' to navigable waters of the United States, or whether it is limited to waters with a continuous connection. Accord ing to the Rapanos decision, the CWA will: 1) Continue to regulate \"traditionally navigable waters,\" includi ng all rivers and other waters that are large enough to be used by boats th at transport commerce a nd any wetlands adjacent to such waters; 2) Continue to regulate \"non-navigable tr ibutaries that are relatively permanent and wetlands that are physically connected to these trib utaries\"; and 3) Continue to regulate based on case-by-case determinations for other tributaries and adjacent wetlands that have certain characteristics that significantly affect traditionally navigable waters (U.S. EPA 2007). State Policies and Regulations State regulation of activities in waters and wetla nds resides primarily with the CDFG and the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). In addition, the California Coastal Commission has review authority for wetland permits within its planning jurisdiction. CDFG provides comment on USACE permit actions under the Fish a nd Wildlife Coordination Act. CDFG is also authorized under the California Fish and Game Code, Sections 1600-1616, to enter into a Streambed Alteration Agreement with applican ts and develop mitigation measures when a Proposed Project would obstruct the flow or alter th e bed, channel, or bank of a river or stream in which there is a fish or wildlife resource, in cluding intermittent and e phemeral streams. The SWRCB, acting through the nine Re gional Water Quality Control Boards, must certify that a USACE permit action meets state water quality objectives (CWA, Section 401). IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures G. Biological Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.G-9 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Other Plans and Polices 1985 Castro Valley General Plan The Castro Valley General Plan (1985) lists several Project relevant policies regarding vegetation and wildlife: Policy 3.15 : Development should be restricted to those areas where native plant life and wildlife habitat values are least significant, a nd should be clustered, where possible, to preserve adequately wide strips of native ve getation to connect larger tracts of natural habitat. Policy 3.16 : Native woodland communities, and particularly riparian areas, should be protected from direct encroachment of development and from the adverse effects of increased water runoff, sedimentation, or eros ion which could result from development in adjacent areas. With the exception of improvements required for the protection of life and property, and as otherwise specified by Environmental Resources Principle 3.17 of this Plan, all public and private improvements proposed within or adjoining riparian areas should be sited, designed and their uses regulated to minimize direct damage or indirect disturbance to the riparian areas. Policy 3.18 : Native vegetation or drought tolerant ex otic plant species should be utilized in hill development landscaping to reduce the need for toxic sprays and irrigation. Policy 3.19 : Any increased runoff from urban development should be directed away from stands of native vegetation which could be damaged by over-watering. Draft Castro Valley General Plan Update (2007) The Draft Castro Valley General Plan Update (2007) proposes a substantial expansion of the General Plan policies regarding biological resources. Below are the few proposed policies that apply to the Project Site that is located in a fully urbanized area of Castro Valley: Habitat Conservation: Policy 7.1-3 : Incorporate design features that minimize the impacts of development on biological resources. Policy 7.3-1 : Continue to implement the Alameda County Tree Ordinance. Policy 7.3-2 : Preserve native trees whenever feasible. Policy 7.3-3 : Promote the use of native tree and plant species in public and private landscaped areas. Alameda County Tree Ordinance The Alameda County Tree Ordinance (Ordinance No: 0-2004-23; Alameda County, 2004b) requires an encroachment permit for planting, pruning or removing trees of any size within a county right-of-way. If any construction, repair work or other similar activity is proposed in an area adjacent to or in the County right-of-way, the property owner shall take all necessary measures prior to and during the work to protect any tree located in the right of way. A tree IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures G. Biological Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.G-10 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 qualifies for protection by having a single trunk or multi-trunk structure at least ten feet high and having a major trunk that is at least two inches in diameter taken at breast height (DBH) taken at 4.5 feet from the ground. Impacts and Mitigation Measures Significance Criteria Based on policy and guidance provided by Alameda County and CEQA (Public Resources Code [PRC] \u00a721001 and CEQA Guidelines ), an effect of the Proposed Project would be considered significant if it causes one or more of the following impacts: Adverse substantial effect, either directly or through habitat modifications, on any species identified as threatened, endangered, candidate, sensitive, or special-status species in local or regional plans, policies, regulations or by lists of species of concern from the CDFG, the USFWS, or as defined by CEQA Guidelines \u00a715380; Adverse substantial effect to on any riparian habitat or other sensitive natural community (e.g., serpentine grassland) identified in local or regional plans, policies, regulations, or lists compiled by CDFG or USFWS; Adverse substantial effect to federally or St ate protected wetlands (including but not limited to marshes and riparian areas) as defined by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, or riparian and marsh areas under the jurisdiction of CDFG as defined by California Fish and Game Code 1600-1616; Substantial interference with the movement of any native resident or migratory fish or wildlife species, with established migration or di spersal corridors, or with the use of native wildlife nursery sites; Conflict with any local plans or ordinances d esigned to protect biological resources, such as the Alameda County Tree Ordinance. Conflict with any applicable habitat con servation plan or natural community plan. In addition, the following CEQA Guidelines sections provide further significance criteria: \u00a715065 provides for mandatory findings of significance if projects \"...substantially degrade the quality of the environment, substantially re duce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species, cause a fish or wildlife population to drop belo w self-sustaining levels, threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community, substantially re duce the number or restrict the range of an endangered, rare or threatened species....\" \u00a715206 (b) (5) defines projects as being of statewide, regional, or areawide significance if they \"would substantially affect sensitive w ildlife habitats including but not limited to riparian lands, wetlands, bays, estuaries, marshe s, and habitats for endangered, rare, and threatened species as defined by \u00a715380....\" \u00a715380 states that a plant or animal species, even if not on an official list, may be treated as \"rare or endangered\" if, for example, it is lik ely to become so in the foreseeable future. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures G. Biological Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.G-11 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 \u00a715382 states that a project has a significant effect on the environment if there would be \"...a substantial, or potentially substantial, a dverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the project includi ng land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, ambient noise, and objects of historic or aesthetic significance.\" Approach to Analysis Potential impacts resulting from implementation of the project were evaluated based on a field reconnaissance survey performed by qualified ESA biologists and a review of the following sources: Existing resource maps and aerial photographs of the Project Site; Data presented in the CNDDB and the CNPS El ectronic Inventory of Rare and Endangered Vascular Plants of California, and an official species list for the project area from the USFWS (2008); Standard biological refere nces (e.g., field guides); Previous environmental impact reports, ot her environmental documents, and resources surveys for the project area; and Other available literature regarding the natural resources of the area. Impacts and Mitigation Measures Under the significance criteria established earlier in this section, the project has the potential to adversely impact special-status birds and their nursery sites as well as conflict with the Alameda County Tree Ordinance. These potential impacts ar e discussed and mitigation measures to reduce their effects are proposed below. The remaining significance criteria are not applicable to the Proposed Project. There are no wetlands, or ripari an or other sensitive habitats present on the Project Site. The previously developed Project Site will not interfere with the movement of fish or wildlife, nor does it lie within an established fi sh or wildlife migratory or dispersal corridor. Finally, the Project Site does not lie within th e planning area for any adopted or proposed habitat conservation or natural community plans. Special Status Bird Species Impact BIO-1: The Proposed Project could result in the take of special status bird species. (Potentially Significant) Migratory birds, their nests, and eggs are prot ected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. In addition, CDFG Code 3503 protects the needless d estruction of nests or eggs of most bird species, including all raptors and their nests a nd eggs. Increased noise and activity resulting from construction activities, were it to exceed ambien t levels, could cause nest abandonment and death of young or loss of reproductive potential at ac tive nests located within the Project Site. In addition, grading and removal of vegetation could result in direct losses of nests, eggs, or nestlings. The loss of active nests of special-stat us bird species would be considered a significant IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures G. Biological Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.G-12 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 impact. Implementation of Mitigation Measure BIO-1 would reduce impacts to less than significant level. Mitigation Measure BIO-1: Direct disturbance, including tree and shrub removal or nest destruction by any other means, or indirect disturbance (e.g., noise, increased human activity in area) of active nests of raptors and other special-status bird species within or in the vicinity of the proposed footprint of future development, the Proposed Project shall be avoided in accordance with the following procedures for Pre- Construction Special-Status Avian Survey s and Subsequent Actions. No more than two weeks in advance of any tree or shrub re moval or ground-disturbing activity that will commence during the breeding season (February 1 through August 31), a qualified wildlife biologist shall conduct p re-construction surveys of all potential special-status bird nesting habitat in the vicinity of the planned activity and, depending on the survey findings, the fo llowing actions shall be taken to avoid potential adverse effects on nesting special-status nesting birds: a) Pre-construction surveys are not required for construction activities scheduled to occur during the non-breeding seaso n (August 31 through January 31). b) If pre-construction surveys indicate th at no nests of special-status birds are present or that nests are inactive or po tential habitat is unoccupied, no further mitigation is required. c) If active nests of special-status birds are found during the surveys, the results of the surveys will be forwarded to CDF G (as appropriate) and avoidance procedures will be adopted, if necessa ry, on a case-by-case basis. These can include construction buffer areas (up to several hundred feet in the case of raptors), relocation of birds or seasonal avoidance. If buffers are created, a no disturbance buffer zone will be created around active nests during the breeding season or until a qualified biologist determines that all young have fledged. The size of the buffer zones and types of construction activities restricted within them will be determined through consultation with the CDFG taking into account factors such as the following: 1. Noise and human disturbance levels at the Project Site and the nesting site at the time of the survey and the noise and disturbance expected during the construction activity; 2. Distance and amount of vegetation or other screening between the Project Site and the nest; and 3. Sensitivity of individual nesting species and behaviors of the nesting birds. d) Construction activities commencing during the non-breeding season and continuing into the breeding season do no t require surveys (as it is assumed that any breeding birds taking up nests would be acclimated to project-related activities already under way). However, if trees and shrubs are to be removed during the breeding season, the trees and shrubs shall be surveyed for nests prior to their removal, according to the survey and protective action guidelines 3a through 3c, above. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures G. Biological Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.G-13 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 e) Nests initiated during construction activities would be presumed to be unaffected by the activity, and a buffer zone aro und such nests would not be necessary. f) Destruction of active nests of special-status birds and overt interference with nesting activities of special-status birds shall be prohibited. Significance after Mitigation: Less than Significant. __________________________ Protected Trees Impact BIO-2: The Proposed Project will result in damage to or removal of protected trees that are within or adjacent to the Project Site. (Potentially Significant) The Alameda County Tree Ordinance applies only to trees within the county right-of-way. The Project Site is private property, except for county-owned roads bordering the Project Site; therefore the majority of trees would not be protected under the ordinance. Trees bordering the Project Site and within the county right-of-way would be protected by the ordinance and plans to remove or prune these trees would be considered a significant impact. Protected trees that occur within or immediately adjacent to the project footprint could be damaged by construction activities such as excavating, grading and soil comp action. Extensive damage to branches, trunks, or roots has the potential to result in tree mortality. The closer the construction activity is to the trunk of the tree, the greater the potential for da mage. Each root that is damaged reduces the tree's capacity to supply water and nutrients to its leaves. Implementation of Mitigation Measures BIO-2a, BIO-2b and BIO-2c would redu ce impacts to less than significant levels. Mitigation Measure BIO-2a: The Project Sponsor shall prepare a map indicating the size and species of trees potentially impacted by construction activities on the Project Site and within the County right-of-way abutting the Site. In addition, the Project Sponsor shall conduct the following: a) Prior to the start of any clearing, stockpiling, excavation, grading, compaction, paving, change in ground el evation, or construction, all trees located within the area of project construction shall be identified as \"to be preserved\" and clearly delineated by constructing short post a nd plank walls or other protective fencing material, at the dripline of each tree or groups of trees. b) The delineation markers shall remain in place for the duration of the work. c) Where proposed development or other site work must encroach upon the dripline of a protected tree, special cons truction techniques will be required to allow the roots of remaining trees within the Project Site to breathe and obtain water (examples include, but are not limited to, use of hand equipment for tunnels and trenching, and/or allowa nce of only one pass through a tree's dripline). Tree wells or other techniques may be used. d) Excavation adjacent to any trees, when permitted, shall be in such a manner that will cause only minimal root damage. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures G. Biological Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.G-14 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 e) The following shall not occur within the dripline of any retained tree: parking; storage of vehicles, equipment, machinery, stockpiles of excavated soils, or construction materials; or dumping of oils or chemicals. f) All removed trees that meet the criteria of a protected tree shall be replaced with the same species removed as required by the County of Alameda. Mitigation Measure BIO-2b: All pruning activities of preserved trees shall be performed by a certified arborist. a) No more than 25 percent of a tree's canopy shall be removed during pruning activities of retained trees. b) If any protected preserved tree is damaged, then the project proponent shall replace the tree as required by the County of Alameda. Mitigation Measure BIO-2c: The project proponent shall develop and implement a five-year monitoring program for any requi red replacement plantings. Applicable performance standards may include, but are no t limited to: 75 percent survival rate of restoration plantings; absence of invasive plant species; and self-sustaining trees at the end of five years. Significance after Mitigation : Less than Significant. __________________________ Cumulative Impacts Impact BIO-3: The Proposed Project, co mbined with past, present and reasonably foreseeable future projects, would not result in a significant cumulative biological resources impact. (Less than Significant) Geographic Context and Other Projects The geographic context for analysis of cumulative im pacts to biological resources in this analysis encompasses the General Plan area. The western and central portions of the Planning Area are largely developed, with only ge nerally small, scattered areas of annual grassland and riparian and oak woodland providing wildlife habitat remaini ng, primarily along creeks. Other undeveloped areas in western and central Castro Valley consis t primarily of urban park s and provide isolated patches of non-native dominant habitat. The eastern portions of the General Plan area still consist primarily of native habitats, and large undevelope d portions of this area have been set aside as open space as part of planned unit developments, typically on steep hillsides or in canyons. The SMCCV is not located within or adjacent to an y of the sensitive biological resources mapped in the 2007 Draft General Plan Update (Alameda County, 2007), nor is it located within or adjacent to any of the areas proposed for inclusion in the 2007 Draft General Plan Update Biological Resources Overlay Zone. Past projects in this area are included in the existing setting described in this section and in Chapter III, Project Description. Present project s would include any projects currently under IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures G. Biological Resources Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.G-15 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 construction within the geographic context area. None are identified as of preparation of this EIR. Reasonably foreseeable future projects are tho se that could be developed or occur in the geographic context area by 2030. Discussion This analysis evaluates whether the impacts of th e Proposed Project, together with the impacts of cumulative development, would result in a cumu latively significant impact on special-status species, wetlands and other waters of the U.S., or other biological resources protected by federal, state, or local regulations or policies (based on the significance criteria and thresholds presented earlier). Environmentally protective laws and regulations, which have been applied with increasing rigor since the early 1970s, including the California Endangered Species Act, Federal Endangered Species Act, and the CWA (as described in the Regulatory Setting earlier in this EIR chapter) have applied to the developmen t of past projects. The Proposed Project and other present and future projects within the cumulative geographic context are and would be required to comply with local, state, and federal laws and policies and all applicable permitting requirements of the regulatory and oversight agencies intended to a ddress potential impacts on biological resources, including wetlands, other waters of the U.S., and special-status species. The current impact analysis has shown that th e Proposed Project has the potential for relatively minor impacts on biological resources and that these impacts can be minimized to less-than-significant levels through the application of the proposed mitigation measures. When considered relative to all past, present, and reasonably foreseeab le future projects, most of which would also have incorporated, or will incorporate, simila r mitigation measures, where necessary to reduce significant impacts where feasible. Therefore, th e cumulative effect of the proposed Project on biological resources would be less than significant. Mitigation: None required. __________________________ References - Biological Resources Alameda County, Eden Medical Center Replaceme nt Acute Care Hospital and Ambulatory Care Center Project: Initial Study, Alameda Count y Community Development Agency: Planning Department, Hayward, CA.

Geology, Soils, and Geohazards This section describes geologic and seismic conditions in the Proposed Project vicinity to provide relevant background information of the physical ch aracteristics of the Project Site with respect to soils and potential geologic hazards. The followi ng information is compiled from geologic maps and reports available from Alameda County, the California Geological Survey (CGS; formerly California Divisions of Mines and Geology), th e Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), as well as the geotechnical study and geologic a nd seismic hazards evaluation report completed for the Proposed Project and conducted by Fugr o West, Inc. (Fugro). Based on the evaluation of geologic and seismic conditions in the Proposed Project vicinity, potential impacts are discussed and evaluated, and appropriate standard cond itions of approval are identified, as necessary. Setting The Project Site is situated within the Coast Ranges geomorphic province of California. The Coast Ranges is the largest of the state's geomorphic provinces extending approximately 400 miles from the Klamath Mountains (near northern Humboldt County) to the Santa Ynez River in Santa Barbara County. The province lies between the Pacific Ocean and the Great Valley (Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys) provinces and is characterized by a series of northwest trending mountain ridges and valleys, running gene rally parallel to the San Andreas Fault zone. These mountain ridges and valleys have been formed by tectonic forces that compressed ancient sedimentary deposits over the course of millions of years. The overall hospital site occupies a low gently slopi ng ridge with an elevation of approximately 200 feet above mean sea level. As noted by Fugro ( 2008), although the Project Site is located in a region that contains numerous active earthquake faults, no active faults are mapped across the Project Site, based on the Fugro (2008) evaluati on of existing geologic maps and reports which included Dibblee (2005), Lienkaemper (1992), He rd (1978), and Radbruch-Hall (1974). Further noted by Fugro (2008), according to the map by Dibblee (2005), Quaternary alluvial deposits and Cretaceous age marine sedimentary rock are e xposed at the surface in the Project area. Fugro (2008) indicates that most of the sedimentary rock encountered in the study area consisted of poorly indurated claystone and siltstone. Seismicity Seismic hazards include those hazards that coul d reasonably be expected to occur in the area during a major earthquake on any of the active faults in the region. Some hazards can be more severe than others, depending on the location, unde rlying materials, and level of ground shaking. The Project Site, like the entire Bay Area, lies w ithin an area that contains many active and potentially active faults and is considered to be an area of high seismic activity. 1 The United State 1 An \"active\" fault is defined by the State of California as a fault that has had surface displacement within Holocene time (approximately the last 11,000 years). A \"potentially activ e\" fault is defined as a fault that has shown evidence of surface displacement during the Quater nary (last 1.6 million years), unless direct geologic evidence demonstrates inactivity for all of the Holocene or longe r. This definition does not, of course, mean that faults lacking evidence of surface displacement are necessarily inactive. \"Sufficiently ac tive\" is also used to describe a fault if there is some evidence that Holocene displacement occurred on one or more of its segments or branches (Hart, 1997). IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures H. Geology, Soils, and Geohazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.H-2 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Geological Survey (USGS) Working Group on Ca lifornia Earthquake Probabilities evaluated the probability of one or more earthquakes of Rich ter magnitude 6.7 or higher occurring in the San Francisco Bay Area within the next 30 years (USGS, 2003a).2 The result of the evaluation indicated a 62-percent likelihood that such an earthquake event will occur in the Bay Area between 2003 and 2032 (USGS, 2003a). Ground movement during an earthquake can vary depending on the overall magnitude, distance to the fault, focus of earthquake energy, and type of geologic material. The composition of underlying soils, even those relatively distant from faults, can intensify ground shaking. For this reason, earthquake intensities are also measured in terms of their observed effects at a given locality. The Modified Mercalli (MM) intensity scale ( Table IV.H-1 ) is commonly used to measure earthquake damage due to ground shak ing. The MM values for intensity range from I (earthquake not felt) to XII (damage nearly total), and intensities ranging from IV to X can cause moderate to significant structural damage. 3 The intensities of an earthquake will vary over the region of a fault and generally decrease with distance from the epicenter of the earthquake. According to the Association of Bay Area Gove rnments (ABAG) Shaking Intensity Maps and Information, the Project Site is located in an area subject to \"moderate\" to \"strong\" ground shaking (Modified Mercalli Intensity VI to VII) from earthquakes along the entire San Andreas (similar to the 1906 Earthquake), and \"violent \" to \"very violent\" ground shaking (Modified Mercalli Intensity IX to X) from the Northern and Southern segments of the Hayward Fault (ABAG, 2008). The Project Site is not in an Alquist-Priolo Ea rthquake Fault Zone, and no known active fault exists on or in the project area boundaries. The potentia l for surface fault rupture at the site is thus low (Fugro, 2008). The closest active faults are th e Hayward fault, approximately 0.5 miles west of the Project Site, the Calaveras fault located approximately 7.8 miles southwest of the project area, the Concord fault located approximately 14.9 miles northeast of the Project Site, and the San Andreas fault located approximately 18.6 miles to the northwest (Fugro, 2008). Like the entire Bay Area, the Project Site is subject to ground shaking in the event of an earthquake on the regional faults. Regional Faults The San Andreas, Hayward, and Calaveras faults po se the greatest threat of significant damage in the Bay Area according to the USGS Working Group (USGS, 2003a). These three faults exhibit strike-slip orientation and have experien ced movement within the last 150 years. 4 Other principal 2 Richter magnitude is a measure of the size of an earthqu ake as recorded by a seismograph. Richter magnitudes vary logarithmically, with each whole number step representing a ten-fold increase in the amplitude of the recorded seismic waves. Earthquake magnitudes are also measured by their Moment Magnitude (Mw) which is related to the physical characteristics of a fault incl uding the rigidity of the rock, the size of fault rupture, and movement or displacement across a fault. 3 The damage level represents the estimated overall dama ge that will occur for various MM intensity levels. Damage, however, is not uniform, as the age, ma terial, type, method of construction, si ze, and shape of a building all affect its performance. 4 A strike-slip fault is a fault in whic h movement is horizontal, parallel to th e strike of the fault plane (Press, 1998).

SOURCE: (ABAG, 2003) faults capable of producing significant ground shaking in th e Bay Area are listed on Table IV.H-2 , and include the Rodgers Creek fault, the Conc ord-Green Valley fault, and the Marsh Creek- Greenville fault. These faults are considered activ e, and there are many other potentially active and inactive faults located throughout the Bay Ar ea. Considerable seismic events can occur on faults with a long period of inactivity, alt hough it is generally considered less likely. Occasionally, faults classified as inactive can e xhibit secondary movement during a major event on another active fault. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures H.

Hayward Fault The Hayward Fault Zone is the southern extensi on of a fracture zone that includes the Rodgers Creek fault (north of San Pablo Bay), the H ealdsburg fault (Sonoma County), and the Maacama fault (Mendocino County). The Hayward fault tre nds to the northwest within the East Bay, extending from San Pablo Bay in Richmond, 60 mile s south to east San Jos\u00e9. The Hayward fault in San Jos\u00e9 converges with the Calaveras fault, a similar type fault that extends north to Suisun Bay. The Hayward fault is designated by the Al quist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act as an active fault. A characteristic feature of the Hayward fault is its well-expressed and rela tively consistent fault creep. Although large earthquakes on the Hayward fa ult have been rare since 1868, slow fault creep has continued to occur and has caused me asurable offset. Fault creep on the East Bay segment of the Hayward fault is estimated at 9 m illimeters per year (Peterson, 1996). However, a large earthquake could occur on the Hayward fault with an estimated moment magnitude (Mw) of about Mw 7.3. The USGS Working Group on Ca lifornia Earthquake Probabilities includes the IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures H. Geology, Soils, and Geohazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.H-5 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault Systems in the list of those faults that have the highest probability of generating earthquakes of magnitude (M) 6.7 or greater in the Bay Area (USGS, 2003a). Calaveras Fault The Calaveras fault is a major right-lateral strike -slip fault that has been active during the last 11,000 years. The Calaveras fault is located in the eastern San Francisco Bay region and generally trends along the eastern side of the East Bay Hills, west of San Ramon Valley, and extends into the western Diablo Range, and eventu ally joins the San Andreas Fault Zone south of Hollister. The northern extent of the fault zone is somewhat conjectural and could be linked with the Concord fault. The Calaveras fault has been the source of num erous moderate magnitude earthquakes, and the probability of a large earthquake (greater than M6 .7) is much lower than on the San Andreas or Hayward faults (USGS, 2003a). However, this fault is considered capable of generating earthquakes with Mw 6.9 (Table IV.H-2). Concord-Green Valley The Concord and Green Valley faults are part of the larger San Andreas Fault system. The Concord fault extends from the northwestern slope of Mt. Diablo north to Suisun Bay, where the Green Valley fault is generally thought to be c onnected to the Concord fault and continues north to Wooden Valley in Napa County. Several s ite-specific studies on these faults have been conducted in compliance with the Alquist-Priolo Ea rthquake Fault Zoning Act, and they report the most recent displacement on these faults between 2,600 and 2,700 years ago in the late Holocene. The Concord fault is located approximately 14.9 miles northeast of Project Site area. San Andreas Fault The San Andreas Fault Zone is a major structural feature that forms at the boundary between the North American and Pacific tectonic plates, exte nding from the Salton Sea in Southern California near the border with Mexico to north of Point Arena, where the fault trace extends out into the Pacific Ocean. The main trace of the San Andreas fault runs through the Bay Area and trends northwest through the Santa Cruz Mountains along the eastern side of the San Francisco Peninsula. As the principal strike-slip boundary between the Pacific plate to the west and the North American plate to the east, the San Andreas is often a highly visible topographic feature, such as between Pacifica and San Mateo, where Crystal Springs Reservoir and San Andreas Lake clearly mark the rupture zone. Monte Vista-Shannon Fault The Monte Vista-Shannon fault is part of what is referred to as the Southwestern Santa Clara Valley thrust belt, which is located generally al ong the foothills of the northeastern Santa Cruz Mountains. The fault is recognized has possibly b een active during the last 10,000 years (Bryant, 2000). The Monte Vista-Shannon fault is located approximately 20 miles south of the Project Site. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures H. Geology, Soils, and Geohazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.H-6 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Marsh Creek-Greenville Fault The Marsh Creek-Greenville fault extends along th e base of the Altamont Hills, which form the eastern margin of the Livermore Valley. The fault is recognized as a major structural feature and has demonstrated activity in the last 11,000 year s. The Marsh Creek-Greenville fault is located approximately 23 miles northwest of the Project Site. Seismic Hazards Ground Shaking Strong ground shaking from a major earthquake c ould affect the Project Site during the next 30 years. An earthquake on any one of the active fa ults (listed in Table IV.H-2) could potentially produce a range of ground shaking intensities at the Project Site. Ground shaking may affect areas hundreds of miles distant from the earthquake's epicenter. Historic earthquakes have caused strong ground shaking and damage in the San Fr ancisco Bay Area, the most recent being the Loma Prieta earthquake (moment magnitude 6.9) in October 1989. The epicenter was approximately 50 miles south of the Project Site, and the earthquake caused strong ground shaking for about 20 seconds and resulted in varying degrees of structural damage as far as 50 miles away. This event produced light (Modified Mercalli V) to moderate (Modified Mercalli VI) shaking intensities in the proj ect area (ABAG, 2008). The 1906 San Francisco earthquake, with an estimated moment magnit ude of 7.9, produced moderate (Modified Mercalli VI) to strong (Modified Mercalli VII) sh aking intensities in the project area (ABAG, 2008). The common way to describe ground motion during an earthquake is the duration of the shaking. However, a common measure of ground motion is also the peak ground acceleration (PGA). The PGA for a given component of motion is the la rgest value of horizontal acceleration obtained from a seismograph. PGA is expressed as the pe rcentage of the equivalent acceleration of gravity (g), which is approximately 980 centimete rs per second squared. (In terms of automobile acceleration, one \"g\" of acceleration is a rate of increase in speed equivalent to a car accelerating from a standstill to 60 mph in less than 3 seconds .) For comparison purposes, the maximum peak acceleration value recorded during the Loma Prie ta earthquake was in the vicinity of the epicenter, near Santa Cruz, at 0.64 g. The low est values recorded were 0.06 g in the bedrock on Yerba Buena Island. An earthquake on the Hayward fault would likel y produce more severe ground shaking than was observed during the Loma Prieta earthquake if the epicenter of the earthquake were closer in vicinity to the Project Site, and along the Hayward fault. Probabilisti c seismic hazard maps indicate that peak ground acceleration in the project region could reach or exceed 0.748g (CGS, 2003). As noted in the Fugro report, se ismic design must follow the curr ent building codes for essential structures for the new hospital. Although c onformance to the current building code recommendations does not constitute any kind of guar antee that significant structural damage would not occur in the event of a maximum credible earthquake, it is reasonable to expect that a well-designed and well-constructed structure will not collap se or cause loss of life in a major earthquake. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures H. Geology, Soils, and Geohazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.H-7 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Surface Fault Rupture Seismically induced ground rupture is defined as the physical displacement of surface deposits in response to an earthquake's seismic waves. The ma gnitude, sense, and nature of fault rupture can vary for different faults or even along different strands of the same fault. Ground rupture is considered more likely along active faults , which are referenced in Table IV.H-2. The Project Site is not within an Alquist-Priolo Fault Rupture Hazard Zone, as designated through the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoni ng Act, and no mapped active faults are known to pass through the immediate project region. As noted by Fugro, the concealed trace of the inactive Chabot fault was mapped by Dibblee (200 5) as trending towards the Project Site and approximately 500 feet off-site (Fugro, 2008). A lthough, no indications of surface displacement were found during reconnaissance, the investigative team agreed that the fault appears inactive, and notes that while the possibility of new fau lt breaks on the Chabot fault developing during future earthquakes cannot be precluded, histor ic occurrences of surface fault rupture have generally been within active fault zones (Fugro, 2008). Therefore, the risk of ground rupture at the site is low and is not disc ussed further in this analysis. Liquefaction Liquefaction is a transformation of soil from a so lid to a liquefied state during which saturated soil temporarily loses strength resulting from the buildup of excess pore water pressure, especially during earthquake-induced cyclic loadi ng. Soils susceptible to liquefaction include saturated loose to medium dense sands and gravel s, low-plasticity silts, and some low-plasticity clay deposits. Liquefaction and associated failu res could damage foundations, disrupt utility service, and can cause damage to roadways. Hazard maps available through ABAG and produced by the USGS depict liquefaction and lateral spreading hazards for the entire Bay Area in th e event of a significant seismic event (ABAG, 2003).5 According to these maps, the project area has very low to low liquefaction susceptibility. Additionally, the geotechnical site investigati on indicated that the soils underlying the Project Site generally consisted of stiff to very stiff s ilty clay alluvium underlain by siltstone, claystone and sandstone bedrock. Groundwater was not ob served in the November 1997 borings up to a depth of 36 and 51 feet below ground surface. Thes e additional factors indicate that the potential for liquefaction occurring at the site is low (Fugro, 2008), and the risk of liquefaction occurring at the site is not further analyzed in this study. Landslides Slope failures, commonly referred to as landslides, include many phenomena that involve the downslope displacement and movement of material, either triggered by static (i.e., gravity) or dynamic (i.e., earthquake) forces. A slope failure is a mass of rock, soil, and debris displaced downslope by sliding, flowing, or falling. Exposed rock slopes undergo rockfalls, rockslides, or rock avalanches, while soil slop es experience shallow soil slides, rapid debris flows, and deep- 5 Lateral spreading is a ground failure associated with liquefaction and generally results from predominantly horizontal displacement of ma terials toward relatively unsupported free slope faces. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures H. Geology, Soils, and Geohazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.H-8 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 seated rotational slides. Landslides may occur on slopes of 15 percent or less; however, the probability is greater on steeper slopes that exhi bit old landslide features such as scarps, slanted vegetation, and transverse ridges. Landslide-suscep tible areas are characterized by steep slopes and downslope creep of surface materials. Debris fl ows consist of a loose mass of rocks and other granular material that, if saturated and present on a steep slope, can move downslope. The rate of rock and soil movement can vary from a slow creep over many years to a sudden mass movement. Landslides occur throughout the state of California, but the density of incidents increases in zones of active faulting. Slope stability can depend on a number of complex va riables. The geology, structure, and amount of groundwater in the slope affect slope failure potential, as do external processes such as climate, topography, slope geometry, and human activity. The factors that contribute to slope movements include those that decrease the resistance in the slope materials and those that increase the stresses on the slope. Slope failure under static fo rces occurs when those forces initiating failure overcome the forces resisting slope movement. For example, a soil slope may be considered stable until it becomes saturated with water (e.g., during heavy rains or due to a broken pipe or sewer line). Under saturated conditions, the water pressure in the individual pores within the soil increases, reducing the strength of the soil. In addition, cutting into the slope and removing the lower portion, or slope toe, can reduce or elim inate the slope support, thereby increasing stress on the slope. The Project site is not located in an area wher e earthquake-induced landslides are likely to occur as indicated on the CGS Seismic Hazard Map (CGS, 2002). As noted by Fugro, a geologic study for Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital indicated the presence of a landslide; and soil creep on the north side of the knoll where the proposed helistop is to be constructed. Their site reconnaissance indicated that the area had been re paired during construction of a retaining wall on the knoll. The new helistop will lower the top elevation of the knoll, and future grading and construction will further reduce the potential for landslides at the Knoll. The potential hazards related to landslides are analyzed further in th e Impacts and Mitigation Measures section below. Geologic Hazards Considering the geologic context of the project area and nature of the Proposed Project, other typical geologic hazards could include soil erosi on, expansive soil, and corrosive soil materials. These hazards are discussed briefly here. Expansive Soils Expansive soils possess a \"shrink-swell\" behavior. Shrink-swell is the cyclic change in volume (expansion and contraction) that occurs in fine-grained clay sediments from the process of wetting and drying. Structural damage to buildings can occur over a long period of time, usually as a result of inadequate soil and foundation engineering or the placement of structures directly on expansive soils. Soils in the area have been characterized as having a medium to high expansion potential, or shrink-swell behavior. According to the studies conducted by Fugro, clayey soils at the proposed hospital location ha ve a high to critical expansion potential, and would be classified as \"expansive\" as defined in Section 1802A.3.2 of the 2007 California IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures H. Geology, Soils, and Geohazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.H-9 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Building Code (Fugro, 2008). Due to the fact that settlement will likely occur, mitigation measures to address the potential for expansive soils to increase structural damage will need to be implemented. Soil Erosion Erosion is the wearing away of soil and rock by processes such as mechanical or chemical weathering, mass wasting, the action of waves, wind and underground water. Excessive soil erosion can eventually lead to damage of building foundations and roadways . The Proposed Project includes excavation for graded soils, use of fi ll material, and possibly additional import soils material. The project area will be positively graded for rapid removal of surface water runoff from the foundation systems. Measures will need to be implemented to prevent excessive soil erosion during construction and to ensure that final projec t design minimizes the risks associated with soil erosion. Soil Corrosion In an area where high corrosion potential exists in soils, these conditions present a potential for subsurface structures to lose competency and eventually become a hazard. These conditions are characterized through analytical tests such as resis tivity analysis, chloride a nd sulfate concentration, pH testing, and by measuring the reduction-oxi dation potential of the soil. According to the corrosion testing conducted by Fugro during the November 2007 investigatio n, the soils results indicate that \"moderately corrosive\" to \"corrosive\" soils are present at the site and recommended that a corrosion engineer evaluate the corrosion potential of the soil environment on buried metal, on buried concrete structures, and stee l pipe coated with cement-mortar. Regulatory Setting Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (formerly the Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act), signed into law December 1972, requ ires the delineation of zones along active faults in California. The Alquist-Priolo Act regulates development on or near active fault traces to reduce the hazard of fault rupture and to prohi bit the location of most structures for human occupancy across these traces 6. Cities and counties must regulate certain development projects within the delineated zones, and regulati ons include withholding permits until geologic investigations demonstrate that development sites are not threatened by future surface displacement (Hart, 1997). Surface fault rupture, ho wever, is not necessarily restricted to the area within an Alquist-Priolo Zone. Seismic Hazards Mapping Act The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990 addresses non-surface fault rupture earthquake hazards, including liquefaction and seismically in duced landslides, and its purpose is to protect public safety from the effects of strong ground shak ing, liquefaction, landslides, and other ground 6 A \"structure for human occupancy\" is defined by the Al quist-Priolo Act as any structure used or intended for supporting or sheltering any use or occupancy that has an occupancy rate of more than 2,000 person-hours per year.

Geology, Soils, and Geohazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.H-10 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 failure, and other hazards caused by earthquak es. The Act requires the State Geologist to delineate various seismic hazard zones and requir es cities, counties, and other local permitting agencies to regulate certain development project s within these zones. Before a development permit is granted for a site within a seismic haza rd zone, a geotechnical investigation of the site must be conducted and appropriate mitigation measures incorporated into the project design. 1983 Alfred E. Alquist Hospital Seismic Safety Act (Seismic Safety Act), Senate Bill 1953 (SB 1953) and the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) All acute care medical center properties fall under the jurisdiction of the Alquist Act, as amended in 1994 by SB 1953. The Alquist Act requires medical facilities to comply with seismic safety building standards as defined by Office of Stat ewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) within specific time frames. OSHPD is a department of the California Health and Human Services Agency and is responsible for carrying out the provisions of the Alquist Act and serves as the building authority for acute care facilities in lieu of local jurisdictions. OS HPD's primary goals include assessing California's healthcare infrastructure, managing the health care workforce, providing healthcare outcomes information to the public, insuring healthcare facilities development loans, and running the Hospital Seismic Safety Program, which enforces building seismic safety. The Hospital Building Safety Board (HBSB) further advises the director of OSHPD on the administration of the Act and acts as a board of appeals for hospital seismic safety issues. The Act was adopted in part so that after a ma jor earthquake or disaster, hospital facilities can continue to provide care to their current occupa nts as well as any new patients that might arrive after the event. During and after the 1994 Northr idge earthquake, hospitals that were compliant with the Act sustained minimal structural damage and continued to function. Hospitals that were not compliant sustained major damage and had to be abandoned (OSHPD, 2001). Compliance with the Alquist Seismic Safety Act and SB 1953 (the Act) For a hospital building to remain classified as an acute care hospital facility, and thus be compliant with the Act, the owner of the building must do the following: 1. Complete seismic evaluations with procedures as defined by OSHPD, 2. Prepare a comprehensive plan and schedule for how each building will become compliant with the Act, within 3 years of the evaluation, and 3. Submit the report and a compliance plan to OSHPD for review and approval (California State Senate, 1994). In the process of compliance, OSHPD and th e hospital building owner evaluates both nonstructural (communications, medical gas, etc. ) and structural (actual building structure) components of acute care hospital facilities that might sustain damage during a shaking event. Nonstructural components are put into a Nons tructural Performance Category (NPC), and structural components are put into a Structural Performance Category (SPC). Thus, each acute IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures H. Geology, Soils, and Geohazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.H-11 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 care facility is assigned an NPC rating and an SPC rating that is put into OSHPD's database for review. OSHPD evaluates SPC and NPC ratings sep arately. As part of the ratings evaluation process, OSHPD and affiliated engineers examine structural drawings and submitted reports of upgrades, if any, that have occurred to each hosp ital building. These evaluations may include an onsite visit by the Area Compliance Officer (ACO) and/or the District Structural Engineer (DSE) of OSHPD. After the evaluation process, the rati ng is either confirmed or changed according to OSHPD's review and determination, and OSHP D provides guidance to the hospital property owner regarding further required upgrades. Nonstructural Performance Category (NPC) and Structural Performance Category (SPC) Ratings Each possible NPC and SPC rating is described belo w. In general, low ratings (e.g., SPC-1) mean a hospital building systems are not prepared for a disaster, and high ratings (e.g., SPC-4) mean hospital building systems are prepared for a disaster . If the building is determined to not be in compliance with the Act based on the following NPC and SPC ratings, seismic retrofit regulations (Division III-R) shall be applied to guide the building's retrofit, thus increasing the NPC and SPC rating of the building (OSHPD, 2001). Nonstructural Ratings NPC-0 : No rating was reported to OSHPD. NPC-1 : Basic systems used in life safety and care are not properly anchored, and will not survive an earthquake event. Communications , emergency power, medical gas, and fire alarm systems must be anchored by January 1, 2002. NPC-2 : Communications systems, emergency power supplies, bulk medical gas systems, fire alarm systems, and emergency lighti ng and exit signs are properly anchored. NPC-3 : Basic systems used in life safety and care are properly anchored in critical areas of the hospital. If there is not significant structural damage, basic emergency medical care should be able to continue. NPC-4 : All architectural, mechanical, electrical systems, components and equipment, and hospital equipment are properly anchored. If ther e is not significant structural damage and problems with water and sewer systems, basi c emergency medical care should be able to continue. NPC-5 : All basic systems used in life safety an d care are properly anchored. In addition, the building has water and wastewater holding tanks (integrated into the plumbing system) and an on-site fuel supply that will last through 72 hours of acute care operations. Radiological service can also continue. Structural Ratings SPC-0 : No rating was reported to OSHPD. SPC-1 : These buildings have a high risk of collapse in an earthquake, and are a significant safety hazard to the public. These buildings mu st be retrofitted, replaced, or removed from acute care classification by January 1, 2008. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures H.

These buildings are reasonably capable of providing care after an event, and they have been constructed or reconstructed under OSHP D building permits. They can be used to January 1, 2030 and beyond. California Building Code The California Building Code is certified in the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 24, Part 2, which is a portion of the California Build ing Standards Code. Title 24 is assigned to the California Building Standards Commission (CBSC), which, by law, is responsible for coordinating all building standards. Published by the International Conference of Building Officials, the International Building Code (IBC) is a widely adopted model building code in the United States. The California Building Code inco rporates by reference the IBC with necessary California amendments. About one-third of the text within the California Building Code has been tailored to respond to California earthquake conditions. The national model code standards adopted into T itle 24 apply to all occupancies in California, except for modifications adopted by state agencies and local governing bodies. The CBSC is a standard that OSHPD uses when reviewing and evaluating building plans and specifications. The Seismic Safety Act and OSHPD enforces all build ing standards published in the CBSC relating to the regulation of hospital buildings and the enforc ement of other regulations adopted pursuant to the Seismic Safety Act. Castro Valley General Plan (1985) The following principles are identified in the 1985 Castro Valley Plan (General Plan) : Principle 4.2 : To the extent possible, projects should be designed to accommodate seismic shaking and should be sited away from area subj ect to hazards induced by seismic shaking (e.g., landsliding, liquefacti on, lurching, etc.) where design measures to mitigate the hazards will not achieve a satisfactory degree of risk reduction. Principle 4.3 : All structures should be designe d and constructed to withstand groundshaking forces of a minor earthquake without damage, or a moderate earthquake without structural damage, and of a major earthquake without collapse. Critical and IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures H. Geology, Soils, and Geohazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.H-13 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 essential structures and facilities should be desi gned and constructed to remain standing and functional following a major earthquake. Principle 4.4 : Structures should be located an ade quate distance away from active fault traces such that surface faulting is not an unacceptable hazard. Principle 4.5 : Major transportation facilities (e.g., freeways, rail rapid transit) and underground utilities should be planned to cross active fault traces a minimum number of times and should be designed to accommodate fault displacement without major damage which could cause long term and unacceptable disruption of service. Utility lines should be equipped with mechanisms to shut off flows in the event of fault rupture. Principle 4.6 : Aspects of all development in hill areas, including grading, vegetation removal and drainage, should be carefully c ontrolled in order to minimize erosion and disruption to natural slope stability. Principle 4.7 : Within areas of demonstrated or po tential slope instability, development should be undertaken with caution and only af ter existing geologic a nd soil conditions are known and considered. In areas subject to possi ble widespread major landsliding, only very low density development should be permitted, co nsistent with site investigations. In these areas, grading should be restrict ed to the minimal amounts requi red to provide access to the site. Principle 4.8 : All existing structures or features of structures which are hazardous in their potential to cause damage, injury or loss of life, or loss of critical and essential functions in the event of an earthquake, should be brought in to conformance with applicable and related safety (e.g., fire, toxic materials storage a nd use) standards, through rehabilitation, reconstruction, demolition, reduction in o ccupancy level, or change in use. Draft Castro Valley General Plan Update (2007) The following principles are identified in the 2007 Draft Castro Valley Plan Update : As stated in the 2007 Draft General Plan Update, Landslide Goal (10.3-1): Minimize risks of property damage and personal injury pos ed by geologic and seismic hazards. Policy 10.3-1 : Consideration of Ground Shaking Forces during Design Process. Design and construct structures to withstand ground sh aking forces of a minor earthquake without damage, or a moderate earthquake without st ructural damage, and of a major earthquake without collapse. Design and construct critical and essential structures and facilities to remain standing and functional following a major earthquake.

Geology, Soils, and Geohazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.H-14 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 - Rupture of a known earthquake fault, as delineated on the most recent Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Map or Seismic Ha zards Map issued by the State Geologist for the area or based on other substantial evidence of a known fault (refer to Division of Mines and Geology Special Publications 42 and 117 and PRC \u00a72690 et. seq.); - Strong seismic ground shaking; - Seismic-related ground failure, including li quefaction, lateral spreading, subsidence, collapse; or - Landslides; Result in substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil; Be located on a geologic unit or soil that is unstable, or that would become unstable as a result of the project, and potentially result in on- or off-site landslide, lateral spreading, subsidence, liquefaction, or collapse; Be located on expansive soils, as defined in Table 18-1-B of the Uniform Building Code (1994), creating substantial risks to life or property; Have soils incapable of adequately suppor ting the use of septic tanks or alternative wastewater disposal systems where sewers are not available for the disposal of wastewater. As noted in the Initial Study, the Proposed Project Site will continue to be served by Castro Valley Sanitary District and would not use septic tanks or alternative wastewater disposal systems. Therefore, the Proposed Project would have no impact resulting from use of certain wastewater disposal systems in unsupportive soils, an d this topic will not be analyzed further in this EIR. As discussed above, the risks associated with surface fault rupture and liquefaction occurring at the site are low and are considered less than significant and are not discussed further in this section. Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Compliance with Seismic Safety Act A primary objective of the Proposed Project is development of the New Hospital to replace the Existing Hospital. To comply with the Act, SM CCV proposes to develop a new state-of-the-art acute care hospital, where the New Hospital w ill replace the Existing Hospital prior to the January 1, 2013 compliance date in SB 1953. The Proposed Project will assure that medical services will continue to be provided by a li censed acute care hospital on the existing Eden Medical Center Castro Valley Campus (as expa nded for construction of the New Hospital) during construction and thereafter without disruption. Th e principal objectives also include construction of the New MOB, which is not considered an essential structure and does not fall under the guidelines presented in California Geological Survey - Note 48, Checklist for the Review of Engineering Geology and Seismology Reports fo r California Public Schools, Hospitals, and Essential Services Buildings (Note 48). The main purpose of the Proposed Project is to meet the provisions of SB 1953 by 2013. Construction of ne w acute care facility buildings according to the 2007 California Building Code , would meet the requirements of the Act. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures H. Geology, Soils, and Geohazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.H-15 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Project Phasing The Proposed Project will be completed over a period of approximately five to six years. Total onsite population would not subs tantially increase as a result of the Proposed Project (see Table III-1 in Chapter III, Project Description), an d e the Project will decrease the seismic hazards risk to people and property by upgrad ing or demolishing older buildings that are seismically unsafe. New buildings will be constr ucted to stricter building codes. The impact discussion below pertains to all construction phases of the project. Local Plans and Policies Discussion of the project's overall consistency with the General Plan and the specific Castro Valley goals and principles and pol icies listed above is provided in Section IV.A, Land Use, Plans and Policies , of this EIR. The analysis below evalua tes the Proposed Projec t's consistency with General Plan policies that entail regulatory requirements with which the project must comply. Geotechnical Investigation The following analysis focuses on potential project impacts related to seismicity and erosion. The evaluation considered Proposed Project plans, current conditions at the Project Site, and applicable regulations and guidelines. A geotechni cal investigation has been completed for the proposed project (Fugro, 2008). Consistent with standard acceptable geotechnical practices and OSHPD compliance, the report was prepared with regard to satisfying the guidelines presented in the most recent version of Note 48 published in October 2007. The following analysis is based on the findings of the geotechnical investigation prepared by Fugro (2008), as well as proposed project plans, current conditions at the Proj ect Site and its surroundings, and various maps, resources, and applicable regulations and guidelines cited througho ut this section. Operational Impacts Exposing People and Structures to Seismic Hazards Impact GEO-1: In the event of a major eart hquake in the region, seismic ground shaking could potentially injure people and cause colla pse or structural damage to existing and proposed structures. (Potentially Significant) The Project Site would likely experience at least one major earthquake (Ric hter magnitude 6.7 or higher) within the next 30 years. The intensity of such an event would depend on the causative fault and the distance to the epicenter, the mo ment magnitude, and the duration of shaking. A seismic event in the Bay Area could produce ground accelerations at the proposed project area that are violent to very violent (MM-IX to MM-X) (ABAG, 2008). Based on the MMI scale, an earthquake of this intensity on the Hayward fault would cause considerable structural damage, even in well-d esigned structures. Ground shaking of this intensity could lead to an interruption in patient care due to structural building damage, movement or damage of internal building components (i.e., be ds, shelves, and cabinets), or power failure. Substantial cracks could appear in the ground , and the shaking could cause other secondary IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures H. Geology, Soils, and Geohazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.H-16 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 damaging effects such as the failure of underground pipes. As a comparison, the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, with an M 7.9, produced st rong (MM-VII) shaking intensities in the project area (ABAG, 2008). A characteristic earthquake on the Calaveras, San Andreas, or Concord- Green Valley (listed in Table IV.H-2) coul d produce moderate (MM-VI) to strong (MM-V) ground shaking intensities (ABAG, 2008). Eart hquakes of this intensity may move heavy furniture and cause slight damage. In accordance with Section 129770 of the Seismic Safety Act, OSHPD is required to review the structural systems and related details of the cons truction or renovation of medical buildings with acute care facilities, as well as the recommenda tions of any site-specific geotechnical investigations prepared for those buildings, to en sure compliance with the Seismic Safety Act and the CBC. OSHPD's comments and the recommendations from the geotechnical investigation would be submitted to the County Building Insp ection Department and the County Planning Department. The County Building Inspection De partment, County Planning Department would not be able to issue a building permit until it h as received approval from OSHPD. In addition to reviewing the proposed structural plans, OSHPD is responsible for overseeing construction of the proposed hospital building to ensure that cons truction complies with the approved plans. In accordance with the California Building C ode, the geotechnical investigation includes recommendations applicable to foundation design, earthwork, and site preparation. These recommendations were prepared by a licensed ge otechnical engineer and would be incorporated into the project designs upon approval by OS HPD. Prior to commencement of any other construction as part of the Proposed Project, a si te specific geotechnical investigation would be prepared for the site of the pr oposed New Hospital and MOB, and the new helistop, the only other locations where new construction would occu r. In summary, oversight by OSHPD and implementation of accepted geot echnical evaluation techniques and appropriate engineering practices can reduce potential in jury and damage, thereby exposing fewer people and less property to the effects of a major damaging earthquake. Howe ver, predicting seismic events is not possible, nor is it feasible to provide mitigation that can en tirely reduce the potential for injury and damage that can occur during a seismic event. This would th erefore result in a potentially significant impact. Mitigation Measure GEO-1: Project buildings shall be designed and constructed to withstand groundshaking forces of a minor earthquake without damage, or a moderate earthquake without structural da mage, and of a major earthquake without collapse. The New Hospital shall be design ed and constructed to remain standing and functional following a major earthquake, consistent with the requirement of the Seismic Safety Act. The New MOB shall be designed and constructed to meet the stringent requirements of the California Building Code for Commercial Buildings. Each investigation shall include an analysis of expected ground motions at the Project Site from known active faults. The analyses shall be in acco rdance with applicable County ordinances and policies, OSHPD requirements, and consistent w ith the most recent version of the California Building Code, which requires structural design that can accommodate ground accelerations expected from known active faults. Specifically, Im plementation 4.3.1 requires all construction to IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures H. Geology, Soils, and Geohazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.H-17 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 meet the most current, applicable lateral force requirements, and evaluation of all requirements made by the County Building Inspection Depart ment and other State Regulatory Agencies. Therefore, all geotechnical investigations shall determine final design parameters for the walls, foundations, foundation slabs, and surrounding related improvements (utilities, roadways, parking lots and sidewalks). The investigations sha ll be reviewed and approved by a registered geotechnical engineer. All recommendations by th e project engineer, geotechnical engineer, and OSHPD will be included in the final design. Reco mmendations that are applicable to foundation design, earthwork, and site preparation that were prepared prior to or during the project design phase, shall be incorporated in the project. For structures not subject to OSHPD permitting, the final seismic considerations for the site shall be submitted to and approved by the County Building Inspection Department prior to the commencement of the project. Significance After Mitigation: Less than Significant. ______________________ Landslides / Slope Failure Impact GEO-2: The Proposed Project could expose people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects due to landslides or other slope failures. (Less than Significant) Landslide-susceptible areas are characterized by steep slopes and downslope creep of surface materials. Debris flows consist of a loose mass of rocks and other granular ma terial that, if saturated and present on a steep slope, can move downslope . The rate of rock and soil movement can vary from a slow creep over many years to a sudde n mass movement. Landslides occur throughout the state of California, but the density of incide nts increases in zones of active faulting. The Project Site is not located in an area th at has been designated by the CGS as having the potential for landslide movement during a seismic event. However, the Fugro Report noted a geologic study that indicated the presence of a la ndslide and soil creep on the north side of the knoll where the proposed helistop is to be cons tructed. The new helistop will lower the top elevation of the knoll, and future grading ( on and offsite) and construction will reduce the potential for landslides on and around the knoll. Speci fic design criteria have been developed to ensure stable conditions for the future helistop area As a result, since the Project Site is not within a designated area susceptible to landslides, and the localized areas wher e the potential does exist will be altered (to accommodate the relocated he listop) to stabilized existing conditions, the impact would be less than significant. Mitigation: None required. ______________________ IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures H. Geology, Soils, and Geohazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.H-18 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Expansive Soils Impact GEO-3: The Proposed Project would be located on expansive soils that could create substantial risks to life or property. (Less than Significant) The shrink-swell capacity of expansive soils can cause damage to foundations through changes in moisture content of underlying soils. As noted in the Environmental Setting section, the studies conducted by Fugro identified clayey soils at the proposed New Hospital location that have a high to critical expansion potential, and would be classified as \"expansive\" as defined in Section 1802A.3.2 of the 2007 California Building Code (Fugro, 2008). However, as discussed in the Fugro geotechnical evaluation for the Project S ite, standard geotechnical engineering measures would mitigate the potential damage from expansive soils. The design phase of the Proposed Project has incorporated recommendations from the site- specific design-level geotechnical evaluation that identified the presence of expansive soils. The recommendations mitigate the potential hazards asso ciated with expansive soil conditions. Soil sampling and testing has determined the presence and characteristics of potentially compressible soils, the engineering properties of the proposed foundation material, the depth and thickness of soil layers, and the depth to groundwater. Standard engineering practices and common engineering design strategies, such as the use of deep drilled pile foundations, stabilizing agents in soils, and the removal and replacement of problematic topsoil, will be used to address problematic soil conditions on the Project Site. M easures to correct adverse soil conditions that result in ground settlement or uplift due to ground swelling have been considered in the design of the Proposed Project buildings and will be im plemented during construction. All feasible recommendations identified in the geotechnical ev aluations, as consistent with the requirements and standards of the Seismic Safety Act, are in corporated into the Project design specifications and are considered part of the Proposed Project. Therefore, the potential for the Proposed Project to cause substantial risk due to expansive soils on the Project Site is less than significant. Mitigation: None required. ______________________ Unknown Subsurface Structures Impact GEO-4: The Proposed Project could be located in a geologic unit that contains corrosive soils and create hazardous co nditions. (Potentially Significant) Corrosion testing on Site soils conducted by Fugro during the November 2007 investigation indicated that \"moderately corrosive\" to \"corrosive\" soils are present at the site and recommended that a corrosion engineer evaluate the corrosion potential of the soil environment on buried metal, on buried concrete structures, and steel pipe coated with cement-mortar. In an area where high corrosion potential exists in soils, these conditions present a potential for subsurface structures to lose competency and eventually become a hazard. Implementation of the following mitigation measures would reduce the potential impact regarding corrosive soils to less than significant. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures H. Geology, Soils, and Geohazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.H-19 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Mitigation Measure GEO-4: The Project Sponsor shall implement all recommendations in the 2007 geotechnical study prepared by Fugro for the Proposed Project to minimize the effects of corr osive soils. This specifically includes (1) consultation by a qualified corrosion engineer during any subsequent geotechnical studies conducted on the Project Site, and (2) using suitable coatings, wrappings, or seals, as recommended by the corrosion engi neer, to protect subsurface structures. Significance After Mitigation: Less than Significant. ______________________ Construction Impacts on Soil Erosion Impact GEO-5: Construction of the Proposed Project would not result in substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil. (Less than Significant) Construction activities such as backfilling, grading, and compaction can expose areas of loose soil that, if not properly stabilized, could expe rience soil loss and erosion by wind and storm water runoff. Concentrated water-induced erosion, if not managed or controlled, can eventually result in significant soil loss. As discussed for Impact HYD-1 (in Section IV.I, Hydrology and Water Quality ), construction activities of the Proposed Project would comply with standard County practices and all regulations that address erosion and sediment c ontrol, and minimize the resulting effects of erosion on water quality. These requirements in clude adherence to the existing General Construction Permit requirements (pursuant to the NPDES General Permit for Discharges of Stormwater Runoff Associated with Construction Activity), which are specifically aimed at reducing impacts on surface waters that may occu r due to construction activities. Specifically, the Permit requires preparation of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) that would incorporate best management practices (BMPs) to control degradation of surface water by preventing soil erosion, controlling and ensuring careful handling of chemicals and fuels during construction, and controlling the discharge of pollutants from construction areas. Other requirements include compliance with provisions of the Alameda County Grading, Erosion, and Sediment Control Ordinance; Stormwater Mana gement and Discharge Control Ordinance; and Watercourse Protection Ordinance. Given the ex tent of existing regu lations and mandated compliance that the Proposed Project would be re quired to comply with that address reducing or avoiding the erosion of disturbed soils during construction activities, the impact would be less than significant. ______________________ IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures H. Geology, Soils, and Geohazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.H-20 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Cumulative Impacts Impact GEO-6: The Proposed Project, when combined with other past, present and reasonably foreseeable future projects in the vici nity, could potentially injure people and cause collapse or structural damage to exis ting and proposed structures. (Less than Significant) Geographic Context and Other Projects The geographic context considered for the cumu lative geology and geohazards impacts includes the surrounding area that could have the potential to combine with the Project area and result in cumulative geologic hazards impacts. Given the natu re of the potential impacts analyzed for this topic, the geographic scope would include the CV Central Business District Subareas 4 through 5, and the residential and mixed use areas extending north, east and west of the Project Site for approximately three blocks (the distance to Castro Valley Boulevard). Past projects in this area are included in the existing setting described in this section and in Chapter III, Project Description. Present project s would include any projects currently under construction within the geographic context area. None are identified as of preparation of this EIR. Reasonably foreseeable future projects are tho se that could be developed or occur in the geographic context area by 2030. Discussion As discussed above, the Proposed Project would result in significant project-level impacts related to potentially hazardous seismic conditions, which would be reduced to less than significant. Although the entire Bay Area is within a seismically -active region with a wide range of geologic and soil conditions, these conditions can vary wi dely across the area, making the cumulative context for potential impacts resulting from expos ing people and structures to related risks one that is more localized or even site-specific. Development of the Proposed Project, with implementation of the conditions of approval identified above, would have potentially signifi cant impacts related to exposing persons or structures to geologic, soils, or seismic hazards . The number of people living and working in the area of the Project Site as a result of foreseeable development will increase incrementally, thus exposing additional people to seism ic and geological hazards. (The on-site population associated with the Proposed Project is not anticipat ed to substantially increase, as shown in Table III-1 in Chapter III, Project Description.) However, all pr ojects would be required to adhere to the County Building Code and Grading Ordinance requirement s, all other related and applicable County ordinances and policies, and the hospital project would be required to comply with all OSHPD requirements. The Proposed Project, in particular, would upgrade or demolish older buildings that are seismically unsafe, and would construct new bu ildings to stricter building codes, specifically those intended to heighten seismic safety of me dical buildings. All construction phases of this Proposed Project, and other foreseeable projects in the area, would be required to implement the principles for geologic and seismic hazards, and adhe re to all federal, state, and local programs, requirements and policies pertaining to building safety and construction permitting. Therefore, IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures H. Geology, Soils, and Geohazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.H-21 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 the Proposed Project, combined with other foresee able development in the area, would not result in a cumulatively significant impact by exposing pe ople or structures to risk related to geologic hazards, soils, and/or seismic conditions. Mitigation: None required. ______________________ References - Geology, Soils, a nd Geohazards Alameda County, Draft General Plan for Castro Valley, January 2007.

IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-1 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 I. Hydrology and Water Quality This section describes existing hydrologic cond itions in the project vicinity and presents applicable regulations that pertain to surface water and groundwater hydrology, flooding, and water quality. This section also discusses the cha nges in hydrology and water quality that could result from construction and operation of the proj ect and identifies potential project impacts and appropriate measures to reduce or eliminate significant impacts. Setting This section describes the existing regional and local surface water and groundwater hydrology and water quality conditions in the vicinity of the Proposed Project). Surface Water Regional Hydrologic Setting Castro Valley is located in unincorporated Alam eda County in the southern San Francisco Bay hydrologic region. Creeks, streams, and other surf ace water drainages in the area originate in the upland areas of Mount Diablo and its foothills, gene rally to the north and east of Castro Valley, and flow downslope toward the Bay. Drainage pa tterns within Castro Valley are shaped by the region's topography, which is steeper in the foot hills of the Diablo Range and gradually flattens onto an alluvial plain. Castro Valley lies in the San Lorenzo Creek Wate rshed, which includes Chabot, Castro Valley, Cull, and Crow Creeks. These creeks flow south from the foothills thorough Castro Valley and converge near the southern boundary of the Castro Valley Urban Area before entering San Lorenzo Creek, which flows west to San Franci sco Bay. Other surface water bodies in the project area include Sulfur Creek, San Leandro Creek, Lake Chabot, and Cull Canyon and Don Castro Reservoirs. Portions of creek segments within Castro Valley ar e natural, concrete-lined, earthen, or enclosed in conduit underground (i.e., in culverts). San Lorenzo Creek, Chabot Creek, and Castro Valley Creek have been modified over the years to ade quately convey flows to avoid or reduce flooding. Several ponds, which serve as detention basins, have been created by dams on Cull and San Lorenzo Creeks. Natural ponds also may occur w ithin some of the creeks, such as the unnamed tributaries to San Lorenzo Creek. Chabot Creek, which is enclosed in conduit beneath Lake Chabot Road, flows through Castro Valley adj acent to the eastern boundary of the Project Site. Local Hydrologic Setting Site topography is characterized by the low gently sloping ridge on which the site is located. The ridge generally trends northwest-s outheast, with drainage genera lly flowing to the northeast and southwest. However, site topography , and consequently drainage, varies locally within the Project Site. Site elevations range from approximately 170 feet above mean sea level (msl) near the IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-2 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 southeastern corner of the Project Site to a pproximately 235 msl at the knoll where the proposed helistop would be located. Elevations near the Existing Hospital range from approximately 190 feet msl along the south side of the building to approximately 210 feet msl along the north side. The site is highly develope d; buildings and paved areas (e.g., parking lots and roads) cover approximately 75 percent of the site and landscap ed areas the remaining 25 percent. There are no streams located on the Project Site; as noted above , Chabot Creek flows within a conduit beneath Lake Chabot Road immediately to the east of the Project Site. Flooding Castro Valley lies in Flood Zone 2 of the Alameda County Flood Control and Conservation District (ACFCWCD). In general, areas located in topographic lows and in close proximity to shorelines, streams and creeks are prone to floo ding. Flooding could result from dam or reservoir failure and/or storm runoff from upstream waters heds or local areas. Dams and reservoirs in Castro Valley (e.g., on Cull and San Lorenzo Creeks) are relatively small (essentially ponds serving as detention basins, as discussed above) a nd pose less extensive safety hazards due to potential failure than do larger dams in the Count y. The Project Site is outside all areas shown as inundation areas on the dam failure inundation hazard map 1 for Castro Valley (ABAG, 2008). The inundation area of Lake Chabot, the largest reservoir in the project vicinity, is west of the reservoir and northwest of Castro Valley. Flood hazards resulting from stormwater runoff have largely been addressed through flood control proj ects by the ACFCWCD. Most drainage systems are adequate to carry runoff from a 10-year stor m and a 15-year storm. During larger storms, flooding could occur primarily as sheet flow in streets and along stream channels (Alameda County, 1985). Flood zone mapping by the Federa l Emergency Management Authority (FEMA) indicates that Castro Valley is most prone to flooding along Cha bot and Castro Valley Creek in the southern portion of the Castro Valley urban area, south of the Project Site. Areas around the concrete and improved channels of the creeks in the southe rn portion of Castro Valley are designated as 100-year flood plains, 2 and wider and/or more extended linear zones along many of the creeks and closed channels in the northern portion of Castro Valley are designated as areas between the limits of the 100-year flood and 500-year flood. The Chabot Creek channel area adjacent to most of the length of the Project Site is designated as Zone AO, which is defined as areas of 100-year shallow flooding where inundation depths are between one and three feet, but for which no flood hazard factors are determined. The average inundation depth of Zone AO in the Project Site vicinity is two feet. North of Zone AO near the northeastern corner of the Project Site, the Chabot Creek channel is designated as Zone B, which is defined as areas between the limits of the 100-year flood and 500-year flood or areas subject to 100-year flooding with average depths of less than one foot (FEMA, 2000). A small, wedge-shaped portion of the northeastern corner of 1 California state law requires dam owne rs to prepare inundation maps; these maps, which provided the basis for the ABAG dam inundation map cited here, are prepared base d on engineering hydrology and represent the best estimate of where water would flow in the event of total dam failure with a full reservoir (ABAG, 2008). 2 A flood plain is an area ne ar a river or creek that is subject to periodic flooding. A \"100-year flood\" is the flood that has a 1 in 100 chance (or 1 percent chance) of occurring in any given year (USGS, 1996) . Similarly, the \"500-year flood\" is the flood that has a 1 in 500, or 0.2 pe rcent, chance of occurring in any given year. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-3 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 the Project Site (measuring approximately 0 to 75 feet wide and approximately 300 feet long) lies within these two designated flood zones. Other cr eeks and culverts in the area could experience localized flooding during large storm events. Surface Water Quality Both point and nonpoint pollutant sources discharge pollutants into the creeks in Castro Valley. A point source is any discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance (e.g., a pipe discharge) of pollutants to a water body from such sources as industrial facilities or wastewater treatment plants. Nonpoint source pollution does not have a single, identifiable discharge point but instead comes from many diffuse sources. Point sources in Castro Valley include dischar ges through pipelines and other discharges that drain into creeks. These are permitted discharges that are subject to prohibitions, water quality requirements, periodic monitoring, annual reporti ng, and other regulatory agency requirements designed to protect the overall water quality of the creeks and ultimately San Francisco Bay. Nonpoint sources include stormwater runoff from land that contains, for example, petroleum from parking lots, fertilizers and pesticides from farmi ng operations and urban r esidential gardens, and sediment from soil erosion. San Lorenzo Creek is listed as impaired for the pollutant diazinon from urban runoff and storm sewers (Regional Water Quality Control Board [RWQCB], 2003a), which indicates the flow of pesticides from agri cultural and urban lands into the creek through runoff and storm sewer lines. Groundwater Castro Valley is underlain by the Castro Valley groundwater basin (No. 2-8) within the San Francisco Bay hydrologic region. The basin, which is dog-leg shaped and approximately three square miles in area, is bounded on the east by San Lorenzo Creek and on the west by the Hayward Fault; the basin extends from Lake Chabot in the north to the intersection of Jackson Street with U.S. Highway 238 in the south. San Lorenzo Creek and its tributaries principally drain the basin and discharge to San Francisco Bay. Th e principal water bearing units within the basin are Pleistocene alluvial deposits including clays, silts, sands, and gravels. Groundwater quality in the basin is characterized by bicarbonates with calcium and sodium as the predominant cations. Uses of the groundwater should generally be r estricted to non-potable purposes (DWR, 2004). Natural recharge to the basin occurs principa lly as seepage from streams that drain the upland areas and by direct percolation of precipitation (DWR, 2004). Castro Valley, Crow Canyon, and Cull Canyon are free groundwater areas that are replen ished by direct infiltration and percolation of rainfall (approximately 18 to 24 inches annually) and stream flow excesses of applied irrigation water and by subsurface inflow from adjacent foothills. These groundwater areas form the principal sources of recharge for the confined groundwater area of the East Bay Plain. Data on the number and yield of wells in the Castro Valle y area are limited; the very few existing wells are principally domestic (Alameda County, 1985). The California Department of Water Resources Water Data Library provides access to groundwater level monitoring data. However, IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-4 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 no water level data from wells with in the Castro Valley urban area are provided. Water level data from the nearest well in the project vicinity (lo cated in the adjacent East Bay Plain groundwater basin), approximately one mile southwest of the Project Site, indicate groundwater levels ranging from approximately 15 to 35 feet below ground surface (DWR, 2008). Regulatory Framework Several federal, state, and local agencies regulate activities that could affect hydrological and water quality features in the project area. This section describes the regulatory framework that would apply to the Proposed Project. Federal Under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) of 197 7, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) seeks to restore and maintain the chemi cal, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters. The statute employs a variety of regulatory and non-regulatory tools to reduce direct pollutant discharges into waterways, fina nce municipal wastewater treatment facilities, and manage polluted runoff. The CWA authori zes the US EPA to implement water quality regulations. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program under the CWA controls water pollution by regula ting point and nonpoint sources that discharge pollutants into \"waters of the U.S.\" California has an approved state NPDES program. The US EPA has delegated authority for NPDES pe rmitting to the California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), which has nine regi onal boards. The San Francisco Bay RWQCB regulates water quality in the project area. Section 303(d) of the CWA requires that each state identify water bodies or segments of water bodies that are \"impaired\" (i.e., not meeting one or more of the water quality standards established by the state). These waters are identified in the Section 303(d) list as waters that are polluted and need further atten tion to support their beneficial uses. Once the water body or segment is listed, the state is required to est ablish Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for the pollutant causing the conditions of impairment. TMDL is the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet wate r quality standards. Typically, TMDL is the sum of the allowable loads of a single pollutant fro m all contributing point and nonpoint sources. The intent of the Section 303(d) list is to identify water bodies that require future development of a TMDL to maintain water quality. In accordance with Section 303(d), the San Fran cisco Bay RWQCB has identified impaired water bodies within its jurisdiction, along with the pollu tant or stressor responsible for impairing the water quality. In the San Francisco Bay region, the RWQCB has designated the South Basin of San Francisco Bay, which includes the Project S ite, as an impaired water body. Pollutants that contribute to this impairment are chlordane, DDT, diazinon, dieldrin, and selenium (RWQCB, 2003a). As noted above San Lorenzo Creek is liste d as impaired for diazinon (RWQCB, 2003a). IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-5 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 State The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act authorizes the SWRCB to adopt statewide water quality control plans. The purpose of the plans is to establish water quality objectives for specific water bodies. The act also authorizes National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program under the CWA, which establishes water qua lity requirements for discharges to waters of the state. Most of the implementation of SWRCB's responsibilities is delegated to the nine regional boards. Under the NPDES program, the San Francisco Bay RWQCB has established permit requirements for stormwater runoff for the project area (see discussion below). Under the California Toxics Rule, the US EPA has pr oposed water quality criteria for priority toxic pollutants for inland surface waters , enclosed bays, and estuaries. These federally-promulgated criteria create water quality sta ndards for California waters. The California Toxics Rule satisfies CWA requirements and protects publ ic health and the environment. The US EPA and the SWRCB have the authority to enforce these standards. However, because the Proposed Project would not discharge toxic pollutants directly into inland surf ace waters, such as San Lorenzo Creek, or to San Francisco Bay, the California Toxics Rule would not apply to the project. The San Francisco Bay RWQCB is responsible for the protection of beneficial uses and the water quality of water resources within the San Franci sco Bay region. The San Francisco Bay RWQCB administers the NPDES stormwater permitting program and regulates stormwater in the San Francisco Bay region, which includes the Project S ite. Project applicants are required to apply for a NPDES permit for discharges associated with construction activities. Alameda County and ACFCWCD are permittees under the NPDES Muni cipal Stormwater Permit for the Alameda Countywide Clean Water Program (ACCWP) (see below for detailed discussion). The Proposed Project would be required to comply with the permit requirements. Construction Permitting Construction activities disturbing one acre or mo re are regulated by the RWQCB and are subject to the permitting requirements of the NPDES General Permit for Discharges of Storm Water Runoff Associated with Construction Activit y (General Construction Permit). The RWQCB established the General Construction Permit program to reduce surface water impacts from construction activity. The Proposed Project would be required to comply with the current NPDES permit requirements to control stormwater discharges from the construction site (see discussion under \"Alameda County,\" below). The General C onstruction Permit requires the preparation and implementation of a Storm Water Pollution Preven tion Plan (SWPPP) for construction activities. The SWPPP must be prepared before construction begins, and in certain cases, before demolition begins. The SWPPP must include specifications for best management practices (BMPs) that would need to be implemented during project construction. BMPs are measures that are undertaken to control degradation of surface water by preventing soil erosion or the discharge of pollutants from the construction area. Additio nally, the SWPPP must describe measures to prevent or control runoff after construction is co mplete and identify procedures for inspecting and maintaining facilities or other project elemen ts. Required elements of a SWPPP include: 1) Site description addressing the elements and ch aracteristics specific to the Project Site IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-6 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 2) Descriptions of BMPs for erosion and sediment controls 3) BMPs for construction waste handling and disposal 4) Implementation of approved local plans 5) Proposed post-construction controls 6) Non-stormwater management Examples of typical construction BMPs include sc heduling or limiting activities to certain times of year, installing sediment barriers such as silt fence and fiber rolls, maintaining equipment and vehicles used for construction, tracking controls such as stabilizing entrances to the construction site, and developing and implementing a spill prevention and cleanup plan. Non-stormwater management measures include inst alling specific discharge controls during certain activities, such as paving operations, vehicle and equipment wa shing and fueling. The RWQCB has identified BMPs in the California Stormwater Best Manage ment Practice Handbooks (California Stormwater Quality Association [CASQA], 2003) to effectively reduce degradation of surface waters to an acceptable level. The NPDES permit of the Al ameda Countywide Clean Water Program covers unincorporated portions of Alameda County, incl uding Castro Valley. Any proposed development or grading activities would be required to comply with the permit requirements to control stormwater discharges from th e construction site (see Alam eda County discussion below). Excavation and trenching activities in areas with shallow groundwater require dewatering (the removal of groundwater by pumping) and would be subject to RWQCB construction dewatering permit requirements. Dewateri ng operations are regulated under state requirements for stormwater pollution prevention and control. Di scharge of non-stormwater from a trench or excavation that contains sediments or other po llutants to sanitary sewer, storm drain systems, creek beds (even if dry), or receiving waters is prohibited. Discharge of uncontaminated groundwater from dewatering is a conditionally exempted discharge by the RWQCB. However, the removed water could potentially be contaminat ed with chemicals released from construction equipment or sediments from excavation. Therefore, disposal of dewatering discharge requires permits either from the RWQCB for discharge to surface creeks and groundwater or from Alameda County for discharge to storm or sanitary sewers. The discharge of groundwater generated during dewatering from the Project Site to the sanitary sewer or storm drain system would require authorization of and required pe rmits from the Alameda County Public Works Agency. The discharge of groundwater resulting from dewatering operations would also require a NPDES Permit or a waiver (exemption) from the RWQCB, which would establish discharge limitations for any specific chemicals known to existing in the dewatering flows. Basin Plan The San Francisco Bay RWQCB prepared the San Francisco Bay Basin (Region 2) Water quality Control Plan (\"Basin Plan\") for San Francisco Bay (RWQCB, 2007a).3 The Basin Plan describes 3 The first comprehensive Basin Plan for the San Fran cisco Bay Region was adopted in 1975; subsequent major revisions were adopted in 1982, 1986, 1992, 1995, 2002, and 200 4. The current revision of the plan was adopted in 2007 (RWQCB, 2007). IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I.

Local Alameda County Zone 2 of the ACFCWCD is responsible for mainta ining drainage facilities in Castro Valley. The Project Sponsor would be required to comply with the drainage-related requirements of ACFCWCD during construction and operation of the project. The Alameda County Public Works Agency (ACPWA) Grading and Permits Division administers the following ordinances (ACPWA, 2004): Floodplain Management Ordinance: This or dinance regulates development within areas designated as flood hazard zones by the Fe deral Emergency Management Agency. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-8 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Grading, Erosion, and Sediment Control Ordinance: The purpose of this ordinance is to control cuts and fills on private property, especially in order to limit sedimentation of county stormdrains and flood control system. Stormwater Management and Discharge Contro l Ordinance: This ordinance provides the regulations for discharges into the County stormdrain system and includes provisions of stormwater permits. The ordinance establish es procedures and controls pursuant to and consistent with requirements of the federal Clean Water Act. Watercourse Protection Ordinance: This or dinance regulates development within and adjacent to natural bodies of water on private property. Since the Project Site does not include natural bodies of water this ordinan ce would not apply to the Proposed Project. Alameda Countywide Clean Water Program The Alameda Countywide Clean Water Program (ACC WP) consists of 17 participating agencies, including Alameda County and ACFCWCD, that cooperatively comply with RWQCB requirements to prevent stormwater pollution and protect creeks, wetlands, and San Francisco Bay. The Program has worked since 1991 to edu cate the public about stormwater pollution and its prevention; eliminate illegal dumping and monitor water quality; and by promoting BMPs, reduce the amount of polluted runoff (ACCWP, 2008). In Castro Valley, the ACCWP administers the stormwater program to meet the CWA requireme nts by controlling pollution in the local storm drain sewer systems. The ACCWP's Stormwater Qua lity Management Plan (SQMP) (ACCWP, 2003) describes the ACCWP's approach to reducing stormwater pollution. In conjunction with the stormwater discharge permit issued by the RWQCB (discussed below), the SQMP is designed to enable the ACCWP member agencies to meet CWA require ments. The SQMP provides a framework for protection and restoration of cree ks and watersheds in Alameda County in part through effective and efficient implementation of appropriate control measures fo r pollutants. The SQMP includes the following major program components: regul atory compliance, watershed assessment, monitoring and special studies, public informat ion and participation, municipal maintenance activities, new development and constructi on controls, illicit discharge controls, and industrial/commercial disc harge controls. The SQMP also addre sses specific pollutants of concern and describe performance stan dards being implemented by member agencies (ACCWP, 2003), including performance standards for construction si te controls that would apply to the Proposed Project. The performance standards are applicable for all construction activities, including clearing, grading, and excavation that result in the cumulative disturbance of 10,000 or greater square feet of land that would discharge stormwat er to the municipally-owned st orm drain system. Measures and policies to control stormw ater quality include the following (ACCWP, 2003): documenting permanent erosion and stormwat er quality controls, controls during construction, and operation and maintenance of structural controls in the conditions of approval for projects; agencies will select BM Ps from appropriate guidance materials in implementing this measure. implementing design guidelines and practices th at incorporate water quality protection measures for both public and private projects IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-9 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Major tasks associated with new development a nd construction identified in the SQMP includes identifying how to implement source, Project Site design, post-construction stormwater treatment and hydromodification4 controls and helping to do so (ACCWP, 2003). In 2005 the ACCWP submitted its Hydrogra ph Modification Management Plan (HMP) (ACCWP, 2005) to RWQCB. The HMP was prepared in partial fulfillment of requirements in ACCWP's 2003 NPDES municipal stormwater discharge permit, and describes the proposed approach of ACCWP's member agencies to manage increases in the frequency and duration of flow magnitude and runoff volume when those increases result from increased impervious surface area at large development and redevelopment sites and are likely to increase erosion of creek beds and banks, increase silt pollution, or result in other impacts to bene ficial uses. The HMP identifies areas subject to hydromodification management (HM) measures; describes design requirements for enhanced HM; outlines the review and repor ting procedures for municipalities; and includes special HM provisions in specific jurisdictions. In 2007 the RWQCB issu ed an amendment to ACCWP's NPDES permit to approve and incorpor ate key provision of the HMP (RWQCB Order No. R2-2007-025, described below). Applicable NPDES Permit Requirements On February 19, 1997, by Order 97-030, the San Francisco Bay RWQCB issued a NPDES permit for waste discharge requirement s (Permit No. CAS0029831) to the ACCWP, which includes Alameda County and the ACFCWCD. This permit was modified by Order No. 99-049 on July 21, 1999, and reissued by the RWQCB on February 19, 2003 (by Order R2-2003-021) (RWQCB, 2003b). In 2007 the RWQCB approved an amendment to Provision C.3.f, Limitation on Increase of Peak Stormwater Runoff Discharge Rates (by Order R2-2007-0025, adopted March 14, 2007) (RWQCB, 2007b). Construction activities associated with the Propo sed Project would be subject to the NPDES permit requirements for stormwater management and discharges. The permit also incorporates updated state and federal requirements related to the quantity and quality of post-construction stormwater discharges from new development and redevelopment projects. The SQMP (discussed above) contains performance standards to a ddress these requirements. The SQMP serves as a framework for identification, assignment, and impl ementation of practices of control measures or BMPs. Provision C.3 of the NPDES permit governs storm drain systems and regulates post-construction stormwater runoff. The provision requires ne w development and redevelopment projects to incorporate treatment measures and other appropria te source control and site design features to reduce the pollutant load in stormwater discharg es and to manage runoff flows. \"Redevelopment\" is defined as a project on a previously developed site that results in the addition or replacement of impervious surface. According to Provision C.3, the Proposed Project falls under the \"significant redevelopment projects\" category under \"Group 1 Pr ojects.\" A significant redevelopment project is defined as a project on a previously developed site that results in the addition or replacement of 4 Hydromodification is alteration of the na tural flow of water through a landscape. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-10 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 a total of 43,560 square feet (one acre) or more of impervious surface.5 In the case where a significant redevelopment project would result in an increase of, or replacement of, more than 50 percent of the impervious surface of a previ ously existing development, and the existing development was not subject to stormwater treatment measures, the permit requires that the entire project be included in the treatment measure design. The Proposed Project would qualify as \"significant\" according to these provisions, since it would replace or create more than one acre of impervious surface (the footprint of the New Hosp ital alone is more than an acre -- 52,606 square feet compared to 43,569 square feet per acre), and the Proposed Project also involves replacing more than 50 percent of the previously existing development. Therefore the permit requires that treatment measures be implemented for the entire Project Site, along with permit requirements for appropriate source control and site design me asures (RWQCB, 2003). Numeric size criteria are required for all pollutant treatment systems fo r Group 1 and Group 2 projects (Alameda County, 2005). Provision C.3. also includes the following conditions, as applicable (ACCWP, 2003): Implement site design/landscape characteristics, as feasible, that maximize infiltration (where appropriate), provide re tention or detention, slow runoff, and minimize impervious land coverage, so that post-deve lopment pollutant loads from the site have been reduced to maximum extent possible, and For new and redevelopment projects that di scharge directly to water bodies listed as impaired (under section 303(d) of CWA), ensure that post-project runoff does not exceed pre-project levels for such pollutants, th rough implementation of the control measures addressed in the C.3 provision, to the maxi mum extent practicable. Because the Proposed Project would not discharge directly to a lis ted impaired water body, this provision would not apply. The RWQCB's 2007 amendment to Provision C.3.f of the ACCWP NPDES Permit (Order No. R2-2007-0025) establishes a Hydromodification Management (HM) Standard; identifies HM control areas; identifies projects to which the re vised provision applies; and provides for certain exemptions. The amendment requires the follo wing of applicable new development and redevelopment projects: Hydromodification Management (HM) Standard: Projects shall not cause an increase in the erosion potential of receiving streams compar ed to pre-project (existing) conditions. Increases in runoff flow and volume are to be managed so that post-project runoff does not exceed estimated pre-project rates and durations in areas where such increased flow and or volume is likely to cause increased potential fo r erosion of creek beds and banks, silt pollutant generation, or other adverse impacts to beneficial uses due to increased erosive force. Applicable projects located in designated HM control areas shall be required to meet the HM Standard. The Project Site is located in a designated HM control area identified as \"Special Consideration - San Lorenzo a nd Alameda Creeks\" on the \"HMP Susceptibility Map\" included as Attachment A of Order No. R2-2007-0025. The map legend defines special consideration areas as \"upstream areas where hydromodification impacts are of concern due to factors such as bank instability, sensitive habitat, or restoration projects.\" 5 The other category, \"Group 2,\" covers projects that create or replace 10, 000 square feet or more of impervious surface. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-11 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 The HM standard and all associated requiremen ts apply in the designated areas and projects in these areas may be subject to additional agency reviews related to hydrologic habitat, or other watershed-specific concerns. \"Applicable projects\" required to meet the HM Standard are defined as new development or redevelopment projects in which the comb ined amounts of impervious surface created and replaced totals one acre or more, unless the project falls into one of the exempt categories. A redevelopment projects may be exempted from the HM Standard if the area of impervious surface does not increase and a comp arison of the project design to the pre- project condition demonstrates that the project would not increase the efficiency of drainage collection and conveyance facilities co mpared to the pre-project condition. The pre-and post-project comparison must include specified information. Local Plans and Policies Castro Valley General Plan (1985) The Castro Valley General Plan (General Plan ) (Alameda County, 1985), adopted by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors in 1985, is the currently adopted general plan for the project area. This section identifies the releva nt goals, objectives, and principles related to hydrology and water quality of the adopted general plan. A. General Development Policies Goal 3 : Protection of and Mitigation of Impacts of Urban Development on Environmental Sources Objective 3: To conserve and protect significant environmental, energy, archaeological, and historic resources; to minimize the adve rse and disruptive effects of development on these resources. Principle 3.3 : The quality of surface runoff from urba n development should be controlled to minimize contamination of surface waters (including creeks, streams, lakes, reservoirs, San Francisco Bay and its estuaries) and groundwaters. Principle 3.6 : Conservation of water should be encouraged in existing and new development. Goal 4 : Reduction of and Mitigation of Impacts of Urban Development on Environmental Hazards. Objective 4: To minimize the potentially adverse effects of environmental hazards on development; to ensure that all new developm ent is located, designed, and constructed to minimize risks of property damage, personal injury, and loss of life resulting from an earthquake, landslide, flood, or major wildland or urban fire. Principle 4.17: New structures located within the flood fringe of a one-hundred year flood plain should be flood-proofed and should be located and designed to allow unrestricted flow of flood waters. New structures should no t be permitted in the floodway of a 100 year flood plain. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-12 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Principle 4.18: Surface runoff from new development should be controlled by on-site measures including but not limited to: a) struct ural controls and b) restrictions regarding changes in topography, removal of vegetation, creation of impervious surfaces, and periods of construction, such that the need for offs ite flood and drainage control improvements is minimized and such that runoff from the deve lopment will not result in downstream flood hazards. D. Public Utilities, Facilities, and Service Policies Objective 9: To Provide adequate and appropriate water supply, wastewater, and solid waste collection, treatment, and disposal, storm drainage and flood control, and electric and gas power to meet the needs of Castro Va lley residents and businesses. To minimize the adverse effects which the operations of these utilities may have on adjoining uses and environmental quality. Principle 9.1 Flood control improvements should be undertaken to eliminate flooding problems in the central area of the Castro Valley community. Principle 9.4 Flood control and drainage facilities should be adequately maintained in order to maintain and/or improve their carrying capacity. Draft Castro Valley General Plan Update (2007) Alameda County is currently in the process of updating the General Plan . Therefore, this section also reviews potentially applicab le goals and policies of the Draft Castro Valley General Plan Update (Alameda County, 2007). This draft plan is currently undergoing environmental review and has not been adopted. Flooding Goal 10.2 : Provide surface drainage and flood protection facilities to protect the public safety and maintain and improve wate r quality to comply with all applicable requirements and protect the natural environment. Policy 10.2-1 : Protection of Water Quality. Protect water quality, including groundwater recharge and surface water surfaces, from contamination. Policy 10.2-3 : Downstream Flooding Risks. Lower the risk for downstream flooding by reducing impervious surfaces on new devel opment and protecting existing draining patterns. Action 10.2-1 : Compliance with the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board. Continue to ensure that all construc tion and development activities comply with all applicable San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) and RWQCB Water Quality Certification stormwat er and water quality requirements, which may include but not be limited to, prepar ation and implementation of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) and implem entation of effective best management practices (BMPs) for applicable cons truction and development activities. Action 10.2-5 : Restrictions on Timing of Grading and Construction Activities. Restrict grading and construction activities to dry peri ods, to the extent feasible. During the wet weather period from mid-October through mid-March, require additional erosion prevention measures when issuing grading pe rmits; except where Public Works Agency IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-13 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 and Flood Control District emergency and ma intenance action necessary to protect life and property is required. Action 10.2-6 : Requirements for Dewater Activities. Where applicable, ensure that all construction and development activities a dhere to all permitting and regulatory requirements regarding dewatering activities. Specifically, all activities shall comply with state requirements for stormwater pollution prevention and control and obtain a construction dewatering permit or waiver from the RWQCB prior to disposal of dewatering discharge for discharge to surface creeks and groundwater. Action 10.2-7 : Nonpoint Source Pollutants. Protect surface water quality by reducing the release of nonpoint source pollutants into storm drain systems and waterways. Action 10.2-8 : Alameda Countywide Clean Water Program Stormwater Quality Management Plan. Continue to protect su rface water quality by complying with the Alameda Countywide Clean Water Program (ACCWP) Stormwater Quality Management Plan and require individual projects to prepare site-specific plans to demonstrate incorporation of appropriate source controls, site design strategies, and post-construction stormwater treatments to control and manage stormwater runoff and quality. Action 10.2-9 : Surface Runoff. Incorporated into all site development review materials to the public, information regarding models a nd recommended approaches to controlling the quality of surface runoff from urban development. Action 10.2-10 : Compliance with San Francisco Bay RW QCB. Continue to ensure that all new development and redevelopment projects co mply, to the maximum extent practicable, with all applicable San Francisco Bay RWQ CB stormwater and water quality requirements, specifically requirements and recommendations of Provision C.3 regarding post-construction water runoff. Impacts and Mitigation Measures Significance Criteria The project would have a significant impact on the environment with respect to hydrology or water quality if it would: Violate any water quality standards or waste discharge requirements or otherwise degrade water quality; Substantially deplete groundwater supplies or interfere substantia lly with groundwater recharge such that there would be a net deficit in aquifer volume or a lowering of the local groundwater table level (e.g., the production ra te of pre-existing nearby wells would drop to a level that would not support existing land uses or proposed uses for which permits have been granted); Substantially alter the existing drainage patte rn of the Project Site or area (including through the alteration of the course of a creek, river, or stream, or by increasing the rate or amount of flow of a creek, river, or stream) in a manner that would result in substantial erosion, siltation, or flooding, either on or off the site; IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-14 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Result in substantial erosion or siltation onsite or offsite that would affect the quality of receiving waters; Create or contribute runoff water that would exceed the capacity of existing or planned stormwater drainage systems or provide substantial sources of polluted runoff; Place housing within a 100-year flood hazard ar ea, as mapped on a federal Flood Hazard Boundary or Flood Insurance Rate Map or other authoritative flood hazard delineation map; Place within a 100-year flood hazard area stru ctures that would impede or redirect flood flows; Expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury, or death involving flooding, including flooding as a result of failure of a levee or dam; or Expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury, or death involving inundation by seiche6, tsunami7, or mudflow. Hydrology and Water Quality Impacts Impact HYD-1: Project construction activities would involve activities that, if not properly managed, could affect stormwater runoff, contri bute to siltation of drainage facilities, and substantially degrade water quality. (Potentially Significant) Project construction would occur over approximately five (or up to 6 years under the Subsequent New MOB Scenario, as detailed in Chap ter III (Project Description) under Development Phasing . Construction activity on the Site is anticipated to begin in 2009 and include activities associated with site preparation (removal of existing stru ctures, removal of contaminated soil material, deposition of clean fill, grading of the site, and construction of necessary infrastructure) and building construction. A variety of equipment woul d be required for the site preparation stage, including bulldozers, grading machines, cranes, and dump trucks, which w ould be responsible for the removal and deposition of cut and fill material on the site. Each phase of construction would involve activiti es that have the potential to degrade water quality. Site clearing and grading activities with excavation and soil stockpiling generate loose, erodible soils that, if not properl y managed, could be washed into surface water by rain or by water used during grading operations or c onstruction site manage ment. Earthmoving and stockpiling and demolition activities would also expo se soil and building material debris to wind effects. Soil erosion and exposure of loose soils or damaged and friable building materials to wind would cause excess sediment loads and silta tion in waterways and could affect the water quality of local creeks, including San Lorenzo Creek and San Francisco Bay, to which site surface drainage ultimately leads. Additionally, construction activities typically involve fuels, 6 Waves occurring in an enclosed or semi-enclosed body of water, such as a lake or bay; they can be caused by changes in atmospheric pressure, winds, currents, tides, or seismic events and, depending on the height of generated waves, can damage shoreline areas. 7 A tsunami is a great sea wave produced by a submarine earthquake or volcanic eruption.

Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-15 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 paints, solvents, and other chemicals that, if not managed properly, could get washed into stormwater and waterways. Unregulated, this would be a significant impact. Consistent with existing requirements for constr uction on sites over one acre, the Project Sponsor would comply with the existing General Cons truction Permit requirements (pursuant to the NPDES General Permit for Discharges of Stormwater Runoff Associated with Construction Activity), which are specifically aimed at reducing impacts on surface waters that may occur due to construction activities. As outlined under the Regulatory Framework discussion above, the Gene ral Construction Permit requires preparation of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) prior to the start of construction activities, and the SWPPP would inco rporate (BMPs to control degradation of surface water by preventing soil erosion, contro lling and ensuring careful handling of chemicals and fuels during construction, a nd controlling the discharge of pollutants from construction areas. Examples of typical construction BMPs include scheduling or limiting activities to certain times of the year, installing sediment barriers such as silt fence and fiber rolls, maintaining equipment and vehicles used for construction, tracking co ntrols such as stabilizing entrances to the construction site, and devel oping and implementing a spill prevention and cleanup plan. Non-stormwater management procedures include in stalling specific discharge controls during the activities such as paving operations, vehi cle and equipment washing and fueling . The Project Sponsor has prepared a Preliminary SWPPP (Greenwood & Moore, Inc., 2008a), which identifies erosion and sediment controls, ma intenance and inspection procedures, and spill prevention and materials management practices to be implemented during project construction, among other elements that the Proposed Project will implement. The Preliminary SWPPP is provided as Appendix G.1 to this EIR. Accord ing to the Preliminary SWPPP, non-stormwater discharges (e.g., discharges from dewatering) are not anticipated for the Project Site. Stormwater controls would be installed pr ior to grading operations and would apply through all phases of project construction. Consistent with existing regulations project c onstruction activities are also required to comply with provisions of the Alameda County Grading, Erosion, and Sediment Control Ordinance; Stormwater Management and Discharge Cont rol Ordinance; and Watercourse Protection Ordinance, as well as any additional specific permits or approvals necessary for specific construction or development activities. Given the level of regulation surro unding construction and the requirements of the Project Sponsor and its contractors to protect surface water sources during project construction, each of the above measures, as well as preparation and implementation of a Final SWPPP as specified in the mitigation measure below, water quality impacts associated with construction activities would be reduced to less than significant. Mitigation Measure HYD-1: (Obtain Coverage Under the Construction General Permit, Including Final Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan) The Project Sponsor shall obtain cover age under the SWRCB Construction General Permit, including implementation of a Final Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-16 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 (Final SWPPP). The Project Sponsor shall ensure that construction practices for the Project comply with practices to prevent water pollution under the provisions of the Construction General Permit. In order to obtain a permit, the Project Sponsor must file a Notice of Intent (NOI) with the SW RCB prior to the start of construction. Pursuant to the requirements of the Construction General Permit, the Project Sponsor shall prepare and implement a Final SWPPP. The Final SWPPP shall be consistent with the terms of the General Permit; the Manual of Standards for Erosion and Sedimentation Control Measures by th e Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG); the Best Management Practices (BMPs) as provided in the California Stormwater Quality Association (CASQA) handbooks; policies and recommendations of the local urban runoff program (Count y of Alameda); and any recommendations from the RWQCB. The Final SWPPP shall incorporate BMPs to reduce the potential for pollutants in runoff waters and to prevent pollutant transport off site during construction activities. Examples of BMPs include, but are not limited to the following: a) Only clear land which will be actively under construction within 6 to 12 months after clearing; b) Minimize new land disturbance during the rainy season, and avoid clearing and disturbing sensitive areas (e.g., slopes a nd natural watercourses) and other areas where Site improvements will not be constructed; c) Provide temporary stabilization of distur bed soils whenever active construction is not occurring on a portion of the Proj ect Site by water spraying or applying dust suppressants and gravel covering of high-traffic areas; provide permanent stabilization during finish grade and landscaping of the Project Site; d) Safely convey runoff from the top of the slope and stabilize disturbed slopes as quickly as possible; e) Delineate the Project Site perimeter to prevent disturbing areas outside the project limits f) Divert upstream run-on safely arou nd or through the construction; g) Runoff from the Project Site shall be free of excessive sediment and other constituents; h) Control tracking at points of ingress to and egress from the Project Site; i) Retain sediment-laden waters from disturbed, active areas within the Project Site; j) Perform activities in a manner to keep potential pollutants from coming into contact with stormwater or being transp orted off site to eliminate or avoid exposure; IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-17 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 k) Store construction, building, and waste ma terials in designated areas, protected from rainfall and contact with stormwater runoff. Dispose of all construction waste in designated areas, and keep stormwater from flowing onto or off these areas; l) Prevent spills and clean up spilled materials. (Also see Mitigation Measures HYD-3 and HYD-4.) Significance after Mitigation: Less than Significant Impact HYD-2: Project excavation activities would not deplete groundwater supplies nor substantially interfere with groundwater re charge or cause contaminated groundwater discharge to contaminate surface water. (Less than Significant) Excavation of soils or underground structur es, such as foundations and utilities, and the construction of new structures with subsurface f oundations or open trenches, can often intercept shallow groundwater and require dewatering (re moval of groundwater by pumping) to lower groundwater levels and dry the area prior to construction. Depending on the nature of construction activities and subsurface water leve ls at a site, groundwater could flow into excavations that extend below the groundwater table. Dewatering of excavations is a common practice employed to reduce groundwater inflow; groundwater is pumped from the excavation to the surface, where it is discharged, typically to either the storm drain or sanitary sewer. Water extracted during dewatering could contain chemi cal contaminants, could be contaminated by chemicals released from construction equipment, or could become laden with sediments as a result of construction activities. Consequently, the discharge of water from dewatering operations has the potential to contaminate surface water. Groundwater in the three-square-mile Castro Valle y basin is recharged through direct natural infiltration and percolation of ra infall (approximately 18 to 24 inches per year), stream flow excesses of applied irrigation water, and by subs urface inflow of the adjacent foothills. Although water level data are not provided for areas within Castro Valley (Department of Water Resources [DWR], 2008) and DWR Groundwater Bulletin 118 states that there is no published information to indicate groundwater levels for the Castro Valley Groundwater Basin (DWR, 2004) it is reasonable to assume that the depth to groundwater may vary throughout the Castro Valley area. The Proposed Project involves removal of ex isting building foundations and subsurface excavation for the New Hospital basement and foundation and other structure foundations and utility lines. Any excavation or construction activiti es at the Project Site that required dewatering would be subject to RWQCB construction dewate ring permit requirements and state requirements for stormwater pollution prevention and control; if dewatering were determined to be necessary the RWQCB would identify appropriate dewatering collection and disposal methods. The Project Sponsor would be required to obtai n appropriate permits for the disposal of dewatering discharge IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-18 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 pursuant to the NPDES permit, either from th e RWQCB for discharge to surface creeks and groundwater, or from the Alameda County Public Works Agency for discharge to storm or sanitary sewers (as discussed under Regulatory Framework, above) and would comply with the specified groundwater discharge requirements. An y dewatering that may be required would be limited in scope and would not deplete groundw ater supplies. If dewatering were required, compliance with permit requirements would ensure that the discharge of collected groundwater would not contaminate groundwater or surface waters. Mitigation: None required. Impact HYD-3: Construction and operation of the Proposed Project would potentially increase releases of nonpoint pollutant runoff from the Project Site. (Potentially Significant) In addition to replacement of the Existing Hospita l, the Proposed Project involves development of new medical office space and increased surface parki ng, which could result in additional nonpoint source pollutant releases in the storm drains or waterways (i.e., surface drainages leading to area creeks and San Francisco Bay, and groundwater). Nonpoint source pollutants do not have a single, identifiable discharge point but are a combined effect from multiple sources collected primarily in urban runoff. As discussed with respect to construction related-impacts, above, construction activities and the use of chemicals and fuels and related materials during construction could cause soil erosion and sedimen tation and allow contaminates to enter the storm drain system and waterways. Once construction is complete, land use activities may also result in increased pollutants entering the storm drains and waterways. Although the to tal impervious surface area at the Project Site would decrease under the Proposed Project compared to the existing site, the area for surface parking would increase (by 23 percent) and th e overall paved area (primarily parking and roadways (would increase by 3 percent). Contam inants that collect on paved areas such as parking lots and roadways include motor vehicle fluids (motor oil, brake fluid, power steering fluid), by-products of brake pad dust from motor vehicles, pesticides and fertilizers. Stormwater runoff can \"wash\" such residues from paved surfaces allowing pollutants to enter the stormwater system, which leads to area streams and San Fran cisco Bay. Pollutants and sediments also enter the system as a result of rainfall on cumulative atmospheric dust collected during non-rainy months on new structures and roadways. The Stormwater Quality Management Plan (2001) prepared by the Alameda County Clean Water Program (ACCWP) contains strategies for contro lling discharge of pollutants from urban runoff flowing into municipal storm drains and waterways. In conjunction with the stormwater discharge permit adopted by the RWQCB, the plan is d esigned to enable the ACCWP member agencies (which includes Castro Valley) to meet Clean Water Act (CWA) requirements. The plan provides a framework for the protection and restoration of creeks and watersheds in Alameda County in part through effective and efficient implementa tion of appropriate control measures. The plan IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-19 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 addresses several program areas including new deve lopment and constructi on controls, controls for specific pollutants of concern, and perform ance standards. Specific tasks include the implementation of source controls, site design, post-construction stormwater treatment and hydromodification controls, as well as public outreach and monitoring efforts. (ACCWP, 2001). The Proposed Project would include implementati on of measures identified in the Clean Water Program, specifically practices to prevent potentia l pollutant sources from coming in contact with rainfall and overland stormwater flows. The Propo sed Project would be required to adhere to ACCWP long-term stormwater controls and standa rds as well as all other existing federal, state and local regulations regarding water quality. The Project Sponsor has prepared a Preliminary Storm Water Control Plan (Greenwood & Moore, 2008b), which identifies stormwater treatment BMPs being planned for the Project Site. The Prel iminary Storm Water Control Plan is provided as Appendix G.2 to this EIR. Measures specified in the Preliminary Storm Wate r Control Plan include vegetated swales and vegetated strips adjacent to parking areas, media filters (sand filters) in parking areas, and flow- through planters and bioretention areas in and adjacent to parking areas (see Figure III-9 , Landscape Site Plan, in Chapter III, Project Description). These BMPs serve both to manage runoff rates and filter pollutants as well as manage runoff rates. Preliminary analysis of the pervious and impervious areas for the Project S ite indicate that hydromodification management (HM) or controls would not be required becau se the amount of post- development impervious surface area is being reduced compared to exis ting conditions, and this conclusion has been verified through modeling the existing and mitigated site designs using the Bay Area Hydrology Model. Alameda County staff reviewed the Preliminary Storm Water Control Plan and preliminary modeling and determined that, based on current site plan characteristics (e.g., amount and location of impervious surfaces), the Propo sed Project would be exempt from HM or stormwater detention, pursuant to provision C.3.f (v)(a), as discus sed further under Impact HYD-4, below. In addition, the Preliminary Storm Water Contro l Plan specifies that landscaping be designed to minimize the need for fertilizers and pesticides and that all accessible storm drain inlets be marked with the caution, \"No Dumping! Drains to Bay.\" Storm drain inlets and pipes would be inspected and maintained as part of a BMP Op eration and Maintenance Plan outlined in the Preliminary Storm Water Control Plan and which he Project Sponsor will finalize and implement upon approval. Given that the overa ll coverage of impervious surface at the Project Site would be reduced, that BMPs would be implemented to tr eat runoff from site parking areas and roadways and other areas of the Project Site, and that the Project Sponsor would be required to adhere to existing regulatory and permit requirements - in cluding preparation and implementation of a Final Storm Water Control Plan, the impact of Project operation on water quality would be reduced to less than significant. Mitigation Measure HYD-3: (Final Storm Water Control Plan - Pollutant Runoff ) The Project Sponsor shall finalize a stormwat er control plan that specifies the specific control and treatment measures to manage st ormwater pollutant runoff as part of the IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-20 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 overall site design. The Final Storm Water Co ntrol Plan shall list potential pollutant sources on the Project Site and corresponding source control measures specified in the current edition of the Stormwater C.3 Handbook ; identify all areas where potential pollutant activities occur will drain to storm water treatment Best Management Practices (BMPs); and identify permanent and operational BMPs to further reduce the potential for pollutants to enter runoff. The Project Sponsor shall submit the Final Storm Water Control Plan (incorporating all requirements of Mitigation Measure HYD-4) to the County and RWQCB for approval, and shall implement the approved Final Storm Water Control Plan throughout the life of the Project, updated a nd revised as necessary. As specified in the Preliminary Storm Water Control Plan (included as Appendix G.2 to the Draft EIR for the Proposed Project), BMPs in the Final Storm Water Control Plan shall address, among others without limitatio n, potential pollutant sources from: a) Potential dumping of standard commercial cleaning supplies or other liquids into storm drain inlets; b) Potential dumping of wash-water or other liquids into storm drain inlets; c) Fertilizers and pesticides used in landscape maintenance; and d) Minor oil and/or gasoline spills in parking lots and service areas. Significance after Mitigation: Less than Significant Impact HYD-4: The Proposed Project would not result in a net increase in impervious surfaces; however, the Proposed Project wo uld alter existing drainage patterns, and inadequate design or sizing of onsite stormwat er treatment systems could result in localized increases in runoff volumes and/or velocities, resulting in flooding impacts and erosion- related water quality impacts. (Potentially Significant) Overall, the Proposed Project would reduce the tota l area of impervious surface within the Project Site and increase the total landscaped area, as shown in Table III-1 of Chapter III, Project Description. Reduction of the amount of impervious surface is recognized as a site design stormwater quality control measure (Alameda County, 2005). As discussed for Impact HYD-3, the Project Sponsor has prepared a Preliminary Storm Water Control Plan\" (Greenwood & Moore, 2008b) that identifies the treatment BMPs that could be incorporated on the construction areas of the Project Site to accommodate runoff from buildings and paved areas to be located throughout the Project Site. The plan is preliminary and does not indicate the number of treatment areas that will be needed, where they would be located, or the assumptions used to make these determinations. Nor does the plan provide calcula tions to demonstrate that a selected BMP is appropriately sized to accommodate and treat runoff from the area the BMP is intended to serve. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-21 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Provision C.3 of the ACCWP NPDES permit governs storm drain systems and regulates post- construction stormwater runoff. As discussed under Regulatory Framework , above, Provision C.3 requires redevelopment projects to incorporate tr eatment measures and other controls to reduce the pollutant load in stormwater discharges and to manage runoff flows. The RWQCB's 2007 revision to the NPDES permit (Order R2-200 7-0025, discussed above) identifies several Hydromodification Management (HM) control ar eas in the county-- including the San Lorenzo Creek watershed within which the Project Site is located. Because the Proposed Project is a \"significant redevelopment project\" as defined by C.3 (as discussed above) and replaces more than 50 percent of the impervious surface area of the entire Project Site, the ACCWP NPDES permit requires that treatment measures apply to the entire Project Site. As discussed above, the HM Standard requires th at a project be designed and managed so that runoff from the project site does not increase the erosion potential of receiving streams and so that post-project runoff does not exceed pre-project rate s and durations in areas where increased flow or volume would cause increased erosi on or other related adverse impact s on the beneficial uses of the receiving waters. Pursuant to provision C.3.f (v )(a), the Proposed Project is expected to be exempted from the HM Standard as it has demonstrated to the County that a comparison of the project design with pre-Project Si te condition shows that the Project will not increase impervious surface and will not increase the efficiency of dr ainage collection and conveyance compared with the pre-project condition. As required, the preliminary comp arison included the following: 1. Assessment of site opportunities and constrai nts to reduce imperviousness and retain or detain site drainage; 2. Description of proposed design features and surface treatments used to minimize imperviousness. 3. Inventory and accounting of existing and proposed impervious areas; and 4. A qualitative comparison of pre-project to post-project efficiency of drainage collection and conveyance that demonstrates that hydrologic s ource controls will be incorporated into the project to the maximum extent practicable. The Preliminary Plan provided in Appendix G.2 includes measures that will ensure the Project will not increase impervious surface and will not increase the drainage collection efficiency compared to existing conditions. These provisions recognize that when the impervious surface area at a site decreases, site modifications can nevertheless increase drainage efficiency and cause impacts on receiving waterways. With implementa tion of the following mitigation measure, the Proposed Project's impact to localized increases in runoff volumes and/or velocities resulting in flooding impacts would be reduced to less than significant. Mitigation Measure HYD-4: (Final Storm Water Control Plan - Runoff Volumes and Flooding ) The Project Sponsor shall finalize a stormwat er control plan that specifies the specific control and treatment measures to manage stormwater runoff as part of the overall site design on the development portion of the Project Site. The Final Storm Water IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-22 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Control Plan shall clearly state assumptions u sed to identify each area to be covered by given treatment measure(s) and include th e calculations used to determine capacity requirements for each treatment/control me asure. Information presented in the Final Storm Water Control Plan shall be consistent with other information on the Project. The Plan shall also incorporate a final hydromodification modeling report and the engineer's statement of compliance of the HM requirements for exception. Calculations shall be prepared consistent with guidance in ACCWP's C.3 Stormwater Handbook and Alameda County requirements. As part of the Final Storm Water Control Plan the Project Sponsor sha ll implement site design/ landscape characteristics, as feasible, that maximize infiltration (where appropriate), provide retention or detention, slow runoff, and minimize impervious land coverage, so that post-development pollutant loads from the site have been reduced to the maximum extent possible. Where feasible, the Proposed Project shall include measures to help reduce the rate and volume of stormwater runoff from the development portion of the Project Site. The Project Sponsor shall submit the Final Storm Water Control Plan (incorporating all requirements of Mitigation Measure HYD-3) to the County and RWQCB for approval, and shall implement the approved Final Storm Water Control Plan throughout the life of the Proposed Pr oject, updated and revised as necessary. As specified in the draft Preliminary Storm Water Control Plan (included as Appendix G.2 to the Draft EIR for the Proposed Project), measures in the Final Storm Water Control Plan to address runoff flow and flooding may include, but would not necessarily be limited to, vegetated swales, vegetated buffers strips, media filters in parking areas, flow through planters, and bioretention areas. Significance after Mitigation: Less than Significant Impact HYD-5: The Proposed Project would not result in flooding as a result of its proximity to a 100-year flood hazard area, or expose people or structures to other substantial risk related to flooding, seiche, ts unami, or mudflow, as well as sea level rise due to climate change. (Less than Significant) Improvements to the Chabot Creek channel w ithin Castro Valley by the ACFCWCD over time has increased capacity to contain anticipated fl ows. As discussed in the setting section above, the Project Site is adjacent to a portion of Chabot Creek (which is culverted and located under Lake Chabot Road) that is designated as an area of 100-year shallow flooding (with an average inundation depth of two feet) (Zone AO), and, near the northern boundary of the Project Site, as an area between the limits of the 100-year flood and 500-year flood or subject to 100-year flooding with average depths less than one f oot (Zone B). Although these two designated flood zones are primarily contained within the limits of the roadway east of the Project Site boundary, a small section of the northeastern corner of the Project Site is located within these designated hallow flood zones. Under the Proposed Project , the existing Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital in the northeastern corner of the Project Site would be demolished and replaced in this area by landscaping and an at-grade parking lot. The proposed new structures (i.e., the IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-23 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 New Hospital and New MOB) would be located upslope from Lake Chabot Road, well to the west of the designated floodplains. Because only a small portion of the Project Site, consisting of a small area of landscaping and parking would be subject to shallow, 100-year (or lower- probability) flooding, the impact due to the proximity of the Project Site to the 100-year flood plain is less-than-significant. The likelihood of flooding in the Castro Va lley area as a result of tsunamis or seiches is negligible: the Project Site is too far from the co ast to be at any risk from a tsunami and if a seiche were to develop on Lake Chabot in response to seismic ground shaking, a remote possibility at best, the amount of water that mi ght be released through over topping, in the direction of the Project Site, would be dissipate d long before reaching the site vicinity. Because the Proposed Project is located well south of the steeper foothills along the north end of Castro Valley, it would not be vulnerable to a mudflow from these areas; refer to Impact GEO-2 of Section IV.H, Geology Soils and Geohazards , regarding the potential for slope failure at the Proposed Project Site. Finally, although the Pr oposed Project proposes a New MOB, the number of hospital beds at the Project Site would decr ease under the Proposed Project and no residential development is proposed. Therefore, the Proposed Project would not expose people or structures to the risk of loss due to flooding, seiche, tsunami, or mudflow. With respect to the potential flooding impacts due to global climate change, the Project Site is located inland (approximately 4.5 miles west of San Francisco Bay) and therefore would not be subject to coastal-area inundation due to potential sea level rise. According to a recent Technical Paper prepared for the Intergovernmental Pane l on Climate Change, \"increased precipitation intensity and variability are projected to increase risks of flooding and drought in many areas. The frequency of heavy precipitation events (or propor tion of total rainfall fro m heavy falls) will be very likely 8 to increase over most areas during the 21st cen tury, with consequences for the risk of rain generated floods,\" (Bates, et al., 2008). Th e Proposed Project structures are located at the higher elevations of the Project Site upslope from the designated floodplains. As discussed above, the only site elements that would be affected by flooding in this area are the proposed parking lot and landscaping. If the projected increases in precipitation intensity and frequency of heavy precipitation events as a consequence of climate change occurred in the Project vicinity, it is likely that ACFCWD would respond by upgrading and increasing the capacity of storm drain facilities, consistent with County policies. No specific information about or projections of precipitation changes or flooding impacts due to climate change on the Project vicinity are available. Given the current uncertainty associated with this potential future consequence of climate change in the Project area, more detailed consideration of this topic would be speculative Mitigation: None required. 8 The paper defines \"very likely\" as having a more than 90 percent probability of oc currence (Bates, et al., 2008). IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures I. Hydrology and Water Quality Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.I-24 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Cumulative Impacts Impact HYD-6: Construction activity and ch anges to the Project Site resulting from the Proposed Project, in conjunction with other foreseeable development in the area, would not result in cumulatively considerable impacts on hydrology and water quality conditions. (Less than Significant) Cumulative Context and Projects The geographic context used for the cumula tive assessment of water quality and hydrology impacts is the South Basin of the San Francisco Bay Basin. The South Basin includes Castro Valley and surrounding areas. Past projects in this area are included in the existing setting described in this section and in Chapter III, Project Description. Present project s would include any projects currently under construction within the geographic context area. None are identified as of preparation of this EIR. Reasonably foreseeable future projects are tho se that could be developed or occur in the geographic context area by 2030. Discussion Assuming concurrent implementation of the Propo sed Project with other reasonably foreseeable future projects in the vicinity, adverse cumula tive effects on hydrology and water quality could include construction impacts related to increas es in stormwater runoff and pollutant loading within the San Lorenzo Creek Watershed and San Francisco Bay. The Proposed Project and other future projects in the unincorporated county and nearby cities would be required to comply with drainage and grading ordinances intended to c ontrol runoff and regulate water quality at each development site. Furthermore, Castro Valley is generally built out with few and relatively small undeveloped parcels that would convert from pe rvious to impervious surfaces. New projects would be required to demonstrate that stor mwater volumes could be managed by downstream conveyance facilities and would not induce flooding . New development projects in Castro Valley and nearby unincorporated areas in the Project vi cinity would also be required to comply with County ordinances and permit conditions re garding water quality and ACCWP NPDES permitting requirements. Therefore, the effect of the Proposed Project on water quality and hydrology, in combination with other foreseeable projects, would be less than significant. Mitigation: None required. IV.

Hazardous Materials and Hazards This section discusses the hazardous materials issu es related to the existence of hazardous materials associated with the Project Site, pr oject construction, and project operations. This section provides an overview of the regulatory settin g that is applicable to health and safety regarding hazardous materials at the Project Site and potential project impacts and appropriate mitigation measures, as necessary. Introduction The Existing Hospital uses hazardous materials and generates hazardous and medical wastes in its operation and maintenance activities and during patie nt care procedures. Materials and waste may be considered hazardous if they are poisonous (toxicity), can be ignited by open flame (ignitability), corrode other materials (corrosivity), or react violently, explode or generate vapors when mixed with water (reactivity). The term \"ha zardous material\" is define d in the State Health and Safety Code (Chapter 6.95, Section 25501[o]) as any material that, because of quantity, concentration, or physical or chemical char acteristics, poses a significant present or potential hazard to human health and safety or to the environment. A hazardous waste, for the purpose of this EIR, is any hazardous material that is abandoned, discarded, or recycled, as defined in the Stat e Health and Safety Code (Chapter 6.95, Section 25125). The transportation, use, and disposal of hazardous materials, as well as the potential releases of hazardous materials to the e nvironment, are closely regulated through many state and federal laws. Medical waste is generated or produced as a re sult of diagnosis, treatme nt, or immunization of human beings or animals, the production or testing of biologicals,1 and can be described as biohazardous waste or a sharps2 waste. Cultures, blood and blood products, tissues, and body parts are all considered medical waste. The transportation and disposal of medical waste is closely regulated under Section 118215 of the California Medical Waste Management Program (CMWMP). Setting Existing Hospital Medical Center Hazardous Chemicals and Waste Table IV.J-1 presents the quantities of the primary, solid, and gaseous chemicals that are currently present at the existing facility and used in quantities greater than about two gallons of liquid or about ten pounds of solid in any year. These chemicals and other materials are primarily 1 The term \"biologicals\" means medici nal preparations made from living orga nisms and their products, including but not limited to, serums, vaccines, antigens and anti-toxins. 2 The term \"sharps waste\" refers to an y device having acute rigid corners, edge s, or proturbences capable of cutting or piercing, including, but not limited to, hypodermic need les and broken glass items (s uch as pipettes and vials) contaminated with biohazardous waste.

Other chemicals are used, but these are generally in smaller quantities. Compressed gases are listed regardless of the quantity used. The Exis ting Hospital facilities store and use petroleum- based fuel in underground storage tanks (USTs ) and above ground storage tanks (ASTs). Hazardous materials are currently used in operati ons and as a consequence, the facility generates hazardous waste. Any hazardous material that is not consumed and can no longer be used is designated as a hazardous waste material. A brea kdown of the current hazardous waste generation is also shown in Table IV.J-1. Phase I Environmental Assessment In July 2008, a Phase I Environmental Site Ass essment was conducted for the Project Site. The assessment included a review of historical uses of the site, current operations, agency environmental databases, and provided conclu sions regarding recognized environmental conditions. The Project Site was part of a ru ral area including residential ranch complexes, chicken farming, and other agricultural uses prio r to the initial construction of the hospital in 1954 (Northgate, 2008). Since 1954, the hospita l has undergone numerous expansions and additions of support buildings (Northgate, 2008) . Recommendations contained within the Phase I report included additional inves tigation of contaminated soils in the area of the former underground storage tanks (discussed below), m onitoring of demolition activities involving excavation for contaminated soils, monitoring of soils beneath the sanitary sewer lines connected to current and former X-ray photoprocessing waste tr eatment areas, preparation of a contingency plan for encountering contaminated soil, uni dentified underground storage tanks, or other subsurface structures, and an evaluation of h azardous building materials prior to demolition. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures J. Hazardous Materials and Hazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.J-3 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Hazardous Building Materials Associated with Demolition Implementation of the Project would include de molition of the eight-story Existing Hospital on the Project Site. Some of these structures are decades old, and like many older buildings, may contain building materials that are considered to be hazardous to people and the environment. These materials include lead-based paint, asbest os, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Prior to the U.S. Environmenta l Protection Agency (US EPA) ba n in 1978, lead-based paint was commonly used on interior and exte rior surfaces of buildings. Old peeling paint has been found to contaminate near surface soil and exposure to resi dual lead has resulted in illness in children. Asbestos is a naturally occurring fibrous material that was extensively used as a fireproofing and insulating agent in building construction before such uses were banned by the US EPA in the 1970s. Asbestos can lead to lung disease by inhaling its tiny fibers. PCBs are or ganic oils that were formerly used primarily as insulators in many ty pes of electrical equipmen t including transformers and capacitors. After PCBs were determined to be a carcinogen in the mid to late1970's, the US EPA banned PCB use in most new equipment and began a program to phase out certain existing PCB-containing equipment. Fluoresce nt lighting ballasts manufactured after January 1, 1978, do not contain PCBs and are required to ha ve a label clearly stating that PCBs are not present in the unit. Additional information about thes e materials is provided in the Regulatory Setting Section below. Underground Fuel Storage Tanks The Project Site formerly contained four underg round fuel storage tanks (USTs) used for the storage of diesel products. In 1991 and 1994, a ll four of these USTs were removed under the oversight of the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) (ACDEH, 1996). Following removal, the surrounding soils a nd groundwater were sampled for the presence of diesel fuel components. The tank pits were overexcavated to remove some of the more obviously contaminated soils. The residual levels of diesel components found in the remaining site soils and groundwater was analyzed by th e ACDEH as a low risk for human health (ACDEH, 1996). No further investigation or remediation was proposed by ACDEH a nd the case was closed. A new 20,000 gallon UST was installed at the Proj ect Site and permitted for operation in 2000. This double-walled fiberglass tank includes seconda ry containment and a continuously operating monitoring system which can detect when a leak first occurs. The tank and monitoring system are permitted through the ACDEH and require periodic t esting to ensure the potential for releases are minimized. Radioactive Materials The current operations of the Project Site incl ude a Nuclear Medicine Department which handles and stores radioactive material. According to adop ted safety rules, the radioactive material is stored in one designated area in lead contai ners. All radioactive waste disposal from the laboratory is conducted by radioactive waste dis posal personnel or following adequate decay to background levels disposed in ordinary refuse. Employees in the department wear radiation detection badges to monitor exposure of radioac tive materials. According to a safety survey IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures J. Hazardous Materials and Hazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.J-4 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 conducted in 2004, the department was operating within safety requirements (Sutter Health Medical Physics Center, 2004). Regulatory Context SMCCV is subject to government health and safety regulations applicable to the transportation, use, and disposal of hazardous materials and bio-medical wastes. This section provides an overview of the regulatory setting that is applicab le to health and safety at the Project Site. Federal Hazardous Materials Management The primary federal agencies with responsibility for hazardous materials management include the US EPA, U.S. Department of Labor Occupa tional Safety and Health Administration (Fed/OSHA), and the U.S. Department of Trans portation (DOT). Federal laws, regulations, and responsible agencies are summarized in Table IV.J-2 and are discussed in detail in this section. State and local agencies often have either paralle l or more stringent regulations than federal agencies. In most cases, state law mirrors or ove rlaps federal law and enforcement of these laws is the responsibility of the state or of a local ag ency to which enforcement powers are delegated. For these reasons, the requirements of the law and its enforcement are discussed under either the state or local agency section. State In January 1996, the California Environmental Pr otection Agency (Cal EPA) adopted regulations implementing a Unified Hazardous Waste and H azardous Materials Management Regulatory Program (Unified Program). The program has six elements: hazardous waste generators and hazardous waste onsite treatment; underground storage tanks; aboveground storage tanks; hazardous materials release response plans and i nventories; risk management and prevention programs; and Unified Fire Code hazardous mate rials management plans and inventories. The plan is implemented at the local level. The Ce rtified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) is the local agency that is responsible for the implem entation of the Unified Program (Cal EPA, 2008). In Castro Valley, the ACDEH is th e designated CUPA for all businesses. Hazardous Materials Management The California Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans and Inventory Law of 1985 (Business Plan Act) requires that any busin ess that handles hazardous materials prepare a business plan, which must include the following: Details, including floor plans, of the facility and business conducted at the site; An inventory of hazardous materials that are handled or stored on site; An emergency response plan; and A safety and emergency response training program for new employees with annual refresher courses IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures J. Hazardous Materials and Hazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.J-5 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 TABLE IV.J-2 FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO HAZARDOUS MATERIALS MANAGEMENT Classification Law or Responsible Federal Agency Description Hazardous Materials Management Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (also known as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) Imposes requirements to ensure that hazardous materials are properly handled, used, stored, and disposed of and to prevent or mitigate injury to human health or the environment in the event that such materials are accidentally released. Hazardous Waste Handling Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) Hazardous and Solid Waste Act Under RCRA, the EPA regulates the generation, transportation, treatment, stora ge, and disposal of hazardous waste from \"cradle to grave.\" Amended RCRA in 1984, affirming and extending the \"cradle to grave\" system of regulating hazardous wastes. The amendments specifically prohibit the use of certain techniques for the disposal of some hazardous wastes. Hazardous Materials Transportation U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) U.S. Postal Service (USPS) Has the regulatory responsibility for the safe transportation of hazardous materials. The DOT regulations govern all means of transportation except packages shipped by mail (49 CRF). USPS regulations govern the transportation of hazardous materials shipped by mail. Occupational Safety Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 Fed/OSHA sets standards for safe workplaces and work practices, including the reporting of accidents and occupational injuries (29 CFR). Radioactive Materials a Atomic Energy Act Administered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the act regulates the use and control of radioactive material.b Biosafety Standardsc The National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Operated under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, these agencies est ablish standards for working with biohazardous materials. Structural and Building Components (Lead-based paint, PCBs, and asbestos) Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) USEPA Regulates the use and management of PCBs in electrical equipment, and sets forth detailed safeguards to be followed during the disposal of such items. The USEPA monitors and regulates hazardous materials used structural and building components and affects on human health. a U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, http:// www.nrc.gov/who-we-are/governing-laws.html, accessed November 15, 2002. b Radioactive material is any material or combination of materials that spontaneously emit ionizing radiation. c A hazardous biologic material is any potentially harmful bi ologic material (including infectious agents, oncogenic viruses, an d recombinant DNA) or any material contaminated with a potentially harmful biologic material. SOURCE: Environmental Science Associates, 2005 Hazardous Waste Handling The Cal EPA Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) regulates the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. State and federal laws require detailed planning to ensure that hazardous mate rials are properly handled, used, stored, and disposed of, and, in the event that such materi als are accidentally released, to prevent or to mitigate injury to health or the environment. Laws and regulations require hazardous materials users to store these materials appropriately and to train employees to manage them safely. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures J. Hazardous Materials and Hazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.J-6 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), whose responsibilities are described in Table IV.J-2, individual states may implement their own hazardous waste programs in lieu of RCRA, as long as the state program is at least as stringent as federal RCRA requirements. In California, the DTSC regulates the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. The hazardous waste regulations establish criteria for identifying, packaging, and labe ling hazardous wastes; prescribe management of hazardous waste; establish permit requirements for hazardous waste treatment, storage, disposal, and transportation; and identify hazardous wastes that cannot be disposed of in landfills. Hazardous Materials Transportation The State of California has adopted DOT regula tions for the intrastate movement of hazardous materials. State regulations are contained in T itle 26 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR). In addition, the State of California regulates the transportation of hazardous waste originating in the state and passing through th e state (26 CCR). Both regulatory programs apply in California. The two state agencies that have primary responsibility fo r enforcing federal and state regulations and responding to hazardous materials transportation emergencies are the California Highway Patrol (CHP) and the Califor nia Department of Transportation (Caltrans). Medical Waste Within the regulatory framework of the Medical Waste Management Act, the Medical Waste Management Program of the California Department of Health Services (CDHS) ensures the proper handling and disposal of medical waste by permitting and inspecting medical waste offsite treatment facilities and transfer stations throughout the state. The CDHS also oversees all medical waste transporters. The Medical Waste Management Program provides support and oversight to the ACDEH, which enforces the Medical Waste Management Act locally. Occupational Safety The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA) assumes primary responsibility for developing and enforcing work place safety regulations in California. Because California has a federally approved OSHA program, it is required to adopt regulations that are at least as stringent as those found in Title 29 of th e Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Cal/OSHA standards are generally more stri ngent than federal regulations. Cal/OSHA regulations (8 CCR) conc erning the use of hazardous mate rials in the workplace require employee safety training, safety equipment, accident and illness prevention programs, hazardous substance exposure warnings, and emergency ac tion and fire prevention plan preparation. Cal/OSHA enforces hazard co mmunication program regulations , which contain training and information requirements, including procedures for identifying and labeling hazardous substances, and communicating hazard information relating to hazardous substances and their handling. The hazard communication program also requires that Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) be available to employees, and that employee in formation and training programs be documented. These regulations also require preparation of emergency action plans (escape and evacuation procedures, rescue and medical duties, alarm systems, and trai ning in emergency evacuation). IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures J. Hazardous Materials and Hazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.J-7 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 State laws, like federal laws, include special provisions for hazard communication to employees in research laboratories, including training in chemical work practices. Specific, more detailed training and monitoring is required for the use of carcinogens, ethylene oxide, lead, asbestos, and certain other chemicals listed in 29 CFR. Em ergency equipment and supplies, such as fire extinguishers, safety showers, and eye washes, must also be provided and maintained in accessible places. Cal/OSHA (8 CCR), like Fed/OSHA (29 CFR) incl udes extensive, detailed requirements for worker protection applicable to any activity th at could disturb asbestos-containing materials, including maintenance, renovation, and demolition. These regulations are also designed to ensure that persons working near the maintenance, renova tion, or demolition activity are not exposed to asbestos. Radioactive Materials Pursuant to the federal Atomic Energy Act requi ring states to assume responsibility for the use, transportation, and disposal of low-level radioac tive material and for the protection of the public from radiation hazards, the Radiological Health Branch of the CDHS administers the state's Radiation Control Law, which governs the storage, use, transportation, and disposal of sources of ionizing radiation (radioactive material and radi ation-producing equipment). Radioactive material regulations require registration of sources of ionizi ng radiation, licensing of radioactive material, and protection against radiation exposure. The Radiological Health Branch also regulates the transportation of radioactive materials and dispo sal of radioactive waste. Users of radioactive materials must maintain detailed records regarding the receipt, storage, transfer, and disposal of such materials. State regulations concerning ra dioactive substances are included in 17 CCR. The regulations specify appropriate use and disposal methods for radioactive substances, as well as worker safety precautions and worker health monitoring programs. In addition, federal regulations that govern radiation include 10 CFR Part 20 (Standards for Protection Against Ionizing Radiation) and 40 CFR Part 61(Na tional Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants). Biosafety Standards Similar to federal laws, state laws establish st andards for working with biohazardous (infectious) materials and wastes. A hazardous biologic materi al is any potentially harmful biologic material (including infectious agents , oncogenic viruses, and recombinant DNA) or any material contaminated with a potentially harmful biolog ic material. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) operate under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and establish standards for working with biohazardous materials. The Project Site facilities currently handle wastes that are considered biological hazards. Emergency Response California has developed an emergency response plan to coordinate emergency services provided by federal, state, and local government and pr ivate agencies. Responding to hazardous materials IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures J. Hazardous Materials and Hazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.J-8 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 incidents is one part of this plan. The plan is administered by the State Office of Emergency Services (OES), which coordinates the responses of other agencies, including Cal EPA, CHP, the Department of Fish and Game, the San Franci sco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB), and the Alameda County Fire Depa rtment (ACFD). The ACFD provides first response capabilities, if needed, for hazardous material s emergencies within the Project Site area. Structural and Building Components Implementation of the Proposed Project would include demolition of structures which, due to their age, may contain asbestos, polychlorinated bi phenyls (PCBs), or lead and lead-based paint. In addition, removal of existi ng aboveground or underground st orage tanks may be required. Asbestos. State laws and regulations prohibit em issions of asbestos from asbestos-related manufacturing, demolition, or construction ac tivities; require medical examinations and monitoring of employees engaged in activities th at could disturb asbestos; specify precautions and safe work practices that must be followed to minimize the potential for release of asbestos fibers; and require notice to federal and lo cal governmental agencies prior to beginning renovation or demolition that could disturb asbestos . Asbestos represents a human health risk when asbestos fibers become airborne (fri able) and are inhaled into the lungs. The Bay Area Air Management District (BAAQMD) is vested by the California legislature with authority to regulate airborne pollutants, including asbestos, through both inspection and law enforcement, and is to be notified ten days in advance of any proposed demolition or abatement work. Cal/OSHA regulates asbestos removal to ensu re the health and safety of workers removing asbestos containing materials and also must be notified of asbestos abatement activities. Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs). As previously discussed, PCBs are organic oils that were formerly placed in many types of electrical e quipment and in fluorescent lighting ballasts. PCBs are highly persistent in the environment and are toxic. In 1979, the US EPA banned the use of PCBs in most new electrical equipment and began a program to phase out certain existing PCB-containing equipment. The use and management of PCBs in electrical equipment is regulated pursuant to the Toxic Substances Control Act (40 CFR). Fluorescent lighting ballasts that contain PCBs, regardless of size and quantity, are regulat ed as hazardous waste and must be transported and disposed of as hazardous waste. Lead and Lead-Based Paint. The California Code of Regulations, Title 22, considers waste soil with concentrations of lead to be hazardous if it exceeds a total concentration of 1,000 parts per million (ppm) and a soluble 3 concentration of 5 ppm. Both the federal and California OSHAs regulate all worker exposure during construction activities that involve lead-based paint. The Interim Final Rule found in 29 CFR Part 1926. 62 covers construction work where employees may be exposed to lead during such activities as demolition, removal, surface preparation for re- painting, renovation, clean up and routine ma intenance. The OSHA-specified method of compliance includes respiratory protection, protec tive clothing, housekeeping, hygiene facilities, medical surveillance, training, etc. 3 Capable of being dissolved, especially in water. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures J. Hazardous Materials and Hazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.J-9 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Aboveground and Underground Storage Tanks. The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) administers the AST Program. Facilities that store petroleum in a single tank greater than 1,320 gallons or facilities that store petrol eum in ASTs or containers with a cumulative storage capacity of greater than 1,320 gallons are subject to SWRCB regulations. The AST Program requires that the owners or operators f ile a storage statement, pay a facility fee, and prepare and implement a federal Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan. The SPCC Plan must discuss the procedures, methods , and equipment in place at the facility to prevent discharges of petroleum from reaching na vigable waters. AST oversight is provided by the Alameda County Fire Department . State laws governing USTs specify requirements for permitting, construction, installation, leak detection monitoring, repairs, release monito ring, corrective actions, cleanup, and closure. ACDEH and the Alameda County Fire Department are the local agencies designated to permit and inspect USTs and to implem ent applicable regulations. California Office of Statewide He alth Planning and Development The Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) is a department of the California Health and Human Services Agency. OSHPD serves as the regulatory building agency for all hospitals and nursing homes in California. Its primary goal in this regard is to ensure that patients in these facilities are safe in the event of an earthquake or other disaster, and to ensure that the facilities remain functional after such an event in order to meet the needs of the community affected by the disaster. Refer to Section IV.H, Geology, Soils, and Geohazards , for more information regarding the OSHPD. Local Soil and Groundwater Contamination In Alameda County, remediation of contaminated sites is performed under the oversight of the ACDEH and the San Francisco Bay RWQCB. The ACDEH implements a local oversight program under contract with the SWRCB to provide regulatory oversight of the investigation and cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination fro m leaking petroleum USTs and ASTs. At sites where contamination is suspected or known to ha ve occurred, the Project Sponsor is required to perform a site investigation and prepare a remedi ation plan, if necessary. For typical development projects, actual site remediation is completed eith er before or during the construction phase of the Proposed Project. Site remediation or developm ent may be subject to regulation by other agencies. As noted above, several properties sl ated for acquisition have contaminated soil and groundwater which is currently subject to ove rsight by ACDEH. Future investigation and remediation of soil or groundwater contamination that is known, or has not yet been identified, would be subject to oversight by ACDEH. Alameda County Hazardous Waste Management Program Assembly Bill (AB) 2948 requires counties and c ities either to adopt a county hazardous waste management plan as part of their general plan, or enact an ordinance requiring that all applicable zoning subdivision, conditional use permit, and vari ance decisions be consistent with the county IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures J. Hazardous Materials and Hazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.J-10 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 hazardous waste management plan. Once each County had its Hazardous Waste Management Program approved by the State, each city had 180 days to either 1) adopt a City Hazardous Waste Management Plan containing specified elements consistent with the approved County Hazardous Waste Management Plan, 2) incorporate the applicable portions of the approved Plan, by reference, into the City's General Plan, or 3) en act an ordinance which requires that all applicable zoning, subdivision, conditional use permits, a nd variance decisions be consistent with the specified portions of the plan. Alameda County has adopted a Hazardous Waste Management Program that addresses procedures for hazardous materials incidents. Under the Unified Hazardous Waste and Hazar dous Materials Management Regulatory Program, the ACDEH is certified by the DTSC to implement the following programs: Hazardous materials management plan and i nventory (HMMP) and the hazardous materials business plan (HMBP) Risk management program (RMP) Underground storage tank (UST) program Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan (SPCC) for ASTs Hazardous waste generators Onsite hazardous waste treatment (Tiered Permit). Submittal of updated HMMP and HMBP to the AC DEH in accordance with changes to hazardous materials storage and disposal locations and vol umes in association with implementation of the Project and future operation of the hospital would be required. Potential removal or installation of USTs or ASTs under the Project Site would also be subject to oversight by ACDEH. Local Plans and Policies Castro Valley General Plan policies and other applicable plans and policies that pertain to public health and safety with regard to hazardous materi als and related effects, and that apply to the Proposed Project, are identified below. Castro Valley General Plan (1985) The adopted Castro Valley General Plan includes policies that cover the handling and storage of hazardous materials. The following would apply to the Proposed Project. Principle 4.19 : Uses involving manufacture, use or storage of highly flammable, toxic, and/or highly water-reactive materials should be located at an adequate distance from other uses and should be regulated to minimize the risk of onsite or offsite personal injury and property damage. These uses should be located where they will not be adversely affected by disasters such as major fires, floods, or earthquakes. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures J. Hazardous Materials and Hazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.J-11 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Draft Castro Valley General Plan Update (2007) The proposed hazards and hazardous materials goa ls and policies that would apply to the Proposed Project include: Goal 10.4-1 : Minimize the risk to life and property from the production, use, storage and transportation of hazardous materials and waste by complying with all applicable Federal, State and local requirements. Policy 10.4-1 : Hazardous Materials Exposure Risks . Ensure that risks of exposure to hazardous materials are minimized by educating the public, establishing special zoning regulations for uses that involve hazardous materials, and evaluating soil and/or groundwater contamination as part of development project review. Impacts and Mitigation Measures Medical and administrative activities at the Project Site would use hazardous chemicals common in medical care, office and support settings. These chemicals would include familiar materials, such as toners, paints, lubricants, kitchen and r estroom cleaners, and other maintenance materials as well as chemicals used during patient care, laboratory testing and medical diagnostics. These common consumer products would be used fo r the same purposes as in any office or support setting, including residences. A medical facility cannot reasonably be expected to predict in advance every possible chemical or combination of chemicals it might conceivably use. However, estimated hazardous material use, storage, a nd disposal that would result from the Proposed Project are provided in the discussion that follo ws. These estimates represent projected use based on the facility's current operations. Significance Criteria A project would generally be considered to have a significant adverse impact on the environment if it would: Create a significant hazard to the public or th e environment through the routine transport, use, or disposal of hazardous materials. Create a significant hazard to the public or th e environment through reasonably foreseeable upset and accident conditions involving the release of hazardous materials into the environment. Emit hazardous emissions or handle hazardous or acutely hazardous materials, substances, or waste within one-quarter mile of an existing or proposed school. Be located on a site that is included on a lis t of hazardous materials sites compiled pursuant to Government Code Section 65962.5 and, as a result, create a significant hazard to the public or the environment. Result in a safety hazard for people residing or working in the project area for a project within the vicinity of a private airstrip. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures J. Hazardous Materials and Hazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.J-12 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Impair implementation of or physically interfe re with an adopted emergency response plan or emergency evacuation plan. Expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving wildland fires, including where wildlands are adjacent to urbanized areas or where residences are intermixed with wildlands. Be located within an airport land use plan or, where such a plan has not been adopted, within 2 miles of a public airport or public u se airport, where the project results in a safety hazard for people residing or working in the project area. Based on the characteristics of the Proposed Pr oject and the existing conditions, the Proposed Project would not result in impacts related to hazardous emissions near an existing or proposed school, being located on a hazardous materials sites list, safety hazard associated with an airstrip or airport, or interfere with an adopted em ergency response or evacuation plan. No impact discussion is provided for these topics for the following reasons: Emissions near School . There are a number of schools that are located within a quarter mile of the Project Site. However, the Proposed Project consists of rebuilding the Existing Hospital and support buildings that would not significantly increase the quantities of hazardous materials or wastes that are currently handled at the site. Therefore, the potential for hazardous emissions to affect any nearby schools is very low. Emergency Response/Evacuation Plan . Overall, the Proposed Project would not impede an emergency access route and would continue to maintain the existing city grid system. Additionally, the Proposed Project would not result in permanent road closures, and therefore, would not physically interfere with emergency response or evacuation plans. In addition, construction activities that would result in temporary road closures would include traffic control plans to ensure emergency ve hicle access and therefore would not cause an impact. Wildland Fires . The Project Site is located in a deve loped urban area that is not susceptible to wildland fires. In addition, the Propos ed Project would be built according to all applicable fire safety codes. There would be no impact from wildland fires. Interfere with Airstrip/Airport . The Project Site is located more than two miles from the nearest airstrip or airport and therefore would not interfere with any airport use plan or otherwise create a safety hazard related to any such facility. Hazardous Materials Impacts Construction-Related Impacts Impact HAZ-1: The Proposed Project would demolish existing structures that contain hazardous building materials, such as lead-b ased paint, asbestos, and PCBs could expose workers, the public, or the environment to th ese hazardous materials and would generate hazardous waste. (Potentially Significant) Demolition of existing structures on the Project Site may expose construction workers, the public, or the environment to hazardous materials such as lead-based paint, asbestos, and PCBs. The IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures J. Hazardous Materials and Hazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.J-13 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 level of potential impact is depe ndent upon the age, construction, and building materials in each building. Various asbestos surveys have been comp leted for structures on the Project Site over the years which have also resulted in some abat ement activities of asbestos containing materials (ACMs). However, ACMs may still be present at the site which, if disturbed, could expose workers and the public during demolition. Any remaining ACMs would need appropriate abatement of identified asbestos prior to demolition. ACMs are regulated both as a hazardous air pollutant under the Clean Air Act and as a poten tial worker safety hazard under the authority of Cal/OSHA. Cal/OSHA also regulates worker exposur e to lead-based paint. Potential exposure to these hazardous building materials can be reduced through appropriate Mitigation Measure HAZ-1a: Each structure proposed for demolition shall require an assessment by licensed contractors for the po tential presence of lead-based paint or coatings, asbestos containing materials, or PCB-containing equipment prior to obtaining a demolition permit. Mitigation Measure HAZ-1b: If the assessment required by Mitigation Measure HAZ.1a finds presence of lead-based paint, asbestos, and/or PCBs, the Project Sponsor shall create and implement a health and safety plan to protect workers, the public, and the environment, from risks a ssociated with hazardous materials during demolition or renovation of affected structures. Mitigation Measure HAZ-1c: If the assessment required by Mitigation Measure HAZ.1a finds presence of lead-based paint, the Project Sponsor shall develop and implement a lead-based paint removal plan. The plan shall specify, but not be limited to, the following elements for implementation: Develop a removal specification approved by a Certified Lead Project Designer. Ensure that all removal workers are properly trained. Contain all work areas to prohibit offsite migration of paint chip debris. Remove all peeling and stratified lead-based paint on building and non-building surfaces to the degree necessary to safe ly and properly complete demolition activities according to recommendations of the survey. The demolition contractor shall be responsible for the pr oper containment and disposal of intact lead-based paint on all equipment to be cut and/or removed during the demolition. Provide onsite personnel and area air monitoring during all removal activities to ensure that workers and the environmen t are adequately protected by the control measures used. Clean up and/or vacuum paint chips with a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. Collect, segregate, and profile waste for disposal determination. Properly dispose of all waste. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures J. Hazardous Materials and Hazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.J-14 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Both the federal OSHA and Cal/OSHA regulate worker exposure during construction activities that disturb lead-based paint. The Interi m Final Rule found in 29 CFR 1926.62 covers construction work in which employees may be exposed to lead during such activities as demolition, removal, surface preparation for re painting, renovation, cleanup, and routine maintenance. The OSHA-specified compliance includes respiratory protection, protective clothing, housekeeping, special high-efficiency filtered vacuums, hygiene facilities, medical surveillance, and training. No minimum level of lead is specified to activate the provisions of this regulation. Mitigation Measure HAZ-1d: If the assessment required by Mitigation Measure HAZ.1a finds presence of asbestos, the Project Sponsor shall ensure that asbestos abatement shall be conducted by a licensed contractor prior to building demolition. Exposure to asbestos, and the resulting adverse health effects, is possible throughout the demolition and renovation phases if materials that contain asbestos are present. In structures slated for demolition under the Proposed Project, any asbestos-containing materials would be abated in accordance with state and federal re gulations prior to the start of demolition or renovation activities. Section 19827.5 of the California Health and Safe ty Code requires that local agencies not issue demolition or alteration permits until an applicant has demonstrated compliance with notification requirements under applicable federal regulations regarding hazardous air pollutants, including asbestos. The BAAQMD is vested by the California le gislature with authority to regulate airborne pollutants, including asbestos, through both inspectio n and law enforcement, and is to be notified 10 days in advance of any proposed demolition or abatement work. Notification includes the names and addresses of operations and persons responsible; description and location of the structure to be demolished/alte red including size, age, and prior use, and the approximate amount of friable asbestos; scheduled starting and completion dates of demolition or abatement; nature of planned work and methods to be employed; procedures to be employed to meet BAAQMD requirements; and the name and loca tion of the waste disposal site to be used. The BAAQMD randomly inspects asbestos remova l operations and will inspect any removal operation about which a complaint has been received. Asbestos abatement contractors must follow state regulations contained in 8 CCR 1529 and 8 CCR 341.6 through 341.14 where there is asbestos-rel ated work involving 100 square feet or more of asbestos-containing material. Asbestos re moval contractors must be certified as such by the Contractors Licensing Board of the State of California. The owner of the property where abatement is to occur must have a hazardous waste generator number assigned by and registered with the DTSC in Sacramento. SMCCV and the tran sporter of the waste are required to file a hazardous waste manifest that details the trans portation of the material from the site and its disposal. Compliance with these regulations and procedures w ould ensure that any potential impacts due to asbestos are less-than-significant. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures J. Hazardous Materials and Hazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.J-15 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Mitigation Measure HAZ-1e: If the assessment required by Mitigation Measure HAZ.1a finds presence of PCBs, the Project Sponsor shall ensure that PCB abatement shall be conducted prior to building demolition or renovation. Fluorescent lighting ballasts manufactured prior to 1978, and electrical transformers, capacitors, and generators manufactured prior to 1977, ma y contain PCBs. In accordance with the Toxic Substances Control Act and other federal and st ate regulations, SMCCV would be required to properly handle and dispose of electrical equipment and lighting ballasts that contain PCBs, reducing potential impacts to a less-than-significant level. Significance after Mitigation: Less than Significant. Impact HAZ-2: Implementation of the Proposed Project would disturb soil and groundwater impacted by historic hazardous ma terial use, which could expose construction workers, the pubic, or the environment to adv erse conditions related to hazardous materials handling. (Potentially Significant) As discussed above, the soil and groundwater at the Project Site has been impacted from the former underground storage tanks. Previous remediat ion efforts in this area were limited due to the potential for undermining the building foun dation. Construction activities would include demolition of existing buildings and subsequent excavation and trenching could potentially intercept and disturb impacted soil and/or groundwater. The Proposed Project would involve excavation for installation of building substructures and subgrade utilities and would involve grading that could be substantial in certain areas. Soil disturbance during construction could disperse existing contamination into the environment and expose construction workers and the public to contaminants. Significant undetected levels of contamination in soils could result in various shor t-term health effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, or burns. While the past release of diesel fuel associated with the former USTs, has been closed by ACDEH, the presence of residual contaminants po se an environmental risk and potential health risk during construction. Othe r potentially contaminated ar eas identified in the Phase I investigation include the sanitary sewer lines used to dispose of x-ray photo processing waste. It is not uncommon for older sewer lines to develop holes or ruptures and allow contaminated waste line fluids to leak into the subsurface. This would result in a potentially significant impact. Mitigation Measure HAZ-2a: The Project Sponsor shall prepare a health and safety plan, based on the site conditions and past diesel release history and remediation, by a licensed industrial hygienist. The health and safety plan, in accordance with OSHA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emerg ency Response Standard (HAZWOPER), shall identify potential contaminants th at may be encountered, appropriate personal protective equipment, and worker safety procedures. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures J. Hazardous Materials and Hazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.J-16 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Mitigation Measure HAZ-2b: To reduce en vironmental risks associated with encountering contaminated soil that is di scovered during grading and construction, the Project Sponsor shall ensure that any suspected impacted soil is stockpiled separately, profiled for hazardous material content and disposed of in accordance with all state and federal agencies and under federal (RCRA) and the requirements of state laws. All contaminated soil determined to be hazardous or non-hazardous waste must be adequately profiled for acceptable disposal before it can be removed from the site. Site procedures for encountering, hand ling, profiling, and disposing of suspected contaminated soils shall be prepared for the contractor by a licensed environmental professional in a Soil Management Plan. Mitigation Measure HAZ-2c: Groundwater pumped from the subsurface would be contained onsite prior to treatment and di sposal to ensure environmental and health issues are resolved pursuant to oversight age ncies. Engineering controls shall be utilized, which include impermeable barriers to prohibit groundwater and vapor intrusion into the building, if applicable , as determined by the overseeing agency. Significance after Mitigation: Less than Significant. Hazardous Materials Use, Storage, and Disposal Impact HAZ-3: The Proposed Project would involve the transportation, use, and storage of hazardous chemicals, which could present public health and/or safety risks to facility workers, patients and visitors, and the su rrounding area. (Less than Significant) Activities at the Project Site are expected to c ontinue to involve a wide range of chemical compounds and products that are considered hazardous materials. Exposure to hazardous chemicals could cause acute or chronic hea lth effects to workers and visitors. The Proposed Project would continue to implemen t the regulatory guidelines and procedures that are currently in use at the existing facility. At the Project Site, areas where hazardous chemicals would be stored regularly would be equipped w ith proper ventilation and secondary containment. Most of the flammable materials stored indoors woul d be kept in fire safety cabinets when not in use. Handling and use of these hazardous materials and the disposal of the resulting hazardous wastes would be required to follow the applicab le laws and regulations, as described in Regulatory Setting above. The net result of good compliance woul d be the reduction of risks and hazards to workers, the public, and the environment to le vels that are considered acceptable, for all hazardous materials proposed for use on the Project Site. Hazardous materials would typically be stored in their original containers prior to use. As required, the hazardous materials would be stored in each building, in locations according to compatibility and in storage enclosures (i.e., fla mmable material storage cabinets and biological safety cabinets) or in areas or rooms specially designed, protected, and contained for such IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures J. Hazardous Materials and Hazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.J-17 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 storage, in accordance with applicable regula tions. Hazardous materials would be handled and used in accordance with applicable regulations by personnel that have been trained in the handling and use of the material and that have received proper hazard-communication training. Hazardous materials reporting (i.e., California H azardous Materials Business Planning, California Proposition 65 notification, and Emergency Pl anning and Community-Right-to-Know Act reporting) would be completed as required. Hazardous Materials Any hazardous material that is not consumed a nd can no longer be used would be designated as a hazardous waste material. Overall, the Proposed Proj ect is expected to operate without significant change with respect to existing operations. The proposed changes that will occur with the Proposed Project are not expected to substantially increase the number of patients (in-patient or out-patient), visitors or medical doctors and hospital staff on site (in total or within any work shift) compared to existing conditions. Biohazardous Wastes and Sterile Waste Various types of biological waste materials woul d be used at the Project Site and employees would continue to be appropriately trained to work with (i.e., handle and dispose of) these biological materials. The use of biohazardous wast e materials at the Project Site could include cultures, blood and blood products, and tissues. Po tentially infectious sharps, including razor blades, syringes, and needles would also be collected in plastic biohazard containers. The handling and disposal of biohazardous wastes w ould continue in accordance with the existing procedures and regulatory requirements. The amount of biohazardous wastes is estimated to be relatively similar to existing operations since the Proposed Project is not expected to increase the number of patients, staff, or visitors. Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Transport All hazardous materials would be transported to th e site in accordance with applicable hazardous materials shipping regulations. Chemical and bi ohazardous waste and radioactive materials, and other packages for laboratories would be deliver ed in accordance with the Hazardous Materials Management Plan. Chemical and biohazardous w aste would be picked up on a regular basis and transported by a properly licensed commercial waste transporter and disposed of or recycled at a properly licensed and permitted offsite di sposal and/or recycling facility. Required compliance with applicable regulator y requirements would minimize hazards to workers, visitors, the public, and the environment from waste products. Mitigation: None required. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures J. Hazardous Materials and Hazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.J-18 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Impact HAZ-4: Hazardous materials used on site during construction activities (i.e., solvents) could be spilled through improper ha ndling or storage, potentially increasing public health and/or safety risks to facilit y workers, patients and visitors, and the surrounding area. (Less than Significant) Construction activities would require the use of cer tain hazardous materials such as fuels, oils, solvents, and glues. Inadvertent release of larg e quantities of these materials into the environment could adversely impact soil, surface waters, or groundwater quality. The use of construction best management practices typically implemented as part of construction would minimize the potential adverse effects to groundwater a nd soils. These could include the following: Follow manufacturer's recommendations on use, storage and disposal of chemical products used in construction; Avoid overtopping construction equipment fuel gas tanks; During routine maintenance of constructi on equipment, properly contain and remove grease and oils. Properly dispose of discarded containe rs of fuels and other chemicals. Construction projects, such as the one that would be undertaken for the Proposed Project, would require certain hazardous materials (fuels, adhesi ves, solvents), that, if improperly used and inadvertently released, could result in a tem porary hazard to workers, the public, or the environment. However, the hazardous materials ty pically used on a construction site are brought onto the site packaged in consumer quantiti es and used in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. The overall quantities of these mate rials on the site at one time does not result in large bulk amounts that, if spilled, could cause a significant soil or groundwater contamination issue. Spills of hazardous materials on construction sites are typically localized and are cleaned up in a timely manner. In most cases, the individual construction contractors are responsible for their hazardous materials and are required under th eir contract with SMCCV to properly store and dispose of these materials in compliance with state and federal laws. Given the quantities of hazardous materials typically needed for larg e construction projects and the use of best management practices by the individual constructi on contractors, the threat of exposure to the public or contamination to soil and groundwater from construction-related hazardous materials is considered a less than significant impact. Mitigation: None required. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures J. Hazardous Materials and Hazards Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.J-19 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Cumulative Impacts Impact HAZ-5: The Proposed Project, comb ined with past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects, would not result in a cumula tive hazards in the vicinity of the Project Site. (Less than Significant) Geographic Context and Other Projects Past projects in this area are included in the existing setting described in this section and in Chapter III, Project Description. Present project s would include any projects currently under construction within the geographic context area. None are identified as of preparation of this EIR. Reasonably foreseeable future projects are tho se that could be developed or occur in the geographic context area by 2030. Cumulative hazardous materials effects could occur if activities at the Project Site and other past, existing and proposed development, together, coul d increase risks in the neighborhood. However, most routine hazardous materials activities at the Project Site would be located indoors. Any indoor health or safety effects of routine hazardous materials use would be limited to the specific individuals using the materials and anyone in the immediate vicinity of the use. No interaction would occur between these routine activities and sim ilar activities at different sites. In addition, based on the estimated similar quantitative usage of hazardous materials with the Project Site, there would be no substantive change in the amount of hazardous materials handled under the Proposed Project. Cumulative health and safety impacts could occur if project-related outdoor or offsite hazards were to interact or combine with those of ot her existing and proposed development. This could occur through limited mechanisms: air emissions, transport of hazardous materials and waste to or from the Project Site, inadvertent release of h azardous materials to the sewer or non-hazardous waste landfill, and potential accidents that re quire hazardous materials emergency response capabilities. Air emissions are addressed in Section C, Air Quality . The other mechanisms for cumulative offsite effects are discussed below. Because offsite hazardous materials shipments to and from the Proposed Project could involve the same roads used by other existing and future development in the area, the Proposed Project, together with this foreseeable development, could contribute to cumulative increases in the amount of hazardous material transported to and from the Project Site and the surrounding community. Hazardous materials are transporte d by common carriers, such as United Parcel Service and Federal Express, which would often sh ip small containers of hazardous materials for delivery along their routes whether or not the Pr oposed Project is approved. Cumulative increases in the transportation of hazardous materials and wastes would cause a less than significant impact because the probability of such accidents is rela tively low, and the use of legally required packaging minimizes the consequences of poten tial accidents. And again, the amount of hazardous materials used under the Proposed Project is not expected to change related to existing conditions. Therefore, this cumulative impact would be less than significant. IV. Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures J.

Public Services This section describes existing public services and facilities at the Project Site. This analysis includes the impact of the Proposed Project on the delivery of public services; specifically whether the Proposed Project would cause a need to provide new or physically altered public services facilities, potentially resulting in adver se physical impacts to the environment. The analysis reviews policing services and fire prot ection and emergency medical response services. Potential impacts and mitigation measures are identified, as necessary. Public Services Not Analyzed in this EIR Public services topics not addressed in this EIR include schools, parks and recreation and library facilities. The Initial Study determined that the Proposed Project would not introduce new residential uses and would not result in an incr ease in students to area schools. In addition, the Initial Study determined that the Proposed Proj ect would not create a substantial increase in population that would result in increased use of local parks or other public facilities. Thus, these topics are not analyzed in this EIR. Devel opment of the SMCCV Project would increase the availability of public acute care medical services in the area. Setting Castro Valley is an unincorporated community within Alameda County. Accordingly, Castro Valley relies on Alameda County Sheriff's Office, the Alameda County Fire Department, and other special districts for public services. Police Protection Services Facilities and Staffing The Alameda County Sheriff's Office provides police protection services to the Castro Valley community. The Sheriff's Office is headquartered at 1401 Lakeside Drive in downtown Oakland. In 1991, the Alameda Local Agency Forma tion Commission (LAFCO) established the Alameda County's Extended Police Protection County Service Area (CSA) as a dependent special district (administered by the County Sheriff's Office) to supplement funding for police services in the unincorporated areas. The CSA serves an area of 428.3 square miles. B ased on the 2000 Census, the Sheriff's Department estimated that it provid es services to approximately 136,000 residents in the County's unincorporated areas, roughly 43 percent of who are Castro Valley residents (Alameda County, 2005). The Sheriff's Office is currently authorized for 1,612 personnel: 967 Deputy Sheriffs (sworn staff) and 645 professional (non-sworn/civilian) employees (Melanson and Liskey, 2008). The Sheriff's Office estimates that its total populatio n served (throughout the unincorporated areas of Alameda County) was 141,000 in 2008. Based on this total, the Office's 2008 staffing levels on a per capita basis were 11.4 staff members per 1,000 residents. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures K. Public Services Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.K-2 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 The Sheriff's Office Eden Town ship substation, located at 15001 Foothill Boulevard in unincorporated San Leandro, serves the entire uninc orporated county, including the Project Site. The unincorporated county, as served by the Eden To wnship Substation, is roughly divided into the following sectors: 1) San Lorenzo; 2) Ashl and/Cherryland; 3) Castro Valley - North of Highway 580; 4) Castro Valley - South of Highway 580, and 5) Livermore Valley - East County. The Castro Valley area is approximately 17 square miles, and the Sheriff's Office estimates that approximately 60,192 citizens live in the service area. (Melanson and Liskey, 2008). In the unincorporated area, there are a minimum of 24 sworn Patrol Deputies working throughout every 24-hour day. Additionally, the Sheriff's Office h as many specialized units which are available to assist the patrol at any time. The Sheriff's Office also provides policing services to several contract areas (City of Dublin, AC Transit, East County Substation, the Peralta Colleges, Social Services, Marine patrol, and Airport Police Services). Additionally, the Sh eriff's Office operates the Community-Oriented Policing and Problem Solving (COPPS) program, which provides bicycle patrols and community walks, and works with residents on a variety of programs. The California Highway Patrol is responsible for enforcing the State Vehicle Code in Castro Valley, including traffic and parking, and operates a community patrol in Castro Valley (Alameda County, 2007a). Staff at the Eden Township Substation cu rrently includes 162 sworn officers (Captain, Lieutenants, and Sergeants) and 26 non-sworn st aff (Sheriff Technicians and professional staff) for a total of 188 staff members. For the Sutter Medical Center service area, minimum Sheriff's Office staffing on a daily basis includes five patrol deputies and one parking technician. (This total does not include specialized units which patr ol the service area on a daily basis.) (Melanson and Liskey, 2008) The Eden Township Substation occupies a buildin g originally constructed in 1953 that is overcrowded and inadequate to meet the Sheriff' s Office needs. The Draft Castro Valley General Plan Update describes a plan by the Sheriff's Office in which it proposes to consolidate its existing law enforcement facilities in a new 220,000 square foot complex, to be constructed on the site of the existing Fairmont Animal Shelter on Fairmont Drive about 1.2 miles west of Castro Valley and east of San Leandro. This new complex would allow relocation of services from the Eden Township Station as well as the Coroner' s Bureau now located in downtown Oakland (Alameda County, 2007). As of 2008, plans to construct the Law Enforcement Complex are ongoing and the geotechnical phase of the site exam ination is underway. Also, the new animal shelter must be built before the construction of the Complex can begin (Sheriff's Office, 2007, Melanson and Liskey, 2008). Service Demand All emergency (911) and non-emerge ncy calls for police, fire, and medical services are received through the Sheriff's Office Emer gency Dispatch communications center at 2000 150th Avenue in San Leandro. Calls for fire and medi cal services are routed to the fire department for dispatching. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures K. Public Services Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.K-3 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 The Alameda County Sheriff's Office, Emergency Services Dispatch Unit (Dispatch Unit) provides 911 emergency and non-emergency tele phone service, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Dispatch Unit serves the unincorporated areas of Castro Valley, Hayward, Cherryland, Ashland, San Lorenzo, San Leandro, Sunol, Pl easanton and Livermore, as well as the city of Dublin and contract areas such as AC Trans it Police Services and the Peralta Colleges. The Dispatch Unit consists of 27 dispatchers, f our supervisors and three administrative positions. Countywide, for the year 2007, the Dispatch Unit dispatched over 189,495 calls for service and answered 75,279 seven digit and 911 emergency calls (Sheriff's Office, 2008). This level of service equates to about 1,344 dispatched calls per 1,000 residents, based on the population of Alameda County areas served the Sheriff's Office of 141,000, as of 2008 as reported by the Sheriff's Office (Melanson and Liskey, 2008). The Sheriff's Office's countywide response time to calls for police services generally reflects the perceived seriousness of the call. The Dispatch Ce nter prioritizes all calls into four (4) major categories. The priority is determined by the type of call, the immediate threat of life, injury and property and the likelihood of the crime con tinuing. Incoming calls for police services are prioritized as follows: Priority 1 refers to calls re garding serious injury to persons, violent crimes, serious public hazards, felonies in progress or 911 ha ng-up calls; Priority 2 refers to urgent but non-emergency situations such as hazardous or sensitive matters, in-progress misdemeanors and crimes, or residential or business alarms. Priority 3 calls are reports of incidents that do not present immediate danger to life or property (such as when a crime report is requested for an event that took place at an earlier time and there is no likelihood of the crim e continuing). Priority 4 calls consist of non-emergency requests for servi ce. The Sheriff's Office responds to every call for service, regardless of the reason for the call. Dispatch times vary. Average response times for the Sheriff's Office are 14:48 minutes for Priority 1 calls (calls requiring an immediate emergency response) and 17:13 for non-emergenc y calls requiring an urgent response (Melanson and Liskey 2008, Alameda County, 2007a). In 2007, the Eden Township Substation responded to 98,321 calls for service, 34,467 of which were 911 calls. Of those, 17,99 7 resulted in written reports. Table IV.K-1 is a summary of the calls for service at Sutter Medical Center, 20103 Lake Chabot Road, Castro Valley.

Public Services Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.K-4 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Eden Medical Center On-site Security In addition to police protection services provided by the Alameda County Sheriff's Office, Eden Medical Center provides on-site security at the medical center through its contract with a private security company. The onsite contract security staff consists of about 15 full-time equivalent uniformed security officers that provide 24-hour service, seven days a week. They are managed by the Eden Medical Center Safety and Security Di rector and a field supervisor from the contract security company . Security officers regularly patrol the Eden Medical Center grounds, parking areas, parking structure and Existing Hospital bu ilding and Emergency Department entrance as well as the common areas of office buildings on campus. Duties include access control, visitor and employee identification, proactive prevention of the loss of personal or company property (i.e., through the use of surveillance and communi cation systems), and the provision of security and physical safety of all who are on the propert y. Further duties include management of onsite traffic; parking enforcement; securement of th e heliport for helicopter landings; response to alarms, emergency codes and Homeland Security alerts; and cooperation with law enforcement officials in matters which extend beyond the boundaries of the hospital. Security Officers are not law enforcement officers, and therefore, their primary responsibility is to observe and report. Security Officers are not authorized to wear or use any weapon while on duty. Fire Protection and Emergency Medical Services Facilities and Staffing The Alameda County Fire Department (ACFD) pr ovides fire protection and emergency medical services to the unincorporated areas1 of Alameda County, the City of San Leandro, the City of Dublin, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. ACFD's services include fire suppression, arson i nvestigation, hazardous materials mitigation, paramedic services, urban search and rescue, fi re prevention and public education. ACFD operates with an emphasis on fire prevention, bui lding code enforcement, and public education (ACFD, 2008). The Alameda County Fire Department was formed on July 1, 1993 as a dependent special district with the Board of Supervisors as its governing body . This consolidation brought together into a single jurisdiction the Castro Valley Fire Departme nt, the Eden Fire Department and County Fire Patrol. Subsequently, the cities of San Leandro a nd Dublin also consolidated their departments into the ACFD, and Lawrence Berkeley Nationa l Lab was added in August of 2002 (ACFD, 2008). The ACFD serves approximately 461 square mil es with a population of 266,000 people (ACFD, 2008). ACFD has two battalions, 18 fire stations , 18 engine companies, and four ladder truck companies, as well as other specialized equipm ent. The ACFD also has specialized response teams, including hazardous materials, urban search and rescue, and water rescue (ACFD, 2008). Castro Valley is served by the four ACFD stations located within Castro Valley (Stations 4, 5, 6, 1 ACFD's service area includes all unincorporated communitie s except Fairview. Fairview receives fire services from the City of Hayward. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures K. Public Services Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.K-5 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 and 7) as well as other ACFD Stations as appropr iate. Station 4 is located at 20336 San Miguel Avenue; Station 5 is located at 18770 Lake Ch abot Road; Station 6 is located at 19780 Cull Canyon Road; and Station 7 is located at 6901 Villareal Avenue. ACFD Station 3, located at 1430 164th Avenue in San Leandro also serves Castro Valley. The administrative office serving the unincorporated areas of Alameda County is located at 399 Elmhurst Street in Hayward. ACFD Station 4, located approximately 0.7 mile from the Project Site, would be the first engine company that would respond to a fire or medical emergency at the Project Site. The area served by Station 4 is generally bounded by Barlow Dr ive, Lux Avenue, Le Costa Avenue and Heyer Avenue to the north, San Lorenzo Creek between Grove Way and A Street to the south, Forest Avenue to the east, and Rolando Av enue and Foothill Boulevard to the west. If Station 4 were unavailable, the next closest unit, Station 5, woul d respond. A fire or fire alarm would require an initial response from Stations 3, 4 and 5 (Knowles and Rocha, 2008). The ACFD has 295 safety personnel and 61.5 full- time equivalent (FTE) non-safety personnel. Based on the ACFD's estimated population2 of 266,000, this equates to approximately 1.1 fire safety officers per 1,000 residents. All ACFD safety personnel are Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs), and 115 of Alameda County's firefighters are also trained as paramedics (Knowles and Rocha, 2008). The number of personnel actually responding to an emergency depends on the location and nature of the emergency. At any given time, 86 safety personnel are on duty throughout Alameda County. At Station 4, seven firefighters, two of whom are paramedics, are on duty at any given time. On a typical fire call to SMCCV, 17 safety personnel (including at least one paramedic) from Stations 3, 4, and 5 would respond (Knowles and Rocha, 2008). Service Demand All emergency (911) and non-emer gency calls for police, fire, and medical services are received through the Sheriff's Office communications center on 150th Avenue in San Leandro (as described above). Calls for fire and medical ser vices are then routed to the Alameda County Regional Emergency Communications Center (ACR ECC) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Calls are tracked and dispatch ed utilizing a computerized system, called the Intergraph CAD system. The Fire Department received 11,049 calls in unincorporated Alameda County in 2006, and 11,102 calls in unincor porated Alameda County in 2007 (Knowles and Rocha, 2008). The fire station serving the Project Site, Station 4, received 2,082 calls in 2006 and 2,039 calls in 2007 (Knowles and Rocha, 2008). ACFD responded to 32 calls from SMCCV in 2007. Of this total, 19 calls were from Eden Hospital at 2010 3 Lake Chabot Road; 11 calls were from the Laurel Grove Hospital at 19933 Lake Chabot Road, and 2 calls were from the MOB at 20055 Lake Chabot Road (Terra, 2008). 2 This population estimate is based on the ACFD's service area: the uninc orporated areas of Alameda County (excluding Fairfield), the City of San Leandro, the City of Dublin, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures K. Public Services Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.K-6 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 ACFD's policy is to meet a response time goal of 5 minutes or less from the time a call is received in the Fire Dispatch Center, until the first unit arrives on the scene of the emergency, 90 percent of the time (Knowles and Rocha, 200 8). In 2007, the average response time for the Fire Station 4 to the entire area they service is 7 minutes, 51 seconds, while the average response time for calls from SMCCV in 2007 was 3 minut es, 44 seconds (Knowles and Rocha, 2008). A discussion of adequate water supply and fire flow for fire suppression purposes is provided in Section IV.L, Utilities and Service Systems . Regulatory Setting Local Plans and Policies The 1985 Castro Valley Plan (General Plan ) provides general policies and objectives to guide land use decisions and development throughout the County, including the area in and around the Project Site. Castro Valley is in the process of updating its General Plan . The Draft Castro Valley General Plan Update (2007 Draft General Plan Update) contains County policies regarding public services and facilities including the following draft policies: Draft Castro Valley General Plan (2007) Policy 9.1-1 : Provision of Basic Services. All developm ent within the Castro Valley urban areas shall be provided with adequate basi c urban services including...police protection; and fire protection. Policy 9.2-1 : Comparable Public Safety Standard s. Adopt and maintain public safety standards that meet or exceed standards fo r comparable incorporated cities in Alameda County. Policy 9.2-2 : Community-Oriented Policing. Promote a community-oriented approach to law enforcement. Policy 9.2-3 : Emergency Management Plan. Maintain and regularly update a standardized Emergency Management Plan in coordination with the Alameda County Fire Department, the East Bay Regional Parks District, and public safety agencies in surrounding cities.

Policy 9.2-7 : Improve Emergency Response Capability . Improve the capability of Alameda County public safety agencies, Eden Medical Ce nter and other public facilities to respond to public emergencies such as earthquakes and major fires. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures K. Public Services Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.K-7 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Because these policies do not entail quantifiable sta ndards or thresholds of significance, they are not addressed in the following impact analysis. Impacts and Mitigation Measures Significance Criteria The impact of the Proposed Project on public services would be considered significant if it would exceed the following Standards of Significance, in accordance with Appendix G of the state CEQA Guidelines : Result in substantial adverse physical impacts a ssociated with the provision of, or the need for, new or physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times, or other performance objectiv es for any of the following public services: - Fire protection; or - Police protection. As noted above, the Proposed Project was analy zed for potential impacts to public services in an Initial Study published May 5, 2008 . Public services for which the Proposed Project would not result in a significant impact, and therefore not a ddressed in this EIR, include schools, parks and recreation and library facilities. Impacts Police Protection Services Impact PUB-1: The Proposed Project would no t result in a substantial increase in calls for police protection services that would require new or physically altered Sheriff's Office facilities in order to maintain acceptable p erformance objectives. (Less than Significant) The Proposed Project's development intensity would be roughly equal to existing conditions, which is an increase in total population attri butable to the expanded New MOB uses. Demolition of the Pine Cone apartments would result in d ecreased residential population, the number of beds on the Project Site would decrease, and the New Hospital population would be generally the same as the Existing Hospital and Laurel Grove Reha bilitation Hospital that will be demolished. As described above, the Proposed Project is located within the service area of the Eden Township Substation of the Alameda County Sheriff's Departme nt, and is patrolled by five deputies and one parking technician daily. The Sheriff's Office do es not anticipate a need for additional officers with the Proposed Project, and consequently it does not anticipate the need for any new or physically altered facilities as a result of the Pr oposed Project (Melanson and Liskey, 2008). As noted above, the Castro Valley General Plan describ es plans for the Sheriff's Office to construct a new 220,000 square foot complex to be constructed on the site of the existing Fairmont Animal IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures K. Public Services Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.K-8 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Shelter on Fairmont Drive (Alameda County, 2007a). This planned construction is in response to existing growth in Castro Valley, and is not required due to the Proposed Project. Eden Medical Center currently provides on-site secu rity at the medical center through a contract security company. Contract security personnel at the Project Site consist of about 15 full-time equivalent security officers providing 24 hour ser vice, seven days a week. As a result of the Proposed Project, on-site security personnel would remain about the same, or would be increased by one to two contract personnel to offset th e increasing needs of the emergency and trauma department at Eden Medical Center. Contract se curity personnel would then total about 15 to 17 full-time equivalent security officers that would continue to provide 24 hour service (Bosold, 2008). Eden Medical Center contract security personnel would continue to cooperate and coordinate with Alameda County Sheriff's O ffice staff in matters which extend beyond the boundaries of the Project Site. Increases in contr act security personnel would have no impact on Sheriff's Office staffing or facilities. Mitigation: None required. _________________________ Fire Protection and Emergency Medical Services Impact PUB-2: The Proposed Project woul d not increase the number of calls for fire protection services and emergency medical assistance that would not require new or physically altered fire facilities in order to maintain acceptable performance objectives. (Less than Significant) As discussed above, the Proposed Project's deve lopment intensity would be roughly equal to existing conditions, with an increase in total popul ation attributable to expanded New MOB uses. Demolition of the Pine Cone apartments would result in decreased residential population, the number of beds on the Project Site would decrease, and the Ne w Hospital population would be generally the same as the Existing Hospital and Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital that will be demolished. Moreover, calls from the Project Site typically would not be for emergency medical assistance. Thus, the demand on fire protection and emergency services is not expected to increase substantially. In addition, development of the Proposed Project would increase the availability of public acute care medical services in the area, supporting existing emergency services and providing a beneficial effect. Failure to implement the Propo sed Project would result in a substantial loss of emergency public services as the Existing Hospital w ould no longer be licensed to operate after year 2013. As described above, the Project Site falls with in the response boundaries of Fire Station 4 at 20336 San Miguel Avenue, which is approximately 0.7 miles from the Project Site and which would be the first engine company that would res pond to a fire or medical emergency at the site. The Fire Department is currently capable of providing fire protection and emergency medical IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures K. Public Services Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.K-9 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 services to the Proposed Project area, and according to the Fire Department, development of the Proposed Project would not require the construc tion of any new or physically altered facilities (Terra, 2008). The Fire Department's first concern for new deve lopment is the availab ility of adequate water supply (see Section IV.L, Utilities and Service Systems , for further discussion of water and water supply.) In addition, the ACFD requires all new development to incorporate appropriate building and fire code requirements into project construc tion, and the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) regulates these requireme nts for hospitals. OSHPD would review the Proposed Project plans, and the Project Sponsor would be required to incorporate OSHPD's conditions and requirements into the final project design, in addition to conditions established by ACFD, as appropriate. Mitigation: None required. _________________________ Cumulative Impacts Impact PUB-3: The Proposed Project, when combined with other past, present and reasonably foreseeable future development in th e vicinity, could result in cumulative impacts to the provision of public services. (Less than Significant) Geographic Context and Other Projects The geographic context considered for the public services impacts is the unincorporated Area of Castro Valley. The analysis considers past projects (i.e., existing development constructed prior to preparation of the 2005 Draft EIR) and present projects (underway or constructed), because these projects exist as part of the physical setting and are currently served by existing public services. Reasonably foreseeable future projects are those expected to be completed by 2030. Past, present and projected population growth for Castro Valley is used to analyze the pot ential cumulative effect of past, present and reasonably foreseeable future projects on public services in the geographic context of the Area. The population changes that have occurred as a result of past, present and reasonably foreseeable future projects are presented in Section IV.M., Population, Housing and Employment (Table IV.M-5 ), in this EIR. Discussion The Proposed Project would have a less-than-si gnificant impact regarding the ability of the Alameda County Sheriff's Office and the Alameda County Fire Department to provide adequate public services (police and fire protection/emergency medical services) to the Project Site and vicinity. Demand from reasonably foreseeable fu ture development within the area would be addressed case by case during the development and review of those developments, which will ensure that adequate services are available w ithin the cumulative context and that new or IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures K. Public Services Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.K-10 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 expanded facilities would not be required. Therefore, the effect of the Proposed Project, in combination with other past, present and reasonabl y foreseeable future development, would not be cumulatively significant. Mitigation: None required. _________________________ References - Public Services Alameda County, A New General Plan for Castro Valley, Existing Conditions Report , March 2005.

Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.L-1 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 L. Utilities and Service Systems This section evaluates the potential for the Proposed Project to result in impacts to water supply systems, wastewater disposal systems, storm water systems, and energy systems. Potential impacts and mitigation measures are identified, as necessary Utilities Not Analyzed in this EIR Utilities and service system topics not addressed in this EIR include solid waste services. The Initial Study determined that the Proposed Project would not introduce new residential uses and would not result in a substantial change in solid waste generated at the site compared to existing conditions. The Existing Eden Medical Center h as a recycling program in place and the amount of waste generated is expected to be redu ced over time with increased adherence to state- mandated reductions and the Castro Valley Sanita ry District's implementation of waste reduction and recycling programs. In addition, the Proposed Project would not be served by a landfill with insufficient capacity. This is a less-than-signifi cant impact, and these topics are not analyzed in this EIR. Setting This section examines the existing conditions relate d to the provision of water, wastewater, storm drainage facilities, electricity and natural gas, and telecommunications. Castro Valley is located in unincorporated Alameda County and relies on the East Bay Municipal Utilities District for water supply, the Castro Valley Sanitary District for wastewater collection and treatment, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) for natural gas and electricity, and AT&T for telecommunications. Water Supply and Infrastructure The East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD), a publicly owned utility, supplies water and provides wastewater treatment to parts of Alam eda and Contra Costa counties, including the unincorporated community of Castro Valley . EBMUD supplies water to approximately 1.3 million people within its estimated 331-square-mile service area. Water Supply System The EBMUD water supply system consists of a network of reservoirs, aqueducts, treatment plants, and distribution facilities. This networ k extends from its principal water source, the Mokelumne River Basin in the Sierra Nevada m ountain range, to water treatment plants or to reservoirs within its service area, and ultimately to residences and businesses in the East Bay. On average, 90 percent of the water delivered by EBMUD comes from the Mokelumne River watershed, with the remaining ten percent orig inating as runoff within the service area. EBMUD has water rights and facilities to divert up to a maximum of 325 million gallons of water per day (mgd), subject to the availability of Mokelumne Ri ver runoff and prior water rights of other users (EBMUD, 2005). IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures L. Utilities and Service Systems Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.L-2 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 EBMUD provides water service to the Castro Valley area from 15 pressure zones ranging in service elevation from 100 to 950 feet. The Bayview Pressure Zone, with a service elevation between 100 and 200 feet, serves the Existing Hospital (Kirkpatrick, 2008). Existing EBMUD facilities include 21 reservoirs and water tanks that provide water to Castro Valley, some adjacent unincorporated areas, and parts of the City of Hayward. As part of its Seismic Improvement Project, EBMUD recently completed construction of a new 11-mile long emergency transmission pipeline between Castro Valley and the San Ramon Valley that would provide an alternate water supply route after a major earthquake. EBMUD adopted an updated Urban Water Mana gement Plan (UWMP) in 2005. The UWMP provides an overview of EBMUD's water supply sources and usage and recycled and conservation programs. EBMUD does not anticipate any constraints to providing water to development in the existing built- out areas of Castro Valley. As part of its Pressure Zone Planning Program, EBMUD is conducting a series of studies to identify improvements that may be needed to serve pressure zones through 2030. Water Demand In early August 2008, EBMUD experienced an average demand of 234.7 mgd (EBMUD, 2008). In 2005, average daily water consumption among EBMUD customers was about 210 mgd. By 2030, EBMUD estimates that water demand will increase to approximately 281 mgd in its service area, although, with successful implementation of water recycling and conservation programs, this demand could be reduced to about 232 mgd (EBMUD, 2005). As discussed in EBMUD's Urban Water Manage ment Plan, EBMUD adopted a long-term Water Supply Management Program (WSMP) in 1993. The WSMP serves as a planning guide for the reliable provision of quality water to the EBMUD service area through 2020. The WSMP analysis indicates that during a severe drought, the current water supply is not sufficient to meet customer demand. An estimated supplemental suppl y need of 87 mgd of additional water supply (representing a 42 percent deficiency) would be need ed to limit the deficiency to 25 percent. To limit the water supply deficiency to 25 percent by 2020, a supplemental supply of 154 mgd (representing a 67 percent deficiency) would be needed. EBMUD anticipates that customer demand will continue to exceed supply during severe drought conditions until a supplemental water supply project is implemented and a de pendable supply is guaranteed for existing and future needs. To meet 2020 projected water needs and address deficient supply during severe droughts, EBMUD is working to identify supplemen tal water supplies, recycled water programs, and continued implementation of water conserva tion measures. Currently, domestic/fire water is provided to the Project Site by a water main in Stanton Avenue. Sanitary Sewer Service The Castro Valley Sanitary District (CVSD) pr ovides and maintains the sewage collection system that serves Castro Valley. Th e CVSD serves a population of approximately 55,000 and has a service area of about 13 square miles. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures L. Utilities and Service Systems Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.L-3 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Wastewater Collection and Treatment Sewage from the CVSD is treated under contract by the Oro Loma Sanitary District at the Oro Loma/Castro Valley Water Pollution Control Plant in San Lorenzo. The sewage collection system comprises approximately 155 miles of sewers and eight pumping plants. The current service area includes virtually all of the land within the voter-approved Urban Growth Boundary. CVSD is entitled to an average dry-weather flow of 5.0 million gallons per day (mgd) through the Oro Loma plant, which has a total capacity of 20 mgd and had an average dry-weather flow of 15 mgd in 2000. Daily dry-weather flows from the CVSD have recently been averaging 3.7 mgd and under drought conditions, 2.3 mgd. The treat ment plant discharges to San Francisco Bay through pipelines operated by the East Bay Dischar gers Authority. CVSD currently does not have a program for recycling its wastewater. The Exis ting Hospital is connected to a sewer main in Stanton Avenue. Stormwater Drainage Facilities Creeks, streams, and other surface water drainag es in the Castro Valley area originate in the upland areas of Mount Diablo and its foothills, gene rally to the north and east of Castro Valley, and flow downslope toward the San Francisco Bay. Drainage patterns within Castro Valley are shaped by the region's topography, which is st eeper in the foothills of the Diablo Range and gradually flattens onto an alluvial plain. The Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District (ACFCWCD) provides fl ood control services to Castro Valley and surrounding areas. Castro Valley lies in the San Lorenzo Creek Wate rshed, which includes Chabot, Castro Valley, Cull, and Crow Creeks. These creeks flow south from the foothills thorough Castro Valley and converge near the southern boundary of the Castro Valley Urban Area before entering San Lorenzo Creek, which flows west to Bay. Chabot Creek, which is enclosed in conduit beneath Lake Chabot Road, flows through Castro Valle y adjacent to the eastern boundary of the Project Site. An existing underground storm drain system serves the Project Site and connects to an ACFCWCD flood control line located in Lake Chabot Road. Energy Services Electricity and natural gas is provided to the Project Site by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E). Power is currently provided via existing high voltage overhead power lines located on Stanton Avenue. Gas is provided from existing high pressu re lines located in Stanton Avenue or Lake Chabot Road. PG&E expands its services on an as- needed basis and requires the user to fund the extension of service. Telecommunications AT&T provides telecommunications services to the Project Site. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures L. Utilities and Service Systems Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.L-4 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Regulatory Setting Federal and State Plans and Policies Safe Drinking Water Act The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) administers the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), the primary federal law that regulates the quality of drinking water and establishes standards to protect public health and safety. The California Department of Health Services (DHS) implements the SDWA and oversees public water system quality statewide. DHS establishes legal drinking water standards for cont aminates that could threaten public health. Senate Bill (SB) 610 / Senate Bill (SB) 221 Senate Bill (SB) 610, codified as Sections 10910- 10915 of the California Public Resources Code, requires local water providers to conduct a wa ter supply assessment for projects proposing over 500 housing units, 250,000 square feet of co mmercial office space (or more than 1,000 employees), a shopping center or business establishmen t with over 500,000 square feet (or more than 1,000 employees), or equivalent usage. Local water suppliers must also prepare or have already prepared an Urban Water Management Pl an (UWMP) to guide planning and development in the water supplier's service area, and specifica lly pursue efficient use of water resources. Issuance of a water supply assessment determinati on by the local water supplier for a proposed project verifies that the supplier has previously considered a proposed project in its UWMP and has adequate capacity to serve a project in a ddition to its existing service commitments, or alternatively, measures that would be requir ed to adequately serve the Propose Project. Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) The OSHPD is a department of the California Health and Human Services Agency. It serves as the building agency for hospitals and nursing homes in California, monitors the design and construction of inpatient facilities and assures c ode compliance in facility maintenance. OSHPD's primary goal in this regard is to ensure that pa tients in these facilities are safe in the event of an earthquake or other disaster, and that the facilities remain functional after such an event in order to meet the needs of the community affected by the disaster. OSHPD has no current regulations relative to sanitary sewer wastes. However starting in 2030, providing 72-hour service for both domestic water and sanitary sewer will be requi red for medical facilities under its purview. California Code of Regulations, Title 24 The State of California regulates energy consump tion under Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations for most buildings on the Project S ite, however, hospitals are exempt from these regulations due to energy needs to support life safety. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures L. Utilities and Service Systems Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.L-5 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Local Plans and Policies Castro Valley General Plan (1985) The 1985 Castro Valley Plan (General Plan) provides general policies a nd objectives to guide land use decisions and development throughout Alameda County, including the area in and around the Project Site. The following policies regarding utilities and services are included in the General Plan: Principle 2.1 : All development within the Castro Valley Urban Area shall be provided adequate basic urban services and facilities, including: roads; flood control; drainage, erosion and siltation control; water supply; g as and electric power; sewage and solid waste collection, treatment and disposal; educational services; library services; parks and recreation facilities and services; police protection; and fire protection. Principle 2.2 : Basic urban services to new and existing urban development shall normally be provided by existing public service agencies. New single purpose or limited purpose service districts or entities should not be established to serve new development. Private associations should normally not be assigned r esponsibilities for operation, maintenance or management of basic services, although special assessment entities may be formed to meet capital and ongoing operating and maintenance costs. Principle 3.3 : The quality of surface runoff from urba n development should be controlled to minimize contamination of surface waters (including creeks, streams, lakes, reservoirs, San Francisco Bay and its estuaries) and groundwaters. Principle 3.4 : The sanitary sewer system should be ad equately designed and maintained to ensure against intrusion of sewage waters in to surface and groundwaters and into the storm drainage system. Principle 3.21 : All uses should be designed and c onstructed, and where possible, retrofitted, to achieve maximum feasible energy conservation. Principle 4.18 : Surface runoff from new development should be controlled by onsite measures including but not limited to: a) struct ural controls and b) restrictions regarding changes in topography, removal of vegetation, creation of impervious surfaces, and periods of construction, such that the need for offs ite flood and drainage control improvements is minimized and such that runoff from the deve lopment will not result in downstream flood hazards. Impacts and Mitigation Measures Significance Criteria The impact of the Proposed Project on public services would be considered significant if it would exceed the following Standards of Significance, in accordance with Appendix G of the state CEQA Guidelines : Exceed wastewater treatment requirements of the applicable Regional Water Quality Control Board; IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures L. Utilities and Service Systems Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.L-6 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Require or result in the construction of new water or wastewater treatment facilities or expansion of existing facilities, the construc tion of which could cause significant physical environmental effects; Require or result in the construction of new st orm water drainage facilities or expansion of existing facilities, the construction of which could cause significant physical environmental effects; Have sufficient water supplies available to serve the project from existing entitlements and resources, or are new or e xpanded entitlements needed; Result in a determination by the wastewater treatment provider that serves or may serve the project that it has inadequate capacity to serve the project's projected demand in addition to the provider's existing commitments; Violate applicable federal, state and local statutes and regulations relating to energy standards; or Result in a determination by the energy provide r which serves or may serve the project that it does not have adequate capacity to serve the project's projected demand in addition to the providers' existing commitments and require or result in construction of new energy facilities or expansion of existing facilities, construction of which could cause significant environmental effects. As noted above, the Proposed Pr oject was analyzed for potential im pacts to utilities in an Initial Study published May 1, 2008. The Initial Study determined that im pacts to solid waste services would not result in a significant impact, and therefore are not discussed in this EIR. Water Supply Impact UTIL-1: The Proposed Project woul d not exceed water supplies available to serve the Proposed Project from existing entitlements and resources, nor require or result in construction of water facilities or expansion of existing facilities, construction of which could cause significant environmental effects. (Less than Significant) Development of the Proposed Project would ha ve an approximately 20 percent net increase in total building floor square footage on the Project Site at buildout (287,734 compared to 342,664 sq.ft.) (see Table III-1 ). The land uses would remain the same - medical office buildings and hospital use. The New Hospital would be comp arable in floor area to the Existing Hospital and Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital. There w ould be added floor area and usage attributable to the New MOB, but reduced residential area and us age attributable to the Pine Cone Apartments complex. Although the Proposed Project would slightly increase total landscaped area by approximately 10 percent (approximately 199,216 co mpared to 218,720 sq.ft.), irrigation use is not estimated to change substantially, particul arly given landscape water conservation measures and drought tolerant landscaping that would be implemented. Therefore, water demand from the Proposed Project use would remain substantially the same as the existing condition on the Project Site and would not require new or expanded water supply services or physical utilities.

Landscaping water conservation techniques include use of drought resistant plants , minimization of lawn areas, hydro-zoning to minimize overwatering, utilization of high efficiency irrigation projects, installation of a dedicated irrigation water meter(s), and the use of evapotranspiration irrigation controllers with rain sensors. Interior water conservation measures include use of touch-free faucets and low-flow toilets in public restrooms. Domestic/fire water would be provided by a ne w water main shall be provided for the New Hospital. The new service line shall extend betw een existing public water mains located in Stanton Avenue and Lake Chabot Road, providing a separate source of domestic and fire water for the New Hospital and the New MOB. It is an ticipated that the existing water service main, located in Stanton Avenue and serving the Exis ting Hospital, will be abandoned upon demolition of the Existing Hospital. The Lake Chabot Road water main would continue to be used as the backup to the Project Site. Also, it is anticipated that the existing high pressure gas lines located in Stanton Avenue or Lake Chabot Road would c ontinue to serve the Project Site. New electrical service shall be provided for the Proposed Project. Landscape irrigation water would be obtained from either the main in Stanton Avenue or Lake Chabot Road and would be separately metered. EBMUD does not currently provide recycled water that could be used for irrigation purposes. The Propose Project would not exceed existing or pr ojected water supplies or result in the need for new or expanded water facilities. Mitigation: None required. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures L. Utilities and Service Systems Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.L-8 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Impact UTIL-2: The Proposed Project would not result in increased generation of wastewater at the Project Site or result in the construction of new wastewater treatment facilities or expansion of existing facilities, th e construction of which could cause significant environmental effects. (Less than Significant) As indicated in Table IV.L-2 below, implementation of the Proposed Project would result in a reduction of wastewater generated at the Project Site. TABLE IV.L-2 ESTIMATED EXISTING AND FUTURE WASTEWATER GENERATION a Eden Medical Center b Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital Pine Cone Apartments TOTAL Existing 54,000 4,500 7,000 65,500 Project 41,000 -- -- 41,000 a Gallons per day b Includes MOBs SOURCE: Capital Engineering Consultants, Inc., 2008b The existing sanitary sewer lines located under ex isting streets would continue to serve the Project Site. A new sanitary sewer lateral will be provided from the New Hospital to the existing sewer main located in Stanton Avenue. The ex isting sanitary sewer lateral would be removed and/or abandoned in accordance with Castro Valley Sanitary Sewer District (CVSD) requirements upon demolition of the Existing Hospital. Although the Proposed Project may be required to extend or enlarge existing onsite sewer lines to serve the New Hospital and the New MOB that could result in construction impacts, those impacts would be considered less than signifi cant with implementation of mitigation measures identified throughout this EIR in Section. Mitigation: None required. _________________________ Stormwater Drainage Impact UTIL-3: The Proposed Project would no t require or result in construction of new stormwater drainage facilities or expansion of ex isting facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental effects. (Less than Significant) The Proposed Project would not increase stormwater runoff volume that would result in the need for new or expanded stormwater drainage facilities. As discussed in Section IV.I, Hydrology and IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures L. Utilities and Service Systems Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.L-9 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Water Quality , a Preliminary Storm Water Control Plan has been prepared by the Project Sponsor, which identifies the need for desi gn measures that would accommodate runoff from buildings and paved areas. The plan states that runoff would be collected and conveyed to a variety of best management practices (BMPs) such as vegetated swales, vegetated buffer strips, sand media filters, flow-through planters, and bi oretention areas. All BMPs would be designed and constructed in accordance with the Alameda Countywide Clean Water Program Stormwater C.3 Technical Guidebook . The Preliminary Storm Water Control Plan does not indicate the number of treatment areas that would be required or their location. In addition, the plan does not demonstrate that a specific BMP is appropriately sized to accommodate and treat runoff from the area the BMP is intended to serve. Implementation of Mitigation Measures HYD-3 and HYD-4 would require the Project Sponsor to prepare a Final Storm Water Control Plan that specifies treatment and control measure to manage storm wa ter runoff as part of the overall site design. Pursuant Mitigation Measures HYD-3 and HYD-4, th e Project Sponsor shall submit the final plan to Alameda County and the Regional Water Qua lity Control Board (RWQCB) for review and approval and shall implement the approved Final Storm Water Control Plan throughout the life of the Propose Project. As discussed under Impact HYD-4 regarding the potential for increased stormwater runoff and resulting flooding, pre liminary engineering projects that the Proposed Project will not increase runoff to the drainage collection and conveyance system compared to existing conditions. In addition, BMPs for cons truction, operations and maintenance will be adopted as part of the Final Storm Water Contro l Plan and their implementation will ensure no substantial increase in stormwater flows will r esult from the Project to require new or expanded stormwater facilities. The impact would be less than significant. Mitigation: None required. _________________________ Energy Use Impact UTIL-4: The Proposed Project would not violate regulations relating to energy standards; exceed available capacity of the loca l energy provider; or re quire construction or expansion of existing facilities, the cons truction of which could cause significant environmental effects. (Less than Significant) The Proposed Project would construct a New Hospital and a New MOB on the Project Site. The New Hospital would be slightly smaller than the Existing Hospital and would also be expected to utilize more energy efficient equipment and syst ems. Approximately 60,000 sq. ft. more medical office space use would result from demolition of the Eden Professional Center buildings and construction of the New MOB, which would increase energy use by the Proposed Project. However, the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospita l and Pine Cone Apartment complex would be demolished as part of the Proposed Project and would not be replaced, resulting in a reduced demand for energy. IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures L. Utilities and Service Systems Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.L-10 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 As described in detail in the Project Description in Chapter III of this EIR, the Proposed Project includes sustainable design components that will be incorporated into the design, construction, and operation of proposed buildi ngs. These include reuse of a previously developed site with existing infrastructure; increased pervious surface area and landscaping to reduce the heat island effect; recycling and reuse of concrete and meta ls from deconstruction of the Existing Hospital; glass coatings on the New Hospital to reduce ener gy usage; low-emitting and low VOC materials where appropriate; solar shading on exterior wi ndows; roofing material selected to reduce the heat island effect; and the incorporation of \"gr een roof\" areas. Other energy-saving components may include high efficiency mechanical and elect rical equipment; Energy Star office equipment; and an automated building management syst em to control operation of power, HVAC, and lighting systems. The Project Sponsor is pursuing a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver certification level fo r the Proposed Project and has incorporated the above measures (most of which are discussed in greater detail in the Project Description, Chapter III) support that goal.1 Overall, the level of public energy required of the Proposed Project would not be expected to violate applicable federal, state and local statut es and regulations relating to energy standards or exceed PG&E's service capacity or require new or expanded facilities. The Proposed Project would be required to comply with all energy standards and regulations established by OSHPD for hospital buildings, and all other bui lding be subject to the standards of Title 24 of the California Code of Regulation. The design and operation of all structures on the Project Site would be aimed at the incorporation of energy-conserving design and construction. In addition, any improvements and extensions to the existing PG&E infrastru cture onsite required to accommodate the Propose Project would be determined in consultation with PG&E prior to installation. As a result, the Propose Project would not result in a significant impa ct related to the provisi on of energy services. Mitigation: None required. _________________________ Cumulative Impacts Impact UTIL-5: The Proposed Project in co mbination with other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects, would not result in cumulative impacts on utilities and service systems. (Less than Significant) Water Supply The Proposed Project, in conjunction with reasonably foreseeable future projects, could result in a cumulative increase in demand for water service. However, as discussed in the above analysis, the Proposed Project would not exceed water suppli es available to serve the Proposed Project, nor 1 LEED is a Green Building Rating System developed by the U.S. Green Building Council. Silver is the second highest of four possible certification levels available for new construction an d renovation projects, based on a point- based scoring for specified pre-requisite sustainabl e elements (www.usgbc.org ). IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures L. Utilities and Service Systems Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.L-11 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 cause significant environmental effects due the c onstruction of new or expanded water facilities. Additionally, the increases in demand attributab le to other future development would be addressed on a site-by-site basis by EBMUD prio r to approval of new development (through the ESA process for larger projects). All future project s would be required to comply with County ordinances and polices regarding water supply, as well as water conservation measures, and wherever feasible, participate in water recy cling programs established by EBMUD to address effects of severe drought. Development of the Propose Project and other future projects may involve improvements to existing water utility li nes and may result in construction impacts. Construction related impacts are addressed throughout this EIR and would address any construction activities related to water utilities. Ov erall, the effect of the Proposed Project on water supply, in combination with other foresee able projects would be less than significant. Sanitary Sewer Facilities The Proposed Project, in conjunction with reasonably foreseeable future projects, could result in a cumulative increase in sewage generation, r esulting in increased demand on the wastewater treatment facility serving the Project Site. Howeve r, it is not anticipated that the wastewater demands of the project combined with future projects in Castro Valley would result in the CVSD's capacity to serve the project's projected demand in addition to its existing commitments within its service area. Other foreseeable future projects would be required to comply with the County's programs and ordinances regarding adequa te function and capacity of the sanitary sewer system. As previously stated, any construction rela ted effects that may result from future projects' improvements to existing sanitary sewer facilities are addressed by other mitigation measures in this EIR. Overall, the effect of the Proposed Project on the need for new or expanded wastewater facilities, in combination with other foreseeable projects would be less than significant. Stormwater Drainage Facilities As discussed earlier in Section IV.I, Hydrology and Water Quality , the Propose Project would reduce the total impervious surface area and incr ease the total landscaped area. Furthermore, no major change in the total annual stormwater dischar ge from the site into the storm drain system is anticipated, due to the required implementation of stormwater management strategies, including the preparation of a final stormwater management plan and the use of BMPs. Foreseeable future projects would also be subject to all regulat ory requirements and programs aimed to reduce impacts on the area storm drain system, including compliance with the County's stormwater guidelines; thus the Proposed Project, in conjunctio n with reasonably foreseeable future projects, would not result in a cumulative increase in stor mwater runoff, requiring the need for new or expanded stormwater drainage facilities. Energy Despite annual statewide increases in energy c onsumption, development of the Propose Project and other reasonably foreseeable future projects in the County, which is mostly already served by gas and electricity infrastructure, and the net increased power demand from these projects relative to the regional service area, would be minimal and not require expanded or new power facilities IV. Environmental Setting, Im pacts, and Mitigation Measures L. Utilities and Service Systems Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.L-12 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 as a direct result of project development. Further, all future project would be required to comply with all standards of Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations, (or other similar building codes that would apply to residential and/or co mmercial developments), or OSHPD standards for future hospital developments in the area. Therefor e, the effect of the Proposed Project on energy consumption levels, in combin ation with other foreseeable projects, would be less than significant. Mitigation: None required. _________________________ References - Utilities and Service Systems Alameda County, A New General Plan for Castro Valley, Existing Conditions Report , March 2005.

Environmental Impact, Settin g, and Mitigation Measures Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.M-1 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 M. Population, Housing, and Employment The section describes the local area's existing and projected population, employment and housing conditions, and evaluates the poten tial population and housing impacts of the Proposed Project. Setting Existing Population Characteristics The unincorporated community of Castro Valley is located in Alameda County north of City of Hayward and east of the City of San Leandro. The Project Site is located within Castro Valley's central business district. The Project Site is near Castro Valley's primary commercial corridor of Castro Valley Boulevard and accessed by the major secondary road of Lake Chabot Road. The Eden Medical Center is the major local employer for the area. The U.S. Census provides the most detailed pop ulation and socio-demographic for the project area. Castro Valley is recognized as a census -designated place (CDP) by the U.S. Census Bureau.1 Table IV.M-1 shows the historical population trends for Castro Valley and Alameda County as a whole. According to the 2000 Census , Castro Valley's population was 57,292, nearly 18-percent increase from its 1990 Census estimate an d more than a 25-percent increase since the last General Plan update in 1985. Between 1990 an d 2000, Castro Valley's growth rate exceeded the Alameda County growth rate. Castro Valley's estimated population increase of over 8,600 residents during this period was great er than any other of the County's other unincorporated areas. However, the rate of pop ulation growth in Castro Valley since 2000 has slowed. The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) estimates the 2005 population of Castro Valley at 59,100 (ABAG, 2007). 2 TABLE IV.M-1 HISTORICAL POPULATION GROWTH FOR CASTRO VALLEY AND ALAMEDA COUNTY (1980 to 2000) 1980 1990 2000 % Change (1980 to1990) % Change (1990 to 2000) Castro Valley census-designated place (CDP) - does not include the Five Canyons community.

CD Ps are communities that lack separate municipal government, but which otherw ise physically resemble incorporated places. 2 U.S. Census and ABAG demographi c data does not include the Five Canyons community. The community is outside the Census determined boundary of the Castro Va lley CDP. ABAG reports the Five Canyons community as part of the Cherryland-Fairview sub-region. Accord ing to the 2000 Census, the Five Canyons community population was approximately 2,900 (i.e. Block Group 1, Census Tract 4351.01, Alameda County). IV. Environmental Impact, Settin g, and Mitigation Measures M. Population, Housing, and Employment Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.M-2 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 The total population of Alameda County in 2000 was 1,443,741. Between 1990 and 2000, Alameda County's population grew by more than 12.9 percent \u2014 equivalent to more than a 1.2-percent annual growth rate. Table IV.M-2 presents the key population and househol d characteristics for Castro Valley and Alameda County. Households in Castro Valley are typically smaller, older, and wealthier than households countywide or in nearby unincorporat ed communities. The 2000 Census reported that there were 21,606 households in Castro Valley w ith an average household size of 2.58 persons which was virtually unchanged from 1980 when h ouseholds averaged 2.53 persons. During the same period the median age of Castro Valley resi dents has increased from 35.5 in 1980 to 39.4 in 2000 which is far older than the countywide aver age. The increasing proportion of older adults living in Castro Valley is likely due to an increasing number of Castro Valley's long-time residents choosing to remain in the community while the rate of population increase from in-migration and natural increase has been somewhat lower than the county-wide average (County of Alameda, 2005). TABLE IV.M-2 POPULATION AND HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS FOR CASTRO VALLEY AND ALAMEDA COUNTY - 2000 Castro Valleya Alameda County Total Population 57,292 1,443,741 Median Age 39.4 34.5 Households 21,606 540,183 Average Household Size 2.58 2.71 Median Income 2000 (adjusted to 2008b) $64,874 ($80,444) $55,946 ($69,373) a Castro Valley census-designated place (CDP) b Income adjusted into 2008 dollar terms using the Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers. SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000; U.S. Depa rtment of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2008. Income and Employment Castro Valley is a predominantly residential \"bedroom\" community with substantially more employed residents than jobs. Household incom es for Castro Valley residents are considerably higher than the Alameda County average. The est imated average household income of Castro Valley households in 2000 was $64,876 per year (equivalent to $80,444 in 2008 dollars terms). The median income of Castro Valley househol ds increased 42 percent from its 1990 levels. Although the average Alameda County household experienced a nearly 50-percent increase over the same period, the median income for all Al ameda County residents remains almost 16 percent IV. Environmental Impact, Settin g, and Mitigation Measures M. Population, Housing, and Employment Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.M-3 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 lower than Castro Valley's residents. In 2002 the comparable average household income for the Alameda County residents was $55,946 (equivale nt to $69,373 in 2008 dollars terms). Nonetheless, Alameda County's average household income is approximately 17.8 percent higher than the comparable average household income of $47,493 for all California residents. Table IV.M-3 shows the estimated past unemployment rates for both the Castro Valley and Alameda County between 2000 and 2007. Since 1980 , job growth within Castro Valley has been higher than its population growth but its jobs-to- housing ratio remains at only 0.55 compared to the Alameda County proportion of 1.34 jobs to employed residents. More than half of the jobs based in Castro Valley are in th e health, education and recreation employment sectors which is indicative of Eden Medical Center's current im portance to the local economy. The Eden Medical Center is the largest employer in Castro Valley with nearly 1,000 employees. It is a sub-regional employment center that attracts additional medical related business employment including medical offices, medical support facilities, nur sing homes, and other related uses. Hospital employees also help support local stores and restaurants (County of Alameda, 2007). TABLE IV.M-3 EMPLOYMENT FOR CASTRO VALLEY AND ALAMEDA COUNTY (2000 - 2007) Castro Valleya Alameda County Year Labor Force Employment % Unemployed Labor Force Employment % Unemployed 2000 31,800 California Employment Development Depar tment, Labor Force and Unemployment Data, 2008. There are also a considerable proportion of Cast ro Valley jobs in the financial and professional services sectors (18.8 percent) and a comparatively low number of retail jobs. Most of the local employment is clustered within the Castro Valley Central Business district and along major corridors such as Redwood Road, Grove Way a nd East Castro Valley Boulevard. During last the seven years, Castro Valley's un employment rate has remained comparatively low and consistently been more than 40 percent lo wer than the County-wide average. Except for the 2002 to 2003 period when its unemployment levels were comparable to statewide unemployment levels, Alameda County's unemployment rate h as consistently been well below corresponding statewide unemployment rates (California Em ployment Development Department, 2008). IV. Environmental Impact, Settin g, and Mitigation Measures M. Population, Housing, and Employment Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.M-4 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Housing Conditions The current housing conditions in Castro Valley are shown in Table IV.M-4 . In 2000, the U.S. Census reported a total of 22,046 housing units located in Castro Valley.3 This represented approximately a 9 percent growth in the area's hous ing stock since 1990. Compared to the rest of Alameda County, Castro Valley has a higher pr oportion of owner occupied housing (nearly 70 percent) and similarly has a lower housing vacancy rate. Single-family detached residences are the predominant form of housing in Castro Va lley accounting for more than 70 percent of the region's housing stock while 15.4 percent of the Castro Valley's households live in apartment buildings (i.e., multi-units buildings of 5 or more units). TABLE IV.M-4 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOUSING STOCK, CASTRO VALLEY AND ALAMEDA COUNTY, 2000 Castro Valley a Alameda County Number of Units Percent Number of Units Percent Units in Structure 1 unit, detached 15,689 71.2% 2,961 13.4% home, trailer, or Total Housing Units housing units 440 16,817 3.1% a Castro Valley census-designated place (CDP) SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, the estimated median price for housing in Castro Valley was $298,300 ($369,892 in 2008 dollar terms) which was very comparable to the median house price for Alameda County of $303,100 ($375,844 in 2008 dollars). Castro Valley home values are considerably higher than those of the surrounding incorporated or unincorporated communities. Between 2000 and 2006, there was a major appr eciation in housing price throughout the Bay Area (and California in general). While elsewhe re in California most home prices have subsequently declined from their peak values duri ng the last couple of years, home prices in the Bay Area and Alameda County have generally re mained relatively unchanged. In March 2008, the median home price in Alameda County was $598,000 - an estimated 3.8-percent increase 3 The Castro Valley housing estimate does not include the approximately 1,000 housing units located in the nearby Five Canyons development. IV. Environmental Impact, Settin g, and Mitigation Measures M. Population, Housing, and Employment Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.M-5 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 from March 2007, however, the median has likely declined as of preparation of this EIR in November 2008 (East Bay Business Times, 2008). Population, Housing, and Job Projections The Projections Research staff of the Association of Bay Area Government (ABAG) is responsible for producing socio economic projections a nd developing, refining and maintaining the agency's regional and small area forecasting models. The Projections Research staff work closely with the California Department of Fina nce (DOF), sub-regions, local jurisdictions, the public and other major stakeholders to develop their population forecasts. As shown in Table IV.M-5 , ABAG projects that Alameda Count y's future population will increase to 1,700,700 in 2020 and to 1,858,800 by 2030. Betw een 2005 and 2030, the County population is projected to increase at a rate of approximately 0.85 percent per year. In contrast, Castro Valley's population is expected to grow at a pproximately half that annual rate (0.44 percent) resulting in an additional 6,900 residents when its population reaches 66,000 in 2030. TABLE IV.M-5 POPULATION, HOUSEHOLD AND JOBS PROJ ECTIONS FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY AND ITS UNINCORPORATED AREAS, 2005 TO 2030 Geographic Area 2005 2020 2030 2005 - 2020 Change 2005 - 2020 Annual Rate 2005 - 2030 Change 2005 - 2030 Annual Rate Total Population Castro Valley 59,100 0.64 Alameda County 1.34 1.47 1.61 NOTE: The number of households is equivalent to the number of occupied housing units. SOURCE: ABAG, 2008. Future increases in the number of households in both Castro Valley and Alameda County are projected to be very similar to their respectiv e expected growth in population. Consequently, Castro Valley is expected to add 2,570 new house holds resulting in a total of 24,740 households in 2030. Over the same period Alameda Count y is expected to add approximately 127,910 additional households so that in 2030 its tota l number of households will be 671,790. IV. Environmental Impact, Settin g, and Mitigation Measures M. Population, Housing, and Employment Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.M-6 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 In 2005, Castro Valley had a relative shortage of jobs for its residents (represented by the 0.55 jobs-to-housing ratio) while Alameda County' s corresponding ratio of 1.34 indicates a more balanced proportion of jobs for its residents. As shown in Table IV.M-5 , the rate of future local job growth is projected to be greater than the future population growth. As a result, both Castro Valley's and Alameda County's job-to-housing ratios are expected to increase from their 2005 values. In 2030, Castro Valley's projected job an d population growth is expected to result in 0.64 jobs-to-housing while Alameda County's will increase to 1.61. Both the current and future relationship be tween Castro Valley's population and local employment still shows a need for greater local em ployment today and for the foreseeable future. Due to the comparative lack of existing local j ob opportunities, despite relatively strong projected future job growth Castro Valley residents will n eed to continue commuting for work within the County and the greater region. Regulatory Setting Federal and State Policies No federal or state policies or regulations related to populations or housing are applicable to the Proposed Project. Local Plans and Policies This section summarizes relevant policies for population and housing contained in both most recent approved and draft applicable planning documents. Key relevant planning documents include the 1985 Castro Valley Plan (General Plan) , the Draft Castro Valley General Plan Update (2007 Draft General Plan Update ) as well as more specific redevelopment planning for the unincorporated areas of Alameda County (incl uding the Castro Valley's cent ral business district). Castro Valley General Plan (1985) The General Plan was adopted by the Alameda Board of Supervisors in April 1985. The General Plan serves as a general policy guide for public and private decisions affecting development of the Castro Valley area. It was prepared as part of the County of Alameda General Plan. While the General Plan is the most recent adopted planning document for the entire Castro Valley community, more specific and detailed planning re lating to the project has been adopted in the subsequent Castro Valley Central Business District Specific Plan (Specific Plan ) (County of Alameda, 1993). Currently, an update to the General Plan is under development by the Alameda County Community Development Agency as the 2007 Draft General Plan Update (County of Alameda, 2007). Castro Valley Central Business District Specific Plan (1993) The purpose of the Specific Plan (County of Alameda, 1993) is to guide future public and private actions within the Castro Valley Central Busin ess District. The Plan provides a comprehensive framework for County policies and regulations regarding development, including land use, IV. Environmental Impact, Settin g, and Mitigation Measures M. Population, Housing, and Employment Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.M-7 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 circulation, design, and infrastructure within th e plan area. The Plan takes the general policies which the Castro Valley Plan established for th e downtown commercial area, expands them and puts them into a regulatory form. It also provides for more specific implementation measures and programs than those identified by the General Plan . The General Plan is part of the Alameda County General Plan while the Specific Plan is an implementation measure for the General Plan . The most relevant of the Specific Plan's planning goals to the project's potential population and housing issues is that \"employment opportuniti es in the Business District should increase\" (Goal G). The Specific Plan also provides land use policies and regulations for planning subareas within the Central Business District. The Specific Plan's land use policies and regulations are intended to refine the more General Plan policies and thereby enhance the Central Business District's competitiveness and diversify its goods, services and businesses. The Proposed Project is located within Suba rea 4 (Lake Chabot Road - Hospital/Medical- Oriented Office and Retail). The primary devel opment objective for Subarea 4 identified by the Specific Plan is: Development in this subarea shall be orient ated toward the existing concentration of medical and related facilities or adjacent high density residential development. Businesses and services which would benefit from proximity to the medical facilities such as medical laboratories or congregate care facilities, and businesses which can draw clientele from hospital businesses are specifically encouraged. County of Alameda Housing Element (2001) The County of Alameda's goals and objec tives for housing development within the unincorporated areas are the same as those identif ied in the County's 1990 Housing Element. The plan's goals, objectives and principals potentiall y relevant to the Proposed Project consist of: Goals Provide Adequate and Affordable Housing Objective 1 : To ensure a supply of good quality h ousing for persons and households of varying lifestyles, sexual preference, inco me and age groups, and handicapped persons, who choose to live in the unincorporated communities. Principal 1.1 : A mix of affordable housing should be provided consistent with the needs of all income groups. Priority should be given to maintaining and improving the supply of housing available to low and moderate-income households. Concentrations of subsidized housing should be avoided. Encourage Housing Preservation and Rehabilitation Objective 2 : To ensure a supply of sound housing units in safe and attractive residential neighborhoods. Principal 2.1 : The quality of residential neighbor hoods should be maintained and improved. Incompatible residential and non-residential projects should be excluded where they would significantly impair desi rable residential qualities. Public facilities IV. Environmental Impact, Settin g, and Mitigation Measures M. Population, Housing, and Employment Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.M-8 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 in and services to residential areas should be adequately maintained and, where necessary, improved. Draft Castro Valley Redevelopment Strategic Plan (2006) In July 2004, the Alameda County Community Development Agency began the process of devising a Redevelopment Strategic Plan for Castro Valley's \"downtown\" - specifically focusing on the Castro Valley Boulevard Corridor. The pla nning effort is occurring simultaneously with the 2007 Draft General Plan Update . The Redevelopment Strategic Plan is intended to present an economic development strategy and streetscape d esign that will enhance the economic potential of the Central Business District, consistent with the General Plan's broader goals, objectives, and policies. The Project Site is located adjacent to the Redevelopment Strategic Plan area, but is not located within the area. The goals of the Redevelopment Strategic Plan are to construct a development strategy and urban design that will define a vision for fully realiz ing Castro Valley's futu re economic potential and help to prioritize redevelopment spending. The plan's objectives are to create: a downtown where people want to go and spend time; an envir onment that will support economic vitality; and pedestrian friendly main street atmosphere for the area. Draft Castro Valley General Plan (2007) Alameda County is currently undertaking a comprehensive update of the General Plan . The 2007 Draft General Plan Update serves as the blueprint for future growth and development in the unincorporated areas of County of Alameda. Count y policies and programs related specifically to housing issues are contained in the Housing Element component of the General Plan which was last updated and approved in October 2001. Future non-residential development is proposed to be concentrated on the areas adjacent to \"The Boulevard\" (Castro Valley Boulevard, the area's main commercial street). A critical component of this planning effort is development of appr oaches to promote the development of a vibrant town center offering a range of retail goods and services and public facilities, as well as additional housing and employment. The 2007 Draft General Plan Update recognizes the central importance that the Eden Medical Center plays in the Castro Valley community and its economy. Per State Law mandate, the Eden Medical Center must rebuild its main hospital by 2013 to comply with State seismic safety standards. Consequently, the plan identifies pla nning goals and policies to ensure development of a modern and attractive professional medical distri ct at the current location. The proposed goals and policies specifically related to local population and housing impacts include: Goal 4.8-1 : Upgrade and modernize Eden Medical Center (Sutter Medical Center Castro Valley) in order to provide health services a nd jobs for the community. Design the hospital site and surrounding sites in the Professional-Me dical District to achieve the community's goals for improving the area along Lake Chabot Road and to minimize any negative effects on surrounding properties. IV. Environmental Impact, Settin g, and Mitigation Measures M. Population, Housing, and Employment Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.M-9 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Policy 4.8-1: Modernize Eden Medical Center. Continue to modernize and upgrade Eden Medical Center so that it serves as a cataly st for health-related development around the hospital, provides jobs for Castro Valley resident s, and supports local retail and restaurants. Policy 4.8-3: Vibrant Medical District on Lake Chabot Road. Encourage medical office and commercial development on Lake Chabot Road that improves the area's appearance and creates a vibrant district with employment, restaurants, retail, and personal services. Policy 4.8-4: Protect Surrounding Residential. Plan new development to minimize adverse effects on surrounding residential areas. Policy 4.8-5: Medical-related uses and Local Services. Allow a variety of health-related professional and technical support uses, nursing homes, retail, restaurants, and services to meet the needs of employees and residents. Impacts and Mitigation Measures Significance Criteria In accordance with Appendix G of the state CEQA Guidelines , the impact of the Proposed Project on population and housing would be considered significant if it would: Induce substantial population growth in a manner not contemplated in the General Plan , either directly (for example, by proposing new housing and businesses) or indirectly (for example, through extension of roads or other infrastructure); Displace substantial numbers of existi ng housing necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere; or Displace substantial numbers of people, necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere. A project could induce population growth in an area either directly or indirectly. The development of new businesses c ould induce population growth dir ectly while the extension of roads or other infrastructure could attract popul ation growth indirectly by facilitating other residential or commercial development to the surrounding and previously less developed area. The population and hous ing impact analysis assesses the impact of population and employment changes associated with the Proposed Project in the context of other population growth and increases in the housing supply expected in C astro Valley and other unincorporated areas of Alameda County. Methodology and Assumptions The analysis estimates the expected new employme nt and residential population associated with the Proposed Project to determine the magnitude of the new population of residents that could be potentially attracted to the area by the project's new employment opportunities and housing. IV. Environmental Impact, Settin g, and Mitigation Measures M. Population, Housing, and Employment Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.M-10 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Impacts and Mitigation Measures Impact POP-1: Implementation of the Proposed Project would not induce population to Castro Valley. (Less than Significant) The Proposed Project is designed primarily to meet the seismic requirements necessary for the continued operation of the medical facilities at the current site. While major upgrades and improvements to the facilities are planned, th e New Hospital will have 46 fewer licensed in- patient beds than the Existing Hospital. Total New Hospital population (doctors patients, and other employees) is not projected to cha nge from existing conditions - approximately 1,343 persons (see Table III-1 in Chapter III, Project Description), however, there will be some growth associated with the New MOB. Currently, Castro Valley is predominately a \"bedroom\" community and as such is undergoing concerted efforts to maintain and attract local job opportunities. The existing Medical Center is the community's major employer and local planning has long anticipated the need for redevelopment of its medical facilities. Both the Castro Valley Central Business District Plan (1993) and the 2007 Draft Castro Valley General Plan promote redevelopment of the Eden Medical Center as important community goals. Consequently redevelopment of the medical facilities has been long anticipated and planned. The small decrease (approximately 9 percent) in the number of employees at the New Hospital would not result in a substantial population decline in Castro Valley. Similarly, the total increase on the site that will result with the addition of the New MOB would not create a notable increase to the area. The limited local job opportunities currently available within Castro Valley reduces the likelihood that the Proposed Project would a ttract a substantial number of new area residents not previously contemplated for the area. Comp ared to the community's total population of approximately 57,000 residents, the potential proj ect-related job reduction wo uld have not have a significant effect on Castro Valley's housing supp ly conditions. Therefore, project-related change in on-site population, or employees in particular, at the Project Site would have a less than significant impact regarding the inducement of substantial new population Castro Valley. Mitigation: None required. ___________________________ Impact POP-2: Implementation of the Proposed Project would not displace substantial numbers of existing housing and residents nec essitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere. (Less than Significant) The Proposed Project would require the removal of 42 existing apartments at the Pine Cone Apartment complex. The complex is comprised of one and two bedroom apartments except for the single three-bedroom unit occupied by the resident manager. All of the units are rented at market rate - none are restricted units for lower income households. IV. Environmental Impact, Settin g, and Mitigation Measures M. Population, Housing, and Employment Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.M-11 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 The average household size in Castro Valley is es timated to be 2.58 according to the current available demographic data for the community . Based on this community-wide proportion of resident per household, it can be conservatively es timated that the total number of residents that would potentially be displaced by the removal of the Pine Cone Apartment complex would be 106 people. However, given that a major proportio n of the apartments are one-bedroom units, the actual residential population is likely considerably less than 106 people. As shown in Table IV.M-4, the most recent occupancy information for the community identified approximately 440 vacant housing units and the lost housing would correspond to a less than 10-percent decrease to the vacant housing inventory. Since the current housing is at market rates, it can reasonably be expected that the reside nts will be able to find alternative housing - especially since the current tenants have been provided with both required notice and financial assistance to facilitate their relocation. The most recent County of Alameda Housing El ement currently anticipates and is planning for additional housing development to meet the commun ity's projected future growth in population. While the loss of 42 housing units will slightly reduce the local total housing inventory, the magnitude of the reduction is relatively limited and the community's future housing needs will not be substantially changed by the additional demand for housing from the displaced housing. The Sutter Medical Center is the community's major employer and local planning has long anticipated the need for redevelopmen t of its medical facilities. Both the Castro Valley Central Business District Specific Plan (1993) and the Draft Castro Valley General Plan Update promote redevelopment of the Sutter Medical Center as important community goals. Consequently, the minor loss of housing has been anticipated by local planners and it would not have a substantial impact on the local community. Therefore the imp act of the potential project-related displacement of housing and residents is less than significant. Mitigation: None required. _________________________ Cumulative Impacts Impact POP-3: The Proposed Project, combined with the effects of other past, present and reasonably foreseeable projects future projects, could induce population to the community and displace housing and residents from the community. (Less than Significant) Current planning for the Castro Valley comm unity anticipates future population and housing growth that would accommodate considerable additional population in excess of any increases that might be associated with potential changes in employment on the Project Site. Therefore, there would be no significant cumulative impacts from unanticipated or adverse population growth from the Proposed Project and all other p ast, present or reasonably foreseeable projects in the area. IV. Environmental Impact, Settin g, and Mitigation Measures M. Population, Housing, and Employment Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project IV.M-12 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Similarly, current planning for the Castro Valley community anticipates future population and housing growth that would adequately accomm odate the project-related local housing demand impacts. The current housing inventory and pla nned future community development can easily absorb the project-related displacement of local residents from the loss of the 42 housing units at the Pine Cone Apartments necessary for redeve lopment of the Proposed Project. This would ensure that there would be no significant cumulative impacts from displaced housing and residents associated with the Proposed Project combined with past, preset and reasonably foreseeable projects. The impact would be less than significant. Mitigation: None required. _________________________ References - Population, Housing, and Employment Association of Bay Area Governments, Projections 2007 , 2007.

Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-1 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 CHAPTER V Alternatives A. Criteria for Selecting Alternatives The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires that an EIR compare the effects of a \"reasonable range of alternatives\" to the effect s of the project. The alternatives selected for comparison should be those that would attain most of the basic objectives of the project and avoid or substantially lessen one or more significant effects of the project (CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6). The \"range of alternatives\" is governed by the \"rule of reason\" which requires the EIR to set forth only those alternatives necessary to permit an informed and reasoned choice by the decision-making body and informed public participation (CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6[f]). CEQA generally defines \"feasible\" to mean an alte rnative that is capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, while also taking into account economic, environmental, social, technological, and legal factors. CEQA Guidelines The alternatives addressed in this EIR were selected based on the following factors: 1. The extent to which the alternative would accomplish most of the basic objectives of the Proposed Project (described in Chapter III, Project Description); 2. The extent to which the alternative would a void or lessen any of the identified potentially significant environmental effects of the Proposed Project (identified throughout Chapter IV, Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures); 3. The feasibility of the alternative, taking in to account site suitability, availability of infrastructure, property control (ownership), and consistency with applicable plans and regulatory limitations; 4. The extent to which an alternative contri butes to a \"reasonable range\" of alternatives necessary to permit a reasoned choice; and 5. The requirement of the CEQA Guidelines to consider a no project alternative and to identify an environmentally superior alterna tive in addition to the no-project alternative (CEQA Guidelines , Section 15126.6[e]). This chapter describes and discusses each of the sel ected alternatives as well as alternatives that were considered but not studied further in this EIR based on one or more of the aforementioned factors or requirements under CEQA. V. Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-2 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Project Objectives Relevant to Selection of Alternatives The SMCCV Project objectives are presented in Chap ter III, Project Description, of this Draft EIR. Of the comprehensive set of Project objectives developed by Alameda County in collaboration with the Project Sponsor, those most relevant to the selection and evaluation of alternatives to the Proposed Project address the ne w structures, program, and site design. They include the following: To replace the existing eight-story, 178-bed Existing Hospital with a new, modern, efficient, approximately 230,000 square foot and approximately 130-licensed-bed hospital with private, single-patient rooms in full compliance with SB 1953 deadlines and seismic safety requirements. Key hospital components in clude inpatient care, diagnostic treatment functions, emergency department with trauma services, a universal care unit and ancillary support services. To simultaneously construct a new, appr oximately 80,000 square-foot, four-story New MOB above ground-level parking, with a direct physical connection to the New Hospital at each of the four levels. The New MOB will house an ambulatory surgery center and many of the hospital's administrative functions, as well as medical offices and/or an urgent care clinic. By locating hospital-oriented physicians adjacent to the hospital with direct hospital access, the New MOB will help the Proposed Project meet mission-critical needs for outpatient, inpatient, and ancillary services. To continue to provide existing medical services, including acute care, emergency, and helicopter services, without interruption or significant reduction in access during the periods of construction. To ensure that the New Hospital is an effici ent and clinically safe environment by use of the latest best practices in hospital design, including: 1) all private inpatient rooms; 2) spatial layouts that promote the ability of staff to work with patients and decrease time spent in paperwork and support tasks; 3) optimal departmental adjacencies that promote safe patient flow throughout the hospital; and 4) adjacent siting of the helistop and the New MOB. To utilize the Existing Eden Medical Center Campus (and adjacent Pine Cone Apartment complex parcel) for the New Hospital a nd related facilities and improvements. To utilize existing site topography to minimize grading. To provide direct emergency vehicle and pub lic access to the Emergency Department with surface parking adjacent to the Emergency Department, precluding the need to navigate through the parking garage. To utilize the Laurel Grove Hospital site for additional surface parking. To provide adequate accessible parking, convenien tly located adjacent to the main entry for patients and visitors. To construct the New Hospital and New MOB construction staging areas without substantially interfering with existing campus operations. V. Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-3 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Significant and Unavoidable Impacts Relevant to Selection of Alternatives As indicated above, CEQA requires that the alternatives selected for comparison would avoid or substantially lessen one or more significant effects of the project. The analysis in this EIR determined that the SMCCV Project would result in the following significant and unavoidable impacts (i.e., generally impacts for which no f easible mitigations are identified to reduce the impact to less than significant): 2035 Traffic Intersection Operations Impacts Impact TRANS-3a: The signalized intersectio n of Castro Valley Boulevard/Strobridge Avenue/Stanton Avenue (#8) would operate at LOS F under 2035 No Project conditions. The intersection would continue to operate at LOS F with the addition of Proposed Project traffic and the Proj ect traffic would increase the westbound approach delay by more than four seconds during the AM peak hour. (Significant) Because the County has no existing plan, program, or design to mitigate this impact, implementation of an improvement is uncertain, and therefore the impact is considered significant and unmitigated. Also, if the improvements affect the operation of ramps to and/or from Interstate 580, the improvement will require both Caltrans and Federal Highway Administration approval and the impact would also therefore be considered to remain significant and unavoidable. Impact TRANS-3c: The westbound approach at the unsignalized intersection of Strobridge Avenue/I- 580 westbound off-ramp (#10) would operate at LOS F during the AM peak hour and LOS E during the PM peak hour under 2035 No Project conditions. The westbound approach would continue to operate at LOS E and F conditions respectively, with the addition of Proposed Project traffic. This is a significant impact because the intersection would operate at an unacceptable level, the project would add ten or more project trips to the intersection peak hour flow, and the intersection would meet the peak hour signal warrant (Warrant 3) without and with the project. (Significant) The traffic signal addition to the freeway ramp signal requires Caltrans approval and thus its implementation is not certain and the impact is therefore considered to remain significant and unavoidable. Impact TRANS-3d: The signalized intersection of Strobridge Avenue/I-580 EB Ramps/Gary Drive (#11) would operate at LOS E during the AM and PM peak hours under 2035 Without Project conditions. The intersection would continue to operate at LOS E with the addition of Project traffic. This is a significant impact because the Proposed Project would increase the total in tersection average delay by more then four seconds during the PM peak hour. (Significant) The traffic signal and cycle length timing changes to the freeway ramp signal require Caltrans approval and thus its implementation is not certain and the impact is therefore considered to remain significant and unavoidable. V. Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-4 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Noise Impacts Impact NOI-1 (Construction Noise ): Construction activities would intermittently and temporarily generate noise levels that would exceed the Alameda County Noise Ordinance. (Significant and Unavoidable) Impact NOI-1 is unavoidable because, while f easible mitigation measures are identified to reduce the temporary, project-level construc tion noise levels, the impact would remain significant given the intermittent overall duration of construction activities over approximately 4.5 years (or up to 6 years under the Subsequent New MOB Scenario) and the close proximity of residential uses to construction activity areas. Impact NOI-2 (Ground Borne Vibration) Annoyance : The Proposed Project would generate excessive ground borne vibration or ground borne noise levels that could adversely affect sensitive receptors in th e Project vicinity. (Significant and Unavoidable) Impact NOI-2 is unavoidable because the feasi ble mitigation measures identified to reduce annoyance from construction-related vibration impacts to sensitive receptors would not effectively reduce vibration levels below the level of human annoyance. Impact NOI-5 (Loading Dock Noise ): Operational noise sources generated by delivery trucks at the relocated loading dock of the Proposed Project would exceed Alameda County Noise Ordinance standards. (Significant and Unavoidable) Impact NOI-5 is unavoidable because the feasi ble mitigation measures identified to reduce the noise levels received by residential properties to the west of the Project Site would not be adequate to comply with the Noise Ordinance standards. Impact NOI-7 (Nighttime Helicopter Noise ): Helicopter overflights at night would result in a continuation of possible awakenings and sleep disturbance and/or annoyance of some residents, and slight shift in ne arby residents impacted. (Significant) Impact NOI-7 is unavoidable because the feasible mitigation measures identified would not substantially reduce the noise effect of nigh ttime helicopter overflights on approximately 20 residences not previously significantly impacted, and mitigations that preclude nighttime overflights would be infeasible given helicopter flights involve emergency care situations. CEQA-Required \"No Project \" Alternative As indicated in the discussion of CEQA Guidelines , above, consideration of a \"no project\" alternative is required. CEQA states, \"The pur pose of describing and analyzing a \"no project\" alternative is to allow decision makers to comp are the impacts of approving the proposed project with the impacts of not approving the proposed project.\" It also states that the \"no project\" alternative is \"not the baseline for determini ng whether the proposed project's environmental impacts may be significant, unless it is identical to the existing environmental setting analysis which V. Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-5 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 does establish that baseline . . .\" (CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6[e]). (The environmental baseline used in this EIR is discussed in Chapter IV, Introduction to the Environmental Analysis .) State Law Compliance A key consideration for the selection of project alternatives to the SMCCV Project is compliance with the Alquist Act and SB 1953, which mandate the replacement or seismic retrofit of existing acute care hospital facilities that do not meet curre nt earthquake-resistant standards for hospitals prior to the January 1, 2013 (discussed in Chapter III, Project Description, Compliance with Seismic Regulations). A consequence of not meeting this requirement is closure of licensed acute care hospitals, thus, the Alquist Act mandate substan tially guides the formulation of a \"no project\" alternative to the SMCCV Project; existi ng conditions could not continue on the Project Site because the existing acute care facilities (E xisting Hospital and Laur el Grove Rehabilitation Hospital), could not legally conti nue to operate in their \"existing conditions\" after January 1, 2013. Other Key Environmental Impacts and Factors Considered With the primary aim being to reduce or avoid significant unavoidable impacts identified with the Project, much consideration also was given to ot her environmental effects that are particularly relevant because they can involve substantial e ffects (even if the CEQA impact is less than significant or mitigated to less than significant) to adjacent residential uses or areas, such as traffic (particularly on Stanton Avenue), construction period air quality, operational noise associated with rooftop HVAC equipment and the new mechanical yard, and shadow cast on adjacent residences, as summarized in Table V-1 , Comparison of Alternatives and Key Environmental Factors Considered in Selecti on. Feasible alternatives also considered the complexity of site layout and hospital space planning - both site planning as well as hospital interior planning with regard to proximities and functional relationships of departments, services, programs, and parking, etc. The need to ensure uninterrupted operation of the Existing Hospital during construction of the Proposed Project adds additional complexity and constraints to site planning and construction phasing. B. Summary of Alternatives Selected and Considered Each alternative is summarized here and describ ed in greater detail (including illustrative site plans) in the following Alternatives Analysis section, as part of the detailed discussion of the impacts relative to the Proposed Project. \"No Project \" Alternatives As discussed above, the requirement to comply w ith SB 1953 results in a \"no project\" alternative that requires some change to occur to the Existing Hospital and Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital since neither meets current seismic codes that would allow them to legally continue to operate as licensed acute care facilities after January 1, 2013 unless upgraded or replaced. Another basic assumption considered in formula ting a \"no project\" alternative, and that is V. Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-6 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 relevant to the comparison of environmental effects, is that if the Existing Hospital is demolished, a replacement structure or structures would be built onsite for health care uses consistent with the General Plan; if not demolished, the structure w ould not be left unoccupied on the Project Site. Also, some of the existing non-acute care uses on th e Site would leave if a replacement hospital is not built (and no other acute care uses remain onsite ), as there likely would not be enough critical mass of acute care functions remaining onsite to support all of the non-acute care uses -there. The following two \"no project\" alternatives are analyzed in this EIR: No Project 1: Demolish Existing Hospital s and Build New Non-Acute Care Buildings No Project 2: De-License/Remodel Existing Hospital for Non-Acute Care Adaptive Reuse An additional \"no project\" alternative scenario was considered that would seismically retrofit the Existing Hospital for continued use as an acute car e facility. This alternative was not elected for further study for this EIR (See Alternatives Considered but Not Analyzed Further , below.) Selected Project Alternatives In accordance with the alternatives selection criteria discussed above, several alternative scenarios were considered in an effort to avoid or reduce adverse effects of the Proposed Project while aligning with most of the Project Objec tives. The selected altern atives best allow the Existing Hospital to remain on site and operati onal throughout construction of the new facilities, allow desired proximities of the replacement hospita l to the existing parking structure and a new medical office building, and maintain a functionally-efficient hospital layout. The following three alternatives are fully analyzed in this EIR: Reduced Project Alternative East Site Alternative Reconfigured Hospital Alternative The selected alternatives and key selection factors are compared in Table V-1 , below. Except for the Reduced Project Alternative, all the project alternatives assume the same basic development program as that of the Proposed Project: Cons truction of and approximately 230,000-sq.ft., 130- bed replacement hospital, and approximately 80,000-sq.ft medical office building. Other alternative scenarios were considered and sub sequently not elected for further study for this EIR. One scenario would develop the New Hospital in the southeast corner of the Project Site (Southeast Site Alternative) and another would develop the New Hospital in the northern portion of the Project Site (North Site Alternative), si milar to the 2004 project (discussed in Chapter III, Project Description, 2004 Project ). Each of the alternatives considered are discussed under Alternatives Considered but Not Analyzed Fully in this EIR in Section D, following the alternatives analysis. V.

Alternatives Analysis The alternatives analysis is conducted in this EIR to provide a comparison of the Proposed Project to one or more alternatives that could reasonably occur if the Proposed Project was not approved. As permitted by CEQA, the potential e ffects of the alternatives are discussed in less detail than are the effects of the project (CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6[d]). However, the analysis is conducted at a sufficient level of de tail to provide the public, other public agencies, and County decision makers adequate information to fully evaluate the alternatives and for the County to approve an alternative instead of th e Proposed Project without further environmental review. Unless otherwise indicated, the impacts associated with the Proposed Project and the alternatives throughout this chapter are for buildout conditions and are stated as levels of significance after implementation of mitigation measures identified in Chapter IV. No Project 1: Demolish Existing Hospitals and Build New Non-Acute Care Buildings Under the No Project 1 Alternative, the Exis ting Hospital (235,500 sq.ft.) and Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital (49,248 sq.ft.) would be demo lished. As summarized in Table V-1, one or more new buildings totaling approximately 100, 000 sq.ft. would be constructed for non-acute care uses (e.g., clinic, medical offices, etc.) on the Existing Hospital site. The Existing Hospital would not be reconstructed or relocated offs ite, which means that acute care services would no longer be provided in Castro Valley. Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital functions are assumed to relocate or merge into another nearby exis ting facility. No other existing facilities would be demolished (i.e., 42-unit Pine Cone Apartment co mplex and 20,000 sq.ft. of existing MOBs) and no other new buildings would be constructed (i.e., 230,000-sq.ft. New Hospital and 80,000-sq.ft New MOB). Relative Significant and Unavoidable Impacts: Overall, No Project 1 Alternative would result in increased peak hour vehicle trips (approximately 312 trips1). Increased trips result because there would be substantially more MOB floor area with this Alternative than with the Proposed Project (or the Existing Hospital). Thus, the significant and unavoidable traffic intersection impacts identified for the Proposed Project would continue to occur with the No Project 1 Alternative. However, this alternative would be developed in the central portion of the Project Site and no other buildings being demolished (except fo r the Existing Hospital and Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital). As a result, this altern ative would avoid the significant and unavoidable construction noise and vibration annoyance imp acts, as well as the significant and unavoidable operational loading dock noise impacts identified for the Proposed Project, reducing these effects to less than significant with mitigations identifie d in this EIR. In addition, because no acute care 1 The Proposed Project would result in 309 net new peak hour trips (Table IV.C-6). Applying the same vehicle trip generation rates used used in Table IV.C-6, the No Pr oject 1 Alternative would generate 621 net new MOB (100 ksf) peak hour trips. V. Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-9 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 uses would exist on the Project Site, the helist op would no longer operate and the significant and unavoidable nighttime helicopter overflight noise impact would be avoided. Relative Less-than-Significant Impacts : Since the new buildings would be developed in the central portion of the Project Site, and no other buildings would be demolished (except for the Existing Hospital and Laurel Grove Rehabilita tion Hospital, less-than-significant (with mitigation) operational noise impacts from the mechanical yard and HVAC at nearby residential uses would be avoided. Also, the less-than-si gnificant shadow impacts on adjacent residential uses would be avoided. As mentioned above , because no acute care uses would exist on the Project Site, the helistop would no longer opera te; therefore there would be no helistop noise effects. No Project 2: De-License/Remodeled Existing Hospital for Non-Acute Adaptive Reuse Under the No Project 2 Alternative, the Existi ng Hospital (235,500 sq.ft.) would be de-licensed as an acute care facility and remodeled for non-acute care uses (e.g., clinic, medical offices, etc.). No seismic retrofitting would be required by law as it is not required for non-acute care uses. The practicality of the No Project 2 Alternative is limited for the Project Sponsor because remodeling the Existing Hospital without seismic retrofit w ill not support acute care uses. The acute care uses that currently exist in the Existing Hospital woul d not be relocated offsite; therefore it is assumed that these services would no longer be provided in the Castro Valley area. The Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital (49,248 sq.ft.) would be th e only building demolished, and its acute care functions could continue to relocate or be absorb ed into another nearby existing facility. No other existing facilities other than the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital woul d be demolished (i.e., 42-unit Pine Cone Apartment complex and 20,000 sq.ft. of existing MOBs) and no other new buildings would be constructe d (i.e., 230,000-sq.ft. New Hospital and 80,000-sq.ft New MOB). Relative Significant and Unavoidable Impacts: Overall, No Project Alternative 2 would result in more net new peak hour vehicle trips (approximately 1,143 trips 2) As with No Project Alternative 1, increased trips r esult because there would be substantially more MOB floor area with this Alternative than with the Proposed Project (or the Existing Hospital). Thus, the significant and unavoidable traffic intersection impacts identified for the Proposed Project would continue to occur with the No Project 2 Alternative. However, this alternative would result in fewer overall environmental impacts associated with the new building(s) - compared to the Proposed Project as well as to the No Project 1 Alternative. As discussed above, only the Laurel Grove Rehabilita tion Hospital would be demolished, therefore most site conditions would remain the same, and significant and unavoidable construction noise and vibration annoyance impacts and operati onal loading dock noise impacts would be substantially reduced. Also, because no acute car e uses would exist on the Project Site, the 2 The Proposed Project would result in 309 net new peak hour trips (Table IV.C-6). Applying the same vehicle trip generation rates used used in Table IV.C-6, the No Project 2 Alternative would generate 1,452 net new MOB (235.5 ksf) peak hour trips. V. Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-10 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 helistop would no longer operate, and the si gnificant and unavoidable nighttime helicopter overflight noise impact would be avoided. Relative Less-than-Significant Impacts: Since the building would remain in place, less-than- significant effects associated with the Alternativ e's New Hospital and MOB structures, or their construction and operation, woul d be reduced or avoided. The 235,500-sq.ft Existing Hospital would not be demolished and the construction activities associated with remodeling the structure would create fewer less-than-significant (with m itigation) construction air quality effects than those associated with demolition and new constr uction under the Proposed Project and each of the other alternatives. Since the building woul d not be relocated, less-than-significant (with mitigation) operational noise impacts from the mechanical yard and HVAC at nearby residential uses would be avoided. No Project Alternativ e 2 also would avoid the less-than-significant shadow impacts on adjacent residential uses. Because no acute care uses would exist on the Project Site, the helistop would no longer opera te; therefore there would be no helistop noise effects. Reduced Project Alternative The Reduced Project Alternative would develop all components of the Proposed Project, except that the New MOB would be two stories (compa red to four) and 20,000 sq.ft. (compared to 80,000 sq.ft.). As discussed in the Project Descrip tion in Chapter III, functions in the New MOB with the Proposed Project will include an Urge nt Care clinic (approx. 13,000 sq.ft.), an ambulatory surgery center (approx. 22,000 sq.ft. ), hospital management and administrative offices, physician offices, conference rooms, and other various health support offices (approx. 44,000 sq.ft.). In the Reduced Alternative, the New MOB would accommodate the hospital management and administrative office functions; critical support spaces (such as the Urgent Care clinic and surgery center) would not be included in the New MOB As shown in Figure V-1 . the smaller MOB would be located immediately east of the New Hospital and have approximately one-half the building footprint compared to th e New MOB with the Proposed Project. A reduced project is considered to avoid or substantia lly reduce significant impacts associated with the Proposed Project. Operational Considerations (Reduced MOB fo r Required Hospital Support Administrative Uses): If the New MOB is not developed as proposed by this Alternative, other onsite space are assumed for this analysis to be absorbed into the Alternative's New Hospital, however, the new administrative services that would support the hos pital would have be provided in a new two- story, 20,000-sq.ft. medical office building, the effects of which are consistent with those discussed for the Reconfigured Hospital Alternative, below. Relative Significant and Unavoidable Impacts: As previously discussed, the Proposed Project would result in a significant cumulative traffi c intersection impacts in 2035.

Even though the Reduced Project Alternative would not generate the 496 peak hour trips associated with the 80,000-sq.ft New MOB (see Table IV.C-6 ) (or 309 net new peak hour trip overall), it would not avoid or substantially reduce any of the significant cumulative traffic intersection impacts that would occur with the Proposed Project. The Reduced Project Alternative would mainta in the significant and unavoidable operational loading dock noise impacts identified for the Proposed Project, as well as the significant and unavoidable nighttime helicopter overflight noise impact since acute care uses would be provided at the Alternative's New Hospital and the helist op would be located in the same location as with the Proposed Project. Relative Less-than-Significant Impacts: All of the less-than-significant impacts (including those with mitigation) identified for the Proposed Project would continue to occur under this Alternative. In particular, less-than-significan t (with mitigation) operational noise impacts at nearby residential uses from the mechanical yard and HVAC would continue since the Alternative's New Hospital would be constructe d at the same location as the Proposed Project, and the less-than-significant helistop noise impacts would also continue since the helistop would be located at the same location as with the Proposed Project. The Reduced Project Alternative would redu ce the less-than-significant morning shadows (Spring, Autumn, and Winter) that the Proposed Project's New MOB would cast on the southeast corner of the existing apartment complex par cel immediately north of the Reduced Project Alternative's New Hospital. 3 The New MOB under this Alternative would be two stories (compared to four stories) and set back from the north property line. The western portion of the apartment complex parcel would continue to be shaded by the Alternative's New Hospital during these morning hours. Regarding construction period impacts, the Ne w MOB under this Alternative would require slightly fewer daily truck trips and constructi on workers, as well as fewer drilled piles given the smaller MOB. The impacts would be similar to the Proposed Project; the less-than-significant construction period impacts (with mitigation) would also occur with this Alternative. Reconfigured Hospital Alternative The Reconfigured Hospital Alternative would de velop all components of the Proposed Project. Different from the Proposed Project however, the Alternative's New Hospital would be reconfigured to be elongated eastward, which woul d reduce the four-story tower by one level. This change to the east side of the building is the only change to the New Hospital of the Proposed Project. As shown in Figure V-2 , the eastern elongated portion of the building would be two levels (one building level above surface parking along the north portion of the ground 3 Compared to existing conditions, the Proposed Project w ould cast new shadow on the apartment complex parcel at 9 a.m. in March and September and all day in December.

The Alternative's New MOB would be constructed in the southeast corner of the Project Site, which conflicts with one of the key Project Ob jectives (connection between the New Hospital and the New MOB). As summarized in Table V-1 , the Reconfigured Hospital Alternative would have the similar overall effects as the Proposed Proj ect since the program is the same and the Alternative's New Hospital would be developed in an area of the site that would be developed for both the New Hospital and MOB with the Proposed Project. However, the New MOB in this Alternative would be developed in the southeast corner of the Project Site where no building development would occur with the Proposed Project. Relative Significant and Unavoidable Impacts: The significant cumulative traffic impact that would occur with the Proposed Project would con tinue with Reconfigured Hospital Alternative since the development program would not change. The significant and unavoidable construction noise and vibration annoyance impacts would continue with this Alternativ e, and constructing the Alternative's New MOB in the southeast corner would actually increase the extent of th is significant and unavoidable impact since the New MOB would be located immediately adjacen t to additional multifamily residences to the south of the Project Site. Overall constructi on period impacts (including less-than-significant [with mitigation] air quality constructions impacts discussed below) would also be increased because the overall construction period would be lengthened; whereas the Proposed Project would develop the New Hospital and New MOB conc urrently, prior to demolition of the Existing Hospital, the Alternative's New MOB could not be constructed until after the Existing Hospital is demolished given the close proximity of these two buildings. Also, because there are core underground utilities that currently serve the Existi ng Hospital in this southeast corner of the Project Site, substantial excavation and utility re location activities that would not be necessary for the Proposed Project would be required prior to construction of the Alternative's New MOB to ensure continued utility service to the Existing Hospital during construction. This would increase the duration of construction activities compared to the Proposed Project. (The Proposed Project would excavate to place new utilities for the New Hospital separate from the existing utilities that serve the Existing Hospital and that would n eed to be maintained until its demolition.) The Reconfigured Hospital Alternative woul d maintain the significant and unavoidable operational loading dock noise impacts identified for the Proposed Project. It would also continue the significant and unavoidable nighttime helicopter overflight noise impact since acute care uses would be provided at this Alternative's New Hosp ital, and the helistop would be located in the same location as with the Proposed Project. Relative Less-than-Significant Impacts: All of the less-than-significant impacts (including those with mitigation) identified for the Proposed Project would continue to occur under this Alternative. As discussed above, the less-th an-significant (with mitigation) air quality construction period impact would also incr ease with this Alternative because the overall V. Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-15 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 construction period would be lengthened and this Alternativ e's New MOB would be constructed immediately adjacent to residential uses to the south. Less-than-significant (with mitigation) operationa l noise impacts at nearby residential uses from the mechanical yard and HVAC would continue, and the less-than-significant helistop noise impacts would continue to be less than significan t since it would be located at the same location as with the Proposed Project. The Reconfigured Hospital Alternative would avoid the morning shadow (March, September and December) that the Proposed Project's New MOB location would cast on the southeast corner of the existing apartment complex parcel immediately north of the Alternative's New Hospital. 4 Shadow is cast northward; therefore locating the Alternative's New MOB in the southeast corner of the Project Site would not affect adjacent residences to the south or nearby. However, the western portion of th e apartment complex parcel to the north of the Alternative's New Hospital would continue to be shaded by the New Hospital during these morning hours, even though the building would be one level lower than the Proposed Project. The shadow impact would continue to be l ess-than-significant, and only slightly reduced. Regarding construction period impacts, the same number of daily truck trips and construction workers would be required for this Alternative as would be for the Proposed Project. Regarding construction period parking, this alternative would experience greater deficits than the Proposed Project. Construction of the elongated New Hospital would displace the areas the Proposed Project assumes for the New Hospital and MOB. C onstruction of the Alternative's New MOB at the southeast corner of the Project Site, however , would remove a substa ntial number of existing surface spaces that would otherwise have been available throughout the Project. The impacts would be similar to the Proposed Project; the less-than-significant construction period impacts (with mitigation) would also occur with this Alternative. Operational Considerations: As stated above, the Reconfigured Hospital Alternative would conflict with two of the key Project Objectiv es regarding the relationship between the New Hospital and the New MOB: (1) connection be tween the New Hospital and MOB (since the Alternative's New MOB would be located in th e southeast corner of the site while the Alternative's New Hospital would be located in th e northwest portion of the Project Site, as with the Proposed Project), and (2) concurrent cons truction of the New Hospital and New MOB to provide critical hospital services. This Alternativ e would also result in a New Hospital building that would have substantially less operational e fficiency within the building as well as throughout the site as critical adjacencies and functional re lationships of departments and doctor's offices close to the Alternative's New Hospital are precluded with the elongated layout that is aimed principally at reducing shadow. 4 Compared to existing conditions, the Proposed Project w ould cast new shadow on the apartment complex parcel at 9 a.m. in March and September and all day in December. V. Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-16 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 East Site Alternative The East Site Alternative would develop all components of the Proposed Project. Unlike the Proposed Project however, this Alternative's New Hospital would be constructed at the easternmost edge of the Project Site, along La ke Chabot Road and immediately south and adjacent to the existing parking structure. Due to the physically constrained construction area available to build this Alternativ e's New Hospital in this part of the Project Site and maintain uninterrupted operation of, and access to, the Existi ng Hospital during construction, the East Site Alternative would be cons tructed in two phases. The Alternative's New Hospital would be constructed first, as shown in Figure V-3a . The figure shows an Interim phase construction circulation plan that would ensure uninterrupted access to the Existing Hospital and adequate c onstruction access to the New Hospital. Figure V-3b shows buildout with the Alternative's Ne w MOB, which could not be constructed until after completion of the Alternative's Ne w Hospital since the New MOB would be sited within areas critical to the Interim Phase circulation plan. The Alternative's New MOB would be approximately two levels taller (six levels total) in the East Site Alternative to accommodate the additi onal existing MOB uses that would be displaced with this alternative. Specifically, the East Site Alternative requires demolition of 32,664 sq.ft. of existing MOB buildings (shown in Figures V-1 and V- 2) that currently front Lake Chabot Road and that would not be demolished with the Proposed Project (or with any other of the alternatives). Relative Significant and Unavoidable Impacts: The significant cumulative traffic impact that would occur with the Proposed Project would also occur with East Site Alternative since the development program would not change. The primary sources of construction noise and vibr ation annoyance would be the pile drilling for the foundation of both the Alternative's New Ho spital (680 piles over 8 weeks) and New MOB (200 piles over 8 weeks) (see Table IV.E-5 in Section E., Noise , in Chapter IV of this EIR).The Alternative's New Hospital would be constructed in an area of the Project Site that would require the Alternative's New MOB to be constructed after the New Hospital, resulting in a longer overall construction period. The East Site A lternative would reduce the severity of those significant and unavoidable constr uction period noise and vibration annoyance effects associated with the Proposed Project on adjacent reside nces, as no residences exist adjacent to the Alternative's New Hospital site. However, the e ffects associated with the construction of the Alternative's New MOB on the apartments to the nor thwest of the Project Site would remain the same as identified for the Proposed Project, since the New MOB would be situated in the same location as with the Proposed Project. Taken together, the effect of the substantial number of piles required (680), and the extended duration (16 weeks) of the pile drilling activity . The noise and vibration annoyance impact would remain significant and unavoidable, but would be reduced compared to the Proposed Project.

Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley . East Alternative - BuildoutSOURCE: Devenney Group02 00 FeetV. Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-19 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 The East Site Alternative would avoid the si gnificant and unavoidable operational loading dock noise impacts identified for the Proposed Project, as the loading area would no longer be located near residential uses. (Also see discussion of less- than-significant circulation impacts, below.) The East Site Alternative would have the sam e significant and unavoidable nighttime helicopter overflight noise impact as the Proposed Project sin ce the acute care uses would be provided at the Alternative's New Hospital, and the helistop woul d be in the same location as with the Proposed Project. Relative Less-than-Significant Impacts: This Alternative would reduce the less-than-significant (with mitigation) construction air quality impacts identified for the Proposed Project. As discussed above, the Alternative's New Hospital w ould have reduced construction-period effects to residences as no residential uses exist adjacent to the New Hospital site. The effects associated with construction of this Alternative's Ne w MOB would be the same as proposed for the Proposed Project. The construction air quality impact s would continue to be less-than-significant under the East Site Alternative, and slightly reduced in severity compared to the Proposed Project. The location of the mechanical yard and HVAC equipment with the Alternative's New Hospital would reduce the less-than-significant (with mitig ation) noise effect of these activities compared to the Proposed Project, since they would not be lo cated near residential u ses. Also, the less-than- significant helistop noise impacts would continue to be less than significant with this Alternative since the helistop would be at the same location as the Proposed Project. The East Site Alternative would avoid the mo rning shadow (March, September and December) that the Proposed Project's New Hospital would cast on the portion of the existing apartment to the north. As shown in Figure V-3c , the worst-case shadow cast by the Alternative's New Hospital in the direction of the nearest residen tial uses would extend to the medical buildings on the east side of Lake Chabot Road. Thus, the sh adow effect of the Alternative's New Hospital would be less than identified for the Proposed Proj ect's New Hospital. The addition of two levels to the Alternative's New MOB (compared to th e Proposed Project) would increase slightly the shadow cast on the southeast corner of the ap artments to the north in mornings (March, September and December) (see Figure IV.B-8a , in Section B, Aesthetics , in Chapter IV of this EIR). Taken together, the overall shadow impact of the East Site Alternative would be substantially reduced compared to the Proposed Project given that the shadow from the New Hospital with the Proposed Project would be avoi ded. The shadow impacts of this Alternative would be less than significant and reduced compared to the Proposed Project. The East Site Alternative could result in incr eased vehicle trips traveling on Stanton Avenue instead of Lake Chabot Road, both during construction and after completion. During construction, Stanton Avenue traffic would incr ease because of the partial closure of the main onsite roadway (see Figure V-3a ). After completion of the Alternative, more traffic would likely use Stanton Avenue to access the parking lot on the w est side of the Project Site, which would be adjacent to (and west of) this Alternative's New MOB. In comparison, the Proposed Project would redirect traffic from Stanton Avenue to Lake Chabot Road by redistributing parking Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley . 207766 Figure V-3c East Site Alternative - Project Shadow Winter Solstice 3:00 p.m.SOURCE: Devenney Group V. Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-21 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 toward the east side of the Project Site. The increase in traffic on Stanton Avenue would not be expected to result in intersection operations impacts not already identified for the Proposed Project. While it may be feasible to \"direct\" traffi c to use the main Lake Chabot Road entrances to the Project Site and parking garage, this woul d be difficult to implement without restricting the Stanton Avenue entrances. Such a restriction w ould be impractical and create a safety issue for the public and emergency vehicles. This Alternative would locate primary surface park ing lots on both the east and west sides of the Project Site, vehicles would be required to drive across the Project Site, creating unnecessary vehicle/pedestrian conflicts. Similarly, this Alternative would locate the ambulance entrance on the west side of the Alternative's New Hospital, and emergency vehicles using the proposed west emergency driveway from Stanton Avenue would ha ve to cross the Project Site to reach the emergency department that would be locate on the east side of the Project Site. This Alternative would improve vehicle connections between the parking structure and the main surface parking lots/driveway, and improve pedestrian connecti ons between the garage and the Project Site. The East Site Alternative would locate the de livery access (loading dock) on Lake Chabot Road, which would have the potential to create conflicts with traffic flow on this major thoroughfare. The loading dock (and all service entrances) would be restricted to access from Lake Chabot Road due to the significant grade change (a pproximately 35 feet) on the Alternative's New Hospital building site. As depicted in the building section in Figure V-3b , the ground level of the building suitable for loading uses would be facing La ke Chabot Road given the site's upslope to the west. The grade change limits what hospital f unctions can be placed in certain areas and what adjacencies can be achieved. For example, ser vice access from the west would be at the third level of the Alternative's New Hospital, which would create significant inefficiency between it and other services functions that are generally located at the building's basement level. The Alternative's loading dock location would result in a total of three driveways on Lake Chabot Road, instead of two driveways with the Propo sed Project. Three driveways currently provide access to the Project Site from Lake Chabot Road, however, they are all for regular public vehicle access; delivery trucks currently access the Project Site via Stanton Avenue. Truck traffic, including trucks approximately 53-feet long, would use this driveway to the loading dock several times daily. (18 to 24 trucks ranging from 25- to 53 -feet long were observed for this EIR analysis; see the loading dock noise analysis in Chapter IV, Section E, Noise of this EIR). In summary, regarding site access and circulation impacts, Stanton Avenue traffic would be increased with the East Site Alternative. Although this impact would be worsened as compared to the Proposed Project, it would still be less than significant given the other pedestrian/vehicle access improvements that would occur. The location of the service area and loading dock driveway on the major thoroughfare of Lake Chabot Road would worsen potential vehicle/pedestrian conflicts, as well as interrupt traffic flow along Lake Chabot Road. The loading dock location would create conflicts that would not occur with the Proposed Project. The site access and circulation impact would remain l ess than significant since these effects would not conflict with Caltrans design standard and woul d not \"substantially increase traffic hazards.\" V. Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-22 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 The same number of daily truck trips and cons truction workers would be required for this Alternative as would be for the Proposed Project . However, there would be more onsite parking during construction with this Alternative because th e existing parking areas on the west side of the Project Site would be expanded (to the demolishe d Pine Cone Apartments parcel) and available throughout construction, until development of the A lternative's New MOB. Specifically, there are approximately 86 spaces currently located where th e New Hospital would be constructed in this Alternative; thus these 86 spaces would not be av ailable during construction of this Alternative's New Hospital. Instead, significantly more parking area would be created on the west side of the Project Site (since no construction would occur on that part of the site). While there would be more parking area during c onstruction than with the Proposed Project, the location of the Alternative's New Hospital re duces options for onsite construction staging convenient to the building site, but that would not interfere with existing campus operations. As depicted in Figure V-3a , during construction the main access road would be \"divided\" (creating two cu-de-sac access roads) to allow for safe a nd efficient construction vehicle access around the functioning Existing Hospital as feasible. In conclusion, more construction period parking would be available with the East Site Alternative compared to the Proposed Project. The less-than -significant construction period impacts (with mitigation) would also occur with this Alterna tive, and would likely be worse than with the Proposed Project with respect to the increased pot ential for pedestrian/construction vehicle conflicts. Operational Considerations: As discussed above, the East S ite Alternative poses operational issues for its New Hospital due to the building site 's upslope to the west. The grade change limits what hospital functions can be placed in certain areas and what adjacencies can be achieved, such as locating service access and loading dock functions ad jacent to other services functions that are located on the basement levels for maximu m operational efficiency in the hospital. The 35-foot change in grade on the building site for the Alternative's New Hospital would also prevent the building from meeting certain building requirements. For example, all inpatient areas are required to have access to natural light (wi ndows). Because much of the building would be below grade, the building site limits the ability to provide windows on both sides of the building at all levels. As a result, the Alternative's New Hospital may require additional levels to achieve the approximately 130-bed hospital consis tent with the Project Objectives. The building site for this Altern ative's New Hospital is constrai ned between Lake Chabot Road and the existing site access road, which would re main under this Alternative; realigning the existing main access road to accommodate more build ing area to construct the Alternative's New Hospital was not considered to be reasonable given the additional a nd prolonged construction impacts to relocate the road, as well as the re quirement that continuous, unobstructed access to and from the Existing Hospital be maintained during construction. As mentioned previously, this Alternative woul d demolish approximately 32,664 sq.ft. of existing MOB buildings (shown in Figures V-1 and V-2). The existing medical uses in those buildings (i.e., principally physicians that are a significan t referral base for the Existing Hospital and would V. Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-23 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 serve the Alternative's New Hospital) would have to be relocated temporarily until the Alternative's New MOB is constructed. This an alysis assumes that those uses would be located temporarily in existing medical office space w ithin the broader Castro Valley community. (However, no analysis of the availability of su ch temporary space has been considered.) The Project Sponsor recognizes the referring physicians located in the existing medical office buildings on the Project Site as \"customers\" to th e hospital and emphasizes that the uninterrupted continuation of the hospital's spatial and business relationship with these customers is fundamental to the Proposed Project. D. Alternatives Considered but Not Analyzed Fully in this EIR The alternatives analysis in this EIR resulted from an in-depth consideration of possible alternatives to the Proposed Project in order to fulfill the analysis required to satisfy CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(a)). The range of alternatives discussed a nd analyzed above presents a reasonable range of feasible alternatives that would feasibly obt ain most of the basic Project Objectives. The following alternative scenarios were consider ed and rejected from analysis in the EIR because they were determined to be infeasible. Onsite Alternatives Considered Southeast Site Alternative A Southeast Site Alternative would develop the New Hospital and MOB in the southeast area of the Project Site, as shown in Figure V-4 . Different from the Proposed Project, this Alternative would maintain the 20,000 sq.ft. of existing MO Bs located adjacent to the existing parking structure, resulting in slightly more peak hour vehicle trips from the Project; all other components of the Proposed Project would be developed. This Alternative would result in the same a dverse environmental impact associated with development in the southeast corner of the Proj ect Site (see Reconfigured Hospital Alternative) and sequential development of the New Hospita l and MOB. These include, compared to the Proposed Project, increased severity of the significant and unavoidable construction noise and vibration annoyance impacts due to adjacent multifamily residences; the same significant and unavoidable impacts related to loading dock noise; increased less-than-significant (with mitigation) air quality construction period impacts, mechanical yard and HVAC noise impacts, and reduced less-than-significant shadow impacts. Also, like the Reconfigured Hospital Alternative, this Alternative woul d require substantial excavation and utility relocation in the southeast corner that would not be necessary for the Proposed Project. This Alternative could, howev er, reduce the incidence of emergency vehicles through neighborhood streets given the New Hospital s ituated in the southern end of the Project Site (as with no other Alternative).

Figure AlternativeSOURCE: Devenney Group02 00 FeetV. Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-25 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 The Alternative would require the helistop to be located on the roof of the hospital due to issues with placing the landing pad on grade at a hillside lo cation like the southeast corner of the Project Site; the helistop must be located in direct proxi mity to the hospital. The rooftop location could reduce the effects of nighttime helicopter overflight noise; however it presents significant issues related to providing emergency care - primarily the space limitations inside an elevator, and the availability of the elevator which could be alr eady in use or unavailable at any time including, because of malfunction or catastrophe. Overall, in addition to the above considerations, th is Alternative is not fully analyzed in this EIR because it was determined infeasible primarily due to the New Hospital and MOB not being located near the existing parking structure (a key Project Objective). Moreover, except for emergency vehicle circulation that reduces those vehicles traveling two additional blocks north on Stanton, all other environmental impacts iden tified for the Proposed Project are reduced or avoided by one or more of the other Alternatives that are fully analyzed in Section C, above. North Site Alternative A North Site Alternative would develop the Ne w Hospital and MOB in the northern area of the site, similar to the 2004 Project (discussed in Chapter III, Project Description, 2004 Project ), and immediately adjacent to the existing parking structure.5 This Alternative is not fully analyzed in this EIR because it was determined infeasible give n the combined effect of several operational and environmental reasons. As Figures V-5a and V-5b show, this Alternative would require an interim construction period circul ation plan configuration to en sure adequate construction access necessary to construct the New Hospital. Much of this area is where the Alternative's New MOB would be constructed along the nor thern property line, within about 100 feet of adjacent to single family residences. Therefore, the Alternative' s New MOB would be built after completion of the New Hospital, which would lengthen the overall c onstruction period for buildings built in close proximity to residential parcels. To ensure the necessary and efficient operational adjacencies within the A lternative's L-shaped New Hospital, delivery and loading access function also would be restricted to the north end of the building and the Project Site. As with the East Site Alternative and the Southeast Site Alternative, developing new surface parking on the w est side of the Project Site in proximity to the New Hospital would increase the potential for ve hicles to travel Stanton Avenue, which has direct access to this parking area. The North Site Alternative would also require a flood control culvert that currently is located beneath the ex isting Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital to be relocated prior to constructing the Alternative' s New MOB on that portion of the Project site. This major utility relocation is not anticipated to be required for the Proposed Project or any of the other Alternatives. Lastly, the North Site Alternative would avoid the Proposed Project's morning shadow cast on the apartment complex to the north in March, but would slightly increase morning shadow in December, and create new shadow on single family residential lots throughout the day in winter. 5 2004 Proposal located MOB in southeast corner of site.

Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-28 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Seismic Retrofit Existing Hospital for Continued Acute Care Use Consideration was given to seismically retrofitti ng the Existing Hospital to continue as a licensed acute care facility beyond 2013, in accordance with all existing legal requirements and SB 1953. No new construction or demolition (of MOBs or surface parking areas) would occur. This alternative was considered infeasible for full analysis in the EIR given the limited seismic compliance possible with the Existing Hospital st ructure, as well as logistical and operational constraints. At year 2030, the structure would have to be demolished or utilized by a non-acute care use since it would no longer meet the state seismic requirements after that time. In addition, retrofitting the Existing Hospital for continued acute care use poses several logistical and operational issues that prohibit and/or substantially constrain the ability to continue hospital ope rations of the Existing Hospital during retrofit, one of the primary Proj ect Objectives. This conclusion is based on the practicalities of the duration and intensity of c onstruction activities that would be involved to retrofit the entire building while hospital operations remained functional. Therefore, the Seismic Retrofit of the Existing Hospital was not consider ed a feasible alternative for consideration. Offsite Alternatives Considered CEQA requires the consideration of whether an y of the significant impacts of the Proposed Project would be avoided or s ubstantially lessened by developing the Proposed Project at a different Project Site (CEQA Guidelines Section 15126(f)(2)). The following two offsite locations were considered and rejected as infeasible for the reasons discussed below. Brittania Business Park The Britannia Business Park site considered for the Proposed Project is approximately 12 acres at 21325 Cabot Boulevard in the City of Hayward. Th e property is part of a larger business park. The property and surrounding properties consist of mi xed-use, light industrial and industrial uses. The building is approximately 138,000 sq.ft. The site is zoned \"Light Industrial,\" and is within the \"Industrial Corridor\" General Plan land use D esignation. The assessed value of the property is $10.2 million. This site was initially identified because it was on the market and appeared to meet general size criteria for the project. After further consideration, however, the site was rejected as infeasible because: 1) it is located in a business park approxima tely \u00bd to \u00be of a mile north of heavy industrial uses, including auto dismantling operations, a wa stewater treatment facility, and an approved 600-megawatt power plant (not yet c onstructed), all of which contribut ed to an \"out of the way\" impression of the site; 2) it is in the western ar ea of the City, removed from much of the population the hospital is designed to serve; and 3) there is little or no public transportation accessing the site. V. Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-29 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Mervyn's Headquarters The Mervyn's Headquarters site was considered for the Proposed Project. It is approximately 11.5 acres, and is located at 22301 Foothill Boulevard in the City of Hayward. An office building (constructed in 1958 with upgrad es conducted in mid-1980s) of approximately 366,000 sq.ft. currently exists on the site, and us es have current leases that expi re in 2021. The current zoning is \"Central City Commercial\" and the General Plan land use designation is \"C ity Center - Retail and Office Commercial.\" The assessed value of the pr operty at the time of the assessment was $78.4 million. This site was preliminarily identified because it wa s on the market and appeared to meet the general size criteria for the Proposed Project. The property comprises three parcels. The largest parcel (approximately 8.4 acres) is improved with a larg e office building, parking garage and surface parking lot. The remaining two parcels (one contai ning 2.37 acres, the other .74 acres) are used for parking. The office building serves as Mervyn's corporate headquarters. The garage and adjoining parking lot are needed to satisfy parking requireme nts. Consideration was given to constructing the Proposed Project in the existing parking lot adjacen t to the Mervyn's headquarters. This approach was rejected, however, because it would have been infeasible to provide sufficient parking for both the existing office use and the Proposed Project without constructing a s ubstantial new parking structure. At the time of the assessment, the comb ined costs of acquiring the property (which had a high value due to the long-term Mervyn's lease, which expires in 2021) and building a new garage made this alternative infeasible. E. Environmentally Superior Alternative CEQA requires that the EIR identify an environmenta lly superior alternative that, when compared to the Proposed Project and all other alterna tives considered, would avoid (or reduce to the greatest extent) one or more of the adverse environmental effects identified for the project, particularly any significant impacts. The East Site Alternative is considered envir onmentally superior based on the analysis presented in this chapter. Reduced or Avoided Environmental Effects As discussed in detail under East Site Alternative summarized in Tables V-1 and V-2, the East Site Alternative would substantially reduce or avoid the following environmental impacts that would occur with the Proposed Project and that would not be avoided or reduced to as full an extent with the other Project Alternatives analyzed: Loading Dock Noise - The significant and unavoidable operational loading dock noise impacts on nearby residential uses would be avoided. (Impact NOI-5) The New Hospital would be located adjacent to Lake Chabot Road and not immediately adjacent to residences; the Proposed Project would be locat ed adjacent to residences. No other Project Alternative would avoid this impact. V. Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-30 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Construction Noise and Vibration Annoyance - The significant and unavoidable construction noise and vibration annoyance eff ects on nearby residential uses would be reduced - even given the extended constr uction duration. (Impact NOI-2) The New Hospital would be located adjacent to Lake Ch abot Road and not immediately adjacent to residences; the Proposed Project would be c onstructed adjacent to residences. No other Project Alternative would reduce or avoid this impact. Mechanical Yard and HVAC Noise - The less-than-significant (with mitigation) mechanical yard and HVAC equipment noise impacts on nearby residences would be reduced. (Impact NOI-4) The New Hospital woul d be located adjacent to Lake Chabot Road and not immediately adjacent to reside nces; the Proposed Project would be located adjacent to residences. No other Project Alte rnative would reduce or avoid this impact. Construction Air Quality - The less-than-significant (with mitigation) construction air quality impacts on nearby residential uses would be reduced. (Impact AIR-1) The New Hospital would be located adjacent to Lake Ch abot Road and not immediately adjacent to residences; the Proposed Project would be c onstructed adjacent to residences. No other Project Alternative would reduce or avoid this impact. Shadow - The less-than-significant shadow impact s on nearby residential uses, specifically worst-case shadow in Spring, Autumn, a nd December mornings, would be reduced. (Impact AES-5) Although the New MOB would be located near adjacent residences and would be taller than with the Proposed Project , the New Hospital would be located adjacent to Lake Chabot Road and not immediately ad jacent to residences - avoiding the substantial shadow on adjacent residences compared to the Proposed Project. No other Project Alternative analyzed would reduce or avoid this impact. Construction Period Impacts (Parking) - The less-than-significant construction period impacts (with mitigation), specifically with rega rd to construction peri od parking, would be reduced. (Impact TRANS-6) During construction, the Alternative would result in more onsite parking than with the Proposed Project . Each of the other Project Alternatives, except the Reconfigured Hospital Alterna tive, would also reduce this impact. Environmental Issues As discussed in detail under East Site Alternative summarized in Tables V-1 and V-2, the East Site Alternative would result in the following envi ronmental effects that would not occur with the Proposed Project or any of the other Alternatives analyzed: Stanton Avenue Traffic - The East Site Alternative would generate increased traffic and circulation along Stanton Avenue, both duri ng construction and after buildout. (Impact TRANS-5) By relocating the New Hospital to th e east side of the Project Site, the surface parking lot would be developed on the west side of the Project Site, adjacent to the Alternative's New MOB. This would result in increased vehicle trips traveling on Stanton Avenue instead of Lake Chabot Road. As pr eviously discussed, while it may be feasible to \"direct\" traffic to use Lake Chabot Road en trances to the site and parking garage, this would be difficult to implement without restricting the Stanton Avenue entrances. Such a restriction would be impractical and would create a safety issue for the public and emergency vehicles. Vehicles would be required to drive across the Project Site - through other motorists and pedestrians to access the west lot, creating unnecessary vehicle/pedestrian conflicts. This would wor sen aspects of the less-than-significant site V. Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-31 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 access and circulation impact identified with the Proposed Project. Each of the other Project Alternatives, except the Reconfigured Ho spital Alternative, would also result in this effect. Site Access and Circulation - Due to the significant grade change (approximately 35 feet) on the Alternative's New Hospital building site , a third driveway (compared the two with the Proposed Project) for delivery access / loading dock would be located on Lake Chabot Road. (Impact TRANS-5) This could create conflicts with traffic flow on this major thoroughfare due to the frequency and size of tr ucks that generally access the Project Site. This would worsen aspects of the less-than-s ignificant site access and circulation impact identified with the Proposed Project. No other Project Alternative would cause this effect. Construction Period Impacts (Pedestrian/Vehicle Conflicts) - This Alternative would have minimal area for onsite construction stag ing convenient to the building site, and the interim circulation layout would likely result in pedestrian/construction vehicle conflicts given the limited site area. (Impact TRANS-6) Conflicts with the Project Objectives The East Site Alternative would not meet most of the basic Project Objectives. The Alternative would not fully achieve Project Objectives intended to achieve the following: To \"...simultaneously construct a New Hosp ital and New MOB...with a direct physical connection to the New Hospital at each of the four levels.\" To provide direct emergency vehicle and pub lic access to the Emergency Department with surface parking adjacent to the Emergency Department....\" To ensure that the New Hospital is an effici ent and clinically safe environment by ensuring \"...optimal departmental adjacencies that promote safe patient flow throughout the hospital.\" To utilize existing site topography to minimize grading. To optimize area and site traffic circulation by separating emergency transport, service vehicles, staff vehicles, and routine non-emer gency patient/visitor access and traffic flows. To provide construction staging without s ubstantially interfering with existing campus operations. Operational Issues As discussed in detail under East Site Alternative : Temporary Relocation of Referring Physicians - This Alternative would demolish approximately 32,664 sq.ft. of existing MOBs in which several referring physicians' offices are located. As a result, these uses w ould be temporarily relocated offsite until completion of the Alternative's New MOB - after completion of the Alternative's New Hospital. The Project Sponsor emphasizes that the uninterrupted continuation of the hospital's spatial and business relationship with these referring physician's is fundamental to the Proposed Project. V. Alternatives Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project V-32 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Inefficient Adjacencies of Hospital Functions - The 35-foot grade change and constrained building area for this Alternative' s New Hospital limits what hospital functions can be placed in certain areas and what adj acencies can be achieved to ensure maximum operational efficiency in the hospital. Meeting Code Requirements for Light Access - The 35-foot grade change and constrained building area for this Alterna tive's New Hospital would also prevent the building from meeting certain building requirements. A key example is the provision of natural light (windows) to all inpatient areas, which would be restricted by part of the building levels being below grade due to site sl ope cuts required to construct the building in to the hillside. To achieve the Project Ob jective to provide an approximately 130-bed hospital, the Alternative's New Hosp ital may require additional levels. No Connection between the New Hospital and New MOB - This Alternative would not connect the New Hospital and New MOB. As shown in Figure V-3b , an emergency route would separate the two buildings. Summary The East Site Alternative is considered Envi ronmentally Superior because it would avoid or substantially reduce impacts identified with the Proposed Project and each of the other alternatives, but would fail to fully meet most of basic Project Objectives, as listed above. Specifically, the Alternative would avoid th e significant and unavoidable loading dock noise impact, reduce the significant and unavoidabl e construction noise and vibration annoyance impact, and would substantially reduce other imp acts to residential uses that would occur during construction (air quality a nd construction parking) or after th e project is completed (shadow and mechanical yard/HVAC noise). However, compar ed to the Proposed Project and the other Alternatives, the East Site Alternative would increase the number of peak-hour vehicle trips on Stanton Avenue, increase the potential for site access and circulation site effects by locating service area / loading dock driveway on Lake Chabot Road, and increase the potential for vehicle/pedestrian conflic ts during construction. The Alternative also poses a number of operationa l issues regarding the relocation of existing referring physicians, construction of the New MOB at a later phase and not directly connected to the New Hospital, and limitations the steep build ing site for this Alternative's New Hospital places on the design of the building and ability to meet light access requirements within the programmed number of building stories.

Significant Unavoidable Environmental Impacts A significant, unavoidable impact results if a pr oject reaches or exceeds the defined threshold of significance and no feasible mitigation measure is av ailable to reduce the significant impact to a less-than-significant level. The Proposed Proj ect would result in the following significant, unavoidable environmental effects, as iden tified in Chapter IV of this EIR: 2035 Traffic Intersection Operations Impacts Impact TRANS-3a: The signalized intersectio n of Castro Valley Boulevard/Strobridge Avenue/Stanton Avenue (#8) would operate at LOS F under 2035 No Project conditions. The intersection would continue to operate at LOS F with the addition of Proposed Project traffic and the Proj ect traffic would increase the westbound approach delay by more than four seconds during the AM peak hour. (Significant) Because the County has no existing plan, program, or design to mitigate this impact, implementation of an improvement is uncertain, and therefore the impact is considered significant and unmitigated. Also, if the improvements affect the operation of ramps to and/or from Interstate 580, the improvement will require both Caltrans and Federal Highway Administration approval and the impact would also therefore be considered to remain significant and unavoidable. Impact TRANS-3c: The westbound approach at the unsignalized intersection of Strobridge Avenue/I- 580 westbound off-ramp (#10) would operate at LOS F during the AM peak hour and LOS E during the PM peak hour under 2035 No Project conditions. The westbound approach would continue to operate at LOS E and F conditions respectively, with the addition of Proposed Project traffic. This is a significant impact because the intersection would operate at an unacceptable level, the project would add ten or more project trips to the intersection peak hour flow, and the intersection would meet the peak hour signal warrant (Warrant 3) without and with the project. (Significant) The traffic signal addition to the freeway ramp signal requires Caltrans approval and thus its implementation is not certain and the impact is therefore considered to remain significant and unavoidable. VI. Impact Overview and Growth Inducing Impacts Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project VI-2 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Impact TRANS-3d: The signalized intersection of Strobridge Avenue/I-580 EB Ramps/Gary Drive (#11) would operate at LOS E during the AM and PM peak hours under 2035 Without Project conditions. The intersection would continue to operate at LOS E with the addition of Project traffic. This is a significant impact because the Proposed Project would increase the total in tersection average delay by more then four seconds during the PM peak hour. (Significant) The traffic signal and cycle length timing changes to the freeway ramp signal require Caltrans approval and thus its implementation is not certain and the impact is therefore considered to remain significant and unavoidable. Noise Impacts Impact NOI-1 (Construction Noise) : Construction activities would intermittently and temporarily generate noise levels that would exceed the Alameda County Noise Ordinance. (Significant and Unavoidable) Impact NOI-1 is unavoidable because, while f easible mitigation measures are identified to reduce the temporary, project-level construc tion noise levels, the impact would remain significant given the intermittent overall duration of construction activities over approximately 4.5 years (or up to 6 years under the Subsequent New MOB Scenario) and the close proximity of residential uses to construction activity areas. Impact NOI-2 (Ground Borne Vibration) Annoyance -: The Proposed Project would generate excessive ground borne vibration or ground borne noise levels that could adversely affect sensitive receptors in th e Project vicinity. (Significant and Unavoidable) Impact NOI-2 is unavoidable because the feasi ble mitigation measures identified to reduce annoyance from construction-related vibration impacts to sensitive receptors would not effectively reduce vibration levels below the level of human annoyance. Impact NOI-5 (Loading Dock Noise) : Operational noise sources generated by delivery trucks at the relocated loading dock of the Proposed Project would exceed Alameda County Noise Ordinance standards. (Significant and Unavoidable) Impact NOI-5 is unavoidable because the feasi ble mitigation measures identified to reduce the noise levels received by residential properties to the west of the Project Site would not be adequate to comply with the Noise Ordinance standards. Impact NOI-7 (Nighttime Helicopter Noise) : Helicopter overflights at night would result in a continuation of possible awakenings and sleep disturbance and/or annoyance of some residents, and slight shift in ne arby residents impacted. (Significant) Impact NOI-7 is unavoidable because the feasible mitigation measures identified would not substantially reduce the noise effect of ni ghttime helicopter overflights on approximately 20 residences not previously significantly impacted, and mitigations that preclude nighttime overflights would be infeasible given helicopter flights involve emergency care situations. VI. Impact Overview and Growth Inducing Impacts Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project VI-3 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 B. Cumulative Impacts The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) defines cumulative impacts as two or more individual impacts which, when considered t ogether, are substantial or which compound or increase other environmental impacts. The cumu lative analysis is intended to describe the \"incremental impact of the project when added to other, closely related past, present, or reasonably foreseeable future projects\" that can result from \"individually minor but collectively significant projects taking place over a period of time (CEQA Guidelines Section 15355). The analysis of cumulative impacts is a two-phase pr ocess that first involves the determination of whether a project, together with reasonably foreseeable projects, would result in a significant impact. If there would be a significant cumulative impact of all such projects, the EIR must determine whether the project's incremental eff ect is cumulatively considerable, in which case, the project itself is deemed to have a significant cumulative effect (CEQA Guidelines Section 15130). Cumulative impacts that could occur as a result of the Proposed Project are discussed in the appropriate sections of Chapter IV of this report. The Project would result in significant cumulative impacts as follows: 2035 Traffic Intersection Operations Impact TRANS-3a: The signalized intersectio n of Castro Valley Boulevard/Strobridge Avenue/Stanton Avenue (#8) would operate at LOS F under 2035 No Project conditions. The intersection would continue to operate at LOS F with the addition of Proposed Project traffic and the Proj ect traffic would increase the westbound approach delay by more than four seconds during the AM peak hour. (Significant) Impact TRANS-3c: The westbound approach at the unsignalized intersection of Strobridge Avenue/I- 580 westbound off-ramp (#10) would operate at LOS F during the AM peak hour and LOS E during the PM peak hour under 2035 No Project conditions. The westbound approach would continue to operate at LOS E and F conditions respectively, with the addition of Proposed Project traffic. This is a significant impact because the intersection would operate at an unacceptable level, the project would add ten or more project trips to the intersection peak hour flow, and the intersection would meet the peak hour signal warrant (Warrant 3) without and with the project. (Significant) Impact TRANS-3d: The signalized intersection of Strobridge Avenue/I-580 EB Ramps/Gary Drive (#11) would operate at LOS E during the AM and PM peak hours under 2035 Without Project conditions. The intersection would continue to operate at LOS E with the addition of Project traffic. This is a significant impact because the Proposed Project would increase the total in tersection average delay by more then four seconds during the PM peak hour. (Significant) VI. Impact Overview and Growth Inducing Impacts Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project VI-4 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 C. Growth-Inducing Impacts Section 15126.2(d) of the CEQA Guidelines requires that an EIR should discuss \"...the ways in which the Proposed Project could foster economic or population growth, or the construction of additional housing, either directly or indirectly , in the surrounding environment.\" Growth can be induced in a number of ways, including through th e elimination of obstacles to growth, through the stimulation of economic activity within the region, or through precedent-setting action. The Proposed Project would replace the Existing Hospital with a New Hospital in order to comply with State-mandated earthquake-resistan t standards for acute care facilities. The New Hospital would be essentially the same size as the Existing Hospital, although approximately 48 fewer licensed beds would be included in the Ne w Hospital. In addition, the deconstruction of the Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital would r esult in a reduction of approximately 79 licensed beds over the entire Project Site. The total daily population, which includes patients, doctors, and staff, would remain roughly the same at approximately 1,343 persons. The Proposed Project also includes the demolition of four older medical buildings to be replaced by a new Medical Office Building (MOB). The net increase in medical office space would be approximately 60,000 sq. ft. An existing 42-unit apartment complex, Pine Cone Apartments, would also be demolished as part of the Project and would not be replaced. Employment at the New Hospital is expected to be reduced by almost ten percent in comparison to the Existing Hospital. Some increase in employme nt on the Project Site will occur with the net increase of approximately 60,000 sq.ft. MOB space a nd is not anticipated to be substantial. Tenants currently residing at the 42-unit Pine C one Apartments complex would be displaced as a result of the Project. However, existing housing in Castro Valley, Alameda County, and the greater Bay Area would be expected to accommodate residents displaced by the Project and would not directly result in the need to c onstruct additional housing in the surrounding area. The Proposed Project is not expected to be a catalyst for other significant development or population growth in the area, directly or indirectly, requiring new infrastructure not previously considered and analyzed . New infrastructure required to develop the Project is directly associated with the Proposed Project and is generally located within the \"contained\" Project Site. No offsite infrastructure improvements are proposed that would potentially induce growth not otherwise anticipated. D. Significant Irreversible Environmental Effects The CEQA Guidelines requires that an EIR examine the significant irreversible environmental effects of the Proposed Project. Section 15126.2(c) of the CEQA Guidelines identifies irreversible environmental changes as those involving a large commitment of nonrenewable resources or irreversible damage resulting from environmental accidents. VI. Impact Overview and Growth Inducing Impacts Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley, Replacement Hospital Project VI-5 ESA / 207766 Draft Environmental Impact Report December 2008 Total building area of the Proposed Project would increase by approximately two percent over existing conditions. During construction, th e Project would involve a commitment of nonrenewable resources, including building mate rials and fossil fuels. Post-construction commitment of nonrenewable resources would be antic ipated to remain generally equivalent to current levels. The consumption of nonrenewab le resources during construction would not be considered significant in comparison to the av ailability of these resources. Likewise, the post- construction commitment of these resources would not be considered significant when projected resource consumption due to the Proposed Proj ect is compared to current consumption. Accidental release of hazardous materials during environmental accidents would similarly not be expected to increase because th e size of the Proposed Project is essentially the same as the existing developed site. The risk associated w ith hazardous materials and waste from hospital activities would not increase over existing conditions . Environmental damage due to accidental release of hospital waste that could affect the su rrounding area is unlikely to be irreversible. State safety requirements and hospital policies and regulations regarding handling of hazardous materials would reduce the public health and safety risks so that significant irreversible effects from accidental releases would not be anticipated. E. Effects Found to be Less than Significant The Initial Study prepared for the Proposed Project identified that, for the environmental topics listed below, the Proposed Project would result in less-than-significant impacts. As discussed in Chapter I (Introduction) of this EIR, the inform ation and analysis presented in the Initial Study provides substantial evidence to conclude for mo st of these topics that (1) the analyses in the Initial Study satisfy the requirements of CEQA a nd (2) CEQA standards triggering preparation of further environmental review do not exist. Simila rly, the analysis presented in this EIR provides substantial evidence supporting findings of less than significant for several topics.

The Existing Hospital and located in the cen tral portion of the site. Other buildings on the site include several low-rise medical office build ings, a 6-story parking garage, the single-story Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital and associat ed parking and circulation roadways. Uses surrounding the project site primarily include a mix of residential uses, medical offices and medical support use, and commercial businesses. The majority of the project site (the portion th at makes up the existing Eden Medical Center) is within the \"Office & Medical Office Commercial\" General Plan land use designation, with a small portion (with existing apartment buildi ng) located within the \"Medium Density Residential\" land use designation. Existing zoning on the majority of the project s ite is \"CV Central Business District, Subarea 4 - Lake Chabot Road - Hospital/Medical-Oriented Office and Retail\" (referred to as \"Subarea 4\"), and smaller parcels along Stanton Avenue are within the \"R-S (CSU, D-31), Suburban Residential\" zoning designation. Project Purpose and Need All existing hospitals within the state are require d to comply with the regulations developed by the California Office of Statewide Health Pl anning and Development (OSHPD) as mandated by California Senate Bill 1953 (SB 1953) adopted in February 1994. The emphasis of SB 1953 is that essential hospital facilities should remain opera tional after an earthquake and provide full acute medical services. The existing Eden Medical Center Hospital (\"Existing Hospital\") would need to meet these standards to continue ope rations as a general acute care hospital facility beyond January 1, 2013. To comply with SB 1953, SMCCV proposed to develop a new state-of-the-art acute care hospital, totaling approximately 230,000 square feet (sf) and containing approximately 130 licensed beds (\"New Hospital\"). The New Hosp ital will replace the Existing Hospital prior to the January 1, 2013 compliance date in SB 1953. The SMCCV Pr oject will assure that medical services will continue to be provided by a licensed acute care hospital on the existing Eden Medical Center Castro Valley Campus (as expanded for construc tion of the New Hospital) during construction and thereafter without disruption. In addition to the New Hospital, the Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley Replacement Hospital Project (\"SMCCV Project\" or \"proposed project\" will include a relocated helistop, a new Medical O ffice Building (MOB) and other improvements and changes to the Project site as described below. 1 Conditional Second Unit, Overlay District to the R-S Zone to establish reside ntial density standards. May 5, 2008 Notice of Preparation Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley Replacement Hospital Project 3 In 2004, Alameda County received and proceeded in itially to process an application for an Eden Medical Center replacement acute care hospital project (\"2004 plan\"). The County published an Initial Study and NOP for the 2004 plan in June 2004, however, the 2004 plan did not proceed past the initial development application phase. Proposed Project Elements New Hospital The approximately 230,000 square-foot, 130-be d New Hospital will be positioned in the northwest portion of the SMCCV Project Site, at a higher elevation than the Existing Hospital. Given the significant variation in topography acro ss the site, the building will be 6 stories on the eastern side of the building and 7 stories on the western side of the building. The New Hospital will include critical care, neurosciences, women' s and infant's health services, emergency and level II trauma medical services, ancillary services (e .g., laboratory, outpatient surgery, diagnostic imaging and intervention services, in addition to hospital support services (administrative, materials management, patient/visitor support func tions, etc.). Overall, the New Hospital is expected to serve approximately the same c ase load as the Existing Hospital. The proposed changes that will occur with the New Hospital pr ogram also are not expected to substantially increase the number of patients (in-patient or out- patient), visitors or me dical doctors and hospital staff on site (in total or within any work shift) compared to existing conditions. Helistop Relocation The location of the New Hospital requires that th e existing helistop be relocated approximately 150 feet northeast of the present pad. The new pa d will be approximately 200 feet from the New Hospital's emergency department entrance, and an undeveloped earthen knoll on which the existing helistop is located will be graded dow n approximately 13 feet (to an elevation approximately 5 feet higher than the existing pad) to provide for the necessary flight pad obstruction clearances required by Caltrans Divi sion of Aeronautics and to provide easy access via a moderately sloped ramp. Helicopter flight paths to the relocated pa d will remain essentially the same as the existing routes and helicopter service will continue uninterrupted during construction of the New Hospital (see Phasing , below). Medical Office Building (MOB) An approximately 80,000 square-foot, 3-story MO B is planned adjacent to the New Hospital to be developed concurrently or as a later phase of the proposed project after the New Hospital is completed and is operational. Demolition of Existing Structures The SMCCV Project requires the demolition of the following existing structures to accommodate development of the proposed project and/or to ensure compliance with SB-1953 for seismically- obsolete facilities: Notice of Preparation May 5, 2008 Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley Replacement Hospital Project 4 Existing Hospital - The Existing Hospital (approx. 235,500 sq.ft.) will remain open throughout construction and until the New Hospita l is completed and open, and then will be closed and demolished. Eden Professional Offices - Four older 1- and 2-story existing medical office buildings (totaling approx. 19,570 sq.ft.) north of the Existing Hospital will be demolished to facilitate construction of the New Hospital. Pine Cone Apartments - The 42-unit Pine Cone Apartment complex (fronting Stanton at Nordell Avenue) will be demolished to fac ilitate construction of the New Hospital. Laurel Grove Hospital - The 1-story, approximately 46,000-square-foot Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital, a seismically obsolete acute rehabilitation facility at the northeast corner of the site will be demolished. SMCCV currently anticipates that the Laurel Grove rehabilitation program would be relocated to the vacant fourth floor of San Leandro Hospital, where adequate programmatic capacity exists. Access, Circulation and Parking All access to the SMCCV project site will be essentially the same as existing conditions, except that an additional driveway for emergency ve hicles only (ambulance and fire trucks) and a support and delivery traffic access driveway are proposed on Stanton Avenue. Internal site circulation will involve two circular loop roads - one that currently exists around the Existing Hospital as well as a new perimeter loop road around the New Hospital. Preliminary estimates indicate that the SMCCV Project will provide approximately 1,136 parking spaces to serve the proposed project at buildout. Th is total does not consider parking reductions that are anticipated with implementation of a Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Program and any improved site circulation. The existing 447-space, 6-stor y garage will continue to serve the proposed project and approximately 320 spaces will be provided in landscaped parking lots and structured parking. During cons truction, parking for construction workers will be provided offsite, and a temporary shuttle system will transport workers to the project site. Landscaping and Open Space The SMCCV Project Site will incorporate tree-lined main boulevards, small park-like areas available to SMCCV users (and not restricted from general public access) that take advantage of long-range views from the hilltop area of the site. Sustainable Design and Building Materials The SMCCV Project will incorporate sustainabl e elements in its design, construction and operations. Primarily, the proposed project will o ccur on a previously developed site currently served by infrastructure, utilities and public trans it. Site design strategies include maximizing pervious and landscaped areas, implementing established best management practices (BMPs) for stormwater management, minimizing grading and using light-colored roof materials. Construction strategies will include deconstructi on (versus demolition) of the Existing Hospital (and Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital), recy cling and reuse of concrete and metals from May 5, 2008 Notice of Preparation Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley Replacement Hospital Project 5 demolished structures (as permitted) for project site work, road work and structures,, adherence to an approved Storm Water Pollution Prevention Pl an (SWPPP) and use of Lean Construction Methodology (e.g., promoting coordination, reduced changes, off-site fabrication). Concrete materials not needed for the project site will be off-hauled from the site for Caltrans recycled material reuse. Other sustainable measures re garding water efficiency, energy use (through building mechanical systems and fixtures, archit ectural materials/coating selections and possible incorporation of a partial \"green roof\") and reducing motor vehicle trips to the site (TDM program). Construction Activities The SMCCV Project will be constructed in four phases, and each phase will involve demolition/deconstruction, grading and/or buildi ng construction activities. Construction activities will be confined to the area of new construc tion underway during each phase of the proposed project. General Plan and Specific Plan Am endments and other Entitlements The SMCCV Project will involve amendments to the Castro Valley Plan and the Castro Valley Central Business District Specific Plan to incorporate adjacent parc els into the medical/hospital use designation and clarify related development objectives and design policies relevant to the project. The proposed amendments are considered part of the SMCCV Project, however, there are other approvals required for the proposed pr oject including: County approval for Planned Development Zoning and a phased subdivision ma p (to merge, re-subdivide and map multiple parcels that comprise the SMCCV Project Site). Subsequent and additional Site Development Review and Design Review will be sought for th e Future MOB in conjunction with its later design development if the MOB is not develope d at the same time as the New Hospital. Project Phasing Full buildout and operation of the SMCCV Project is anticipated by approximately 2015 and will occur through the fo llowing four phases: Phase 1 - 3rd Quarter 2009 to 4th Quarter 2010 (6 months) - Demolish Eden Profession Offices - Demolish Pine Cone Apartments - Demolish and relocate Helistop and pedest rian connection to Existing Hospital - Prepare New Hospital site Phase 2 - 1st Quarter 2010 to 3rd Quarter 2012 (2.5 years) - Construct New Hospital - Develop new surface parking and circul ation (at demolished Eden Professional Offices location) Phase 3 - 1st Quarter 2013 to 3rd Quarter 2013 (9 months) - Demolish Existing Hospital (after New Hospital opens) - Demolish Laurel Grove Rehabilitation Hospital - Develop new surface parking and circula tion (at demolished Ex isting Hospital and Laurel Grove locations) Notice of Preparation May 5, 2008 Sutter Medical Center, Castro Valley Replacement Hospital Project 6 Phase 4 - Future Phase (18 months) - Construct Future MOB/Parking (remove por tion of surface parking and circulation developed in Phase 2), unless constructed in Phase 2. A more detailed Project Description is presented in the Initial Study, which is summarized from the project sponsor's project app lication submitted to the County. Preliminary Evaluation of Impacts Based on the preliminary evaluation of poten tial project impacts in the Initial Study, the following environmental factors could be subject to at least one impact that is considered \"Potentially Significant\" and will be analyzed fu rther in and EIR that shall be prepared to evaluate environmental effects associated with implementation of the SMCCV Project: Aesthetics Air Quality Biological Resources Cultural Resources Geology, Soils, and Seismicity Hazards and Hazardous Materials Hydrology and Water Quality Land Use and Planning Noise Population and Housing Public Services Transportation and Traffic Utilities and Service Systems Agency Mailing List for SMCCV Project NOP Mailing 5/1/08 PUBLIC AGENCIES (*Also identified in SCH Transmittal) FAA, Chf., Air Space & Proc.

Jurdy Date: November 24 , 2008 Subject: Sutter Medical Center EIR Technical Noise Section Please find below the technical noise section of the EIR document reflecting the most recent mechanical yard's layout and equipment. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments. Affected Environment Noise within the Eden Medical Center campus and in its immediate vicinity is due to sources that are commonly found in an urban environment. Namely these sources are; vehicular traffic activities on major arterials ( such as Castro Valley Boulevard) and on minor streets (such as Lake Chabot road and Stanton Avenue) , mechanical ventilation equipment, delivery trucks, and emergency vehicles accessing the campus. Noise from distant I -580 was also audible at times and during lulls in local traffic. Alameda Co unty Noise Ordinance as described under Chapter 6.60, N oise, establishes noise limits for the surrounding properties . The Ordinance under Section 6.60.040, Exterior Noise Level Standards, requires that the noise generated by the hospital and that is recei ved at the neighboring residential land use be limited to 50 dBA during the daytime (7 am to 10 pm) and to 45 dBA during the nighttime (10 pm to 7 am). Exceeding the allowable noise limits for periods of time within any one hour is permitted by the ordin ance as described in the following Table. Category Cumulative Number of Minutes in any one hour time period Daytime 7 am to 10 pm Nighttime 10 pm to 7 am 1 30 50 dBA 45 dBA 2 15 55 dBA 50 dBA 3 5 60 dBA 55 dBA 4 1 65 dBA 60 dBA 5 0 70 dBA 65 dBA *Alameda County Noise Ordinance, Chapter 6, Table 6.60.040A Section 6.60.070, Special Provisions or Exceptions, exempts noise due to ambulance sirens and construction from the provisions set forth under Section 6.60.040. To be exempt c onstruction 720 Olive Way Suite Medical Center Page 2 of 8 November 24 , 2008 activities shall take place between the hours of 7 am and 7 pm on weekdays and between the hours of 8 am and 5 pm on weekends. Medical Center Noise Sources A new mechanical yard is planned for the northwest corner of the new addition . This two - level mechanical yard contains emergency generators, chillers, cooling towers, boilers, and pumps. The upper level is 6 feet below ground level and the lower level is 20 feet below ground. The yard is surrounded by a 12 feet high wall starting at ground level . The effe ctive barrier height for the yard's upper level is 18 feet and the effective yard's lower level height is 32 feet. The nearest residential property line s to the yard are 65 feet due north and 195 feet due west. Mechanical equipment preliminary selections and no ise information is shown under Appendix 1. Other Equipment is located on the building rooftop. Rooftop mechanical equipment consists of ventilation air handling units and miscellaneous exhaust fans. There is at least 100 feet between any rooftop equipment the nearest residential property line to the north. This equipment has not been as of the writing of this report. However, not-to-exceed sound power levels have been specified to ensure compliance with the Ordinance. The future loading dock is located on the west side of the new building addition just south of the mechanical yard. Delivery trucks usage of the existing dock were counted on Monday April 21, 2008 and Tuesday May 22nd 2008 to establish a frame of reference of the number of visitin g trucks per day. The number ranged between 18 trucks on Monday and 24 trucks on Tuesday . A log of the counted trucks and their lengths is shown under Appendix 2 . The majority of the delivery trucks were in the range of 25 -foot long. One 53 -foot long w as counted on Monday and two 53 -foot trucks were counted on Tuesday. Noise levels used in the model for 53 -foot trucks were 75 dBA and for 25 -foot truck was 70 dBA at elevations of 12 feet and 10 feet, respectively. The reference distance for the noise l evel was 50 feet. Impacts and Mitigation Long term noise impacts due to the hospital addition of mechanical equipment and the loading dock activities were investigated. Based on preliminary selection of equipment, noise received by the nearest residentia l properties to the north and the west is expected to exceed the Alameda County noise limits. The predicted noise levels at the nearest property line were approximately 81 dBA during the daytime and the nighttime when the emergency generator is running. In the absence of the emergency generators, the predicted daytime and nighttime noise levels at the nearest property line were 64 dBA and 58 dBA, respectively. Noise control strategies such as selection of quiet equipment, the use of sound traps (silenc ers) on air moving devices, enclosures for specific equipment, and the positioning of sound barriers will be incorporated as the design and the selection of mechanical equipment evolves to ensure compliance with the Noise Ordinance daytime and nighttime li mits. Following is a summary of noise mitigation measures used for the mechanical yard and their estimated effectiveness. All of these measures are necessary to meet the noise limits at the property line. Quiet type cooling towers reduced noise levels at the source by about 12 dB over standard cooling towers. James Mobley, Devenney Group Sutter Medical Center Page 3 of 8 November 24 , 2008 Sound barrier around the yard reduced noise levels between 8 to 15 dB depending on the location of the equipment and the elevation of the source relative to the barrier. Emergency generator acoust ical enclosure reduced the generators noise by approximately 30 to 35 dB over emergency generator with weather enclosure. Emergency generator exhaust stack will be equipped with muffler(s) to reduce the stacks' noise to 68 dBA at 3 feet from the stack sinc e the sound barrier is not effective in reducing the stacks' noise. Given the height of the stack, noise reduction is not expected from the sound barrier. Acoustical shroud are planned to be placed at the boilers' blowers to reduce their noise by approx imately 5 dB. The surface of the sound barrier facing the yard and building fa\u00e7ade facing the yard to be covered with sound absorptive material. Building fa\u00e7ade to start at elevation -18 feet and up to +12 feet (top of sound barrier). North, south and we st sound barrier sound absorptive material to be placed between elevations -6 feet and +12 feet (tope of sound wall). As the rooftop equipment design progresses, noise analysis will be conducted to ensure that the noise ordinance requirements are met at t he surrounding properties. The approach to noise control will consist of selecting quiet type equipment, strategically orienting equipment on the roof, incorporation of silencers, and positioning of sound screens. Noise predicted from delivery truck at the loading dock ranged between 60 dBA and 65 dBA. This level exceeded Alameda County Noise Ordinance requirements . A 15 foot tall sound barrier is planned along the west and parts of the south property line to reduce the loading dock's noise . Also, prov iding a solid south wall to the loading dock, and an absorptive overhang along with the barrier will reduce the loading dock noise received by the residential properties to the west to within the noise ordinance requirements. See f igure s 1 and 2 below that describes the extent of the 15' barrier wall and loading dock construction. Figure 1: Loading dock details James Mobley, Devenney Group Sutter Medical Center Page 4 of 8 November 24 , 2008 Figure 2: Loading dock details Because there is an entrance planned within the west wall, a solid barrier does not meet the use requirements of this space. Therefore, a solid gate as described below, and in figure 3, is recommended to meet both use requirements and to meet the noise ordinance requirements. Without this gate, the noise levels at the neighboring properties within direct line of sight of the loading dock (as shown highlighted in yellow in Figure 4 below ) are predicted to be between 50 dBA and 55 dBA. Weight: 2.5 lb/sq. ft., The gate needs to be comprised of continuous solid panels Min. Height: 12' Max. Distance from ground to ga te: 6\" Min. Overlap on both sides of gate: 18\" Figure 3 : Retractable gate details for loading dock.

James Mobley, Devenney Group Sutter Medical Center Page 6 of 8 November 24 , 2008 Appendix 1: M echanical Yard Preliminary Equipment Selection and Noise Information Cooling Towers A total of three cooling towers are planned for the mechanical yard and are located on the upper level . Preliminary sizing suggests three towers at 350 ton capacity each. The cooling towers evaluated for this project are labeled by manufacturers as quiet type. Noise levels provided by manufacturers were: Sound pressure level of 59 dBA at 5 feet from the top (location of fan) Sound power level of 78 dBA. Noise predictio n assumed the elevation of the top of the cooling tower to be at 1 5 feet and the air inlet side to be at 7 feet relative to the upper level elevation . The cooling towers are expected to run at 50% of capacity between the hours of 10 pm and 7 am. Conseq uently, their noise level was reduced by 6 dB for the nighttime noise calculations. Emergency Generators Two emergency generators are planned for the mechanical yard and are located on the upper level . Their capacity is 800 KW each. Each generator is sp ecified to meet a sound pressure level of 65 dBA at 20 feet away and exhaust stack noise not exceeding 6 8 dBA at 3 feet away from stack . This requires the generators to be supplied with an acoustical enclosure. Noise prediction assumed the elevation of the generator noise as follows: Exhaust stack at 15 feet Generator enclosure discharge opening approximately 13 feet Generator enclosure intake opening at approximately 3 feet Chillers Chillers are located on the lower level . Cooling capacity is provided by three centrifugal type chillers; two chillers are sized at 400 ton each and one chiller is sized at 250 ton. The sound power levels used in noise prediction model was 92 dBA for each 400 ton chiller and 86 dBA for the 250 ton chiller. Noise pre diction assumed the source of noise of the chillers at 9 feet above the location of the chiller . The chillers are expected to run at 50% of capacity between the hours of 10 PM and 7 AM. Consequently, their noise level was reduced by 3 dB for the nighttim e noise prediction. Boilers Three 200 -hp boilers are planned for the upper level of the mechanical yard. Only two of the three boilers will be running at any one time. The boilers' sound pressure levels used in the model was 90 dBA at 3 feet away from th e blower. The elevation of the source was assumed at 8 feet. Pumps A total of twelve pumps are planned for the mechanical yard. Three pumps are located on the upper level and the rest are located on the lower level . The size of the pumps is assumed at 50 hp each for the noise prediction model . Sound power level of 89 dBA per pump was used in the model and the source location was at 3 feet . James Mobley, Devenney Group Sutter Medical Center Page 7 of 8 November 24 , 2008 Pumps are expected to run at 50% of capacity between 10 pm and 7 am. Consequently, their noise level was reduc ed by 3 dB for the nighttime noise prediction.

We do not anticipate thatthe hospital improvement program will result in changes to existing percentages . 5.Contact information andhelicopter model s \"exhibit. 6.Estimated onsby time of day See accompanying \"Eden Medical Center Helicopter Operations Distribution \"spreadsheet. 7.Future estimated annual helicopter operations by time of day Use existing numbers. We do not anticipate thatthe hospital improvement program will result in changes to existing percentages . The following notes refer to the numbers on the\"Eden Medical Center Helicopter Operations Distribution \" spreadsheet : 1)In Table 1, o neflight represents onearrival andonedeparture. 2)In Tables 2 and 3, a rrival and departure quantities differ because four flights in the logs hadan arrival time listed but no departure time . 3)Inbound and outbound flight path alignments are based on what security personnel wrote in the logs. These may be based somewhat on the particular person 'sinterpretation of directions .Logs prepared over time by different security personnel may reflect different interpretations. Also, they may not always represent \"close -in\" flight paths. They m ay in some cases indicate what general direction thehelicopter approached from or departed toward. 4)Before June 16, 2007, most o utbound flight paths were listed in the logs with one direction. Starting on June 16, 20 07,most were listed in the logs with two directi ons. The first, acco rding to an Eden Security Department representative, represents the direction that the helicopter departedHeliplanners Aviation Planning Consultants -Heliport Specialists Page 2 31110 Avenida el represents thedirection in which it left thehospital campus. As an example ,\"W-E\" indicates that it lifted off the helipad toward the west (frequent because of prevailing w inds from thewest or northwest) but then executed a turn while still over the campus andleft the campus flying east bound. Flights from 6/16/07 and later are compiled using thisW-E convention in Table 5. Note 1: For general inform ation, t heaverage time span between an arrival and its associated departure forthe145 logged flights was 29.6 minutes. The shortest time span listed wastenminutes and the longest was two hours and tenminutes.

PROJECT SETTING I.A. Project Description and Location Sutter Medical Center Castro Valley (SMCCV) is proposing a new plan to replace the Existing Eden Hospital and other outdated medical facilities prior to the State mandated closure of the Existing Hospital. The major components of the project include: \u00a7 A new approximately 230,000 square foot/130 bed acute care hospital with a 40 station Universal Care Unit. \u00a7 A relocated helistop to an at grade location adjacent to the New Hospital. \u00a7 Use of the existing garage with new on-site access and with additional parking spaces in separate lots and below a new 80,000 square foot, four story, Medical Office Building (MOB). \u00a7 Demolition of the Existing Hospital after opening and transfer of operations to the New Hospital. \u00a7 Demolition of the Existing Laurel Grove Hospital and re-use of the site for surface parking. (Figure 1. Project Location)Sutter Medical Center Castro Valley PAGE 4 OF 12 10/13/2008I.B. Existing Site Condition The existing hospital site is composed of five separate parcels with a total area of approximately 18.97 acres. Four of the five parcels currently comprise the existing hospital campus; the fifth parcel encompasses the Pine Cone Apartments which will be demolished to provide additional area for the new hospital. The existing hospital is located on top of a hill near the center of the site. There is an approximately 52 foot vertical difference between the main entrance roadway elevation and the parking lot elevation near the existing helipad. The property is currently fully developed and covered with buildings, parking lots and landscaping. There is an existing subterranean storm drain system located throughout the campus. This system connects to an existing Alameda County Flood Control drain line located in Lake Chabot Road. I.C. Opportunities and Constraints for Stormwater Control The largest opportunity for Stormwater control arises from the new site design as it reduces the amount of impervious surface area. The following table is a summary of the preliminary pervious/impervious areas: Development Building (SF)Pervious 0 Design constraints include existing impermeable soils (estimated soil group type C or D), existing high intensity land use and moderate to high grade slopes at various portions of the project site. The site will be extensively graded to create building pads, parking and landscape areas. Disposal of stormwater runoff to deep infiltration is not feasible on this site due to the low permeability of the clay soils. Run-on from adjacent sites is not a significant issue for the existing or new site. The current Laurel Grove Hospital sits atop an existing stormwater culvert that connects to the existing Alameda County Flood Control District main storm drain line located in Lake Chabot Road. The removal of Laurel Grove Hospital, and the subsequent construction of a new parking lot on the site, will not require any significant modification to the existing storm drain line.Sutter Medical Center Castro Valley PAGE 5 OF 12 10/13/2008II. MEASURES TO LIMIT IMPERVIOUSNESS II.A. Measures to Cluster Development and Protect Natural Resources Measures to cluster development are minimal due to the high intensity development of existing hospital. II.B. Measures to Limit Directly Connected Impervious Area II.B.1. Selection of paving materials Conventional concrete and conventional asphalt are used throughout the site. Permeable pavements are impractical for this site because as much of the new pavements overlie expansive clay soils on moderate to steep slopes. II.B.2. Self-Retaining Areas Many of the impervious planting areas will be designed to be Self-Retaining to minimize the amount of water needing to be treated by BMP's. These areas will have individual drain lines that eliminated surface runoff to stormwater treatment BMP's. Exposed slopes in self-retained areas will be stabilized and revegetated as required.Sutter Medical Center Castro Valley PAGE 6 OF 12 10/13/2008III. SELECTION AND PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF STORMWATER TREATMENT BMPS Stormwater runoff from impervious areas of the new hospital site (roofs and paved areas of the new hospital and MOB), will be collected and conveyed to one of two large treatment BMPs (bioretention areas) via a new subterranean storm drain system. Each of these two bioretention areas will have an area of approximately 7,823 sf and 6,388 sf respectively. These BMPs are located to accommodate the complex drainage areas and topography of the site, while allowing maintenance access from parking areas. Stormwater runoff from impervious areas of the new parking lot on the existing Laurel Grove Hospital site will be treated by bioretention areas located in the interior planter islands. Each BMP has adequate hydraulic head to allow drainage into, through, and away from the BMP without need for pumps. Runoff from all new impervious areas will be treated, except as follows: Existing parking areas and internal roadways that are not being modified will not be treated. Hydrograph Modification Management Preliminary analysis of the site pervious/impervious areas indicate that Hydromodification Management should not be required as the amount of post- development impervious surface area is being reduced compared to the pre- development areas. This assumption has been verified by modeling the existing and mitigated site designs using the Bay Area Hydrology Model. The analysis confirms that hydromodification will not be required, III.A. General Treatment BMP Characteristics All BMP's will be designed and constructed in accordance with the Alameda Countywide Clean Water Program Stormwater C.3 Stormwater Technical Guidance, Version 1.0, dated August 31, 2006, hereafter referred to as the \"Guidebook\". III.A.1. Bioretention Areas. Bioretention Areas shall be designed and constructed in accordance with Chapter 6.6 of the Guidebook. These BMP's are located away from all buildings within the parking lot areas where the landscaping configuration will allow their installation. Key design guidelines are described below: Ponding depth between 6 inches and 12 inches. Layer of sandy loam soil, minimum 18 inches deep, with a minimum infiltration rate of 5 inches per hour. Filter fabric between soil and gravel layersSutter Medical Center Castro Valley PAGE 7 OF 12 10/13/2008\u0081 Pea gravel or drain rock layer, minimum 12 inches deep. \u0081 Perforated pipe underdrain, min. 6 inches diameter, connected to off-site drainage. \u0081 Overflow drain connected to off-site drainage. \u0081 Plantings suitable to the imported sandy loam soil, the site, and the location. Plantings will be selected to minimize potential future need for fertilizers orpesticides. III.B. Specific Characteristics of Each Impervious Area and Swale Specific descriptions of each drainage area and swale follow: \u0081 [Detail to follow]Sutter Medical Center Castro Valley PAGE 8 OF 12 10/13/2008IV. SOURCE CONTROL MEASURES The project will create few potential sources of storm water pollutants. Sources to be controlled are: Potential dumping of standard commercial cleaning supplies or other liquids into storm drain inlets. Potential dumping of wash-water or other liquids into storm drain inlets. Fertilizers and pesticides used in landscape maintenance. Minor oil and/or gasoline spills in the parking lot area. Vehicle washing. Table 2 lists potential pollutant sources on the development site and the corresponding source control measures specified in the Stormwater C.3 Guidebook, Second Edition, Appendix E. All areas where these activities occur will drain to storm water treatment BMPs. To further reduce the potential for pollutants to enter runoff, permanent and operational BMPs will be implemented as described in Table 2. All areas where these activities occur will drain to stormwater treatment BMPs. To further reduce the potential for pollutants to enter runoff, permanent and operational BMPs will be implemented as described in Table 4.Sutter Medical Center Castro Valley PAGE 9 OF 12 10/13/2008V. PERMITTING AND CODE COMPLIANCE ISSUES There are no known conflicts between the stormwater control BMPs and other Alameda County codes or other development requirements.Sutter Medical Center Castro Valley PAGE 10 OF 12 10/13/2008VI. BMP OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE VI.A. Means to Finance and Implement BMP Maintenance VI.A.1. Commitment to Execute any Necessary Agreements. Developer agrees to provide any necessary easements or rights of entry to Alameda County for access and inspection of stormwater BMPs and to make provision of easements or rights of entry a condition of sale. VI.A.2. Statement Accepting Responsibility for Operation and Maintenance until Responsibility is transferred. Developer agrees to operate and maintain the swales and bioretention areas constructed in connection with the project until one of the following occurs: (1) Acceptance of maintenance responsibility by the County, including the filing of all required easements and establishment of a special district or other permanent funding mechanism or (2) the sale of the property and transfer or responsibility to a new owner. VI.A.3. Stormwater Facilities Operation and Maintenance Plan Developer will submit, with the application for building permits, a draft Stormwater Facilities Operation and Maintenance Plan including detailed maintenance requirements and a maintenance schedule. VI.B. Summary of Maintenance Requirements Bioretention Areas remove pollutants primarily by filtering runoff slowly through an active layer of soil. Routine maintenance is needed to insure that flow is unobstructed, that erosion is prevented, and that soils are held together by plant roots and are biologically active. Typical routine maintenance consists of the following: Inspect inlets for channels, exposure of soils, or other evidence of erosion. Clear any obstructions and remove any accumulation of sediment. Examine rock or other material used as a splash pad and replenish if necessary. Inspect outlets for erosion or plugging. Inspect side slopes for evidence of instability or erosion and correct as necessary. Observe soil at the bottom of the swale or filter for uniform percolation throughout. If portions of the swale or filter do not drain within 48 hours after the end of a storm, the soil should be tilled and replanted. Remove any debris or accumulations of sediment. Confirm that check dams and flow spreaders are in place and level and that channelization within the swale or filter is effectively prevented. Examine the vegetation to insure that it is healthy and dense enough to provide filtering and to protect soils from erosion. Replenish mulch as necessary, remove fallen leaves and debris, prune large shrubs or trees, and mow turf areas.Sutter Medical Center Castro Valley PAGE 11 OF 12 10/13/2008Confirm that irrigation inadequate and not excessive. Replace dead plants and remove invasive vegetation. Abate any potential vectors by filling holes in the ground in and around the swale and by insuring that there are no areas where water stands longer than 48 hours following a storm. If mosquito larvae are present and persistent, contact the Alameda County Vector Control District for information and advice. Mosquito larvicide's should be applied only when absolutely necessary and then only by a licensed individual or contractor.Sutter Medical Center Castro Valley PAGE 12 OF 12 10/13/2008VII.
