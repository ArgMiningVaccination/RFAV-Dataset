One Health 167ix Foreword Malnutrition, in all its forms, is a global concern that has lasting health, developmental and economic impacts for individuals, communities and nations. One-tenth of the global population faces hunger. Three billion people are unable to afford healthy diets. At the same time, one in three people is overweight or obese, almost a quarter of children under five years of age are stunted and anaemia affects more than half a billion of women. While all forms of malnutrition have multiple causes, healthy diets are central to prevention of them all. Sustainable agrifood systems must be part of the solution to achieve affordable healthy diets for all, specifically those in situations of vulnerability. Nutrient needs of humans varies substantially over their life course. While there are a variety of dietary patterns that can meet those needs, foods that are rich in nutrients are a critical part of a healthy diet. Terrestrial animal source foods provide energy and many essential nutrients, such as protein, fatty acids and several vitamins and minerals that are less common in other food types. Livestock species and breeds are adapted to a wide range of environments. They contrib - ute to healthy diets particularly in areas less suited or unsuitable for crop production. However, to optimize this contribution to human and planetary health, the livestock sector must contribute to addressing a range of challenges. These include issues related to the environment (e.g. deforestation, land-use changes, greenhouse-gas emissions, unsustainable water and land use, pollution, food-feed competition), herd management (e.g. low productivity, overgrazing, poor animal welfare), animal health related issues (e.g. diseases, antimicrobial resistance), human-livestock related issues (e.g. zoonotic and food-borne diseases) and social issues (e.g. equity). At its 27th Session, in October 2020, FAO's Committee on Agriculture (COAG) requested the Organization \"to produce a comprehensive, science and evidence-based global assessment of the contribution of livestock to food security, sustainable food systems, nutrition and healthy diets.\" The assessment follows an agrifood systems approach and applies a One Health perspective to the economic, social and environmental dimensions when reviewing how the livestock sector contributes to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It will consist of four component documents. This first component document - a milestone in the work of COAG's Sub-Committee on Livestock - focuses on the downstream impacts of terrestrial animal source food consumption as part of healthy diets and provides a robust systematic review of the evidence for its contribution to health and nutrition outcomes. This review includes an analysis of policy consumption recommendations. The assessment supports COAG's Sub-Committee on Livestock in its quest to optimize the role of livestock, including their contributions to poverty alleviation, food security and nutrition, sustainable livelihoods and the realization of the 2030 Agenda.

Specific amino acids and bioactive factors with roles in human health (carnitine, creatine, taurine, hydroxy- proline TASF. The long-chain fatty acids and the ratios of essential fatty acids found in TASF are important for cognition across all phases of the human life course. u Iron and zinc in red meat are bound in compounds that are more bioavailable and may be more easily digested than those in which they are bound in plant- based foods. Milk is well recognized for its high concen- tration and bioavailability of calcium, among other nutrients. Eggs have high concentrations of choline and some long-chain fatty acids. Generally, TASFs are a rich source of selenium, vitamin B12 and choline. Consumption of TASF has been shown to counteract the effects of antinutrients found in plant-based foods. u The nutritional quality of TASFs (especially the fat composition) can be influenced by (in order of prior - ity) choice of animal species and feeding system, followed by breed and production environment. Effects of terrestrial animal source food on nutrition and health over the life course u Dietary intakes of TASF can have effects on nutrition (improved nutrient status, increased anthropometry), health (reduced infectious disease, increased NCDs, immune system function broadly, improved bone Key findings Terrestrial animal source food (TASF), within healthy dietary patterns, can make vital contributions to efforts to meet the global nutrition targets for 2025 endorsed by the World Health Assembly1 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that aim to reduce stunting among children under five years, low birthweight, anaemia in women of reproductive age (15-49 years), overweight among children under five years, and obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in adults.2 health), and cognition (improved development, neuro - protection, neurological disease prevention). u For people in all life-course phases - including preg- nant and breastfeeding women, infants and young children, school-age children and adolescents, adults and older adults - the majority of evidence related to the influence of TASFs on nutrition and health comes from trials assessing milk and dairy products. Beef and eggs follow in terms of availability of evidence, with fewer studies available on pig and poultry meat, meat from wild animals, insects and meat from other minor species. Overall, the evidence suggests that, among apparently healthy individuals, TASF intakes at appro - priate levels benefit several health outcomes. A robust evidence base shows that milk and dairy consumption during pregnancy increases infant weight at birth and may also increase birth length and foetal head circum- ference. Among infants and young children, egg, milk and meat consumption has been studied, with mixed findings depending on overall diet and environmental exposure. Evidence shows that consumption of milk and dairy products by school-age children and adoles - cents increases height and reduces overweight and obesity. Beef consumption in this life-course phase has been shown to improve cognitive outcomes. u In adults, findings largely indicate that consumption of milk and dairy products (such as yoghurt) has positive effects in terms of reducing risk of all-cause mortality, hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, obesity, osteoporosis and fractures. Relatively robust evidence shows that egg consump - tion among adults does not increase the risk of stroke or coronary heart disease. Compelling evidence suggests that, in adults, meat intake of between 85 and 300 g/day can protect against iron deficiency. Poultry meat has not been studied as much as beef, but find- ings suggest non-significant effects on stroke risk, with subgroup analysis suggesting a protective effect in women. u The evidence base for red meat consumption in adults has been thoroughly assessed by the Global Burden of Disease Study and shows some increased risk of chronic disease associated with consumption of 23 g (18-27 g) 1.

However, other studies have shown non-signifi- cant effects of beef on chronic disease biomarkers. u Significant gaps remain in the evidence base for older adults. Preliminary evidence, however, suggests that milk and dairy products, and possibly other TASFs, may play a role in mitigating sarcopenia, fractures, frailty, dementia and Alzheimer's disease u Cow's milk and poultry eggs are among the eight food groups that pose allergenic risks to consumers, and it is therefore mandatory in many countries to state their presence in foods as part of precautionary allergen labelling. However, there is no evidence that avoiding such foods during infancy can delay or prevent reac - tions. Lactose malabsorption is widespread but does not automatically lead to lactose intolerance, which also greatly varies in severity. Policy recommendations on terrestrial animal source food consumption u Findings are based on a desk review of policy docu- ments including food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs), non-communicable disease-related documents and documents related to food and agriculture legislation and nutrition policies and programmes. u Most policy recommendations address TASF consump - tion in general, followed by meat, milk and dairy prod- ucts and eggs. There is significantly less coverage of offal, poultry, pig meat, meat from wild animals, and insects. u Most recommendations on TASF consumption are linked to human micronutrient needs and NCDs and target the entire population. Micronutrient-related recommen- dations tend to be more detailed than NCD-related recommendations, providing quantitative indications in terms of daily or weekly TASF intake. There are no specific recommendations on TASF consumption to address the risks associated with multiple forms of malnutrition (e.g. coexistence of micronutrient defi- ciency with overweight, obesity and NCDs). u In total, the review of policy documents identified 378 recommendations on TASF consumption that follow a life-course approach, 325 in FBDGs. Although the review identified a similar number of quantitative and qualitative recommendations, those in the FBDGs of high-income countries were the most detailed. u Environmental sustainability considerations were only included in documents from eight upper middle- and high-income countries, and these mostly provided qualitative recommendations. Animal welfare was only mentioned in the FBDGs of Denmark and Sweden, which mentioned the use of animal welfare labels to inform consumers. Food safety and food-borne disease issues related to terrestrial animal source food u One-third of the global food-borne disease burden is associated with the consumption of contaminated TASFs, mainly linked to bacterial causes and diarrhoea. While evidence on food-borne disease hazards and health outcomes, and on risk analysis methods, is well documented, knowledge of the national burden (inci- dence and severity) of food-borne diseases is lacking. The main transmission routes along the value chain are crucial to the targeting of national policies but are not well understood. u Changing agricultural practices (especially those related to the intensification of livestock production and input use), the lengthening and broadening of value chains, and increasing consumption of processed food contribute to increasing exposure to food-borne disease hazards. Antimicrobial resistance presents additional challenges, beyond those related to nutri- tion and food safety. u Food-safety burdens must be alleviated by enhanc - ing sanitation and mitigating health risks at the inter - faces between animals, humans and the environ- ment, through a One Health approach. Strengthening national food-control systems is key to ensuring food safety for better health and nutritional outcomes. Emerging topics u While cost and access remain a barrier, milk powder has been used extensively as an ingredient in fortified and blended foods, with evidence for its effectiveness when used as a therapeutic supplement in the management of severe acute malnutrition in infants and young child- ren. Egg powder and fish powder have been used to a significantly lesser extent as ingredients in fortified and blended foods, probably because of palatability and shelf-life issues and the processing techniques involved.xvi u Science related to TASF alternatives, including plant- based food and cell-cultured \"meat\" , is relatively new. Evidence suggests that these products cannot replace TASF in terms of nutritional composition. Microalgae are highly regarded as a TASF alternative because of their rich nutritional composition and the advantages they may offer as a natural carbon sink. Nevertheless, plant-based meat alternatives that are widely available on the market have been found to be deficient in some essential nutrients and high in saturated fat, sodium and sugar. Further research is also needed to complete food-safety risk assessment for cell-cultured \"meat\" produced at industrial scale. u While insects can provide many essential nutrients and there is some evidence on nutrition outcomes, cultural barriers and individual preferences currently interfere with consumer acceptability. The environmental sustainability appeal of using insects as human food seems compelling and may increase demand in the coming years. Nevertheless, food- safety concerns should be considered in the scaling up of insects as food or animal feed. u Current \"omics\" applications provide promising options for characterizing nutritional quality and safety, and developing precision or personalized nutrition (especially for defined targeted groups such as young children). u Microbiome science has recently revealed that some of the effects of the diet on health may be mediated by the gut microbiome - the trillions of microor - ganisms that live in the human gut. Diverse TASFs, including meat and fermented dairy products, influence the composition and functions of the gut microbiome and consequently affect human health via the production of microbial metabolites. High intake of red and processed meat and of animal saturated fats may induce deleterious effects, while fermented dairy products seem to be associated with reduced inflammation. Positive or negative impacts on health may be modulated by the overall quality of the diet (in terms of fats, sugars and fibre). u Assessment of the roles of TASF in sustainable healthy diets needs to consider regional variations in natural resources, background health and nutri- tion as well as people's nutritional needs over the life course, the availability and accessibility of food, and the ecosystem roles of livestock. Emerging evidence on the sustainability of diets shows that greater species diversity in the diet (plant-based foods, TASFs and aquatic foods) contributes to higher nutrient adequacy. Preliminary gaps u In conclusion, the findings of this document reveal some gaps in evidence and policy related to the contri- butions of TASF to healthy diets. To summarize: u A deeper understanding of the interactions of TASF nutrients and bioactive compounds with other foods in the overall diet and of the effects of TASF on nutrition, health and cognitive outcomes across the course of human lives is required. u Gaps remain in the literature on the nutritional compo - sition and health effects of several types of TASF, includ- ing those from poultry, goats, sheep, pigs, rabbits, wild animals and insects. u Robuster evidence is needed on the health effects of TASF consumption (underconsumption and over - consumption). Specifically, there is a need for studies with consistent design and methods, implemented in a range of different contexts (low- and middle-income countries and high-income countries). u While beyond the scope of the present assessment, examining the significance of TASF in the diets of unhealthy populations (for example, those that are diabetic, overweight or obese) may be merited given the high prevalence of these conditions. u National FBDGs should be updated with recommen- dations that provide ranges for daily intake of TASFs in different life-course phases. These recommendations should consider the implications of underconsump - tion and overconsumption of TASF given the increasing coexistence of micronutrient deficiencies and NCDs. u National FBDGs should be used to better inform live - stock policies, programmes and legislative frameworks on nutrition outcomes. xviiSetting the scene At its twenty-seventh session, in October 2020, the Committee on Agriculture (COAG), one of FAO's govern- ing bodies, requested FAO to produce a \"comprehensive, science and evidence-based global assessment of the contribution of livestock to food security, sustain able agrifood systems, nutrition and healthy diets.\" At the same session, the COAG established a Sub-Committee on Livestock to provide targeted guidance to stakeholders on this specific sector of agriculture. The assessment of the contribution of livestock to food security, sustainable agrifood systems, nutrition and healthy diets will be based on four component documents prepared for consideration by governing body sessions. The process will be accompanied and guided by a multi- disciplinary scientific advisory committee. Box 1. What is terrestrial animal source food? In this assessment, terrestrial animal source food (TASF) is taken to comprise all food products obtained from ter - restrial animals. The assessment covers TASFs derived from animal production systems of any scale, including integrated plant-animal production systems, specialized livestock production systems, and grazing systems and pastoralism. TASF includes food derived from the hunt- ing of wild animals and from wildlife farming. Food products covered include those derived from mammals, birds and insects. They are classified into the following food groups: eggs and egg products; milk and dairy products; meat and meat products; food from hunting and wildlife farming; and insects and insect products. Each group includes subgroups (e.g. red meat and poultry) and multiple food items coming from different species (e.g. beef and chicken meat). The assessment focuses mainly on unprocessed TASFs, as there are many different processed TASFs. However, the health consequences of processed TASFs are discussed in Section C, where evidence is available, and processed blended food products containing TASF ingredients are introduced in Section E. Aquatic food is beyond the scope of the assessment. Source: Food groups adapted from FAO & WHO. 2022. Global Individual Food consumption data Tool (GIFT).

The 166th FAO Council, in its report (http://www.fao.org/3/nf693en/nf693en.pdf ), defined agrifood systems as follows: The agrifood system covers the journey of food from farm to table - including when it is grown, fished, harvested, processed, packaged, transported, distributed, traded, bought, prepared, eaten and disposed of. It also encompasses non-food products that also constitute livelihoods and all of the people as well as the activities, investments and choices that play a part in getting us these food and agricultural products. In the FAO Constitution, the term \"agriculture\" and its derivatives include fisheries, marine products, forestry and primary forestry products.This document is the first component document of the assessment and focuses on the contribution of terrestrial animal source food (TASF) (see Box 1) to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health. Although - in line with the mandate from COAG - the focus of the document is on TASF, it recognizes that human nutrition requires dietary diversity and a full spectrum of healthy foods and food groups, including aquatic foods, to promote and main- tain health. The document builds on Livestock-derived foods and sustainable healthy diets (UN Nutrition, 2021), a document prepared by UN Nutrition that provides a general overview of topics covered by the four compo - nent documents of the present assessment and consid- ers the major health benefits, opportunities and potential trade-offs associated with sustainable production and consumption.xviiiThe present document deepens the analysis via a system- atic review focused specifically on nutrition and health outcomes related to TASF intake. It is intended to build consensus on the role of TASF in healthy diets by consid- ering the vulnerability of different target groups from economic, health and contextual perspectives. Healthy diets are fundamental to people's health and well-being. TASFs are among a range of food groups (see Box 2) that can contribute to diverse and balanced dietary patterns. This document focuses on the endpoints of the conceptual framework for agrifood systems (see Figure 1), Box 2. Food groups and subgroups related to terrestrial animal source food A food group is a set of foods that share similar nutri- tional properties or biological characteristics. The following food groups and subgroups related to ter - restrial animal source food are adapted from those used under the FAO/WHO Global Individual Food consump - tion data Tool (GIFT) (FAO and WHO, 2022): Eggs and egg products: mainly from poultry (chicken, duck, goose, quail and turkey), including fresh and pro - cessed foods such as dried eggs. Milk and dairy products: from mammalian livestock species, most commonly cattle, water buffalo, goat, sheep, dromedary and Bactrian camel. This group com- prises the following subgroups: fresh and processed milk: milk and products derived from milk by reducing water or/and increasing sugar content and isolating milk protein, such as evaporat- ed, condensed and powdered milk and milk protein; cheese, such as cured and uncured cheese, brined cheese, ripened cheese (soft and hard), cheese rind and processed cheese, such as spreads; cream, whey and any other milk products: products derived from milk by isolating its different fractions, including dried products such as powdered whey, cream and sour cream, and isolated whey protein, and manufactured products such as flavoured whey, cream and sour cream; fermented milk products, such as yoghurt, kefir, kumis and sour and fermented milk, including fla - voured and non-flavoured products; Meat and meat products: red and white meat from live- stock (both ruminants and monogastrics), offals and processed meat: red meat: meat from cattle, buffalo, goat, sheep, pig, dromedary, Bactrian camel, horse, donkey and yak; white meat: meat from rabbit and from chicken and other avian species (including duck, Muscovy duck, goose, guinea fowl, turkey, quail, pigeon, pheasant, ostrich) - characterized by its paleness; processed meat: a range of meat products that have undergone treatment such as salting, curing, smok - ing, marinating, drying or cooking; offals: organ meat and blood from mammalian and avian species, including liver, kidney, heart, lungs and intestines. Food from hunting and wildlife farming: food obtained from hunting of wild animals and from non-domesticat- ed animals raised on farms. Food from invertebrates, including insects and insect products: insects such as beetles, flies, bugs, ants and grubs, and other invertebrates such as spiders, mites, ticks and earthworms, including processed products such as dried invertebrates and manufactured products such as powdered.

The other three component documents will move upstream in the framework to examine the factors determining demand for, and supply and consumption of, TASF (Document 2), livestock-sector benefits, trade-offs and synergies with respect to food security and sustaina- ble agrifood systems (Document 3), and opportunities for transforming the livestock sector sustainably to optimize food and nutrition security (Document 4). It should be noted that the scope of this first component document is to assess the contribution of TASFs, at appropriate levels, in apparently healthy individuals and not to assess risks among individuals suffering from medical conditions.xixCLIMATE CHANGEGLOBALIZATION AND TRADEURBANIZATION AND MIGRATIONPOLITICAL AND AND FRAGILITYDEMOGRAPHIC LEVELS DISTRIBUTIONDRIVERS AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SUPPLY CHAINSFOOD ENVIRONMENTAGRIFOOD SYSTEMS DIETS CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND INDIVIDUAL FACTORS Food producon systems Storage and distribuon Processing and packaging Retail and markeng Food availability and physical access (proximity) Food prices (aordability) Promoon, adversing and messagging Income and purchasing power Intra-household food allocaonQuanty Quality Diversity Safety Informaon and knowledge Conscious and unconscious preferencesFood quality and safetyChoices on where and what food to acquire, prepare, cook, and eat based on individual factors of: POLICY , ACTIONS AND GOVERNANCENUTRITION AND HEALTH OUTCOMESOTHER IMPACTS Social, Economic, EnvironmentalFigure 1.

Rome.xxSummary About this document At its twenty-seventh session, in October 2020, FAO's Committee on Agriculture (COAG) requested FAO to produce a \"comprehensive, science and evidence-based global as - sessment of the contribution of livestock to food security, sustainable agrifood sys - tems, nutrition and healthy diets.\" This assessment will involve four component doc - uments prepared for consideration by FAO's governing bodies. A synthesis document will be prepared based on the four component documents. The present document (Component Document 1) is the first part of the assessment and focuses on the down- stream impacts of terrestrial animal source food (TASF) on healthy diets for improved nutrition and health. An overview of the approach, scope and timeline of the assess - ment and of stakeholder involvement in its preparation was agreed by the First Session of COAG's Sub-Committee on Livestock in March 2022 (FAO, 2022a). The Sub-Committee on Livestock invited Members to provide comments on a draft version of the document, and these have been incorporated into the present version. Component Document 1 is a synthesis of evidence on TASF's contributions to human nutrition and health, in line with the mandate from COAG. The document considers TASF within the context of healthy diets and the full array of foods and food groups important to human health, including aquatic animal foods. The document was prepared through a consultative process involving a team from FAO, a scientific advisory committee and a wider group of technical experts (potential con- tributors). Three major themes were identified and these constitute the focus of the three sections of the document: 1. nutrient composition and value of TASF; 2. effects of TASF on health and nutrition over the life course; and 3. food safety and food-borne dis - eases. A fourth section focuses on emerging topics related to TASF and describes novel themes in the literature that have prospects for growth and salience in public discourse. Terrestrial animal source food and the world nutrition situation TASF, within the context of healthy diets delivered by efficient, inclusive, sustainable and resilient agrifood systems, can make important contributions to efforts to meet the 2025 World Health Assembly and 2030 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) nutrition targets. Trends in nutrition indicators show that the world is currently not on track to attain several of these targets. This document provides evidence that TASF, within ap - propriate dietary patterns, can help achieve milestones related to reducing stunting and wasting among children under five years of age, low birthweight, anaemia in women of reproductive age (15-49 years), overweight among children under five years of age, and obesity in adults. Evidence from the evolutionary past of Homo sapiens shows that higher dietary intakes of TASF were associated with increased stature, brain size and longevity, probably es - tablishing metabolic requirements in the human body that still need to be met today. At present, TASF dietary patterns vary across agrifood systems, with populations in some xxiregions having high intakes and consuming too much and those in others consuming to little. The ways in which TASF affects chronic disease and livestock production af - fects the environment are attracting increasing attention in the public domain. This has given rise to the need to provide decision-makers with an assessment of the evidence in this field. Nutrient and bioactive composition and value of terrestrial animal source food Several macronutrients, micronutrients and bioactive compounds found in TASF play unique and important roles in human health. TASF can provide large proportions of recommended nutrient intake (RNI) across the life course. The food matrix and overall diet of individuals modulate the digestibility, including the absorption and metabolism, of TASF nutrients in humans. TASF provides high-quality proteins, as indicated by the Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS), relative to other foods. Some amino acids and other compounds (carnitine, creatine, taurine, 4-hydroxyproline and anser - ine) are primarily available in human nutrition through consumption of TASF. These nutrients contribute vital functions in immune defence, anti-inflammatory pathways, memory and cognition. TASFs are also dense in dietary fats that can either promote or compromise health. Consuming diverse diets and appropriate levels of TASF can pro - vide the necessary ratios of essential fatty acids (linoleic to acids) and blood cholesterols (high-density to lipoprotein) and enable the ab - sorption of fat-soluble vitamins needed for human health. Dietary intakes of long-chain fatty acids from TASF are important for brain development and cognition across the life course, particularly in the absence of aquatic food. TASF can also provide critical micronutrients (minerals and vitamins) in bioavailable forms. Iron and zinc deficiencies are highly prevalent in populations around the world, contributing significantly to the global burden of disease. Animal meats offer these minerals in compounds that are more efficiently metabolized than those obtained from plant-based foods (PBFs). However, evidence suggests that iron availability from eggs and insects is lower than from meat. TASF is also a rich source of selenium, which plays crucial roles in anti-inflammatory and genome-level processes. Vitamin B12, which is necessary for growth, neurodevelopment function and maintenance, is largely sourced from TASFs in human nutrition, with only a few exceptions among PBFs (e.g. some sea- weeds). Choline, which is also concentrated in some TASFs, has garnered recent atten- tion for its vital roles in human growth, neurotransmission, and cell-membrane integrity and function, among other roles. Vitamin C, which is necessary for growth, develop - ment and repair of all body tissues, is found to some degree in milk and some types of meat but is absent in eggs, meaning that it needs to be obtained mainly from PBFs. Phytates, tannins and oxalates, found in some foods such as legumes and cereals, can interfere with the absorption of minerals and other nutrients in humans. Consumption of TASF has been shown to counteract the effects of these antinutrients. Lipids and fat-soluble vitamins in TASF have been shown to be affected by animal diets, and this has implications for decisions on animal feeding. In populations that do not consume significant quantities of fish, meat can contribute to dietary omega-3 require - ments, especially when the diets of the animals from which the meat is sourced include plants that are dense in polyunsaturated fatty acids.xxiiEffects of terrestrial animal source food on nutrition and health across the life course This section summarizes evidence on the roles of TASFs in human biology across the life course and the impacts of dietary intakes on nutrition (nutrient status and anthro - pometry), health (infectious disease, chronic disease and bone health) and cognition (development, neuroprotection and neurological disease prevention). Differential ef - fects are revealed by life-course phase: women during pregnancy and breastfeeding (including mother, foetus and breastfeeding child); infants and young children; school- age children and adolescents; adults; and older adults. Overall, most evidence comes from trials assessing milk and dairy products, followed by beef and eggs. There is gen- erally good regional representation in sampled populations, except in the case of older adults, for whom evidence comes predominantly from high-income countries. A robust evidence base shows that milk and dairy consumption during pregnancy in- creases birth weight in offspring and may also enhance birth length and foetal head circumference outcomes. Among infants and young children, egg, milk and meat con- sumption has been studied, with findings varying depending on overall diet and envi- ronmental exposure. Evidence for school-age children and adolescents also focuses on milk and dairy products and indicates that consuming them has positive effects in terms of increasing height and reducing overweight and obesity. Beef consumption during this phase has been shown to improve cognitive outcomes. In adults, findings largely indicate that eating milk and dairy products, specifically yo - ghurt, has positive effects in terms of reducing risk of all-cause mortality, hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, obesity, osteoporosis and frac - tures. However, evidence for an association between milk consumption and coronary heart disease is equivocal. Evidence shows that egg consumption in adults does not increase risk of stroke or coronary heart disease. Synthesized findings from risk analy- ses show that consumption of modest amounts of unprocessed red meat (ranging from 9 to 71 g/day) has minimal health risk. For processed red meat, however, very low levels of consumption can elevate risk of mortality and chronic disease outcomes, including cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer. Robust evidence shows that meat intake (85 to 300 g/day) is positively associated with iron status in adults. Poultry meat has been less studied than beef, but findings suggest that it has non-significant effects on stroke risk, with subgroup analyses suggesting a protective effect in women. Among older adults, epidemiological evidence for the health effects of TASF comes pri- marily from high-income countries. A fairly strong evidence-base shows that lean red meat consumption has positive effects on muscle health. Other evidence suggests that milk and dairy products and other TASFs have a potential role in mitigating sarcopenia (muscle loss), fractures, frailty, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Cow's milk and poultry eggs are among the eight foods that pose allergenic risks to consumers, and it is therefore mandatory in many countries to state their presence in foods as part of precautionary allergen labelling. However, there is no evidence that avoiding such foods during infancy can delay or prevent reactions. Lactose malabsorp - tion is widespread but does not automatically lead to lactose intolerance, which also varies greatly in severity.xxiiiPolicy recommendations on terrestrial animal source food consumption Food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) are the most comprehensive reference for TASF consumption. FBDGs from 95 countries provide recommendations on TASF consump - tion, primarily linked to micronutrient intake for health benefits (e.g. iron intake), fol- lowed by the mitigation of potential health risks (i.e. diet-related non-communicable diseases [NCDs]). Most FBDGs target the general public, although many make recommendations for spe - cific groups in the life-course cycle. Most policy recommendations address TASF con- sumption generally. Next most frequent are recommendations on meat (in general), milk and dairy products, eggs and red meat. In the red meat category, most recommen- dations refer to beef; other types of meat, such as pork, goat meat and sheep meat, are less well covered. There is also less coverage of poultry, white meat (in general), offal, meat from wild animals, and insects. Micronutrient-related recommendations tend to be more detailed than NCD-related recommendations, providing quantitative indica- tions in terms of daily or weekly intakes of TASFs. There are no specific recommenda - tions on TASF consumption to address the risks associated with multiple forms of malnutrition (e.g. coexistence of micronutrient deficiency with overweight, obesity and NCDs). Environmental sustainability considerations were found only to be included in the FBDGs of eight upper middle- and high-income countries, with only the Netherlands providing quantitative recommendations. Animal welfare was found only to be mentioned in the FBDGs of Denmark and Sweden, where it was mentioned in the context of food labelling. Food safety and food-borne disease issues related to TASF One-third of the global food-borne disease burden is associated with the consumption of contaminated TASF, mainly linked to bacterial causes and diarrhoea. While evidence on food-borne disease hazards and health outcomes, and on risk analysis methods, is well documented, knowledge of the national burdens (incidence and severity) of these diseases is lacking. For example, effective targeting of national policies requires know- ledge of the main transmission routes along the value chain, but these are not well understood. Changing agricultural practices (especially those related to the intensification of live - stock production and input use) lengthening and broadening of value chains, and greater consumption of processed food contribute to increasing exposure to food- borne disease hazards. Antimicrobial resistance presents additional challenges beyond those associated with food safety and nutrition. Food-safety burdens need to be alle - viated by enhancing sanitation and mitigating health risks at the interfaces between animals, humans and the environment, through a One Health approach. Strengthening national food-control systems is key to ensuring food safety for better health and nutri- tional outcomes.xxivEmerging topics This section addresses some recently emerged topics pertaining to TASF, nutrition and health. Fortified, blended foods containing TASF, most commonly milk powder, have been studied globally, and there are indications that they can have positive effects on child growth and development outcomes. However, the independent effects of the TASF ingredients cannot be directly linked to outcomes. Early findings for TASF alter - natives, including cell-derived and plant-based alternative \"meats\" , suggest that some products can mimic the taste and texture of TASF, but evidence for their effects on hu- man nutrition and health outcomes is lacking. Insects and insect powders show prom- ise as nutritious, sustainable food sources. Issues of preference and culture remain to be resolved in product development and marketing. Major developments in microbiology offer insights into the relationship between TASF and human health. These developments include, first, methodological advances provide related to the pathways and metabolites involved in TASF's roles in nutrition and health. A second development is the rapidly expanding science of the microbiome, which essentially shows that the microbiome plays a mediating role in the relationship between TASF and human health. Species diversity, the abundance of short-chain fatty acids and the presence of pathogens are among the factors driving this association. Animal models and trials in humans demon- strate that red and processed meats and animal fats can damage human health via microbial meta bolites, such as trimethylamine-N-oxide and hydrogen sulfide, while fermented dairy products have positive impacts. Connections to other component documents Component Document 1 summarizes the evidence for the downstream effects of TASF on human nutrition and health outcomes. Building on this analysis, Component Document 2 will examine factors influencing demand for TASFs and their supply and consumption, historically and into the future. It will illuminate factors affecting access to, and affordability of, TASFs and the quantity, quality, safety and diversity of TASFs within dietary patterns. Moving further upstream, Component Document 3 will assess the contribution of the livestock sector to food security and sustainable agrifood sys - tems. Component Document 4 will present options for sustainably changing the live - stock sector in ways that contribute to the development of more sustainable agrifood systems, healthier diets and better nutrition. Ultimately, all four documents will be combined into a high-level synthesis document on the contribution of livestock to food security, sustainable agrifood systems, nutrition and healthy diets. 1 IntroductionSection A2 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesKey findings u Trends in nutrition indicators show that the world is currently not on track to attain several of the 2025 World Health Assembly1 and 2030 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) nutrition targets. u Terrestrial animal source food (TASF) within appropriate dietary patterns can make important contributions to reducing stunting and wasting in children under five years of age, low birthweight, anaemia in women of reproduc - tive age (15-49 years), overweight in children under five years of age, and obesity and diet-related non-communi- cable diseases (NCDs) in adults. u Evidence from the evolutionary past of Homo sapiens shows that higher levels of TASF intake were associated with increased stature, brain size and longevity, probably establishing metabolic needs in the human body that have remained into the present. u Globally, 21 percent of total caloric supply is comprised of TASF. The figure is higher in Europe (37 percent) and the Americas (30 percent), but in Africa it is only 11 percent. The highest level of TASF relative to total caloric supply is in Northern America (43 percent), followed by Australia and New Zealand, and Northern Europe (both 41 percent). The lowest levels are in Eastern Africa and Middle Africa (6 percent) and Western Africa (4 percent). u Globally, 47 percent of children between 6 and 23 months of age consume dairy and 22 percent consume eggs. However, this masks a significant disparity between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles. u Certain agrifood systems may be particularly salient with respect to the substantial role of TASF in human nutrition. Conversely, in populations practising vegetarianism for religious, cultural or other reasons, TASF may play a very minor role. Summary This section summarizes recent data on the world nutrition situation, focusing on progress towards the global nu- trition targets set by the World Health Assembly and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It also provides an overview of trends in nutrition indicators by region, showing the geographical variation in different forms of malnutrition. It provides an overview of TASF dietary patterns using data from the FAO Food Balance Sheets. It also presents trends in the global and regional supply of TASFs, which show great disparities across regions and subregions. It provides an overview of the contribution of TASFs to caloric supply and of energy and protein supply from plant- and animal-source foods (including those from both terrestrial and aquatic sources), differentiated by region. It also provides a snapshot of the percentage of children between 6 and 23 months consuming TASFs, such as dairy, eggs and flesh foods (including those from both terrestrial and aquatic sources), which shows high discrepancy by wealth quintile. The section further includes a brief evidence-based overview of the role that TASF played in hominin evolution over the last 2 million years and introduces the importance livestock and TASF to food security and nutrition. It emphasizes the extent to which certain agrifood systems may be particularly salient in the consid- eration of the substantial role of TASF in human nutrition. For example, pastoralist populations whose livelihoods have traditionally depended on livestock have historically consumed more TASF and some of the food systems of some Indigenous Peoples incorporate TASF through hunting, gathering or livestock production. The section further presents the results of a study that examined the inclusion of wild foods in the diets of eight groups of Indigenous People across the world. At the other end of the consumption spectrum, there are populations that practise vege - tarianism for cultural or religious reasons. 1 Global nutrition targets 2025 (https://apps.who.int/nutrition/global-target-2025/en/).3 Section A | Introduction1. The world nutrition situation Healthy diets are those that include an appropriate balance of the foods necessary to achieve the optimal growth and development of all individuals and to meet their physio - logical needs and support their physical, mental and social wellbeing at all life stages (CFS, 2021). Healthy diets are safe, diverse, balanced and based on nutritious foods. They help to protect against malnutrition in all its forms, including undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity, and lower the risk of diet-related non-communica- ble diseases (see Box A1). More practically, FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO (2022) defines healthy diets as follows: They 1. start early in life with early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding until six months of age, and con- tinued breastfeeding until two years of age and beyond combined with appropriate complementary feeding; 2. are based on a great variety of unprocessed or minimally processed foods, balanced across food groups, while re - stricting highly processed food and drink products; 3. include wholegrains, legumes, nuts and an abundance and variety of fruits and vegetables; 4. can include moderate amounts of eggs, dairy, poultry and fish, and small amounts of red meat; 5. include safe and clean drinking water as the fluid of choice; 6. are adequate (i.e. reaching but not exceeding needs) in en- ergy and nutrients for growth and development and meet the needs for an active and healthy life across the life cycle; 7. are consistent with WHO guidelines for reducing the risk of diet-related NCDs and ensuring health and well-being for the general population; and 8. contain minimal levels of, or if possible no, pathogens, toxins or other agents that can cause food-borne disease. According to WHO the characteristics of a healthy diet in- clude the following: less than 30 percent of total energy intake comes from fats, with a shift in fat consumption away from saturated fats towards unsaturated fats and the elimination of industrial transfats; less than 10 per - cent of total energy intake comes from free sugars (prefer - ably less than 5 percent); at least 400 g of fruits and veg- etables are consumed per day; and not more than 5 g of salt (which should be iodized) is consumed per day. The Committee on Food Security Voluntary Guidelines on Food Systems and Nutrition (CFS, 2021) recognizes that healthy diets may vary according to individuals' characteristics (e.g. age, sex, health status, economic secu- rity, lifestyle and level of physical activity) and with geogra- phy, culture and customs, food preferences and the avail- ability of foods. There can be tremendous diversity and variation in dietary preferences within the range of what may be a healthy diet. The review provided here also recognizes that there is variability in TASF consumption patterns globally and that this is a consequence of both choice and circumstance. It considers TASF within the context of diverse and varied diets and recognizes that TASF intake levels affect health by acting synergistically in the diet matrix and in response to external factors. The world is not on track to meet the World Health Assembly or the SDG nutrition targets by 2030 (see Figure A1). Large gaps remain for several milestones, including those for exclusive breastfeeding from zero to six months and anaemia in women of reproductive age (15-49 years). Anaemia affects nearly one in three women worldwide. Efforts to meet the 3 percent target for the prevalence of child wasting by 2030 and to ensure that there is no increase in overweight among children under five years of age are also not on track. Overweight affects 14.6 percent of children and adolescents globally, and obesity affects 4.3 percent (WHO, 2021a). Prevalence of low birthweight was 14.6 percent globally in 2015, only a small reduction from 2012, and the 10.5 percent target is unlikely to be met. These statistics mask vast differences across countries in prevalence of these public-health problems. Stunting is the only indicator showing substantial improve - ments in the last two decades (see Figure A2), although the 2021 State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World predicts that the COVID 19 pandemic may reverse this trend for the first time. Anaemia among women of repro - ductive age persists at very high levels across multiple regions. Again, limited progress has been made towards the target of a 50 percent reduction. Adult obesity has also risen sharply across many regions. Globally, 39 percent of adults 18 years or older (1.9 billion) were overweight in 2016 and 13 percent (650 million) were obese (WHO, 2021e). Annually, 41 million people die from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) - approximately 71 percent of all deaths globally. The majority of these deaths occur in low- and middle income countries (WHO, 2021c). Four conditions 4 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesare responsible for over 80 percent of premature NCD deaths annually: cardiovascular diseases (17.9 million); cancers (9.3 million); respiratory diseases (4.1 million); and diabetes (1.5 million). Unhealthy diets are among the lead- ing risk factors for NCD morbidity and mortality (Afshin et al., 2019).The State of the World Food Security and Nutrition (2022) reports that the prevalence of undernourishment increased from 8.4 percent to 9.9 percent globally between 2019 and 2020. This translates into an estimated 118 million more people experiencing hunger and a total of around 811 million people worldwide (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO, 2022). 010203040506070 2019 203020302012 2016 Low 15 49 years)Exclusive breastfeeding (infants <6 months)Overweight (under 13.1Dashed lines indicate the required prevalence of the latest year with global estimates for the indicator to be on track to achieve its target.

Different forms of malnutrition Malnutrition is an abnormal physiological condition caused by inadequate, unbalanced or excessive intake of macronutrients and/or micronutrients. Malnutrition is also characterized by physiological inefficiencies in the utilization of nutrients. It may manifest in a variety of ways depending on nutritional status, and different forms of malnutrition can co-occur. Stunting or chronic malnutrition Low height-for-age, reflecting a past episode or epi- sodes of sustained undernutrition. In children under five years of age, stunting is defined as height-for-age more than 2 standard deviations below the WHO Child Growth Standards median (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO, 2022). This form of malnutrition may be associated with both physical and cognitive delays in growth and devel- opment as well as an elevated risk of death. It occurs particularly in the first 1 000 days, i.e. between concep - tion and the age of two years, as a result of inadequate maternal and/or child nutrition. It can be caused by lack of access to adequate and high-quality foods and/or by disease. Wasting or acute malnutrition Low weight-for-height, generally the result of weight loss associated with a recent period of inadequate die- tary energy intake and/or disease. In children under five years of age, wasting is defined as weight-for-height more than 2 standard deviations below the WHO Child Growth Standards median (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO, 2022). This form of undernutrition indicates recent and severe weight loss, which is often associated with infectious disease and acute starvation. Children under five years of age are most vulnerable to wasting, in particular when transitioning from exclusive breast- feeding to complementary feeding. The occurrence of wasting often varies seasonally or increases as result of emergencies such as droughts or floods. Stunting and wasting often coexist. Underweight Underweight is defined as weight-for-age z score more than 2 standard deviations below the WHO Child Growth Standards median. A child who is underweight may be stunted, wasted or both. Mortality risk increases in chil- dren that are even moderately underweight. Micronutrient deficiencies or hidden hunger Micronutrient deficiencies are shortages of essential vitamins and minerals that the human body requires in small amounts. Most micronutrients come from die- tary sources, as the body does not produce them or only does so in inadequate quantities. Some micronutrients cannot be stored in the body for long periods, for exam- ple water-soluble vitamins. Regular consumption of food rich in those micronutrients is therefore necessary to avoid deficiency. Micronutrient deficiency can cause severe and even life-threatening conditions such as anae- mia, xerophthalmia, osteoporosis and impaired immune function. Anaemia Anaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or the haemoglobin concentration within them is lower than normal, decreasing the capacity of the blood to carry oxygen to the body's tissues. This results in symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, dizzi- ness and shortness of breath. The optimal haemoglo - bin concentration needed to meet physiological needs varies with age, sex, elevation of residence, smoking habits and pregnancy status. The most common causes of anaemia include the following: nutritional deficien- cies, particularly iron deficiency, though deficiencies in folate and vitamins B12 and A are also important caus- es; haemoglobinopathies; and infectious diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV and parasitic infections. Anaemia is a serious global public health problem that particularly affects young children and pregnant wom- en. WHO estimates that 42 percent of children under five years of age and 40 percent of pregnant women worldwide are anaemic (WHO, 2021d). Overweight and obesity Body weight that is above normal for height as a result of an excessive accumulation of fat. It is usually a mani- festation of expending less energy than is consumed. In adults, overweight is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or more, and obesity as a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more. In children under five years of age, overweight is defined as weight-for-height more than 2 standard devi- ations above the WHO Child Growth Standards median, and obesity as weight-for-height more than 3 standard deviations above the WHO Child Growth Standards medi- an (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO, 2022). Diet-related non-communicable diseases Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), also known as chronic diseases, tend to be of long duration and are the result of a combination of genetic, physiological, envi- ronmental and behavioural factors. Unhealthy diets and a lack of physical activity may show up in people as raised blood pressure, increased blood glucose, elevated blood lipids and obesity. These are called metabolic risk factors and can lead to cardiovascular disease, the leading NCD in terms of premature deaths (WHO, 2021c). The NCDs that are most commonly studied in association with con- sumption of red and processed meat include colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes and ischaemic heart disease.6 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes a. Wasting is an acute condition that can change frequently and rapidly over the course of a calendar year. This makes it difficult to generate reliable trends over time with the input data available and, as such, this report provides only the most recent global and regional estimates. b. For wasting and exclusive breastfeeding, estimates are not shown for regions/years where population coverage was below 50 percent. c. The collection of household survey data on child height and weight were limited in 2020 due to the physical distancing measures required to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Only four national surveys included in the database were carried out (at least partially) in 2020. The estimates on child stunting, wasting and overweight are therefore based almost entirely on data collected before 2020 and do not take into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. d.

Terrestrial animal source food, dietary patterns and agrifood systems: historic legacy and current challenges This assessment considers TASF within the context of dietary patterns and broader agrifood systems. As discussed below in Sections B and C, nutrition and related health outcomes depend on the interaction of TASFs with other foods, environmental exposures and metabolic processes. This subsection discusses how dietary patterns have evolved over the course of human evolution, and then presents an overview of the diversity of current dietary patterns incorporating TASF, and of agrifood systems, locally and regionally. Other component documents of the assessment will address these issues in greater detail. 2.1 Hominin evolution and terrestrial animal source food Evidence suggests that TASF played an important role in hominin evolution over the last 2 million years. Information from isotope studies, archaeological assem- blages, dental wear analyses and ethnographies of contemporary gatherer-hunter-fisher groups suggests that TASF was present in hominin diets in relatively high proportions and that they were among the factors driv- ing important physiological changes (Kuipers, Joordens and Muskiet, 2012; 2003; Stanford and Bunn, 2001). Dietary patterns today diverged from those of our ancestors only in recent history, precipitated by changes in climatic conditions, agriculture and technological advances. The discordance theory posited by Konner and Eaton suggests that this sudden change in diets resulted in chronic disease (Eaton and Konner, 1985), while others, building on the discordance theory, suggest a broader array of poor health outcomes (Eaton and Iannotti, 2017). Dietary diversity and a higher proportion of energy from TASF were among the key characteristics distinguishing the ancient gatherer-hunter-fisher diet from the diet of modern Homo sapiens (Kuipers, Joordens and Muskiet, 2012). Some studies have used contemporary gatherer- hunter-fisher groups to examine diets in human evolu- tion. One recent analysis concluded that approximately one-third of dietary energy intakes in these groups comes from meat consumption (Pontzer and Wood, 2021). An older analysis reviewed ethnographies from 229 gatherer-hunter-fisher groups and showed that TASF comprised between 45 percent and 65 percent of total energy intakes (Cordain et al., 2000). These estimates may have limitations, however, including a potential gender bias (data from more men than women are used), the fact that modern hunter-gather populations do not rely exclusively on foraging, and the large diversity of dietary patterns across groups (Milton, 2003). Estimates for macronutri- ent intakes as a proportion of total calories range widely across ecological zones: 10 percent to 35 percent for protein; 20 to 50 percent for carbohydrates; and 20 to70 percent for fat (Kuipers et al., 2010). Many scholars agree that TASFs were part of diets that were very diverse over - all and that provided migrating groups with flexibility and the capacity to adapt to different environments (Turner and Thompson, 2013; Marlowe, 2005). Several different types of TASF have been documented in hominin diets, depending on the environment and the period in hominin evolution. Archaeological assemblages from early hominin species suggest that they ate TASFs from lacustrine ecosystems and drew on a diverse range of terrestrial animals and aquatic animals, including croc - odiles, turtles and fish (Braun et al., 2010). Although some evidence points to scavenging for meat among early Pleistocene species, predation and hunting were proba- bly more common means of sourcing meat (Dom\u00ednguez- Rodrigo et al., 2021). The use of tools appears to be connected to very early carnivorous behaviours, including the consumption of animal tissue and intake of nutrients from bone marrow (Pante et al., 2018; Thompson et al., 2019). One study applied paleobiological and paleoeco - logy approaches to analyse over time (Ben-Dor, Sirtoli and Barkai, 2021). It showed that during the Pleistocene era the trophic level of the human lineage evolved from a low base in Homo habilis to a high (carnivorous) state in Homo erectus and that there was a reversal of this trend over the period from the Upper Palaeolithic to the Neolithic and the emer - gence of agriculture.8 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesThere is consensus about the junctures in hominin evolu- tion when significant anatomical and physiological changes occurred, and there is some evidence regard- ing the role of TASF in driving these shifts (Aiello and Wheeler, 1995; Milton, 2003). The first juncture occurred around 2 million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus. Evidence suggests marked increases in stature, body mass and brain size, and some have linked these changes to increased levels of TASF in the diet (Kuipers et al., 2010). Others have attributed larger brain sizes compared to other primates in part to early habitats near aquatic ecosystems and improved diets that included TASF (Broadhurst et Burini and Crawford, 2014; Mann, 2018). Other physi- ological changes that arose during human evolution and marked a divergence from other primates suggest dietary requirements for TASF (Mann, 2018). These include the following: inability to absorb vitamin B12 produced by gut bacteria (Dom\u00ednguez-Rodrigo et al., 2012); preferen- absorption Rodrigo et al., 2012; Wiedeman et al., 2018); reduction in taurine production from precursors (Chesney et al., 1998; Ripps Shen, 2012); reduced - alpha-linolenic acid into eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)/docosahexaenoic (DHA) (Emken et al., 1993). Multiple lines of evidence show that the greatest dietary shifts away from TASF and towards plant based (PBF) food followed the widespread adoption of agriculture (crop and livestock production) during the Neolithic era, and during industrialization. Skeletal evidence suggests that for many populations, agriculture was associated with poorer diets, shorter stature, shorter lifespan, greater infectious-disease burden (as a consequence of higher population density) and more dental caries, among other health deficits (Armelagos et al., 2014). In summary, evidence shows that TASF has been inte - gral to shifting dietary patterns and anatomical features during hominin evolution. High proportions of the energy obtained from the ancestral gatherer-hunter-fisher diet were probably derived from TASF of a wide variety of types, and embedded within diverse diets determined by ecosystem habitat. Critical aspects of anatomical and physiological evolution, such as stature, brain size, and longevity, were associated with patterns of TASF consumption. The evolutionary history linking TASF and health suggests the importance of TASF in diets today.2.2 Terrestrial animal source food and dietary patterns around the world today FAO and WHO define sustainable, healthy diets as follows: dietary patterns that promote all dimensions of indi- viduals' health and wellbeing; have low environmental pressure and impact; are accessible, affordable, safe and equitable; and are culturally acceptable. The aims of Sustainable Healthy Diets are to achieve optimal growth and development of all individuals and support function- ing and physical, mental, and social wellbeing at all life stages for present and future generations; contribute to preventing all forms of malnutrition (i.e. undernutrition, micronutrient deficiency, overweight and obesity); reduce the risk of diet-related NCDs; and support the preservation of biodiversity and planetary health. Sustainable healthy diets must combine all the dimensions of sustainability to avoid unintended consequences. (FAO and WHO, 2019) The twentieth century was an era of rapid industrialization that saw significant advances in sanitation and hygiene, vaccin ation, use of antibiotics and other public health inter - ventions in some parts of the world. It has been suggested that these factors, along with increased consumption of TASF in some populations, were associated with increased stature and other improvements in health during this period (Roser and Appel, 2013). At the start of the twenty-first century, a \"nutrition transition\" occurred in tandem with rapid urban- ization and greater access to processed food (Popkin, 2006). Dietary patterns associated with this nutrition tran- sition generally include increased fat intakes, increased consumption of refined sugar and processed food, and reduced fibre intakes. Figure A3 shows that during the six decades between 1961 and 2016 the per capita supply of most types of TASF increased, probably because of growing stability and wealth. Bovine meat is an exception, with per capita supply levels increasing steadily until around 1990 and then begin- ning to decrease. Pig meat supply showed the greatest increase over this period, rising at a relatively steady rate, while egg and milk supply increased more notably after 1990. However, these trends were not uniform across all the regions and subregions of the world. There are clear dispar - ities in TASF supply (see Figure A4). Europe, North America and Oceania had the highest supply levels, marked particu- larly by high milk consumption relative to other TASFs and regions. The combined Americas region showed the larg- est increases in the supply of poultry meat after1990, while 9 Section A | Introductionintakes of other TASFs remained relatively stable. In Asia, there were large differences by subregion, with Eastern Asia showing steep increases in pig meat, Central Asia consum- ing higher levels of milk than the other subregions, and Southeastern and Southern Asia having fairly low levels of consumption for all TASFs except pig meat and milk, respectively. In Africa, levels of all TASFs remained low and stable, except in Southern Africa, where supplies of poultry meat increased and there were slightly higher supplies of milk and bovine meat. Within regions, there are also stark differences in country-level TASF supply patterns. While the energy density from global cereal supply remained constant between 1961 and 2013, the nutritional content decreased because production of highly nutritious cereals (e.g. millet and sorghum) declined relative to that of less nutritious, high-yielding cereals, such as rice and maize (DeFries et al., 2015). For example, the iron content in the global cereal supply decreased by 19 percent. 020406080100120140 1961 1966 1971 1976 1981 1986 1991 1996 2001 2006 2011 2016Food supply (kcal/cap/day) Year Milk excluding butter Pigmeat Poultry meatBovine meat EggsMutton and goat meat Meat, other Figure A3.

Globally, 21 percent of total caloric supply is provided by TASF. Regions showing higher proportions include Europe (36 percent) and the Americas (30 percent), while the figure for Africa is only 11 percent. The highest proportion of caloric supply contributed by TASF is in Northern America (48 percent), followed by Australia and New Zealand (43 percent), and Northern Europe (41 percent). The level in Eastern Africa and Middle Africa is 6 percent and that in Western Africa is 4 percent ( Tables A1 and A2). Populations in which the proportion of calories supplied by TASF is high often have unhealthy dietary patterns, sedentary life - styles, high levels of overweight and obesity and high NCD burdens, although in some countries, such as Australia, red meat consumption is associated with healthy patterns such as vegetable consumption (Sui, Raubenheimer and Rangan, 2017). There are also country-level disparities in the supply of TASF and particular categories of TASF (Figure A6). Australia, Finland and the United States of America consume greater quantities of TASF per capita than other countries. Note that estimates used for Figures A3 to A6 were derived only from food balance sheets and do not account for food loss and waste and thus may overestimate supply patterns to a certain degree. Because of data limitations, the estimates presented do not include individual dietary consumption. Figure A5.

The nutrition and health potential of geographical indication foods. Rome, FAO. 92 pp. https://doi.org/10.4060/cb3913en FAO defines food security as the condition in which \"all people, at all times, have the physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life\" (FAO, 1996). The original four dimensions of food secu- rity include - availability, access, utilization, and stability. Two additional dimensions are now recognized as funda- mental aspects of food security: agency, which includes empowerment, the capacity to act independently; and sustainability, which includes respect for and protection of ecosystems over the long term in their interaction with economic and social systems (HLPE, 2020). This document focuses primarily on utilization and the vital importance of TASF in providing bioavailable nutrients as part of healthy diets in certain life-course phases. Moderate and severe forms of household food insecu- rity correlate with poor-quality diets in many contexts. One study across four countries (Kenya, Mexico, Samoa and Sudan) examined dietary patterns in relation to food insecurity as measured by the global Food Insecurity Experience Scale (Alvarez-Sanchez, 2021). Analyses of household food consumption and expenditure surveys revealed that in these four countries households experi- encing moderate or severe food insecurity consume less meat and dairy products. Consuming less fruits and vege - tables was also associated with food insecurity in Kenya and Sudan. The authors concluded that the more food insecure households are, the larger the share of staples in the diet and the smaller the presence of nutritious food groups, such as fruits and vegetables, pulses and TASFs. A significant disparity in consumption of TASF between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles among children between 6 to 23 months is shown in Figure A7. TASF and dietary patterns should be viewed within the larger context of agrifood systems. The web of factors influ- encing livestock production and agrifood systems more broadly will be discussed in later component documents. 2.3 Agrifood systems, locally and regionally Dimensions of food security can be represented within an agrifood system framework that encompass food supply chains (availability) and food environments (access), with individual factors and consumer behaviour ultimately leading to diets that translate into nutrition and health outcomes (FAO, 2018; Food Systems Dashboard, 2021). Food supply chains encompass TASF production, stor - age, distribution, processing, packing, retail and market - ing. Food safety and food-borne diseases are covered in Section D, which addresses the various aspects of the food supply chain. Food environments that A | IntroductionFigure A7.

External drivers can play a powerful role in the dynamics of an agrifood system. Some of these factors, may contrib - ute to the role of TASF and livestock production in agrifood systems. Examples include the following: environment and climate change; globalization and trade; income growth and distribution; urbanization; population growth and migration; politics and leadership; sociocultural context; and infrastructure, including electricity and access to refrigeration. Environmental conditions related to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) are especially important drivers of nutritional status via their influence on enteric disease. Similarly, environmental and climatic conditions may influence how TASFs are produced, stored, distrib - uted, processed, marketed and consumed. While these factors will be covered in the later component documents of the assessment, the influence of the multidimensional- ity of agrifood systems on how TASFs are integrated into diets and associated with nutrition and health outcomes needs to be noted here. Policymakers globally are increasingly recognizing the need to transform agrifood systems to promote livelihoods and human and planetary health. In September 2021, key stakeholders from around the world convened for the UN Food Systems Summit with the aim or arriving at a consensus on the changes needed in agrifood systems if the Sustainable Development Goals are to be met by 2030 (see Box A2).Certain types of agrifood system may be particularly sali- ent with respect to the roles of TASF in human nutrition. For example, Indigenous Peoples' food systems have been recognized for their knowledge base and practices related to resilience and sustainability (FAO, Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT , 2021). A study of eight different Indigenous Peoples' groups globally showed that animal source foods were present and were used - in balance with PBFs - for nutrition and livelihoods across all food systems (FAO, Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT , 2021). Among the Indigenous Peoples featured were the Inari S\u00e1mi people of Nellim, Finland, who practise reindeer herding, the nomadic herders and pastoralists of Arat\u00e8ne, Mali, and the Bhotia and Anwal peoples of Uttarakhand, India, who practise agropastoralism in combination with gathering. Fishing contributed the food systems of two other groups, the Melanesians of Solomon Islands and the Tikuna, Cocam and Yagua peoples of Puerto Nari\u00f1o, Colombia. The study found that the diets of Indigenous Peoples include a wide variety of hunted wild species, and wild products more broadly, that potentially provide nutri- tional advantages (see Table A3). Indigenous Peoples' food systems point to the notion of territorial diets. The French word \"terroir\" refers to the origins of food or other products arising from a geographic area but also encompassing sociocultural elements. Geographical indications may be assigned to food aris - ing from interactions between local populations and local environments (FAO, 2021). Some have described the Mediterranean, traditional and new Nordic and Japanese diets as territorial diets emerging from local agrifood systems (FAO and WHO, 2019). The TASFs within these diets 16 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesBox A2. Livestock-related policy at the 2021 United Nations Food System Summit In 2021, the United Nations Food System Summit was convened as part of the Decade of Action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. The summit process included multistakeholder dialogues based on structured discussions between governments and other stakeholders, and supported the development and shap - ing by countries of national pathways towards sustaina - ble food systems. An analysis of national pathways that emerged from the summit was conducted to identify national priori- ties and plans for action relevant to the livestock sector (FAO, 2022b). Livestock policy issues were covered in 90 out of the 106 national pathways reviewed (those avail- able via the Food Systems Summit Dialogues Gateway as of 18 October 2021). A widespread concern was the need to increase livestock productivity to address environmental issues and/or enhance food and nutri- tion security and healthy diets. Enhancing the con- sumption of terrestrial animal source food and its role in nutrition, food security and diverse and healthy diets featured in 42 percent of African and 37 percent of Asian national pathways. There were some thematic differ - ences by region. In Europe, 44 percent of the national pathways addressed the further development of the One Health approach, 28 percent addressed animal welfare and 22 percent addressed reducing consumption of meat, milk and dairy products, and eggs. Animal wel- fare and reducing consumption were not mentioned in national pathways from other regions.

TASFs play a particularly prominent role in certain popu- lations. For example, pastoralists, whose livelihoods have traditionally depended on livestock, have histor - ically consumed high levels of TASF. However, with increased marginalization, diminishing land tenure and climate change there have been declines in TASF intake among pastoralists and consequent health repercussions (Iannotti et al., 2014). Populations also vary in terms of the diversity of the TASFs they consume. At the other end of the consumption spectrum, there are populations that practise vegetarianism for cultural or religious reasons. In India, Hinduism encourages lacto-vegetarianism to uphold the principle of non-violence towards animals but also to protect the mind and the spirit. Climate change has negatively affected many communities around the world. For example, rising temperatures and drought have impacted many pastoralist communities, resulting in severe food insecurity for populations already at risk of low consumption of healthy diets (Herrero et al., 2016; Inman, Hobbs and Tsvuura, 2020). extreme 17 Section A | IntroductionTable A3.

The production of TASFs in some agrifood systems has attracted the public's attention in the context of dialogues on climate change and environmental sustainability. While this topic will be covered in Component Document 3, important sustainability issues related to the consump - tion of TASFs within healthy diets are introduced here. Overconsumption of TASFs and rising demand for TASFs in some populations are likely to be contributing to the envi- ronmental impacts and climate change effects associated with livestock production. Agriculture, forestry and other land use broadly contribute approximately 21 percent of greenhouse-gas emissions, and livestock production contributes an estimated 14.5 percent (Clark et al., 2019; Gerber and FAO, 2013). Greenhouse-gas emissions in livestock systems arise primarily from feed production, enteric fermentation in ruminants and manure storage. Unsustainable freshwater use and biodiversity losses have also been documented in livestock production systems. Comprehensive life-cycle assessments that fully encompass all stages of production are needed in order to adequately compare the contributions of different food groups to climate change and environmental degradation. In summary, the global nutrition situation points to the important role played by TASF across different dietary patterns and its importance for meeting global milestones. Evidence from the evolutionary history of our species indi- cates that there a wide variety of TASFs were consumed in our ancient past, and that their introduction into hominin diets approximately 2 million years ago was associated with significant anatomical and physiological changes. TASF should be viewed within a larger multidimensional agrifood systems framework that comprises the following elements: TASF's contribution to healthy diets for nutrition and health outcomes (covered in this document 1); factors determining demand for, and supply and consumption of, TASF (covered in Component Document 2); the role of livestock and its impacts on the environment and climate change (covered in Component Document 3); and benefits, opportunities and trade-offs associated with livestock and TASF (covered in Component Document 4).18 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesBox A3. Animal source food in dietary patterns - some examples of traditional diets Arctic Canadian: The Arctic Canadian tundra is char - acterized by low temperatures and a short growing sea - son that does not allow crop production. Thus, hunting and fishing activities play a central role in the culture of Arctic communities. Their traditional diet includes a variety of hunted meat and fish and is particularly high in protein and micronutrients (e.g. vitamins, iron and zinc). Animal source foods - comprising meat from livestock, meat from wild animals, fish and dairy - rep - resent around 40 percent of the total calories consumed (Kuhnlein and Receveur, 2007). Maasai: The Maasai live in southern Kenya and northern parts of the United Republic of Tanzania, along the Great Rift Valley on semi-arid and arid lands where there is limited potential for crop production. Their agropastoral communities depend mostly on cattle, sheep, goats and dromedaries. TASF (meat, poultry, eggs, milk and milk products) provides 26 percent of the total dietary energy intake of a Maasai community in Kenya (Transmara dis- trict), with 19 percent of total calories coming from milk and milk products (Hansen et al., 2011). Mongolian: Nearly 36 percent of total calories consumed in the Mongolian diet come from TASFs, with 20 percent provided by meat and meat products and 11 percent by milk and milk products. However, cereals are still the main source of energy, providing on average 55 percent of the daily intake (FAO/UNICEF/UNDP, 2007). The coun- try's extreme weather conditions and the high propor - tion of grassland (80 percent of total land area) relative to available arable land (< 1 percent) explain the major role played by livestock products in the Mongolian diet. Total energy obtained from different food groups in some traditional diets 1 Adapted from Kuhnlein and Receveur, 2007. *Grain, fruits and vegetables provide around 30 percent of total energy. 2 Adapted from FAO/UNICEF/UNDP , 2007. *Vegetables provide around 3 percent of total energy. 3 Adapted from Hansen et al., 2011. *Cereals and grain products represent 45 percent of total energy.

The long-chain fatty acids and the ratios of essential fatty acids found in TASF are important for cognition across the human life course. u Iron and zinc in red meat are bound in compounds that are more bioavailable and may be more easily digested than those in which these nutrients are bound in plant-based foods. Milk is recognized for its high concentration and bioavailability of calcium, among other nutrients. Eggs have high concentrations of choline and some long- chain fatty acids. TASFs are also generally a rich source of selenium, vitamin B12 and choline. Consumption of TASF has been shown to counteract the effects of antinutritional compounds found in plant based foods. u The nutritional quality of TASFs (especially the fat composition) can be influenced by (in order of priority) animal species and feeding system, breed and production environment. u Husbandry practices barely affect the protein composition and amino acid profile of TASFs. u Feed and feeding systems mostly affect the nutritional quality of TASFs, especially fat and fatty acid content and especially in monogastric livestock (such as poultry and pigs). High dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acid- dense plants, in both ruminants and monogastrics, results in higher quantities of beneficial fatty acids (ome - ga-3) in eggs, meat and milk. Feed and feeding systems affect, in particular, the technological and organoleptic quality and the commercial value of TASFs. u Genetic selection programmes predominantly focus on increasing production and productivity, improving eco - nomic performance and meeting the demands of the food-processing industry. A few initiatives aim to improve nutritional quality. u Causing stress to animals before slaughter affects the quality of TASF. u Drivers of livestock production include consumer demand and market opportunities.. Summary This section summarizes the available evidence on the nutrient and bioactive-compound composition of TASF. Several of the nutrients and bioactive compounds highlighted play important roles in human nutrition and health. TASF digestibility is modulated both by the food matrix and by the overall diet of the individual. TASF can provide large proportions of the recommended nutrient intake (RNI) of both macronutrients and micronutrients throughout the life course. Evidence indicates that all TASFs provide high-quality proteins (as indicated by Digest - ible Indispensable Amino Acid Scores). Some amino acids and bioactive compounds are predominantly found in TASF, for example, carnitine, creatine, taurine, hydroxyproline and anserine. The lipid and fat-soluble vitamin content of TASF is highly responsive to animal diets, and this has implications for decision-making in animal feeding. The ratio of high-density lipoprotein to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol affects human health. Excess low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which is caused primarily by high levels of transfat in the diet, can build up \"plaque\" in blood vessels and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. Some carbohydrates identified in TASF have been found to be potentially beneficial to human health, for example lactoglobulin in milk, oligo - saccharides in milk and honey, and fibre in insects. Evidence shows that TASFs are micronutrient dense and provide several limiting micronutrients in bioavailable matrices that are more easily absorbed and metabolized than those in other foods. TASFs are an especially im- portant source of vitamin B12, which is not found in bioavailable forms in plant based food. The evidence also indicates that TASFs are rich sources of the entire vitamin B complex. Choline, which has relatively recently been recognized for its role in health and development, is found in high concentrations in liver, eggs and other TASFs. Very high proportions of the RNI can be met by consuming these products. Animal meats and insects are impor - tant dietary sources of iron and zinc. Deficiencies in these two nutrients remain highly prevalent across multiple populations globally. Selenium is also found in high concentrations in TASF. Milk and dairy products and other TASFs provide high proportions of the RNI of calcium, which is vital for bone health and various other biological processes. TASF contain a range of bioactive compounds that have been associated with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative processes.25 Section B | Nutrient composition and value of terrestrial animal source food1. Introduction This section reviews the literature on the nutrient compo - sition and value of TASF. It also describes the evidence base concerning distinct nutrients found in various TASFs and their products, and the pathways through which they affect human health (see Figure B1). The first subsection describes the concepts, definitions and methods used. This is followed by a discussion of particular nutrients that may be more bioavailable and/or more highly concentrated in TASFs than in plant based foods (PBFs) and of their roles in selected aspects of human biology and public health. Evidence on the food chemistry and composition of TASFs and their products is also summarized, and factors at the production level that cause variation in the nutritional quality of TASFs are described. The section ends with a recap and a discussion of gaps and needs.

Pathway from animal production to human health26 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes2. Concepts, definitions and methods Essential nutrients are compounds or single elements that need to be included in the diet either because the human body does not produce them endogenously or does not do so in sufficient quantities to sustain optimal health. Deficiencies in essential nutrients may lead to serious health problems and even death. Approximately 150 nutrients or components are included in global food composition data- bases and studied in human health and nutrition. Generally, nutrients are classed as macronutrients (proteins, fats and carbohydrates), which provide energy, among other roles, or micronutrients (vitamins and minerals and trace elements), which are necessary for healthy development, disease prevention and well-being. Human nutrient requirements established by FAO and WHO are used to guide the preparation of recommendations on nutrient intakes for consumers and are periodically updated based on the latest evidence. This guidance indicates the amount of nutrients needed to maintain health in an other - wise healthy individual or group of people (WHO and FAO, 2004). Nutrient requirements are used by countries and international bodies, including the Codex Alimentarius Commission, to develop applications and tools for improv- ing nutrition, for example food labelling. Nutrient require - ments are also established at regional and national levels, for example the dietary reference values3 established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the United States of America's comprehensive set of dietary reference intakes, which includes recommended dietary allowances, adequate intakes and upper limits (USDA, 2021). Evidence shows that, in addition to macronutrients and micronutrients, there are more than 26 000 biochemical compounds present in foods and that these probably influ- ence human health (Barab\u00e1si, Menichetti and Loscalzo, 2020a, 2020b). These compounds can enhance or interfere with metabolic processes. There is also evidence for food synergies that give rise to the need to consider dietary patterns and the interactions between food compounds in the diet (Jacobs, Gross and Tapsell, 2009). This section considers the nutrient composition of TASFs but also the bioavailability of nutrients in foods and the diet. Nutrients and other bioactive compounds in foods may be absorbed, metabolized, transported, stored and excreted differently depending on nutrient density and bioavailabil- ity. Food and diet matrices in which nutrients and bioactive compounds interact are important determinants of the mechanical and biochemical processes of human nutri- tion (Capuano and Janssen, 2021). Nutrient density refers to the quantity of nutrients provided per calorie (e.g. per 100 kcal) or contained in a given food volume (e.g. per 100 g) or serving size (Drewnowski and Fulgoni, 2014). Nutrient bioavailability refers to the proportion of nutrient intake that is absorbed and metabolized. Bioavailability depends on the composition of the food and interactions with the overall diet as well as on the health status of the individ- ual consuming the foods. For example, the absorption of iron is enhanced when consumed with meat or vitamin C-rich foods (Gropper, Smith and Carr, 2021). There may also be compounds that interfere with absorption, for example phytates in the case of iron. These antinutritional compounds are highlighted in this section. Nutrient and food quality affect absorption, metabolism, stor - age and excretion processes. The Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS), defined as the percentage of digest - ible indispensable amino acids compared with a reference protein, is an example of a metric used to rate protein quality (FAO, 2013) (see Box B1). The Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) was recently developed to measure nutrient adequacy and diet-related NCD risk and was found to perform comparably with other metrics, including the Minimum Dietary Diversity- Women and Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 scores (Bromage et al., 2021). Some TASFs improve the score (e.g. eggs, chicken meat, game meat and low-fat dairy products), while some contribute positively only in moderate amounts (e.g. red meat) and others have a negative effect on the score (processed meat, and high-fat dairy products). Food quality refers to the attributes of a food that influence its nutritional value and make it acceptable or undesirable to the consumer (FAO and WHO, 2003). The factors affecting food quality are presented in Subsection 5. This document primarily covers raw TASFs, but processed products are covered to some extent. Processing methods are grouped into six categories (see Table B1), each of which serves to preserve food and protect it from contamina- tion (FAO, 2021b). Other forms of food preparation include mixing, grinding and cutting. Processing may serve not only to preserve food but also to change its palatability and nutri- tional quality. The concept of ultraprocessed food has been recognized and a classification scheme known as NOVA that ranks foods according to the extent and purpose of indus - trial processing has been developed (Monteiro et al., 2019). 3 https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/dietary-reference-values27 Section B | Nutrient composition and value of terrestrial animal source foodBox B1. Amino acid digestibility: Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS) Protein quality is closely associated with the capability of different food sources to supply the amino acids and nitrogen required to support multiple functions in the human body. High-quality proteins have high digest- ibility and contain all the indispensable (dietary essen- tial) amino acids at an adequate level and in an adequate pattern. Understanding the food security situation requires accuracy in the measurement of protein quality (Minocha et al., 2017). In 1990, FAO and WHO adopted the Protein Digestibility- corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS), which relates protein quality to indispensable amino acid profile and digestibility. In 2011, FAO proposed a revised system for expressing protein quality, the Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS) (FAO, 2013). While in PDCAAS amino acid digestibility is related to rat crude protein nitrogen faecal digestibility, DIAAS considers the ileal digestibility of each individual amino acid. PDCAAS over - values low-quality protein sources that are limited in indispensable amino acids and undervalues high-quali- ty protein sources (Rutherfurd et al., 2015). In addition, PDCAAS does not adequately account for the bioavail- ability of specific amino acids, for example lysine, which can be modified in the Maillard reaction during food processing.DIAAS and PDCAAS are calculated as the percentage of digestibility for the protein in question in relation to a reference protein with an \"ideal\" amino acid compo - sition. FAO advice for individual foods or food ingredi- ents is not to truncate the values above 100. Truncation penalizes proteins with high concentrations of indis- pensable amino acids, which are of particular interest from a nutrition security perspective. A score above 100 indicates potential to complement protein of lower qual- ity. Not truncating the score allows the protein quality of individual foods or food ingredients to be calculated. However, the calculation for a mixed diet should be done using truncation. DIAAS may be conceptually superior, but published amino acid digestibility datasets are unavailable for a wide range of human foods (FAO, 2014). It should there- fore be noted that PDCAAS remains the validated meth- od for determining protein quality. In recent years, new data have become available on the ileal digestibility of individual amino acids for foods and diets from various regions through the Proteos Phase III project under - taken by the Riddet Institute (Massey University), the University of Illinois, AgroParisTech, and University.

Nutrients in terrestrial animal source foods and their importance for human nutrition This subsection examines the nutrients and bioactive compounds found in TASF that have been associated with health and nutrition (see Box B3). It highlights key macro - nutrients, micronutrients and bioactive compounds that are highly concentrated in TASF and/or more bioavailable in TASF than in other food.When analysing the nutritional aspects of food there is also a need to consider components that can affect the bioavailability of specific nutrients. This is the case for antinutritional compounds. These are substances that naturally occur in PBFs and TASFs and interfere with the absorption of nutrients. Box B3. Food components: nutrients, bioactive compounds and antinutritional compounds A nutrient is a substance that is required by the body for optimal growth, development and maintenance of good health. Nutrients are classified according to quantitative requirement: Macronutrients: calorie-containing components of food needed in substantial quantities, typically above 10 g per day. These include carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Micronutrients: nutrients required by the body in small amounts, usually below 2 g per day. These include vita - mins and minerals. Nutrients can be also classified according to their essen- tiality. Their deficiency causes specific symptoms that can lead to health problems. Essential nutrients: nutrients that cannot be produced by the human body in sufficient quantities to meet phys- iological requirements and must therefore be supplied from foods or other sources (e.g. supplements).Conditionally essential nutrients: nutrients that are produced by the human body in sufficient amounts to meet the body's physiological requirements but for which intake via food or other sources (e.g. supple- ments) may be essential under certain conditions when biosynthesis is inadequate. Non-essential nutrients: nutrients required by the human body that can be synthesized by the human body under normal conditions and are thus not required in the food. Bioactive compounds are substances that are able to modulate metabolic functions leading to beneficial outcomes. TASFs contain various bioactive compounds that are being studied, including carnitine, anserine, creatine and anersine. Classification of vitamin E; vitamin K Minerals: calcium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, iodine, manganese, magnesium, molybdenum, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, sodium, zinc linolenic acid and linoleic acid30 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesAntinutritional compounds occur predominately in PBFs. Examples of antinutritional compounds that interfere with mineral uptakes from TASF include (phytic acid) and oxalates (oxalic acid). 3.1 Macronutrients TASFs are most often associated with protein content and quality. Proteins are found throughout the human body, with over 40 percent found in skeletal muscle, 25 percent in body organs and the remainder in skin and bones (Gropper, Smith and Carr, 2021). Living cells in the body depend on proteins for their architecture and for various functions. Proteins can be grouped into the following cate - gories, among others: and buffers. In general, intake of high qual- ity proteins optimizes human health outcomes, for exam- ple increasing muscle mass, throughout the life course (Tagawa et al., 2021). However, there are particular phases of the life course when higher intakes of protein are import - ant, for example in pregnant and lactating women and in older adults to prevent sarcopenia (Paddon-Jones and Rasmussen, 2009; Wolfe, Miller and Miller, 2008). Though not covered in this assessment, populations that are chronically or acutely ill may also require additional protein intakes (Phillips, Paddon-Jones and Layman, 2020). TASFs are an important source of high-quality proteins containing digestible and indispensable (essential) amino acids. In recent years, there has been renewed focus on the role of high-quality proteins in the prevention of stunted growth. One study, with observational design, conducted in 116 LMICs found that utilizable protein (total protein corrected for biological value and digestibility) was nega- tively associated with stunting after adjusting for energy and gross domestic product (Ghosh, Suri and Uauy, 2012). In another study, which focused on children aged 12 to 59 months in Malawi, lower serum concentrations of specific threonine, acids (argi- nine, glycine and glutamine) were found to be associated with child stunting (Semba et al., 2016). A recent narrative review discussed the importance of TASFs as sources of the essential amino acids needed by young children for growth and neurocognitive development and highlighted the amino acid sensing rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as a key regulator of these processes (Parikh et al., 2022). Some amino acids and their metabolites are notably pres - ent in TASF and absent, or found at low levels, in PBF. These compounds have been classified as bioactive and many have been studied for their association with human health outcomes. Taurine, creatine, carnosine, 4-hydroxyproline and anserine were all discovered in cattle and are concen- trated in beef but lacking in PBF (Wu, 2020). They play key roles in anti-inflammatory and immunological defence pathways, memory and cognition (Avgerinos et al., 2018; Benton and Donohoe, 2011), eye health and cardiovascu- lar maintenance (Ripps and Shen, 2012). Some TASFs may contain higher concentrations of the essential amino acid tryptophan, a precursor of serotonin, recently found to be connected to brain function via the microbiome (Gao et al., 2020) and to depression in older adults (Klimova, Novotny and Valis, 2020) and postnatal women (Trujillo et al., 2018). Diets consisting primarily of the staple food maize are defi- cient in tryptophan and may also interfere with the absorp - tion of minerals found in TASF. The composition of essential fatty acids in TASFs affects human health outcomes (see Box B4 for further information on the classification and importance of fat compounds). For example, the ratio of linoleic acid to alpha-linolenic acid influences how efficiently these fatty acids are endoge - nously converted into the longer chain fatty acids arachi- donic acid, aminopenicillanic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (Bernard et al., 2013). The elongation and desaturation of alpha linolenic acid to long-chain omega-3 PUFAs may be limited if there is excess dietary linoleic acid. The long-chain fatty acids have known benefits to human health and play vital roles throughout the life course, inter alia in neurodevelopment, anti-inflammatory processes and cell-membrane integrity (Hadley et al., 2016; Swanson, Block and Mousa, 2012). There is some evidence that DHA supplementation improves cognitive outcomes in young children (Drover et al., 2011), but systematic and narrative reviews have shown that supplementation trials have only minimal effects on health outcomes throughout the life course (Abdelhamid et al., 2018; Jiao et al., 2014). Dietary TASF intervention trials, which are discussed in Section C, have demonstrated impacts on DHA status. Some fats, such as saturated fatty acids and transfats, have been implicated in negative human health outcomes. Dietary guidelines generally recommend limiting satu- rated fats to approximately 10 percent of total energy intake (FAO, 2010), although the evidence base is mixed. A systematic review and meta-analysis using the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence found no association between saturated fat intakes and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, total coronary heart disease, ischaemic stroke or type 2 diabetes (de Souza et al., 2015). However, the analysis was not able to rule out any risk or association between saturated fat and coronary 31 Section B | Nutrient composition and value of terrestrial animal source foodBox B4. Important fat compounds provided by terrestrial animal source food s TASFs are rich in a variety of fats. Dietary fats not only provide essential fatty acids but also help in the absorp - tion of fat-soluble vitamins. In the human body, they are usually present as triacylglycerols. Fatty acids are components of triacylglycerols. The conformation and abundance of fatty acids vary depending on the source of the food and can influence many health outcomes. Fatty acids can be divided into three large groups: satu- rated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). important, as they include two essential fatty acids: alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid. These two fatty acids are required nutrients that cannot be synthesized by the human body and therefore have to be obtained from dietary sources. Another important fat compound is cholesterol, which is made in the liver and can also be found in food. Cholesterol is transported in human blood on two types of lipoproteins: low-density lipoprotein and lipoprotein affects human health. Excess low-density lipoprotein cholesterol can build up \"plaque\" in blood vessels and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke, while high-density lipoprotein, the \"good\" cholesterol, removes low-density lipopro - tein from the blood by transporting it to the liver from where it is flushed out of the body (CDC, 2020).

The certainty of the associations for saturated fats, however, was ranked as \"very low.\" Some reviews suggest that obser - vational studies examining the links between saturated fats in meat and risk of disease need to consider overall diet or the types of cooking methods used, which may modulate effects on disease (Geiker et al., 2021; Ward 2016). Another systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs and prospective cohort stud- ies in children and adolescents aged between two and 19 years showed that diets with reduced saturated fat content compared to control diets significantly reduced total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure (Te Morenga and Montez, 2017). There was no evidence for adverse effects on growth or anthropometry. There is more evidence suggesting that transfat intakes are associated with negative health outcomes, probably because they increase levels of low-density lipoprotein and reduce levels of high-density lipoprotein (de al., 2015; Te Morenga and Montez, 2017). Transfats may derive naturally from ruminants or be produced through process - ing in which hydrogen is added to vegetable oil to convert it from a liquid into a solid (WHO, 2018). In the systematic review and meta-analysis described above, transfat was found to be associated with all-cause and coronary heart disease mortality and total coronary heart disease, but not with type 2 diabetes or ischaemic stroke (de Souza et al., 2015; Te Morenga and Montez, 2017). When the investiga- tors stratified the data to distinguish the effects of industri- ally produced transfat from those of ruminant transfat, the findings showed that only industrially produced transfat was associated with coronary heart disease and coronary heart disease mortality, and that ruminant trans-palmi- toleic acid was negatively associated with type 2 diabetes. In view of the evidence linking transfat intake with coro - nary heart disease, a global initiative, REPLACE Trans Fat, has been established to eliminate all industrially produced transfat from the food supply by 2023 (WHO, 2021). 3.2 Micronutrients Vitamins play various roles in human nutrition and can occur in various forms. These forms may differ between TASF and PBF, and recommended intakes of vitamins vary by life-cycle phase (see Annex Table B1). Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is an important nutrient in terms of the relation between TASF and human health given that it is largely absent in PBF. It can be found in some PBFs such as seaweed, mushrooms (technically fungi rather than plants) and tempeh, although in forms that may not be as bioavailable as the vitamin B12 in TASF (Watanabe et al., 2013; Zugravu et al., 2021). Vitamin B12 plays an important role in cellular metabolic processes such as DNA synthe - sis and methylation. Deficiencies may result in pernicious anaemia and compromised neurodevelopment and brain function (Green et al., 2017). Other B vitamins serve as cofactors in enzyme systems throughout the human body. Riboflavin, or vitamin B2, is needed for the produc - of two coenzymes, flavin mononucleotide have roles in cellular respira- tion, growth, development and maintenance of epithelial tissue. Vitamin B6 in its phosphorylated form pyridoxine is found largely in plants and has to be dephosphorylated to be absorbed, while vitamin B6 in meat takes the form of esters that are more bioavailable (Brown, Ameer and Beier, 2021). Pyridoxine serves as a coenzyme for the synthe - sis of amino acids, sphingolipids, neurotransmitters and haemoglobin, among other bioactive substances, as well as for the metabolism of glycogen. Other B vitamins, such as B1 and B3, are also contained in TASF and important in human health (Gropper, Smith and Carr, 2021). Choline has gained increasing attention in recent years for its importance in growth, brain function and gene inter - actions (Leermakers et al., 2015; Smallwood, Allayee and Bennett, 2016). In human physiology, choline serves as a precursor for phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) that are integral to cell-membrane integrity and signalling, for acetylcholine, which influences neuro - transmission, neurogenesis, myelination and synapse formation, and for betaine, which donates a methyl group in the homocysteine production pathway (Caudill, 2010; Zeisel and da Costa, 2009). Recent systematic and narra- tive reviews point to the importance of choline for growth and neurodevelopment in the first 1 000 days of life (Bragg, Prado and Stewart, 2021; Derbyshire and Obeid, 2020). Eggs (and beef to a lesser extent) contain high concentra- tions of this nutrient. Another essential nutrient found in TASF is vitamin K, which is important for blood coagulation and calcium-binding pathways (the K2 form is only found in TASF) (Halder et al., 2019). The minerals zinc and iron are highly bioavailable in the muscle tissue of meats. Iron plays multiple roles in the human body, most notably in oxygen transport in the haemoglobin blood protein but also in other pathways involved in growth, neurodevelopment and immunity (Gropper, Smith and Carr, 2021; McCann, Perapoch Amad\u00f3 and Moore, 2020). Iron is especially important during preg- nancy, when there is significant plasma volume expansion 33 Section B | Nutrient composition and value of terrestrial animal source food(Georgieff, 2020) (see Annex Table B2 for more information on recommended intakes of minerals by life-cycle phase). Zinc is necessary for the activity of over 300 enzymes in the human body and also serves vital functions in growth, development and immunity (Gropper, Smith and Carr, 2021). Deficiencies in iron and zinc contribute substan- tially to the global burden of disease (Black et al., 2013). Although selenium is not recognized as being widely defi- cient in human populations, it does play important roles in health (Gashu et al., 2016; Speckmann and Grune, 2015). It is important for immune function and for its antioxidant and epigenetic effects. Selenium is among the nutrients known to be influenced by environmental factors, such as soil concentration (Gibson et al., 2011). Calcium and phos - phorous are considered macrominerals found in TASF and are important for bone health, among other roles (Gropper, Smith and Carr, 2021).The ratio of sodium to potassium dietary intakes has been linked to human health outcomes, particularly for its effects on hypertension and cardiovascular disease (Gon\u00e7alves and Abreu, 2020; Ndanuko et al., 2021; Perez and Chang, 2014). Consumption of milk and dairy products in a popu- lation in the United States of America has been found to be associated with lower ratios of sodium to potassium (< 1), which is consistent with WHO guidelines for reduced risk of mortality (Bailey et al., 2015). A study among Australian school-age children showed that dairy products were an important food source of potassium (Grimes et al., 2017).34 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes4. Evidence for the nutrient composition of different terrestrial animal source foods The evidence on nutrient composition with potential implications for human health was reviewed for the follow- ing five categories of TASF: $eggs and egg and dairy products; products; hunting and wildlife farming; and $insects, including grubs, and their products. TASFs from hunting and wildlife farming were included as a separate group because of consistent findings that for some nutrients their composition diverges from that of meats obtained from livestock. Insects and insect prod- ucts are not generally included in food-based dietary guidelines. However, they are explored in this subsection because there is a growing literature on their value in human health and nutrition.4.1 Eggs and egg products Chicken eggs are the most widely consumed type of egg, although the diets of many populations also include eggs from other poultry species, such as turkey, duck, quail and goose (FAO, 2015b). Egg in shell is the predominant prod- uct on the market, although there are others, including liquid eggs and egg powder. Eggs provide a range of differ - ent nutrients but have especially high concentrations of high-quality proteins, essential fatty acids, DHA, choline, selenium, riboflavin and vitamin B12 (Iannotti et al., 2014) (see Tables B2, B3, Annex Tables B3 and B4). The literature on the nutrient composition of eggs often differentiates the nutrient content of the yolk from that of the white. These two constituents originate during different phases of egg Table B2.

The combination of amino acids and proteins in eggs is considered a gold standard against which other proteins are compared (see Table B2). The concentration of proteins does not vary greatly across bird species, with slightly higher levels in turkey eggs (13.7 g/100 g) and goose eggs (13.9 g/100 g) than in chicken eggs (12.6 g/100g) (see Table B2). One study found a higher quantity of essential and total amino acids in the albumen of turkey eggs than in that of chicken, duck, goose, quail and pigeon eggs, although a higher ratio of essential to total amino acids was found in duck and goose eggs than in chicken, turkey, quail and pigeon eggs (Sun et al., 2019). Egg proteins are noted for their high digestibility - further enhanced through heating and the denaturation of some structural proteins (R\u00e9hault-Godbert, Guyot and Nys, 2019). Egg yolks contain a mix of low- and high-density lipopro - teins, livetins and phosvitins. Phosvitins have been shown to interfere with iron absorption (Yilmaz and Aag\u00fcnd\u00fcz, 2020). The vitelline membrane proteins and lipids sepa- rate the egg yolk from the egg white. Ovoalbumin and ovomucoid, proteinase inhibitors that can resist thermal heating, are the primary proteins contained in the egg white. Antibacterial proteins, such as lysozyme, peptides, ovotransferrin, ovoglobulin, cystatin, avidin and ovoflavin, are also present in the egg white, probably contributing to human nutrition (Guha, Majumder and Mine, 2018). One older review summarized evidence indicating that the proteins and peptides contained in eggs have been associ- ated with multiple health-promoting biological properties (Kovacs-Nolan, Phillips and Mine, 2005). Eggs of all poultry species contain a wide range of fatty acids (see Table B3). Lipids are highly concentrated in the egg yolk relative to the white (see Annex Table B3). Duck eggs (13.8 g) and goose eggs (13.3 g), on average contain more lipids per 100 g than chicken eggs (8.5 g). One study showed that there is a higher ratio of unsaturated to satu- rated fats in eggs than in other TASFs (R\u00e9hault-Godbert, Guyot and Nys, 2019). Cholesterol concentrations are also relatively high in eggs compared to other TASFs and to food broadly, although there is some uncertainty in the evidence-base for correlation of intake levels with plasma cholesterol (Kim and Campbell, 2018). Cholesterol has been associated with the development of cardiovascular disease (Kuang et al., 2018). One systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that looked at various interventions involving higher egg consumption showed that these interventions led to higher low density lipoprotein cholesterol to high density lipoprotein choles - terol ratios than that found in the control group (mean difference = 0.14, p = 0.001, I2 = 25 percent) (Li et al., 2020). Eggs contain several bioavailable vitamins and some minerals at high concentrations (see Table B4 and Annex Table B4). Eggs are among the richest dietary sources of choline, containing both lipid-soluble and water-sol- uble forms. Like other TASFs, eggs contain vitamin B12 (eggs from various poultry species can provide more than 50 percent of age- and sex-specific RNI in a single egg), as well as significant concentrations of other B vitamins. Eggs have been noted for containing the carotenoids of lutein and zeaxanthin, which are important in anti-inflammatory pathways (Eisenhauer et al., 2017; Wallace, 2018). Eggs contain no vitamin C, probably because birds can produce it endogenously. Niacin is also found at very low levels. Some minerals and trace elements that are limited in the diets of vulnerable populations are provided by eggs in bioavailable forms. Egg yolks have higher concentrations of minerals than egg whites, and there is some variability across species. Egg shells are also rich in highly bioavail- able calcium - 1 g of chicken egg shell contains about 380 mg of calcium (Bartter et al., 2018; Omer et al., 2018). Turkey eggs are more highly concentrated than the eggs of other birds in some important minerals, including calcium (99.0 mg per 100 g), iron (4.1 mg per 100 g) and zinc (1.6 mg per 100 g) (see Table B4). Evidence regarding the impact of dietary egg intake on human mineral nutrition is equivocal.36 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesTable B3.

The milk from these species varies in composition. Animal milk is produced around parturition with the biological purpose of nourishing offspring and is nutrient-dense and complete across many nutrients and bioactive compounds (Mozaffarian, 2019). Animal milk contains complementary nutrients that act in synergy to optimize metabolism, for example lactose and casein acting to enhance calcium absorption (Chalupa-Krebzdak, Long and Bohrer, 2018). One recent untargeted metabolo study using chromatography-nuclear magnetic reso identified 296 cow's milk metabolites and metabolite species with the potential to have implications for health (Foroutan et al., 2019). Sphingomyelin in animal milk may be protective against gut dysbiosis and inflammation (Norris et al., 2019). Like eggs, milk and dairy products have been recognized for their importance as sources of high-quality proteins. The two primary protein categories in milk are casein (insoluble) and whey (soluble), which make up approximately 80 percent and 20 percent of the protein content, respectively. Whey proteins can act in concert with other nutrients, specifi- cally minerals, to enhance absorption and metabolism. For example, the glycoprotein lactoferrin binds iron and may increase its bioavailability and play key roles in immunity and inflammatory processes (Hao et al., 2019), although animal milk is generally not considered a good source of iron (Hurrell et al., 1989; Ziegler, 2011). -lactoglobulin has high affinity for retinol and other carotenoids and may enhance vitamin A absorption and metabolism (Mensi et al., 2013). Caseins serve as protein carriers for calcium and phosphorous. The protein insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF 1) in milk has been linked to child growth, although evidence is mixed for this effect (Grenov et al., 2020; Hoppe, M\u00f8lgaard and Michaelsen, 2006). One recent analysis showed that the protein content of plant-based alternatives to milk - containing, respectively, soybean, oats, hemp, coconut, rice and nuts - was on average an estimated 48 percent of that in bovine milk (Chalupa-Krebzdak, Long and Bohrer, 2018). Milk lipids are primarily comprised of triacylglycerols (98 percent) and very small fractions of diacylglycerol (2 percent), cholesterol (< 0.5 percent), phospholipids (1 percent) and free fatty acids (0.1 percent) (Pereira, 2014). Milk fatty acids are a function of feed, stage of lactation and animal species (see also Subsection 5). Bovine milk contains approximately 70 percent saturated and 30 percent unsat - urated fatty acids. Oleic acid, conjugated linoleic acid and omega 3 fatty acids in bovine milk may promote positive human health outcomes (Haug, H\u00f8stmark and Harstad, 2007). Concerns about saturated fats and their association with cardiometabolic health have been raised but largely derive from observational studies (Poppitt, 2020). One systematic review of RCTs examined the effects of cheese consumption on blood lipids and lipoproteins and found that it increased total cholesterol or low-density liprotein cholesterol levels when compared to tofu or fat-modified cheese, and reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when compared to butter (de Goede et al., 2015). The findings of a narrative review that examined the effects of consuming dairy products on cholesterol levels varied by product type, with some decreasing total cholesterol and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and others increasing triglycerides and low-density lipoproteins (Duarte et al., 2021). Further discussion of broader health effects for milk, yoghurt, cheese and other dairy products is provided in Section C. Macronutrient concentrations in milk differ by species (see Table B5). Protein levels per 100 g are highest in reindeer milk (10.4 g), followed by mithan (6.5 g), sheep (6.0 g) and alpaca (5.8 g) milk. Fat concentrations per 100 g are highest in rein- deer milk (16.1 g), followed by mithan (8.9 g), buffalo (7.5 g) and sheep (7.0 g) milk. Amino acid and fatty acid composi- tions also vary across species (see Annex Tables B5 and B6). With regard to micronutrients, milk and dairy products are especially well recognized for their high concentrations and high bioavailability of calcium, which is bound to casein in micellar form but also to whey proteins and inorganic salts. Other macrominerals concentrated in milk are phos - phorous, magnesium and potassium, and the micromin- erals zinc and selenium are also provided by milk. Iodine is found in bovine milk (see Annex Table B7). Among dairy products, dry milk powder unsurprisingly, has the highest concentrations of several vitamins and minerals, although fresh buttermilk, cream and sour cream also have relatively high micronutrient levels (see Annex Tables B8 and B9). Fat-soluble vitamin contents again vary with animal diets and across milk products (whole, low-fat and skimmed). Whole milk contains bioavailable vitamin A. Raw cow's milk contains low levels of vitamin D (0.06 \u00b5g/100 g) relative to some TASFs but may be fortified in commercially available products. Where water-soluble vitamins are concerned, milk provides high levels of vitamin B complex and some vitamin C.39 Section B | Nutrient composition and value of terrestrial animal source foodTable B5.

One review suggests that non-cow milks may be more easily digested than cow's milk, probably because of the softer curds formed in the stomachs of humans during gastric digestion (Roy et al., 2020). This effect may be explained by the varying composition of other species' milks in terms of casein compounds, fat globules and protein-to-fat ratio. Another study (Gantner et al., 2015) compared the nutrient composition of multiple animal milks, including human milk, and found that fat content varied the most compared to other nutrients, and that there were more commonalities in content between human milk and other non-ruminant milks than between human and ruminant milks. For exam- ple, the structure of fat globules and triacylglycerol in rumi- nant milk was found to be significantly different from that in non-ruminant (including human) milk. Non-ruminant milk was also found to contain higher percentages of unsatu- rated, lower saturated and MUFAs than ruminant milk. Some evidence on the nutritional composition of milk from other animals is summarized below. A review that examined buffalo, horse and dromedary milk at the level of breed, and yak, mithan, musk ox, donkey, Bactrian camel, llama, alpaca, reindeer and moose milk at species level, found that inter - species nutrient values (g per 100 g) ranged from 0.70 to 16.1 for total fat, 1.6 to 10.5 for protein, 2.6 to 6.6 for lactose, and 67.9 to 90.8 for water (Medhammar et al., 2012). Reindeer and moose milks were found to have the highest concentrations of fat and protein, and moose milk to be the richest in miner - als (calcium, sodium and phosphorus). By contrast, mare and donkey milks were found to have the lowest concen- trations of protein and fat, although their fatty-acid profiles were more closely aligned to human nutrient requirements. Donkey milk has been found to have low allergenicity, attributed to the whey proteins serving as bioactive peptides and low casein levels (Vincenzetti et al., 2017). TASF sensitiv- ity and allergy issues are addressed in Section C. Buffalo milk makes up 12 percent of global milk produc - tion and more than half of the milk consumed in India and Pakistan (Arora, Sindhu and Khetra, 2020). While compo - sition varies with genetics, nutrition, season and stage of lactation (see Subsection 5), it contains 6 to 12 percent fat, 4 to 5 percent protein, 4 to 5.5 percent lactose, 0.8 percent ash and 82 to 83 percent water (see Table B5 for a compar - ison of cattle and buffalo milk). Another study compared buffalo milk to cow's milk and showed that the former had higher levels of fat, protein, calcium and vitamins A and C but lower levels of vitamin E, riboflavin and cholesterol (Abd El-Salam and El-Shibiny, 2011). An in vitro experiment found that fermented buffalo milk showed higher bacterial viability than cow's milk (Sim\u00f5es da Silva et al., 2020).Camel milk provides high-quality food to populations living in arid and semi-arid regions particularly (Rahmeh et al., 2019). One review of the nutrient composition of camel milks, including dromedary, Bactrian camel and other camelid milks, showed that on average they had high concentrations of vitamin C (up to ten times higher than cow's milk), high concentrations of total salts, calcium and oligoelements, including iron, copper and zinc, and low cholesterol (Benmeziane-Derradji, 2021). The micronutrient composition data compiled for the pres - ent assessment (see Annex Table B10) indicate that among the species compared the highest levels of vitamin A in retinol equivalents per 100 g are present in the milks of Bactrian camels (97 \u00b5g), buffaloes (69 \u00b5g), sheep (44 \u00b5g) and cows (43 \u00b5g), the highest vitamin B12 concentrations per 100 g in the milks of sheep (0.71 \u00b5g), cows (0.46 \u00b5g) and buffaloes (0.45 \u00b5g), the highest iron concentrations per 100 g in the milks of yaks (0.57 mg) and dromedaries (0.21 mg), and the highest zinc concentrations per 100 g in the milks of yaks (0.90 mg), Bactrian camels (0.70 mg) and dromedaries (0.60 mg). 4.3 Meat and meat products Meat and meat products from the following animal species are reviewed in this subsection and in the subsection on food from hunting and wildlife farming: cattle, buffalo, sheep, goat, pig, horse, rabbit, deer, chicken, turkey, quail, pheasant, duck, goose, pigeon and guinea fowl. These animal tissues covered in this subsection include muscle and offal (organs and any other edible non-muscle tissues). Some evidence in public health nutrition distinguishes between red meat (from species such as cattle, buffalo, goat, sheep, pig, dromedary, Bactrian camel, horse and donkey) and white meat (from rabbits and avian species). Meat, like eggs and milk, is considered a high-quality protein food. The protein and amino-acid composition of meat from muscle tissue aligns well with human nutrition requirements, in part because it is similar to human skel- etal muscle (Geiker et al., 2021). Meat from muscle tissue contains an array of amino acids, including all the essen- tial ones (see Annex Tables B11 and B15 for a compari- son between meat and offal). Those present in the high- est concentrations are in glutamic acid and glutamine, followed by arginine, alanine and aspartic acid (Williams, 2007). Cooking practices have been shown to influence ileal amino acid digestibility (and hence the DIAAS). Regardless of processing type, the DIAAS for meat generally exceeds 100; overcooking can, however, lower digestibility and reduce the DIAAS (Bailey et al., 2020). Poultry meats have 41 Section B | Nutrient composition and value of terrestrial animal source foodbeen highlighted for their low content of the structural protein collagen, a characteristic that facilitates digestion (Marangoni et al., 2015). The bioactive compounds carnitine, creatine, taurine, hydroxyproline and anserine - all present in meat - have been shown to confer positive effects on human health, as described above (Wu, 2020). Meat is the most abundant dietary source of taurine, which serves as an anti oxidant, among other roles in human health (Williams, 2007). There is evidence that carnitine levels and metabolism increase during pregnancy and lactation and potentially play a critical role in infants during the first 1000 day period (Manta-Vogli et al., 2020). Depending on multiple factors (e.g. animal diet, tissue type, ruminant versus non-ruminant origin), meat contains approximately 50 percent MUFAs, 40 percent saturated fatty acids, 5 percent transfatty acids and 4 percent PUFAs (see Annex Tables B12 and B16 for comparison between meat and offal). Fatty acids found meat M\u00e4nnist\u00f6, 2005). Meat is also the primary dietary source of docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) (C22:5 omega 3), which is available from mammal and poultry meat but not from fish (De Smet and Vossen, 2016). The evidence suggests that DPA potentially reduces chronic disease risk (McAfee et al., 2010). One review noted that once the skin is removed, poultry meat can be a good source of unsaturated fats (Marangoni et al., 2015). Meat, more broadly, can provide the long-chain fatty acids DHA and EPA, which are important for human health (Mann and Truswell, 2017). Animal diet has a stronger association with the fatty-acid composition of meat in monogastrics than in ruminants (see Subsection 5.1). This is because of the metabolic de gra- dation of fatty acids in the rumen (one of the stomachs of ruminants), which is absent in monogastric animals. Meat from ruminants is influenced by fermentation, lipolysis and biohydrogenation processes in the rumen and contains conjugated linoleic acid and unique branched-chain fatty acids that have positive implications for health (Geiker et al., 2021; Vahmani et al., 2020). Cooking can also change fatty acid composition. A study examining beef and lamb meat found that levels of omega 3 and omega 6 PUFAs increased with cooking (Purchas et al., 2014). Tables B6 and B7 show some differences in the macro - nutrient composition of meats, particularly between meats from livestock species and meats from wild animals. The meats from wild animals tend to contain more protein, while meats from livestock species have higher total fat content. These differences are reflected in findings described below in the subsection on foods from hunting and wildlife farming. Protein levels per 100 g are highest in pheasant (23.6 g), turkey (22.6 g) and rabbit (21.6 g) meats, while fat levels per 100 g are highest in pig (65.7 g) sheep (61 g) and cattle (33.99 g) meats. Meat is among the most important food sources of iron and zinc, the critical limiting minerals in diets globally. Iron in meat is generally complexed as haem iron, which is absorbed at higher rates (on average 25 percent; range 15-35 percent) than the non-haem iron predominantly found in PBF (2-3 percent) (Gropper, Smith and Carr, 2021). Older analyses produced similar findings, with rates rang- ing from 15 percent to 25 percent for haem iron and from 5 percent to 12 percent for non-haem iron (Carpenter and Mahoney, 1992; Hallberg, 1983; Hurrell and Egli, 2010). Zinc supplied by meat is also more bioavailable than that from PBF (Gropper, Smith and Carr, 2021). Other import - ant minerals found in meat include selenium, copper and phosphorous. Fresh or unprocessed meat is low in sodium. Like other TASFs, meat provides vitamin B12 and a range of other B vitamins - vitamin B3 (niacin), vitamin B2 (riboflavin) and vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). Poultry meat has been highlighted for its vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B6 and vitamin B5 contents. All organ meats except tripe are rich in vitamin B12 (Williams, 2007). Choline and DHA are found in the highest concentrations in the liver (Enser et al., 1998). Liver also has high concentrations of vitamin A in its bioavailable form, retinol, as well as iron and folate. The vitamin D metabolite 25 hydroxycholecal- ciferol is provided by meat, and there is evidence for high biological activity (Williamson et al., 2005). Comparing the micronutrient concentrations of various meats (including some meats from wild animals) shows that there are high concentrations of iron per 100 g in cattle (3.48 mg), pigeon (3.45 mg), deer (3.40 mg) and turkey (3.45 mg) meats (see Annex Tables B13 and B17). For zinc, the highest concentrations per 100 g among the species compared are found in horse (2.9 mg), goat (2.6 mg), cattle (2.4 mg) and goose (2.34 mg) meats. Where vitamins are concerned (see Annex Tables B14 and B18), vitamin A in retinol equivalents per 100 g is particularly high in pheas - ant (50 \u00b5g) and pigeon (51 \u00b5g) meats, followed by sheep (42 \u00b5g) and goat (33 \u00b5g) meats. The highest vitamin C concentrations per 100 g among the species compared are found in in goose (7.2 mg) and pigeon meats (6.1 mg). The highest concentrations of vitamin B12 per 100 g among the species compared are found in deer (6.31 \u00b5g) and horse (6.23 \u00b5g) meats.42 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesTable B6.

Other studies have compared the micronutrient contents of different meats. One review covering various meats consumed in Australia and New Zealand found mutton to be denser than beef, veal and lamb in nutrients with biolog- ical value (Williams, 2007). Some recent reviews describe the characteristics of some less-consumed meats, such as processed sheep and goat meat (Teixeira et al., 2020), pheasant, quail and guinea fowl meat (L\u00f3pez-Pedrouso et al., 2019) and meat from South American camelids (Popova et al., 2021). 4.4 Food from hunting and wildlife farming Consumption of meat from hunted animals (game) and meat from farmed wild animals has been increasing 43 Section B | Nutrient composition and value of terrestrial animal source foodthroughout the last two decades (Costa et al., 2016). FAO defines wild meat as \"terrestrial animal wildlife used for food\" (FAO, 2019). The European Union defines wild game under EU Regulation No. 853/2004 as follows: wild ungulates and lagomorphs, as well as other land mammals that are hunted for human consumption and are considered to be wild game under the applicable law in the Member State concerned, including mammals living in enclosed territory under conditions of freedom similar to those of wild game, and wild birds that are hunted for human consumption. Particularly in high-income countries, demand for wild meats has increased, as they are perceived to be healthier and leaner and free of antibiotics and hormones. In some LMICs, populations depend on hunting and wildlife farm- ing for food security. Serious concerns have been raised about the environmental impacts of hunting practices (legal and illegal) and their role in the depletion of wildlife, largely driven by urban demand for wild meat and human encroachment into wildlife areas. Ripple et al. (2016) report that, as of 2015, hunting was a primary threat to the survival of 301 mammalian species classified as threatened accord- ing to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and that all these species were found in LMICs and only eight also found in high-income countries. Almost 72 percent of emerging infectious diseases transmitted from animals to humans (zoonotic diseases) originate from wildlife (Jones et al., 2008). Hunting increases exposure to wildlife and hence to the risk of zoonotic diseases (Van Vliet et al., 2017a). The consumption of meat from wild animals is associated with food-safety risks if appropriate handling and cooking prac - tices are not followed, and there is also a risk that meat from wild animals may be contaminated with chemical residues (toxic metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocar - bons) (Van Vliet et al., 2017a) (see also Section D). However, many populations depend on hunting and wildlife farming for food security, with these practices supplementing culti- vation and livestock production or substituting for them when they are not possible (Hoffman and Cawthorn, 2012). One recent study identified 15 countries that would be at risk of food insecurity if prohibitions of meat from hunting were introduced, and highlighted the trade-offs in terms of species losses that could occur as a consequence of land-use changes associated with replacing protein from wild meat with protein from livestock (Booth et al., 2021). In South America, 5 million to 8 million people were esti- mated to regularly rely on meat from wild animals as a source of protein in the early years of this century (Rushton et al., 2005). Hunted animals range across multiple taxo - nomic groups, including ungulates, rodents, rabbits and hares, kangaroos, reptiles, birds and bats. A study in the Congo Basin estimated that 40 million tonnes of bush meat are harvested each year (Van Vliet et al., 2017b ). One review of meat from wild animals examined nutrient compositional differences across representative species (Costa et al., 2016). Total protein concentrations do not vary significantly, but they are on average higher in some meats, for example meat from the common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia) (25.0 g/100 g/100 g (see Table B7) (Costa et al., 2016). Some species have markedly higher total fat concentrations, notably the (Dama dama) (2.5 g/100 g). Other studies have examined differences in nutrient concentrations across different meats from wild animals or compared them to meat from livestock species. Meats from wild European animals, including those from red and fallow deer, wild boar, hare and wild rabbit, were reviewed for nutritional characteristics by Soriano and S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda (2021) and found to have high protein content and low fat content. Compared to meat from livestock species, the wild sources were found to have higher proportions of omega 3 PUFAs and PUFAs generally, and the wild ruminants had lower omega 6/omega 3 ratios (around 4). High nutrient densities were found for phosphorous, potassium, zinc, iron, vitamin E and the vitamin B complex. Another study (Bure et al., 2015) compared meat from red and fallow deer with that from Aberdeen Angus and Holstein cattle, and found lower total levels of crude fat and collagen and higher polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratios in the venison than in the beef. The atherogenic index measuring the composite of triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was also lower in the venison than in the beef. A study of the fatty-acid profiles of some wild North American and African ruminants found them to be similar to those of pasture-fed cattle but different from those of grain-fed cattle (Cordain et al., 2002). Several studies have examined the nutritional composi- tion of meat from wild animals specific to certain regions: wild fallow deer (Dama dama) in South Africa (Cawthorn et al., 2020); wild axis deer (Axis axis) in Croatia (Kelava 44 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesTable B7.

Findings from these studies are comparable to the reviews described above, generally showing high levels of protein, healthy fats and a range of multiple minerals and vitamins in the meats of these wild animal species. 4.5 Insects and insect products Insects are increasingly recognized for their value and potential in human health and nutrition but also for their significance with regard to environmental sustainability and livelihoods (Nowakowski et al., 2021). FAO estimates that the diets of more than 2 billion people include insects and that more than 1 900 insect species are consumed by humans globally (Huis et al., 2013). The most commonly consumed insects are beetles (Coleoptera) (31 percent), caterpillars (Lepidoptera) (18 percent), bees, wasps and ants (Hymenoptera) (14 percent), grasshoppers, locusts and crickets (Orthoptera) (13 percent) and cicadas, leaf - hoppers, planthoppers, scale insects and true bugs (Hemiptera) (10 percent) (see Figure B2). Entomophagy, or consumption of insects, has been integral to hominin evolution and is practised in many cultures to this day (de Carvalho, Madureira and Pintado, 2020). However, barri- ers to consumption and consumer acceptance of insects and insect products have been described, and include neophobia and disgust (Jantzen da Silva Lucas et al., 2020; Onwezen et al., 2021). Some studies have focused on prac - tices in certain countries, such as Ghana (Parker et al., 2020), Indonesia (Ad\u00e1mkov\u00e1 et al., 2017) and Kenya (Kinyuru et al., 2015). Issues related to the culture of insect consump - tion and consumer demand for and acceptance of insects as food will be covered in Component Document 2 of this assessment.45 Section B | Nutrient composition and value of terrestrial animal source foodFigure B2.

[Cited 14 December 2021]. https://www.wur.nl/ en/Research-Results/Chair-groups/Plant-Sciences/Laboratory-of-En- tomology/Edible-insects/Worldwide-species-list.htm. Environmental sustainability features (e.g. feed conversion rates) will be covered in Component Document 3. Depending on the insect species, the nutritional compo - sition may vary with stage of metamorphosis, sex, habit and feed. For example, larval and pupal stages tend to have higher energy and fat levels than adult insects; female insects have significantly higher concentrations of fat and energy than males. Studies have shown that insects contain high concentrations of protein and healthy fats (Churchward-Venne et al., 2017). One recent review compared insect nutritient composition with other TASFs (Orkusz, 2021). The review showed that some insect species have higher protein, PUFA and cholesterol concentrations than other TASFs and lower levels of saturated and MUFAs, thiamine, niacin, cobalamin and iron. The vitamin C and dietary fibre contents of insects were also highlighted as a possible source of health advantages. A review of 236 species showed that edible insects could supply protein, MUFAs and/or PUFAs in sufficient quan- tities to meet daily requirements for these macronutri- ents (Rumpold and Schl\u00fcter, 2013). Another, more recent, review explored the potential of insect farming as a source of both human food and animal feed (Hawkey et al., 2021). It compared the macronutrient content of ten commonly used insects and found protein content in the orders Orthoptera and Diptera (flies) to be between 51 percent and 76 percent. Fat content was proportionally lower than protein content across all orders, with some species excep - tions, including the greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella) (51.4-58.6 percent). Insects also contain several bioac - tive compounds (Jantzen da Silva Lucas et al., 2020). In a study examining 212 insect species from Africa, inves - tigators found that Lepidoptera had the highest protein content (20-80 percent) and fat content (10-50 percent), while Coleoptera had the highest carbohydrate content (7-54 percent) (Hlongwane, Slotow and Munyai, 2020).

A systematic review of edible insects globally highlighted the wide range of nutrients contents found in insects (Weru, Chege and Kinyuru, 2021). Drawing data from 91 species, this study found that among minerals, potassium levels were especially high across multiple species and copper levels were relatively low. For vitamins, insects were found to have high concentrations of vitamin E and low concentrations of vitamin C. Some studies have highlighted the potential of insects to mitigate iron and zinc deficiencies globally. One analysis showed that levels of these minerals across commonly reared and wild-harvested insects were similar or higher than those in other TASFs (Mwangi et al., 2018). The authors noted, however, that the iron and zinc in insects are derived from non-haem compounds and thus that their bioavailability is unknown. Insect products have also been studied for their effects on human health and nutrition outcomes. Honey has been a valuable source of energy and nutrients for Homo species for millennia (Marlowe et al., 2014). In recent years, honey produced by the honey bee and stingless bees has been recognized for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative factors as well as for its nutritional advantages (Alvarez- Suarez, Giampieri and Battino, 2013; B8). Specifically, the flavonoids and pheno - lic acids in honey probably play roles in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory processes (Cianciosi et al., 2018; Boukraa, 2010; Machado De-Melo et al., 2017). Other studies have found that honey may confer antidiabetic effects and protect cardiovascular health (Cianciosi et al., 2018). Insect powders and processed products obtained through drying and fermentation, among other processing methods, are being considered for use in meeting nutritional needs and mitigating malnu- trition globally (Kewuyemi et al., 2019).47 Section B | Nutrient composition and value of terrestrial animal source food5. Differences in nutrient content and quality associated with animal characteristics and husbandry This subsection explores how animal characteristics such as genetic traits, sex and age as well as livestock husbandry practices and other aspects of the production system determine the nutrient composition and quality of TASFs. Livestock husbandry practices encompass methods and measures applied by the producer. They include, inter alia, feeding, reproductive management, housing, and health and welfare care from birth until slaughter. Nutritional attributes relate to nutrient composition and bioavail- ability, and affect human health. Organoleptic attributes relate to the sensorial experience of the consumer (e.g. taste, texture). Producers often get paid on the basis of commercial attributes, including criteria such as quantity and composition (e.g. protein and fat content, marbling of meat) and the characteristics of the production system. Food safety is linked to factors such as the absence (or low levels) of food-borne pathogens (e.g. those associated with poor hygiene practices during milking) or harmful chemical or physical substances. Technological attributes relate to the suitability of raw TASFs for preservation and processing. The types of factors that affect the quality of unprocessed TASFs, i.e. the characteristics of the animal and the produc - tion system, are summarized in Figure B3. The degree of impact of each factor is further detailed in Table B9. Genetic selection and livestock husbandry practices directly influence the nutritional content of TASFs and also play a substantial role in other aspects of food quality and safety. The impacts of a given factor on different food-qual- ity attributes may be universally beneficial (synergetic), universally detrimental or combine beneficial and detri- mental elements (antagonistic). These associations are discussed further in Subsection 5.3.

The crosses indicate whether and how much animal characteristics and production practices impact food safety and food quality attributes: ++ indicates a major impact; + indicates a minor impact; the absence of cross indicates no impact. 5.1 Intrinsic characteristics of animals affecting the nutritional properties and quality of terrestrial animal source food Protein and fat are the most important macronutrients provided by TASF. The impact of various factors on these nutrients has been studied extensively in livestock species. Micronutrients, such as vitamins, have been studied to a lesser degree. The breed of an animal and its individual genetic traits, as well as other intrinsic characteristics of animals such as age and sex, have been shown to affect the quality of TASFs. 5.1.1 Impact of genetic traits The influence of genetics on nutrient composition is described below for meat, followed by eggs and milk. Table B10 further details the impact of breed on nutritional quality by species and type of TASF. With the exception of chickens and to a lesser degree milk, little impact of genetics on the protein content of TASFs has been reported for most livestock species. However, fat content and fatty-acid profile can vary substantially among and within breeds. This has been studied fairly extensively and has been considered in breeding decisions. For exam- ple, throughout history genetic improvement schemes have frequently aimed to increase or to decrease the leanness of pig meat to meet market demand. In chickens, commercial broiler lines have been intensely selected for fast growth and leanness. Broiler breeds with slower growth rates are generally fatter and their meat tends to have higher total PUFA content from animals belonging to locally adapted breeds can have different nutrient contents from those belonging to international transboundary breeds subject to intensive selection programmes. For example, the eggs of a local Spanish chicken breed have been found to have higher fat content (by 26 percent) than those from commercial laying hens (Franco et al., 2020). Higher levels of PUFA in TASFs, especially omega-3, and lower omega 6/omega 3 fatty acid ratios are considered better for human nutrition (see Subsection B 3). Meat from some local breeds of sheep (Van Harten et al., 2016), duck (Onk, 2019) and pig (Kim and Kim, 2018) has been found to be more closely aligned with this beneficial fatty-acid profile than meat from interna- tional breeds. The higher fat content and specific fatty-acid profile found in Iberico pigs is desired for dry-cured ham processing because of its better technological and organo - leptic qualities. Intramuscular fat content in meat from Iberico pigs has been found to be more than twice that of meat from Berkshire pigs (Ali et al., 2021). The omega 6/omega 3 ratio, the PUFA content and the linoleic acid content of Iberico meat were found to be less than half of those of Berkshire meat. A high fat content and a low 49 Section B | Nutrient composition and value of terrestrial animal source foodcontent of linoleic acid enables slow dehydration during the curing process (Ali et al., 2021; Prache et al., 2020b). The breed effect on nutrient composition needs to be consid- ered along with the feeding system and the geographical area where the animals are raised (Barnes et al., 2012; Belhaj et al., 2020) (see Subsection B 5.2). Nutritional quality also depends on the cut of the meat. Cuts from the loin or rear legs usually have much lower fat content than cuts from the belly, for example. Comparison of the nutritional value of the same meat cuts can be made between different breeds or species (Barnes et al., 2012). Organ meats are particularly nutrient-dense compared to other meats (see Subsection B 4.3). However, there is limited information on the extent to which the nutri- tional content of organ meat is affected by differences in breed and animal characteristics. Differences between the fatty acid profiles of kidneys from different sheep breeds were reported by Nguyen et al. (2017), with omega-3 DHA content 19 percent higher in pure-bred Merinos than in White Suffolk Corriedale cross-bred animals. However, the total lipid percentage and the fatty-acid profile of liver did not differ between breeds. Variation in intramuscular fat content, which is related to the palatability of the meat (marbling), has been reported within populations and between breeds in cattle (Park et al., 2018). This affects both the nutritional and the organ- oleptic qualities. Fat content varies between meat cuts in the carcasses of different breeds, which has an effect on organoleptic qualities (FAO, 2015a; Prache, Schreurs and Guillier, 2021). Differences have been documented between the fatty-acid profiles of subcutaneous and intra- muscular fat in beef, with omega-6 and omega-3 PUFA content a minimum of three times higher in intramuscular fat and a higher percentage of MUFA in subcutaneous fat (10-30 percent increase), independent of the (concen- trate, forage) Rana and Akhtaruzzaman, 2017; Indurain et al., 2006; Orellana et al., 2009). The higher the fat content of the carcass, the lower the proportion of omega-6 PUFA in its intramuscular fat. The fat content and fatty-acid profile of animals' milk is determined by their genetic make-up, and thus varies with species and breed. In most instances, this is a concentra- tion effect. For instance, the Jersey dairy cattle breed has a lower milk productive potential than the Holstein-Friesian, but its milk has higher fat and protein contents (Stocco et al., 2017). However, there are exceptions to this rule. The milk yield of the Simmental breed is both higher in volume and about 10 percent higher in fat content than that of the Italian local breeds Rendena and Alpine Grey (Stocco et al., Box B5. Fat globules in the milk affect food quality Fat globules in milk affect the technological, organ- oleptic and nutritional quality of milk products (Fleming et al., 2017; Martini, Salari and Altomonte, 2016). The composition of fat globules is influenced by species, breed, stage of lactation and season. The average size of fat globules is generally lower in small ruminants (goats and sheep) than in cattle (Felice et al., 2021). Milk fat globules are associated with poten- tial health benefits (to the immune system) and are used as supplements in infant nutrition (Fontecha et al., 2020). Differences in the diameter and the number of globules cause variation in the total surface area of fat globule membranes, which may have a role in lipid and milk digestion and absorption and have anti-inflammatory action. Milk fat globules are also of particular interest in the manufacture of cheeses, as the interaction between the surface of milk fat globules and the casein matrix influences both the structure and the texture of the product. A larger diameter is better for butter production and certain types of cheese and is found in the milk of Jersey and Norman cattle, for example. The smaller diameter of fat globules in goat's milk contributes to the softer texture of goat's cheese compared to cow's cheese (Martini, Salari and Altomonte, 2016). There is an association between the milk fat content and the average diameter of the milk fat globules. 2017). Although breed is an important source of variation in fat content, within-breed variation among individual cows and with the stage of lactation tends to have a greater effect on milk-fat composition than breed (Samkov\u00e1 et al., 2011). Beyond overall fat content, the composition of fat globules in milk varies between cattle breeds and affects technological quality for butter making (Martini, Salari and Altomonte, 2016) (see Box B5); however, it generally does not affect nutritional quality. The nutritional quality of TASFs is controlled by a range of metabolic and genomic (Dadousis et al., 2017; Hocquette et al., 2010; Pegolo et al., 2018). Therefore, traits related to nutritional quality (e.g. protein and fat content, and milk coagulation properties) and organoleptic traits are expected potentially to have a genetic correlation, positive or negative, with many production, reproduction, functional or even adaptive traits (Egger-Danner et al., 2015; Ewaoluwagbemiga et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2019). Some studies in Australian meat and dairy cattle systems have concluded, on the basis of estimated genetic correla- tions between adaptive traits and nutritional-quality traits, that selection for one category of trait should have no undesirable effect on the other (Prayaga et al., 2009; Turner et al., 2010).50 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesCertain genes are known to be directly linked to quality traits and are targeted in genetic selection programmes to improve the commercial quality of TASFs. In particular, a mutation of the myostatin gene can be associated with \"doubled-muscle\" animals, which have muscle hypertrophy (on average 20 percent heavier), lean carcass and meat that is more tender (Allais et al., 2010; De Smet, Raes and et al., 2020). Double-muscled are well-represented in the Belgian Blue and Charolais breeds. Reduced development of intramuscular fat is known to occur in animals with a high muscularity (Hocquette et al., 2010). Double-muscled animals have lower total fat, an approximately 50 percent lower proportion of saturated fatty acids and a higher proportion of PUFAs. Genes affecting milk composition have also been studied. A meta-analysis conducted by Bangar et al. (2021) showed that the B allele of the kappa casein gene (milk protein) is associated with higher fat percentage in cow's milk than allele A. Improving the traits that underlie meat and milk quality is a major chal- lenge and is further discussed in Subsection 5.3.1. Table B10.

The sex of the animal and the time at which the TASF product is harvested are two factors that have been identified. Table B11 summa- rizes some examples of impacts on nutritional quality by type of TASF and species. The sex of the animal influences the lipid content of meat products and thus both the nutritional and the organolep - tic quality. Females and castrated males have higher intra- muscular lipid content. Sex hormones play a role, and their effects are particularly noticeable in the difference between castrated and uncastrated animals. When heated, meat from uncastrated boars may have an unpleasant odour (so-called \"boar taint\"), which is caused by the presence of skatole and androstenone in the adipose Androstenone is a steroidal pheromone produced in the testicles that triggers a urine odour, whereas skatole is produced in the digestive tract and is associated with a faecal odour.

The findings of studies on the impact of age on protein content vary with the age groups studied and the species-specific age at maturity. The fat content of meat generally increases with age. The haemoprotein content in red meat is also higher in the carcasses of older animals (Ba\u00e9za, Guillier and and Boshoff, 2010). Genetic selection for growth rate and carcass yield in chickens has led to a reduction in the slaughter age and thus an increase in the moisture/protein content ratio in the standard retail prod- uct (Ba\u00e9za, Guillier and Petracci, 2021).As well as affecting the nutritional-quality attributes of food, age can also affect food safety. Chemical residues and environmental pollutants tend to be higher in the carcasses of animals slaughtered at an older age, as the exposure time and thus the risk of accumulation increases with age (Prache et al., 2020b). The potential accumulation of undesirable heavy metals, such as arsenic or cadmium, over the life of the animal, curtails the quality of milk, eggs, meat and offal (Hejna et al., 2018).FactorFood productSpecies Impact on nutrient composition Reference Age at slaughterMeatCattle SheepIncrease in fat tissue carotenoid concentration with age Age effect on tenderness depends on the muscle (muscles with less collagen show less impact of age) Stronger flavour with agePrache et al., 2020b; Prache, Dromedary Duck in fat content and PUFA with ageBa\u00e9za, Guillier & Petracci, 2021 SheepIncrease in carotenoid content in the fat tissue and PUFA and iron content with age of the lambPrache, Schreurs and Guillier, 2021 AlpacaHigher levels of omega-3 DHA), DPA and total PUFA content in alpacas at age of 18 months compared to older animals (about 10 percent more)Popova et al., 2021 PigIncrease in intramuscular fat with age (30 percent increase between 160 and 220 days) Decrease in omega-6 PUFA (linoleic acid) content (by 30 percent) in intramuscular fat with ageBosch et al., 2012 Notes: DHA = docosahexaenoic.

Livestock production systems differ substantially in terms of the climate and other geographical aspects of their loca- tion, management practices, feed and feeding systems, housing and animal welfare. The nutritional quality of the resulting TASF is mostly influenced by the diet of the animal. Livestock husbandry practices and other aspects of production systems affect safety, organoleptic and tech- nological food-quality attributes more than nutritional content, but some impacts on nutritional content have been reported. 5.2.1 Feed and feeding systems Whether livestock are fed with grass, forage, cereals or other concentrate feed affects the nutrient content and especially the fatty-acid and vitamin profile of their milk and meat. Table B12 summarizes examples of the findings of studies of the impact of differences in animal feeding and feeding systems on the nutritional quality of TASF. The impact of feed on organoleptic and technological quality is also discussed below. In general terms, grazing animals have lower milk yield (21 percent) and higher protein content (8 percent) in their milk than animals fed on a diet consisting of grass silage, maize silage and concentrates (O'Callaghan et al., 2018). Higher vitamin A and E contents have been documented in milk and meat from grass-fed ruminants (Ju\u00e1rez et al., 2021; Martin et al., 2004) and higher vitamin E contents in meat from free-range chickens (Ba\u00e9za, Guillier and Petracci, 2021). Precursors of vitamin E and vitamin A have been reported to be present at levels, respectively, up to four times and seven times higher in beef from pasture-fed systems than in beef from concentrate-fed systems (Duckett et al., 2009; Cabrera and Saadoun, 2014). A comparison of the milk of cows fed on a pasture-based diet to that of cows fed on a concentrate diet showed that the concentra- tion of the precursor of vitamin A was 50 percent higher in the former (Martin et al., 2004). No variation in the protein content of eggs and meat is reported in the literature. A high PUFA diet improves the content of beneficial fatty acids in milk and meat. Increasing the content of essen- tial fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids) while decreasing omega-6/omega-3 ratio benefits human health. This is of particular interest to researchers and to the processing industry. The omega-6/omega-3 ratio is more affected by the diet of the animals than by their genetic make-up. The PUFA/SFA ratio recommended for the human diet can be achieved in the intramuscular fat of most pig breeds by feeding the animals on an appropriate diet (De Smet, Raes and Demeyer, 2004). The impact of diet differs greatly between monogastrics and ruminants. The difference in the digestive systems of ruminants and monogastrics means that there are differences in the ways they digest and absorb fats (Ponnampalam, Sinclair and Holman, 2021). In monogastric animals, dietary fatty acids are directly absorbed without biochemical reactions in the stomach, and their composition is reflected in that of the meat. This is not the case in ruminants, as ruminal biohy- drogenation4 of fatty acids acid, a nutritionally benefi- cial fatty in the rumen. This is associ- ated with the ingestion of forages - a major part of the diet of ruminants. Monogastrics (including rabbits and horses) can convert alpha-linolenic acid into PUFA. However, the conversion rate is low. Certain bacterial reactions in mono - gastrics can further contribute to this synthesis: caecotro - phia in rabbits (reingestion of soft faeces issued from bacte - rial fermentation in caecum) has been shown to increase PUFA content in the meat (Lebas, 2007). Grazing and high omega-3-dense feed supplements (e.g. linseed) increase PUFA content in milk and meat and thus result in a more nutritionally beneficial fatty-acid profile for human consumption. These effects of grazing are partic - ularly marked when animals feed on leguminous pasture or on forages from diverse grasslands (Hampel et al., 2021; Louren\u00e7o et al., 2007; Albenzio et al., 2016). For example, Hampel et al. (2021) reported a more than 20 percent increase in PUFA content in meat from lambs fed on trop - ical legumes compared to meat from grass-fed lambs. Grasses are rich in alpha-linolenic acid, an essential fatty acid and precursor of omega-3 fatty acids, whereas cereal grains have higher levels of linoleic acid, a precursor of omega-6 fatty acids (Prache et al., 2021; Warren et al., 2008). Dietary linseed increases the level of alpha-linolenic acid in the meat of cattle, sheep, pigs, rabbits and chickens (Lebas, 2007; Wood and Enser, 2017), especially if fed in the form of oil rather than whole seeds (Albenzio et al., 2016). Nguyen et al. (2017) report that supplementing the diet of sheep with flaxseed increased the content of omega-3 fatty acid (by 18 percent), EPA (by 47 percent) and DPA (by 22 percent) 4 Biohydrogenation is a process that occurs in the rumen whereby bacteria convert unsaturated fatty acids into saturated fatty acids. This results in highly saturated fatty acids leaving the rumen and limits the PUFA content in tissues.55 Section B | Nutrient composition and value of terrestrial animal source foodin the kidneys and alpha-linolenic acid (two times higher) in the liver, with alpha-linolenic acid content in liver being almost three times higher than that in the muscles (Sterk et al., 2011; Van Le et al., 2019). Complementary feed and use of different local forages, such as hay from Khortane grass, dried olive leaves or hay from Stipa tenacissima grass, to supplement scarce pasture grazed by goats in Tunisia had a positive impact on the fatty acid profile (lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio; 30 percent variation) and the vitamin E content of the meat (3.71 mg/kg with olive-leaf supplementation, i.e. almost three times higher than an oat hay-based diet) (Ayeb et al., 2019). In Brazil, milk from dairy goats raised on semi-arid native pasture was found to have a better fatty-acid profile than milk from goats kept in a confined system: the native pasture comprised 71 different plant species, whereas the confined-feeding system was based on hay from Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) (FAO, 2021c; Neto et al., 2020; Sant'Ana et al., 2019). The feeding system also has an impact on the quality traits and fatty-acid profile of beef. In Uruguay, beef from animals finished on pastures was found to have a higher level of conjugated-linoleic acid (around two times higher) than that from animals finished in feed- lots, irrespective whether they were grown in a feedlot or on pasture (Ferrinho et al., 2019). The variety of grass or fodder fed can also affect the nutritional content of animal products, and silage supplementation in grazing cows produces variable responses in terms of milk composition: for example, feeding elephant grass and Leucaena silage resulted in higher concentration of fat and lower concen- tration of lactose in milk than feeding colosuana grass and king-grass morado (Roncallo, Sierra and Castro, 2012). The biological significance of increases in omega-3 content and conjugated linoleic acid content in TASFs for human health may be debatable given that the PUFA content of TASFs is rather low compared to that of vegetables. However, some clinical studies suggest a potential effect on the blood of consumers and on the regulation of the metabolism. For example, McAfee et al. (2011) found a higher concentration of omega-3 PUFA (20 higher omega-3 PUFA/total fatty acid ratio) in the blood of people whose diet included red meat (beef and lamb) derived from grass-fed animals than in the blood of those who ate meat from concentrate-fed animals. Another study (Legrand et al., 2010) found that the EPA and DHA proportions in the fatty acids in the red blood cells decreased significantly in a group that ate standard prod- ucts, whereas they were maintained in a group whose diet included a high level of omega-3 originating from linseed- fed animals. The conjugated linoleic acid and alpha-lino - lenic acid contents of sheep's milk are three to four times higher than those of cow's milk (Albenzio et al., 2016). Sofi et al. (2010) reported that consumption of conjugated linoleic acid-rich cheese (derived from pasture-fed sheep) rather than a commercially available cow's milk cheese was asso - ciated with significant reductions in inflammatory cytokines and platelet aggregation. Intake of 90 g per day of sheep's cheese rich in conjugated linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid (three times higher than the control cheese because the sheep's diet was supplemented with linseed) was found to result in significant increases in the plasma concentra- tions of conjugated linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid in consumers and to regulate lipid and energy metabolism (Albenzio et al., 2016; Pintus et al., 2013). In populations that do not consume significant quanti- ties of fish, meat can contribute meaningfully to omega-3 status, particularly when it comes from pasture-fed animals (Coates et al., 2008; Howe et al., 2006). Australian adults consume six times as much meat as fish and seafood. Howe et al. (2006) found that 43 percent of the average intake of omega-3 in the diet of the Australian population came from meat (equivalent to the contribution of fish products). These results can be linked to the livestock husbandry and feeding system in Australia, where most cattle are raised on pasture and grain-fed beef, including beef from systems in which a stage of the production takes place in a feedlot, represents 30 to 40 percent of total beef production (ALFA, 2022). Lenighan et al. (2020) found that consumption of grass-fed beef with a higher PUFA content (compared to grain-fed beef) had the potential to improve the quality of dietary fatty acid intake at the scale of the Irish popula- tion. Coates et al. (2008) showed that the consumption of omega-3-enriched pork can significantly increase omega-3 content in human blood cells. The consumption of animal products derived from animals fed on a linseed diet (asso - ciated with a 60 percent reduction in the omega-6/omega-3 ratio in meat and an 86 percent reduction in eggs) led to a more than twofold increase in omega-3 (alpha-linolenic acid) content in the fatty acids in human plasma (Weill et al., 2002). While TASF with higher PUFA content have a more benefi- cial fatty-acid profile, this can increase the risk of organo - leptic and technological defects caused by a higher level of lipid and protein oxidation. Lipid oxidation in meat induces an unpleasant taste and odour and is associated with a change in colour and with the potential formation of toxic compounds (Prache et al., 2020b). Spontaneous oxidized flavours develop when fats are oxidized in milk and meat. Protein and lipid oxidation leads to a reduction in digest - ibility and negatively affects bioavailability (Est\u00e9vez, 2011; Prache et al., 2020b). Feeding broilers on a diet high in 56 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesomega-3 increases its incorporation into the meat but may compromise meat quality as a result of the oxidation of lipids. The milk and meat of grass-fed animals are reported to have higher antioxidant activity and to contain larger amounts of phytochemicals than those from grain-fed animals (Van Vliet, Provenza and Kronberg, 2021). Adding antioxidants to feed, for example supplementing poultry feed with selenium, can decrease lipid and protein oxida- tion in meat (Ba\u00e9za, Guillier and Petracci, 2021). Vitamin E limits lipid and protein oxidation in meat products, and is used during processing. Because feed is the main variable cost in livestock produc - tion, new feed sources are frequently proposed and tested for safety and quality. For example, insect products are increasingly being used. Feeding insect larvae to laying hens, broiler chickens, quails and partridges has been reported to have some effects on the nutrient composi- tion (e.g. fat content) and organoleptic quality of meat, but the results of the limited number of studies that has been conducted are not consistent (Gasco et al., 2019). Laying hens fed black soldier fly larvae produced eggs with higher fat content in their yolks, while organoleptic quality did not change (Bejaei and Cheng, 2020; Tahamtani et al., 2021). Overall, the reported impact of insect larvae feed on TASF quality has been minimal. The use of algae and fish oil as feed ingredients has been found to increase omega 3, EPA and DHA content in meat from cattle, chickens and sheep, although high levels have been found to cause an unpleas - ant flavour (rancidity) and colour changes in the meat as a result of lipid oxidation Replacing human-edible feed crops with plant by-prod- ucts that cannot be eaten by humans helps to mitigate the environmental impacts of livestock production. A review by Salami et al. (2019) documents the environmental impacts and the impacts on the nutritional quality of meat of using a range of different plant by products as feed. Incorporating up to 30 percent distillers' grains with solubles (maize, wheat) or glycerine in the animals' diet has been asso - ciated with an increase in the PUFA content of beef and lamb (Salami et al., 2019). Citrus pulp in the diet of lambs does not affect performance or carcass or meat quality and limits rumen biohydrogenation of PUFAs and lipid and protein oxidation (Salami et al., 2019). Other extracts from fruits are of interest as sources of natural antioxidants in animal diets. By-products of potato can increase the PUFA content in subcutaneous fat by 19 percent (Pen et al., 2005). Dietary distillates from rosemary leaves increase PUFA content (by 12 percent) and those from thyme leaves decrease saturated fatty acid content (by 8 percent) in mutton (Nieto, 2013). However, flavour and acceptabil- ity need to be further assessed. A recent meta-analysis (Torres et al., 2022) reported that, in addition to mitigating greenhouse-gas emissions, feeding tannins to sheep led to their meat having a higher content of beneficial fatty acids (14 percent increase in omega-3). Using genetically modified crops as feed and feed ingre - dients has so far not been shown to affect the safety and quality attributes of TASFs. There has been public concern about the safety of food produced from animals fed with genetically modified crops. However, such concerns are not supported by current scientific evidence. Box B6 pres - ents the current state of knowledge on the impact of genet - ically modified feed on TASF quality. Box B6. Impact of genetically modified feed on public health About 70 to 90 percent of the genetically modified (GM) crops produced globally are used as feed for food-producing animals (Lucht, 2015). According to the European Food Safety Authority GMO Panel Working Group on Animal Feeding Trials, scientific literature on feeding trials with GM crops showed (as of 2008) no evidence of adverse impacts on animals, the nutritional quality of their products or human health (EFSA GMO Panel Working Group on Animal Feeding Trials, 2008). More recently, de Vos and Swanenburg (2018) reported that no scientific publi- cations had demonstrated adverse impacts on public health. FAO (2015a) reported no indication that intact GMO-related proteins or DNA would be transferred to food products of animal origin (fluids or tissue). Foods produced from animals fed on GM feed are not regulated as such, nor is it mandatory to label these food products as GM foods. However, some national regulations, for example those in France, Germany and the United States of America, cover the use of voluntary claims on food packaging that the animals used to produce the food have not been fed on GM feed.57 Section B | Nutrient composition and value of terrestrial animal source foodTable B12.

Climatic conditions, soil type, altitude and season all affect the chemical composition of plants and thus of animal feed and the nutritional-quality attributes of the resulting TASF. All these factors are determined by environmental condi- tions. Table B13 summarizes key examples of the influence of environmental conditions on the nutritional quality of TASF. Temperature and day length determine the growing season of plants and thus access to pasture and the quantity and quality of the forage available to grazing animals. Milk produced during the summer contains higher levels of vita- min D, lower levels of fat and higher levels of PUFA than milk produced at other times of year. Liu et al. (2013) found no impact of latitude on the vitamin D3 content of lean beef in Australia but found that fat from cattle raised at low lati- tudes contained higher concentrations of vitamin D3 than fat from cattle raised at high latitudes. The milk and meat of sheep, cattle and yaks raised on high altitude pastures have beneficial fatty-acid profiles (Cividini et al., 2019; Han et al., 2020). The diversity of rangelands and their specifici- ties in terms of soils, biodiversity and terrain allow pastoral- ists to take advantage of concentrations of nutritious plants (FAO, 2021c). Grazing on combinations of plants specific to particular geographical areas may improve the extraction of nutrients and affect the nutritional content of TASFs. Dromedaries kept by Raika pastoralists in northwestern India feed on 36 different plant species (FAO, 2021c). Environmental variables can also be important in produc - tion systems where feed is harvested rather than consumed directly by grazing animals. Forages should be harvested at the optimal time to ensure maximum quantity and quality Table B13.

The proportion of nutrients digestible by ruminants decreases with the age of the plants (Duarte et al., 2019). The concentration of the beneficial conjugated linoleic acid in cow's milk fat is increased by dietary intake of fresh pasture (Kelly et al., 1998). Climatic variations in tropical regions can greatly affect the quality of the grass and hence its nutritional contributions, including minerals (Huerta- Leidenz, 2021; Rubio Lozano et al., 2021). The fatty-acid profile is linked to the climatic zone and feeding system, particularly the combination of pasture management, grass maturity, grass diversity, season and altitude, which influ- ences the concentration of alpha-linolenic acid (precursor of long-chain omega-3) in the diet (Garcia et al., 2016). The selenium content of meat has been reported to be affected by the feeding system, the selenium content in the feed (grains and grass) and the environmental conditions (soil) (Cabrera and Saadoun, 204; Gupta and Gupta, 2000). 5.2.3 Housing conditions and other husbandry practices Husbandry practices encompass all the methods and measures used by the producer to manage animals up to the time of slaughter. They include feeding, housing, reproductive management, and health and welfare care. Production systems that include grazing or free-range feeding are generally associated with positive impacts on the nutritional contents of TASFs (Prache et al., 2020a). Housing conditions have been shown to affect the fatty-acid profile and the protein and vitamin content of meat. Pigs raised outdoors have been found to have a lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 PUFA than pigs raised indoors on the same diet (Dost\u00e1lov\u00e1 et al., 2020). The decreased ambient temperature associated with outdoor access was assumed to explain the higher MUFA content of the meat. Ducks raised in irrigated rice fields in China have been found to have higher carcass weight, with higher intramuscular fat, lower protein content and higher concentration of some essential amino acids (valine, methionine, phenylalanine, histidine and argi- nine) and PUFAs (omega-6 and omega-3), than ducks raised in floor pens (Huo et al., 2021). Sokoowicz, Krawczyk and Dykiel (2018) report that outdoor access was found to have a beneficial effect on the vitamin A content, the propor - tions of PUFAs and omega-3 fatty acids and the omega-6/ omega-3 ratio in egg yolk. A systematic review by Pires et al. (2021) highlights conflicting results related to the level of impact of housing system (caged versus free-range) on egg quality, especially egg weight, the most studied qual- ity indicator. As vitamin D is synthesized when animals are exposed to sunlight, housing and indoor rearing decrease the vitamin D content of cow's milk (Weir et al., 2017).Organic production is increasing in the livestock sector. There are no international common standards of organic production, which hampers comparisons of such produc - tion systems and assessments of their effects on the nutritional quality of TASFs. Results differ among studies because of differences in husbandry practices and combi- nations of factors such as diet, housing and the breed and age of the animals. Nevertheless, attempts have been made to study the impact of organic production systems on the nutritional quality of TASFs. Two meta-analyses reported that certain organic meats (beef, lamb and pork) and cow milk have healthier fatty-acid profiles than their non-organic equivalents (higher concentration of PUFA in meat and milk, higher conjugated linoleic acid and vitamin E concentrations in milk) (rednicka-Tober et al., 2016a, 2016b). These results may be closely linked to the pasture access and the grazing and forage-based diets prescribed under organic production standards (rednicka-Tober et al., 2016a). As an illustration, Benbrook et al. (2013) reported a 2.5 times higher omega-6/omega-3 ratio in conventional milk than in organic milk. The production system and, in particular, housing, affect animal welfare, which in turn affects the quality of TASFs. Free-range rearing and pasture-based systems have been shown to improve poultry and cattle welfare (Arnott, Ferris and O'Connell, 2017; Yilmaz Dikmen et al., 2016). Stress factors before slaughtering such as thermal stress, lack of food and water, and transportation over long distances, impair animal welfare and TASF quality, especially tech- nological aspects, as further described in Table B14. Heat stress is already a major challenge for livestock produc - tion and animal welfare, a challenge that may become even more serious in the future given global warming and forecasted increases in demand for TASFs in Asia and Africa. Elevated body temperature before slaughter is more frequent in cattle finished on grain than in grass-fed cattle and is associated with high rigour temperature and tougher meat. Stressors associated with poor animal welfare can lead to pale soft exudative (PSE) and dark firm dry (DFD) meat (Alcalde et al., 2017; Carrasco-Garc\u00eda et al., 2020). DFD meat is dark in colour, tough and has reduced shelf- life. PSE is light in colour, has poor quality and low water retention, and is hard after cooking. Both types of meat are generally rejected by consumers. Box B7 provides further information on the physiological and metabolic reactions caused by stress and their negative effects on TASF quality. Studies in Brazil have found around 5 percent of bovine carcasses (Rosa et al., 2016) and 19 percent of pig carcasses (Trevisan and Brum, 2020) to have DFD meat. Higher temperatures are more likely to produce PSE meat, whereas 61 Section B | Nutrient composition and value of terrestrial animal source foodBox B7. Physiological and metabolic reactions resulting in stress and negative impacts of terrestrial animal source food Physiological and metabolic reactions to stress have been described in the literature. For example, Terlouw et al. (2021) summarized the main effects of stress on the qual- ity of TASFs, and Gonzalez-Rivas et al. (2020) reviewed the effects of heat stress on meat quality. Heat stress induces physiological reactions including faster heart rates, high- er catecholamine (neurotransmitters) levels and high- er metabolic stress, with accelerating muscle glygoge- nolysis (production of glucose from glycogen stored in muscle) and ultimately high pH in muscles. The extent of the (physiological) pH decline in meat after slaughter depends on the amount of glycogen stored in the muscle before slaughter. Preslaughter stress can have two types of effect: 1. Muscle metabolism continues after death and can be higher if the animal is under acute stress right before slaughter, leading to rapid depletion of glyco - gen stores and rapid post-mortem pH decline. In this case, the muscle temperature is still high and, when associated with rapid post-mortem pH decline, this can lead to pale soft exudative (PSE) meat (Gonzalez- Rivas et al., 2020; Terlouw et al., 2021). PSE is more frequently observed in pig and poultry meat than in meat from other animals. 2. A low quantity of glycogen in the muscle at slaugh- ter can lead to high ultimate pH and poor meat quali- ty in the form of increased toughness or \"high rigour temperature\" in carcasses (Gonzalez-Rivas et al., 2020; Terlouw et al., 2021; Warner et al., 2014). In ruminants and pigs, the most likely effect of chronic heat stress is to trigger dark firm dry meat as a result of lower glycogen reserves in the muscles, lower produc- tion of lactic acid and higher ultimate pH (Gonzalez- Rivas et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). In poultry, chron- ic heat stress reduces feed intake and changes the chemical composition of breast meat, increasing fat, especially intramuscular fat, deposition and reducing protein content (Gonzalez-Rivas et al., 2020). Chronic stress factors also jeopardize the capacity of animals to deal with acute stress during preslaughter handling and transport. Heat shock proteins (HSP) in ruminants and pigs play a role in muscle tenderness, juiciness and flavour. Heat stress is associated with an increase of HSP expression, which contributes to cellular protection and preven- tion of protein degradation. Down-regulation of HSP expression is associated with muscle tenderness, where- as up-regulation can lead to tough meat (Gonzalez-Rivas et al., 2020). Archana et al. (2018) report that the low expression of the HSP70 gene in the Indian indigenous Salem Black goat reflects the breed's better adaption to high ambient temperatures than the Osmanabadi, anoth- er Indian indigenous goat breed (Archana et al., 2018). However, no impact of heat stress on the protein and fat content of the meat of the two breeds was reported. Egg weight decreases as the ambient temperature increas- es above 25 \u00b0C, and this is associated with a decline in albumen weight and a delayed decrease in yolk weight. This lower average egg weight is partly explained by reduced protein and energy intake during thermal stress (Renaudeau et al., 2012). The glycogen store in muscles is affected by physical activity and physiological stress, such as that caused by food deprivation (Gonzalez-Rivas et al., 2020; Terlouw et al., 2021). Heat stress also induces oxidative stress, which leads to protein and lipid oxida - tion and to shorter shelf-life. Lipid oxidation leads to off-flavour and decreases nutritional value. Protein oxida - tion can modify the digestibility of proteins and decrease the bioavailability of amino acids (Zhang, Xiao and Ahn, 2013). Heat stress also leads to a decrease in milk yield in cattle and decreases the protein and fat content of milk (Gorniak et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2019). colder temperatures are more likely to produce DFD meat in chickens and turkeys (Leishman et al., 2021). A meta-anal- ysis conducted by Leishman et al. (2021) documented the relation betweeen heat stress and poultry-meat quality and noted that it may reach a level sufficient to have an impact if production conditions are extreme, such as those that may occur during transportation, heat waves or peri- ods when apparent temperature is high (e.g. when there is a combination of high air temperature, low air velocity, high humidity and high stocking density). 5.2.4 Husbandry practices and food safety In addition to nutrient composition, husbandry practices can also affect the safety of TASF. Although public health and food safety are addressed in Section D, some specific aspects of husbandry and food safety are described in this subsection.To reduce the risk that TASF will contain food-borne contaminants, it is essential to ensure that safe animal husbandry practices are implemented as every stage in the production process up until slaughter, including in the case of home slaughtering (FAO, 2021a). Relevant actions include improving biosecurity measures, traceability, feed safety, disease prevention and control, and animal welfare. The type of hazard and the associated level of risk depend on the type of TASF, the type of production system and the animal management practices and strategies deployed. Free-range and confined systems and small- and large- scale systems will not trigger the same levels of risk, and practices implemented to address food safety along the food chain need to be adapted to the respective system. Risk assessment based on Codex Alimentarius guidance enables the predominant risk factors for a given type of 62 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesTable B14. Factors affecting animal welfare and the quality and safety of terrestrial animal source food Factor Food product Heat stressAcute heat stress before slaughter leads to PSE meat in poultry and pigs Chronic heat stress is more likely to cause DFD meat in ruminants and pigs Chronic heat stress reduces feed intake and changes the chemical composition of breast meat in chickens (increased fat, especially intramuscular-fat, deposition, lower protein content) (Gonzalez-Rivas et al., 2020) Chronic stress factors jeopardize the capacity of animals to deal with acute stress during preslaughter handling and transport Egg weight decreases when ambient temperature increases above 25 \u00b0C (associated with a decline in albumen weight and in yolk weight) Fasting/food deprivationFasting and food deprivation increase the risk of DFD meat in pigs (Gonzalez-Rivas et al., 2020) Higher incidence of DFD meat reported during summer in ruminants - related to limited pasture quality and reduced feed intake under high temperature (Gonzalez- Rivas et al., 2020; Kadim et al., 2004) Sheep breeds in temperate climate more likely to withstand reduced feed (and hence nutrient) intake than sheep in tropical arid and semi-arid areas with water scarcity. Impact of water scarcity on meat quality, especially fatty-acid profile, needs further research (Chikwanha et al., 2021) Rearing and preslaughter conditions - mixing animalsMixing pigs with unfamiliar individuals during the preslaughter period affects their behaviour, and rearing conditions influence their behavioural reactivity to mixing: mixing outdoor-reared pigs with other animals before slaughter resulted in less fighting and thus less stress in the slaughterhouse, fewer injuries and a lower risk of DFD and PSE meat (higher glycolytic potential) than observed in indoor-reared pigs subject to the same mixing procedure (Terlouw et al., 2015; Terlouw et al.) DensityHigh stocking density can lead to behavioural stress (e.g. pecking in poultry or cannibalism in pigs), affecting their productivity but also the quality of their meat High stocking density increases occurrence of Salmonella in laying hens (Koutsoumanis et al., 2019) Higher stocking density is considered to be a stress factor in laying hens (Kang et al., 2018) No impact of stocking density on the nutrient content of eggs has been reported Higher stocking density leads to lower feed intake, a lower egg production rate and higher mortality (Geng et al., 2020) TransportPoor roads are associated with higher incidence of DFD in lamb and cattle meat when animals have been transported for several hours (Terlouw et al., 2015, 2021) Transportation in high ambient temperature can generate major physiological and muscle metabolic stress in goats (Kadim et al., 2010) Restraining methodUse of electric prods is documented as being associated with higher incidence of PSE and blood-splashed meat in pigs (Faucitano, 2018) and lower meat tenderness in cattle (Warner et al., 2007) Individual reactionIndividual reaction to stress varies with species, experience and genetics, even if animals are slaughtered under the same conditions The complexity of the biological response and individual adaptation is not sufficiently well understood to allow prediction of meat quality, and additional factors, such as preslaughter stress conditions, need to be taken into account in predicting models (Terlouw et al., 2021) Note: DFD = dark firm dry. PSE = pale soft exudative.63 Section B | Nutrient composition and value of terrestrial animal source foodTASF to be identified (see Section D). Feed and water are potentially significant sources of contamination in the production system, and interventions to reduce the risk associated with them are critical (FAO and IFIF, 2020). The OIE/FAO guide to good farming practices for animal produc - tion food safety (FAO and OIE, 2010) recommends a set of practices that can be implemented to reduce the risk of TASF contamination and food-borne diseases. Guidelines are also available to help small-scale producers minimize food-safety risks (FAO, 2021a). The case of Salmonella spp. can serve to illustrate how livestock production affects the safety of TASF and human health. Non-typhoidal Salmonella is one of the top food- borne pathogens globally (see Section D). Guidelines on how to control this pathogen have been published (FAO and WHO, 2016), but risk factors and levels of occurrence in livestock production systems in LMICs are not sufficiently documented. In as far as risk factors have been identified (largely in high-income countries), they include inadequate farm management, biosecurity (including pest and rodent management), staff hygiene and carcass handling along production chains (Wilke, Windhorst and Grabkowsky, 2011). For instance, the risk factors for Salmonella contamination along the smallholder pig value chain in northern Viet Nam include situating the pig pen next to human housing, allowing visitors unrestricted access to the farm, locating the slaugh- ter area next to the lairage without biosecurity measures, and failing to take adequate measures to prevent cross-con- tamination at the slaughterhouse (Dang-Xuan et al., 2019). High stocking density, large farm size and stress increase the occurrence, persistence and spread of Salmonella in flocks of laying hens (Koutsoumanis et al., 2019). Environmental contamination of TASF with heavy metals is closely linked to the feeding system and the feed resources used. Industrial effluents and agrochemicals can affect feed and feed ingredients and the water sources used for livestock production. Further data are needed to assess the level of heavy-metal contamination and toxicologi- cal safety in TASFs, for example in the Islamic Republic of Iran (Sarlak et al., 2021), and Nigeria where there is a lack of official monitoring (Njoga et al., 2021). The level of soil contamination can have an impact on TASF. For example, a study that compared egg production systems found that eggs produced by free-range hens had higher concentra- tions of heavy metals than those from cage-raised hens (Radu-Rusu et al., 2013). The misuse of veterinary products and the contamina- tion of TASFs with the residues of these products can also give rise to public health risks. The misuse and overuse of antimicrobials, especially antibiotics, and the resulting increase in antimicrobial resistance is a growing concern. Antimicrobials are used in animal production for thera- peutic, metaphylactic and prophylactic purposes, and as growth promotors (see Section D). They can be adminis - tered through feed and water as a practical method of delivering drugs to a large numbers of animals on a daily basis (FAO and WHO, 2019a). Use of antimicrobials is affected by legal frameworks. For instance, the European Union has banned the use of antimi- crobials as growth promotors since 2006 and forbids routine use of antimicrobials and their use to compensate for poor hygiene, animal husbandry, animal care or farm manage - ment; their use for prophylaxis is also forbidden other than in exceptional cases, such as administration to an individual animal or a restricted number of animals when the risk of infection is very high and the consequences are likely to be severe (European Parliament and Council, 2019). Sri Lanka and the Maldives have prohibited the use of all antibiotics as growth promoters and in medicated feed (Goutard et al., 2017). Several other countries are increasingly implementing strategies to reduce antimicrobial use, reporting veterinary antimicrobial sales or introducing specific regulations to address the issue (Tiseo et al., 2020). Importing countries are becoming more likely to require maximum residue limits. Some international standards on veterinary products used in medicated feed are set out in Codex Alimentarius guide - lines on the design and implementation of national regula- tory food-safety assurance programmes associated with the use of veterinary products in food-producing animals (FAO and WHO, 2014). Worldwide, antimicrobial use has increased with the expan- sion of high external input livestock production, and this has put bacteria under high selection pressure (Van Boeckel et al., 2014). The increase in antimicrobial use over the period between 2017 and 2030 is predicted to be greater in pig production than in chicken or cattle production, with pig production expected to account for 45 percent of the total projected increase over this period (Tiseo et al., 2020). Inappropriate use of antimicrobials as growth promotors or to prevent diseases in healthy animals, as well as over - prescription and overuse in animal production, has acceler - ated the upward trend (WHO, 2017), and this has increased human health risks associated with the development of anti- biotic-resistant bacterial strains. However, significant reduc - tion in the use of antimicrobials has been achieved in certain regions of the world over the last ten years (OIE, 2021). Transfer of resistance genes to pathogenic bacteria or commensal bacteria can occur and may lead to these genes 64 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesbeing harboured in the human microbiome for an extended period of time. Food-borne diseases caused by resistant bacterial pathogens may be difficult to treat because antimic - robial treatment options are absent or limited. Antimicrobial resistant micro-organisms can be spread to humans via direct exposure to infected or contaminated animals or via feed, food, animal waste, animal bedding or the environment. 5.3 Drivers of production practices that influence the nutritional quality of terrestrial animal source food Over recent decades, breeding and husbandry practices have been driven by commercial objectives that have gener - ally not specifically considered the nutritional value of TASFs. Priority is essentially given to the commercial-quality attri- butes that constitute the primary basis upon which produc - ers are paid, especially in the case of standard commodity TASFs (Prache et al., 2020a). Technological requirements related to the need to meet processing protocols (e.g. for cheese production) and to standardize production to reduce costs may influence genetic selection programmes and influence the characteristics of livestock production systems. Synergies and antagonisms between the various aspects of quality (nutritional, technological, organoleptic and commercial) and food safety may favour or compromise nutritional quality. 5.3.1 Drivers of genetic selection In a recent review, Prache et al. (2021) underlined the priority historically given to commercial qualities in genetic selection (milk and carcass yield and egg production rate). Genetic selection, gene editing and genomic biomarkers usually target productivity, health and longevity, quality attributes, heat tolerance, removal of technological quality defects and elimination of allergens (Van Eenennaam, 2019) (Prache et al., 2021). Markets have generally emphasized payment for quantity of product rather than nutritional composition, and so the latter has historically not been considered in genetic selection programmes. When a trait is not considered in selection programmes, the expectation is that it will remain constant over time unless it is genetically correlated with traits targeted for selection. However, if such a trait has an unfavourable genetic relationship with the traits for which selection is implemented, it will decline over time. In broiler chickens, genetic selection for high growth rate and breast- meat yield has been associated with lower meat quality and the emergence of constraints to processing. For example, \"white striping\" and \"wooden breast\" - defects associated with a lower protein content in the muscles and higher collagen content in broiler meat - have become more prev- alent in populations selected for increased growth rate. In various livestock species, commercial drivers that have led to genetic selection in favour of higher lean-meat yield and lower fat deposition have led to lower meat tenderness. The halothane gene in pigs is associated with porcine stress syndrome (PSS), i.e. sudden death of pigs placed under stressful conditions before slaughter, including those asso - ciated with transport. Animals affected by a mutation of this gene also tend more frequently to develop PSE meat (a major technological defect described above). The variance of the halothane gene with respect to PSS incidence is also favour - ably associated genetically with growth rate and production of lean meat. Genetic selection programmes for different breeds and populations have therefore targeted removal or retention of the allele depending on the their objectives, which have included the commercial value (carcass lean- meat content) and the technological quality of the meat, and on the genetic background of the population under - going selection. Data from South African slaughterhouses showed that 96 percent of the pigs slaughtered did not carry the mutation (Soma, Marle-K\u00f6ster and Frylinck, 2014). This indicated that the halothane gene was having little effect on the occurrence of PSE meat in the country. Efforts to curtail PSE occurrence therefore focused on other husbandry prac - tices, such as those that decrease stress (Soma, Marle-K\u00f6ster and Frylinck, 2014). Quality attributes are strong drivers of some research and genetic-selection programmes. For example, proteomic stud- ies have been conducted to identify proteins associated with the occurrence of DFD meat following preslaughter stress in ruminants (Chikwanha et al., 2021). Recent interest in the nutritional value of TASFs has led to the inclusion of herita- ble traits affecting nutrient composition in genetic selection programmes. Beta-casein milk protein has two variants: A1 and A2. The A2 variant has been associated with higher milk digestibility than the A1 variant, but current outcomes related to cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are inconclusive (Kuellenberg de Gaudry et al., 2021). This has led to a genetic selection programme in Australia, New Zealand and the United Stated of America that aims to breed animals whose milk contains a higher proportion of variant A2. To reduce allergic reaction triggered by the beta-lactoglobulin protein in milk, gene-editing has been used to prevent the expression of the protein (knockout) and produce hypoallergenic milk (Sun et al., 2019). Debate is still ongoing as to whether this novel technique for producing transgenic animals falls under GMO regulations and is therefore subject to premarket safety assessment (see Box B8).65 Section B | Nutrient composition and value of terrestrial animal source foodBoar taint, which gives meat from male pigs an unpleasant odour and taste, is genetically controlled. Therefore selec - tive breeding to reduce boar taint through genetic markers is ongoing in several countries. This approach is considered to be a more animal-welfare friendly alternative to castration. 5.3.2 Drivers of livestock practices The standardization of milk (fat content) and meat produc - tion (through weight and age of slaughtering) helps to stan- dardize the nutrient content of TASFs that are traded and marketed (Huerta-Leidenz, 2021). This standardization is key to lowering production costs, improving compliance with slaughterhouse equipment (e.g. size and pace of slaugh- ter lines) and processing-industry requirements (e.g. ther - mal treatment and preservation), and ultimately lowering consumer prices. The commercial attributes of meat are mainly defined by the carcass grade classification, which determines the payment to the producer. The South African classification targets lean carcasses, and this has increased the emphasis given to this goal in beef breeding and management systems (Hall and Box B8. Effects of genetically modified animals on human nutrition and health Based on the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, WHO has defined genetically modified organisms (GMOs) as organ- isms in which the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally, in order to induce or remove a trait. Regulatory framework and risk assessment policy The Codex Alimentarius Commission provides interna - tionally harmonized guidance on risk analysis of the safe- ty and nutritional aspects of foods derived from modern biotechnology (FAO and WHO, 2011). A premarket safety assessment should be undertaken on a case-by-case basis and include a comparison between the food derived from modern biotechnology and its conventional counterpart, including extensive comparative studies covering chemi- cal composition, nutritional quality, toxicity and the aller - genicity of proteins. Safety assessment should include data and information that can be used to reduce the possibili- ty that the food in question will have unexpected, adverse effects on human health. Careful monitoring of the post-re- lease effects of such products and processes is also essen- tial if continued safety for humans, animals and the envi- ronment is to be ensured. Responsibility for formulating policies and making deci- sions on genetically modified (GM) food lies with nation- al competent authorities. When requested, FAO provides, advice and technical assistance to strengthen Members' capacities in the field of agricultural biotechnology at national and regional levels. The GM products that are currently on the international market have all passed safe- ty assessments conducted by national authorities. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has established safety assessment processes based on the principle of \"substantial equivalence\" to ensure that foods derived from GM crops are as safe and nutritious as those from plants obtained through conventional breeding. Genetically modified animals for human con- sumption In 2015, the AquAdvantage\u00ae salmon was cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration and became the world's first GM animal authorized for human consumption. The fish grows to market-size in 18 months instead of the usual 36 months. In June 2021, the company announced the first commercial-scale harvest at its farm in Indiana. The AquAdvantage\u00ae salmon was approved for sale by Health Canada in 2015, and the company has announced that its application to Brazil's National Biosafety Technical Commission to sell it in Brazil has been approved. Labelling requirements for GMOs differ from one coun- try to another. There is no mandatory labelling require- ment specific to GMOs in Canada. GMO labelling regula - tory requirements came into force in the United States of America in January 2021 but do not apply to restaurants or other parts of the catering industry. In 2020, the Galsafe\u00ae pig became the first terrestrial GM animal authorized for human consumption. The pig lacks the alpha-gal sugar protein, which can trigger allergic reac- tions in people with alpha-gal syndrome, an allergy to red meat. GalSafe\u00ae animals can also be used to produce medi- cines such as heparin and to solve the problem of rejection of organ transplants. The Food and Drug Administration concluded that the safety of food products originating from GalSafe\u00ae pigs is no different from that of food products orig- inating from non-GM pigs. These conclusions were based on toxicological and microbial food-safety evaluations. No nutritional content variation was reported. No testing was conducted on people suffering from alpha-gal syndrome. Potential for the development of antimicrobial resistant bacteria was considered, and ongoing surveillance to moni- tor for the development of resistance to aminoglycoside is required, in line with Codex Alimentarius Commission guidance (FAO and WHO, 2008). Research interest in GM animals is supported by the private sector and focuses particularly on disease-resis- tant animals, faster-growing animals and animals that have therapeutic uses. Debate is ongoing as to whether organisms obtained by using precise gene-editing biotechnologies should be considered GMOs and thus be covered by GMO regula - tions and subject to premarket safety assessment if they are going to be released for human consumption. The European Union and New Zealand argue that products originating from genome-edited organisms should be subject to the same regulations as GMOs (Callaway, 2018; Fritsche et al., 2018), whereas Canada and the United States of America are taking a different approach (Canada, 2020; FDA, 2020). Canada considers that food products should be regulated on the basis of their final characteristics rather than the method used to develop them.66 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesSch\u00f6nfeldt, 2015). A downward trend in the fat and satu- rated fatty-acid content of beef has also been documented in the United States of America, where it is in line with national dietary guidance that has been in place since the 1980s (McNeill et al., 2012), and in the European Union. A similar trend has been observed pigs and sheep (Prache et al., 2020b). Meeting commercial requirements for heavier and leaner carcasses has triggered technological and organoleptic side-effects in poultry and pig production. The reduction in fat content and intramuscular fat brought about by genetic selection and optimization of feeding (e.g. in Pietrain pigs), reduces the flavour and juiciness of cooked meats as well as the suitability of meat for processing (De Smet, 2012). A higher level of PUFA in TASFs can lead to higher levels of lipid and protein oxidation and hence reduce the organ- oleptic and technological quality (see Subsection 5.2.1). Giving pigs feed that contains high levels of PUFA can lead to off-flavours linked to oxidation. It can also constrain techno - logical processes. For example, firm fat makes meat easier to cure, but higher PUFA content makes meat softer at a given temperature. However, adding antioxidants to a PUFA-rich diet can enhance the technological quality of meat while maintaining the human-health benefits of high PUFA levels. Chicken meat has been considered a lean alternative to red meat and a nutritional source of omega 3 DHA. Wang (2010) reports that genetic selection and production prac - tices targeting greater weight gain and higher productivity increased the fat content and decreased the omega-3 DHA content of broiler meat in the United Kingdom between 1870 and 2004. Confinement of animals indoors with ad libitum access to high-energy feed and the use of growth promoters are reported to have been contributing factors. In the early twenty-first century, the carcass of a chicken from an international strain contained up to three times more fat energy than protein energy (as compared to less fat energy than protein energy before 1950) (Wang, 2010). In France, genetic selection has led to a 12 percent increase in the leanness of pig carcasses since the 1970s (Bidanel et al., 2020). Nutritional quality and other characteristics related to perceived sustainability are increasingly demanded by consumers. This demand for quality and safety is associ- ated with rising incomes and needs to be considered as a driver of shifts in livestock production in all countries (Jabbar, Baker and Fadiga, 2010). For instance, the \"Bleu- Blanc-Coeur\" supply chain, which targets a niche market for cattle milk and meat containing a specific quantity of omega-3 PUFAs and requires that animal diets include a certain quantity of these PUFAs has been extended from France, where it was developed, to several other countries, including Brazil, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Province of China, and Tunisia. Quality can be marketed through certification (Huerta- Leidenz, 2021). Certification and branding often target organoleptic and/or nutritional quality linked to genetic make-up, animal management and geographical origin: for example, the Certified Angus Beef brand in the United States of America, the \"poulet bicyclette\" in Burkina Faso, the Cabrito de Tete goat in Mozambique, and Ternera de Navarra cattle and acorn-fed Iberico pig in Spain. In these cases, consumers' growing interest in, and demand for, food from particular production areas and types of produc - tion system are translated into market value, which in turn influences production practices. International trade opportunities can also lead the live - stock sector include factors such as specific weight, age of slaughter and specific genetics in export specifications in the value chain. Production systems are guided by the need to meet commercial standards and regulations. The commercial standards of importers may differ from the standards of the country of production. Marbling score in beef and pork is linked to meat palatability, an important factor in consumer preference, and is a key quality indica- tor for export. Required levels of marbling vary across the world (De Smet, 2012; Rubio Lozano et al., 2021; Delgado et al., 2005). Marbling score is associated with intramuscular fat deposition, which gives the meat its flavour and palata- bility. Subcutaneous fat, in contrast, has less commercial value. Marbling can be improved by adopting on-farm nutri- tional strategies such as supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid in the fattening stage of pig and cattle produc - tion to increase the deposition of intramuscular fat and decrease the deposition of subcutaneous fat (Li et al., 2020). Rules for export are also based on compliance with internat - ional (Codex Alimentarius and WOAH) regulations related to public health. The European Union has import require - ments regarding the water-protein ratio in meat cuts. These requirements tackle fraud associated with adding external water to the carcass to artificially increases its weight (Dias et al., 2020). The ratio varies from one country to another in line with national regulations. The maximum residue limits of veterinary products also vary between countries, imply- ing different levels of tolerance and monitoring of manage - ment practices on farms that produce for export.67 Section B | Nutrient composition and value of terrestrial animal source food6. Limitations, gaps and needs in the evidence-base The assessment of nutrient composition and value of TASFs reveals several limitations in the evidence-base. Generally, public-health nutrition has had a narrow focus on single nutrients rather than a more holistic focus on the food matrix and dietary patterns underlying TASF digestibility. As in other sections of this document, evidence from LMICs on nutrient composition of local TASFs is limited. Despite its potential implications for human health, the literature on food from hunting and wildlife farming and on insects, grubs and their products is limited. Gaps and needs in the evidence base include the following: $ Interactions of TASF nutrients and bioactive com- pounds in the food matrix and dietary patterns: Further characterization of the role of TASFs in human nutrition and health requires deeper understanding of the complex interplay of nutrients and foods within dietary patterns. More research is needed on underex - plored nutrients (e.g. vitamin K2) and bioactive com- pounds (e.g. carnitine, anserine) found in model- ling: Optimally describing TASFs in relation to environmen- tal impacts and issues of cost and access requires im- proved metrics for nutrient density and bioavailability. Modelling would then be able to provide robuster evi- dence on the roles of TASFs. $ Food composition databases: There is a need to develop more comprehensive and representative food composition databases that cap - ture information on TASFs from local breeds and spe - cies and on dietary patterns in LMICs. $ Insects including grubs and their products: Research is needed on the nutrient bioavailability and composition of insects and insect products. $ Influence of nutrient content and quality on animal characteristics and husbandry: Robust studies on variation in the quality of TASFs are limited in developing countries, where research and in- vestment efforts are more targeted towards increasing productivity. Reviews and publications tend to cover in- ternationally traded breeds. Further research is required on the impact of the diversity of local breeds, husband- ry practices, grazing practices and traditional husband- ry systems on TASF quality, including for the following species: dromedary and Bactrian camel, cattle, yak and llama. There is a lack of meta-analysis covering differ - ent production systems and husbandry practices. Fac - tors such a genetics, animal nutrition, season, housing conditions and other aspects of the production system need to be studied to identify their individual and com- bined effects on TASF quality. Nutritional quality indi- cators should be systematically considered and meas - ured along with organoleptic and technological quality indicators. Literature on the impact of livestock man- agement on the nutritional value of TASFs focuses on nutrient composition. Little is known about variation in the bioavailability of nutrients. Further research is need- ed to assess links between on-farm interventions, such as the choice of animal diets, and the nutritional quality of TASFs and resulting impacts on human health.68 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesReferences Abd El-Salam, M.H. & El-Shibiny, S. 2011.

Beef and eggs follow in terms of the availability of evidence. Pig and poultry meat, meat from wild animals, insects and meat from other minor species have been less studied. Overall, the evidence suggests that TASF intakes at appropriate levels have beneficial effects on several health outcomes. u Milk and dairy consumption during pregnancy promotes healthy weight of infants at birth and may also benefit birth length and foetal head circumference. The findings of studies on egg, milk and meat consumption in infants and young children have varied depending on overall diet and environmental exposures. Evidence shows that con- sumption of milk and dairy products by school-age children and adolescents increases height and reduces over - weight and obesity. Beef consumption in school-age children may improve cognitive outcomes. u In adults, there is evidence showing that milk and yoghurt consumption reduces risk of all-cause mortality, hy- pertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, obesity, osteoporosis and fractures. Evidence also shows that egg consumption in adults does not increase risk of stroke or coronary heart disease. High-quality evidence shows that meat intake (85-300 g/day) is positively associated with iron status in adults. Poultry meat has been studied to a limited extent relative to beef, but findings suggest non significant effects on stroke risk, with subgroup analyses suggesting a protective effect in women. u Unprocessed and processed red meat has been evaluated extensively for non-communicable disease outcomes in adults, largely through prospective cohort studies with risk of bias based on quality assessment of the evidence (e.g. GRADE). The Global Burden of Disease Study has set risk thresholds at 23 g (18-27 g) per day of red meat and 2 g (0-4 g) per day of processed meats. Evidence has shown unequivocally that the consumption of processed red meat increases risk of mortality and chronic disease outcomes (cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer). Evidence on consumption of unprocessed red meat in modest amounts shows that it presents minimal risk with regards to non-communicable disease outcomes (largely based on studies carried out in high-income countries). u Epidemiological evidence for the health effects of TASF in older adults comes primarily from high-income countries. A fairly robust evidence base shows that consumption of lean red meat has positive effects on muscle health. Other evidence suggests that milk and dairy products and other TASFs potentially have mitigating impacts on sarcopenia (muscle loss), fractures, frailty, Alzheimer's disease and dementia more broadly. u Evaluating evidence in any of the life-course phases may be difficult because of heterogeneity in study design with respect to comparator groups (counterfactuals including substitution or replacement foods), dosing and exposure (quantity of TASF intake), and context (high-income countries versus low- and middle-income countries). A prepon- derance of evidence, for adults particularly, has come from observational studies with moderate-to-serious risk of biases. u Cow's milk and poultry eggs are among the eight foods that pose allergenic risks to populations, and it is therefore mandatory in many countries to state their presence in foods as part of precautionary allergen labelling. However, there is no evidence that avoiding such foods during infancy can delay or prevent reactions. Lactose malabsorption is widespread but does not automatically lead to lactose intolerance, which also greatly varies in severity. u Findings from the policy review conducted for this study relate to the consumption of TASF in general. Next most common are those related to meat (in general), milk and dairy products, eggs and red meat (especially beef). There is significantly less coverage of offal, poultry and rabbit (as part of white meat), meat from wild animals, and insects. u Most recommendations on TASF consumption found by the policy review are linked to human micronutrient needs and non-communicable diseases - and target the entire population. Micronutrient-related recommendations tend to be more detailed than those related to non-communicable diseases, providing quantitative indications in terms of daily or weekly intake of TASFs. There are no specific recommendations on TASF consumption to address the risks associated with multiple forms of malnutrition (e.g. coexistence of micronutrient deficiency with overweight, obesity and NCDs). In total, 378 of the recommendations on TASF consumption follow a life-course approach - with 5 Life-course phases: women during pregnancy and lactation; infants and young children; school-age children and adolescents; adults and older adults.91 Section C | Effects of terrestrial animal source food on health and nutrition over the life coursespecific guidance targeting individual life phases, 325 of which are in food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) and thus in the most relevant type of policy document. Although the review identified a similar number of qualitative and quan- titative recommendations, those in the FBDGs of high- income countries were found to be most detailed. u Environmental sustainability considerations for TASF consumption were found to be included only in documents from eight upper middle income or high- income countries, with most of them providing qualitative recommenda- tions. Mentions of animal welfare were found only in the FBDGs of Denmark and Sweden, which include specific reference to animal welfare labels providing information to consumers. Summary This section presents a review of epidemiological evidence for the effects of TASF intakes on nutrition and health out - comes. Human biology and nutrient requirements vary across the phases of the life course, giving rise to differential needs and affecting the impacts of TASF consumption patterns. The review shows that there is also variation in the quality and quantity of scholarly work on different TASFs within each life-course phase. In sum, the evidence suggests that TASF intakes at appropriate levels have beneficial effects on several health outcomes and lead to non-significant increases in chronic diseases among apparently healthy individuals. This section commences with an analysis of evidence on the effects of TASF intake during pregnancy and lactation, examining nutrition and health outcomes for the mother, foetus and exclusively breastfed child. Despite being iden- tified as a critical period in the first 1 000 days of life, pregnancy and lactation have been understudied across the full range of TASFs. Literature provides consistent findings that consuming milk and dairy products results in healthier weight at birth and - to a lesser extent - increased birth length. There is some indication that milk consumption during the first trimester of pregnancy confers the greatest nutritional advantages, notably with regard to anthropometric outcomes in the offspring. Some evidence suggests that milk and dairy intakes have a possible effect on foetal head circumference. Infancy and early childhood have been studied more than other phases of the life course, in part because of the estab - lished body of literature indicating that nutrient needs are high this period and that malnutrition during this period has life-long consequences. The findings of studies on egg, milk and meat consumption in infants and young children have varied depending on overall diet and environmental exposures. Generally, results show positive or null effects on anthropometry and child development. School-age children and adolescents grow more slowly but still require TASF to support neurological development, bone health and reproductive health. Evidence again focuses on milk and dairy products and shows that daily consumption increases height and protects against adiposity and overweight and obe - sity. There is evidence that suggests that beef consumption has positive effects on cognitive outcomes in school-age children. Among adults, findings suggest that milk and dairy products, do not increase risks of all-cause mortality and some chronic diseases. The published literature indicates that egg consumption is not associated with increased risk of stroke or coronary heart disease. The quality of evidence regarding the effects of unprocessed and processed red meat intakes on negative human health outcomes remains low, with high degrees of heterogeneity and risk of bias. Based on the available evidence, risk analyses indicate that consuming modest amounts of unprocessed red meat (ranging from 9 g to 71 g per day) holds minimal risk with respect to NCDs. However, processed meat consumption does confer an elevated risk of mortality and NCDs, including cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer. Red-meat intake has been found to be positively associated with iron status in adults. Poultry and other white meats have been studied to a lesser extent for both positive and negative health outcomes. In older adults, epidemiological evidence for the health effects of TASF comes primarily from high-income countries and may be limited by the co-existence of medical conditions in this segment of the population (impacts of TASF on people affected by medical conditions are beyond the scope of this assessment). There is evidence indicating that consump - tion of lean red meat has positive effects on muscle health, but the evidence for red meat in general is equivocal. Other evidence suggests milk and dairy products can mitigate negative health outcomes including sarcopenia (muscle loss), fractures, frailty, Alzheimer's disease and dementia more broadly. Poultry and eggs have been studied to a lesser extent.92 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesA total of 123 food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs), from 95 countries, were reviewed. Out of the 850 recommenda- tions on TASF consumption provided in these guidelines, 695 recommendations were linked to micronutrient intake, followed by 145 recommendations for the prevention of diet-related non-communicable diseases. Environmental sustainability was mentioned nine times and included only in FBDGs published from 2015 onwards. Most of these recommendations target the general public, although many recommendations are provided for specific phases of the life course. In addition, a total of 79 non-communicable disease-related documents, from 51 countries, were reviewed. They provided 167 recommendations on TASF consumption, 154 of which were linked to the prevention of diet-related non-communicable diseases, with only ten recommendations related to micronutrient intake and three linked to envi- ronmental sustainability. The great majority of the recommendations from the non-communicable disease-related documents target the general public, with only a few targeting specific groups across the life course. A further 35 doc - uments, including food and agriculture legislation and nutrition policies and programmes, were reviewed and were found to include a total of 52 recommendations related to TASF consumption. These recommendations are mostly of a qualitative nature and targeted the generic public with reference to micronutrient intake. Most recommendations on TASF consumption are for TASFs in general, followed by recommendations on meat, milk and dairy products, eggs and red meat (especially beef). There is significantly less coverage of offal, poultry, rabbit, meat from wild animals, and insects. Most recommendations are linked to human micronutrient needs and non-commu- nicable diseases and target the entire population. Micronutrient-related recommendations tend to be more detailed than non-communicable disease-related recommendations, providing quantitative indications in terms of daily or weekly intakes of TASFs. Most recommendations do not consider the implications of consumption above or below any specific level of TASF, an important gap given the co-existence of micronutrient deficiencies with undernutrition, overweight, obesity and non-communicable diseases. In total, the review identified 378 recommendations that follow a life-course approach, 325 of which were found in the FBDGs. While the recommendations in the FBDGs of high income countries were found to be more detailed, overall there was a similar number of qualitative and quantitative recommendations. Environmental sustainability considerations were found only to be included in documents from eight upper middle and high- income countries and mostly related to qualitative recommendations. Animal welfare was found to be men- tioned only in the FBDGs of Denmark and Sweden, which included specific references to animal welfare labels to inform consumers.93 Section C | Effects of terrestrial animal source food on health and nutrition over the life course2. Concepts, definitions and methods One of the original frameworks for nutrition across the life course was published by ACC/SCN (2000) (see adapted as Figure C1). Despite multiple different iterations and adap - tations, the framework has largely endured in its original form. Figure C1 visually represents manifestations of mal nu- trition in each life-course phase, as defined in Box C1. This part of the assessment follows a similar framework, with some minor changes, but narrows the scope to examin ing the consequences of TASF consumption. Many causes of all forms of malnutrition share common determinants, including genetics, inadequate infant and young-child feeding, frequent infections during early child- hood, unhealthy diets, food insecurity, poor health status, inadequate health or care behaviours, and low physical activity. The double burden of malnutrition in an individual refers to the co-existence of undernutrition (e.g. micronu- trient deficiency or stunting) with overweight, obesity and/ or NCDs. The most common combination is micronutrient defi- ciency with overweight and obesity, which has impli- cations for NCDs. Figure C1 provides an overview of the health implications of both undernutrition and overweight or obesity for each life-course phase, and resulting impli- cations for child development, NCDs, and educational, mental and physical capacity. Section C partitions the life course into five phases based on nutritional requirements and largely aligned with the published literature. For infants and young child, the review considers TASF consumption during complementary feeding for both breastfed and non-breastfed children (6-23 months). For school-age children and adolescents, in some cases youth older than 18 years of age may be included if they were part of the sample in a study that was evaluated. Methods for this part of the assessment followed PRISMA guidelines for conducting systematic reviews (Page et al., 2021b, 2021a). PRISMA, which stands for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, is an evidence-based minimum set of items for reporting in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Findings are presented below in narrative form.1. Introduction This section provides an overview of evidence on the effects of TASF intake throughout the life course. Various physiolog- ical processes and environmental exposures drive human nutrient demands throughout life. Social determinants may influence these pathways and ultimately affect the health of an individual (this will be covered in Component Document 2). Section B summarizes evidence on the nutri- ent and bioactive-compound compositions of TASFs and their implications for human health, drawing from literature spanning from food chemistry to public-health nutrition. The section primarily highlights epidemiological evidence on the nutrition and health impacts of TASF intake by life- course phase. TASF-related allergies and policy recom- mendations on TASF consumption are also discussed. This approach takes into account factors across multiple levels, from the cells of the human body to society, and enables further insights into how TASFs affect human nutrition and health (Mahmudiono, Segalita and Rosenkranz, 2019). Box C1. Life course phases relevant for human health The term \"life course\" is applied here to encapsulate both biological and social determinants of health, as compared to \"life cycle\", which generally refers to the biological developmental phases of an organism, and \"lifespan\", which describes the period from concep - tion to death in temporal terms (Brown, 2019; Herman et al., 2014). The following life-course phases are distinguished: women during pregnancy and lactation, including the needs of the developing foetus and the exclu- sively breastfed child up to 6 months of age; infants and young children (below 5 years of age); school-age children and adolescents (5 to 18 years of age); adults (men and women in adulthood); older adults (above 65 years).94 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesADUL TS OLDER ADUL TSINFANTS/ YOUNG CHILDREN PREGNANT /LACTATING WOMEN ADOLESCENT S SCHOOL-AGE CHILDRENNEWBORNSFigure C1. Forms and consequences of malnutrition over the life course95 Section C | Effects of terrestrial animal source food on health and nutrition over the life courseUsing the Population Intervention/Exposure Comparator Outcome (PICO/PECO) framework, the inclusion criteria were as follows: $ Population - apparently healthy populations falling into the respective life-course phases defined above; apparently healthy refers to the absence of disease based on clinical signs and symptoms and function, normally assessed by routine laboratory methods and physical evaluation. Some studies reviewed included sample populations across multiple life- course phases; these findings were considered in vari- ous subsections, as appropriate. $ Intervention/exposure - consumption of TASFs and/ or their products at varying levels (more versus less; some versus none; one TASF type versus another TASF type). $ Comparator - usual diet (often used as control group); TASF intakes at lower PBF or other foods/diets. $ Outcome - nutrition and health outcomes were eval- uated, with some variation depending on life-course phase, on the basis of anthropometry and growth, biomarkers of nutrient and/or health status (e.g. haemoglobin concentration, nutrient biomarkers) infectious and chronic disease morbidities and diag- noses, indicators of food hypersensitivities and gies, all-cause and cause-specific mortality, and cogni- tion and other domains of neurological function and development. Box C2. Search terms by database used for Section B Search terms using Academic Search Complete via EBSCOHost (\"animal source food\" OR \"elderly\" \"nutrition) Search terms using PubMed (\"animal source food\" OR animal source food* OR \"animal OR \"breastfeeding\" OR \"lactation\" OR \"teenager\") AND (\"health\")No single question could be formulated using the PICO/ PECO because of the multiple populations, TASFs and outcomes examined. Studies conducted in the last five years were prioritized, but studies dating back to 2000 were also included. Exclusion criteria were the inverse of the inclusion criteria, with the following specifications. With regard to sample populations, studies examining TASF effects in immuno - compromised individuals and people requiring therapeu- tic diets, as well as medical case reports, were excluded. With regard to intervention/exposure, studies focused on aquatic food only were excluded, although in some stud- ies aquatic foods were part of the overall TASF category and described as such. Also excluded were studies exam- ining isolated TASF components, TASFs as ingredients in processed foods, and fortified TASF products. Some systematic reviews included findings on TASF supple - ments, but this section reports only on those related to TASFs. It should be noted, however, that some of these products are considered in Section E as part of the discus - sion of emerging topics. For Section C, the literature search and screening included peer-reviewed articles and grey literature and used a set of pre-defined search terms across multiple databases, including PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Google Scholar and various institutional websites (see Box C2). 96 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesThe articles, documents and reports were categorized by type: systematic reviews; other reviews; intervention trials; observational studies; and grey literature (see Box C3). Studies were assessed for eligibility, relevance and strength of evidence, drawing on the GRADE domains of risk of bias, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias for deci- sion-making on inclusion. In a subsequent phase, snow- ball sampling was used based on suggestions received from the assessment's scientific advisory committee and other collaborators, again applying the same inclusion criteria as described above.Box C3.

Experimental trial (or intervention trial): study of the effects of an intervention (e.g. risk factor, medical treatment, specific diet) on people who are assigned to different groups. People are randomly assigned to a group in randomized controlled trials. The control group receives no specific intervention or a placebo. Observational study: study of the effects of an interven- tion on people who were already exposed to the inter - vention before the study. A cohort study compares the effect of an intervention on a group of people with shared characteristics (a cohort) who have been exposed to the intervention with the effect on a group of people who have not been exposed. A case-control study compares people with an existing health issue to people without that issue. A cross-sectional study analyses numerous characteristics and variables at once (at a single point in time). Narrative review: analysis that describes the evidence on a topic but is not systematic and does not follow a specific method. Meta-analysis Systematic review Experimental trial -Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) Observational study -Cohort study (prospective/retrospective) -Case-control study -Cross sectional study The flow diagram presented in Figure C2 shows the results of this process. In total, 1 334 records were initially identi- fied. Round 1 yielded 107 studies for extraction of evidence after excluding duplicates and ineligible studies.

Life-course phases Results of the assessment of TASF effects on nutrition and health outcomes through the life course are described below and summarized in Table C1 and Annex Table C6, giving the following information: TASF; specific findings; sample size; country of study; study design (including number of embedded studies if a systematic review); and reference. For each phase of the life course, sections briefly highlight key requirements and biological processes ongoing in the respective life-course phase and the poten- tial role of TASF, followed by an overview of the epidemio - logical evidence for impacts on nutrition and health. Each section presents the most robust, high-quality evidence first, including systematic reviews and meta-analy- ses and experimental trials, followed by well-designed observational studies. Within these categories, to the extent possible given the availability of evidence, the outcomes are presented in the same sequence: nutri- tion (nutrient status, anthropometry); health (infectious and cognition (develop - ment, neuroprotection, neurological-disease prevention). Indicators commonly used to assess the nutritional status of children are defined in Box C4. Annex Tables C1 to C5 present the contribution of selected animal and plant food items to the recommended nutrient intake for vitamin A, vitamin B12, iron, zinc and calcium during specific life-course phases. Box C4. Indicators related to the development of children - before, at and after birth Indicators for the nutritional status of foetuses and infants before and at birth Intrauterine growth retardation: impaired growth and development of the foetus and/or its organs during gestation. Small-for-gestational age: newborn with a weight below the tenth percentile for the gestational age in comparison with average infant population of the same sex and gestational age. Large-for-gestational age: newborn with a weight above the ninetieth percentile for the gestational age in comparison with average infant population of the same sex and gestational age. Prematurity/preterm birth: neonates born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Low birthweight: weight at birth of below 2 500 g.Indicators for the nutritional status of children Height-for-age z-score: the height of a child in relation to the standardized average height of children of the same age and sex. When a child has low height for its age (< -2 standard deviations of the WHO Child Growth Standards), it is stunted. Weight-for-age z-score: the weight of a child in relation to the average weight of children of the same age and sex. When a child has low weight for its age (< -2 standard deviations from the median of the WHO Child Growth Standards), it is underweight. Weight-for-length/height z-score: the weight of a child in relation to the standardized average length/ height of children of the same age and sex. When a child has low weight for its length/height (< -2 stand- ard deviations of the WHO Child Growth Standards), it is wasted. Child overweight is weight-for-height greater than 2 standard deviations above WHO Child Growth Standards; obesity is weight-for-height greater than 3 standard deviations above the WHO Child Growth Standards.99 Section C | Effects of terrestrial animal source food on health and nutrition over the life courseTable C1.

Offspring growth and development depend not only on diet but also on a wide array of genetic and environmental factors (McDade et al., 2019). Malnutrition in this life-course phase can induce critical consequences for both mother and offspring. For the mother, issues may include compro - mised nutrient status, impaired bone health, metabolic perturbations and increased overweight and obesity (Black et al., 2013). For the foetus and infant, malnutrition during pregnancy may result in, inter alia, intrauterine growth restriction or small size for gestational age, large size for gestational age, low birth weight and height, pre-term birth and long-term health outcomes (Barker, 1997; Chia et al., 2019; Christian et al., 2015). Iron deficiencies, in particu- lar, are increasingly prevalent during pregnancies and can induce a range of complications for the mother and the foetus during gestation, with longer-term impacts on offspring mental health, brain development and cognition (Georgieff, 2020). In the lactation period, breastmilk composition, particularly levels of fatty acids and some vitamins, depends on mater - nal diet and body reserves (Bravi et al., 2016; Dror and Allen, 2018; Kovacs, 2016). Required maternal dietary intakes may increase further during breastfeeding as the dependent neonate and infant grows. Calcium and iron requirements, for example, are very high in both pregnancy and lactation (Black et al., 2013; Georgieff, 2020; Hacker, Fung and King, 2012; Kovacs, 2016). Evidence shows that women absorb these nutrients more efficiently during these periods, although their own skeletons may be resorbed to compen- sate for the high mineral needs of the offspring (Kovacs, 2016). Several other nutrients found to be bioavailable in TASF are also required at higher levels during pregnancy and lactation to sustain increases in blood plasma expan- sion, foetal growth and development, milk production and multiple other biological processes (Allen, 2013). Evidence from intervention studies on TASF consumption during pregnancy and lactation has largely focused on milk and dairy products. Two comprehensive systematic reviews were identified for milk and dairy products. Quality observational prospective cohort studies that underline findings from the systematic reviews were also identified.A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of milk and dairy products consumed during pregnancy on perinatal nutrition (anthropometry) outcomes (P\u00e9rez- Roncero et al., 2020) pooled data on 111-184 pregnant women identified from 14 studies and demonstrated that intake of higher quantities of milk and dairy products, as compared to lower quantities or none, was associated with increased birth weight (mean difference = 51.0 g, 95% CI: 24.7-77.3). The meta-analysis showed that higher milk and dairy intake had a positive effect on infant length (mean difference = 0.33 cm, 95% CI: 0.03-0.64). It was also that found higher milk and dairy intake reduced risk of small size for gestational age (odds ratio = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.56-0.84) and low birth weight (odds ratio = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.4-0.84) and increased risk of large size for gestational age (odds ratio = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02-1.21). Consuming higher quantities of milk and dairy products was found to have no effect on the standard ultrasound measures of the foetal size. Another systematic review examined both nutrition (anthro - pometry and breastmilk composition) and health (birth outcomes). Drawing evidence from 17 studies (three inter - vention, six prospective-cohort, three retrospective-cohort and two case-control studies), this study produced find- ings consistent with those of the review described above for a positive association between infant birth weight and length and milk intake during pregnancy (Ach\u00f3n et al., 2019). Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions regarding the effects of milk and dairy intakes during pregnancy on preterm birth and spontaneous abortion or on breastmilk composition during the lactation period. Observational studies, when appropriately designed, can also provide evidence for the impacts of TASF consumption during pregnancy and lactation. The Generation R Study and its follow-on Generation R Next in the Netherlands are prospective cohort studies running from the foetal period to young adulthood (Generation R, 2021). One analysis conducted as part of these studies assessed the association between first trimester milk consumption and foetal growth and neonatal complications (n=3405 mothers) (Heppe et al., 2011). Data from a semi-quantitative food-frequency ques - tionnaire showed that consuming three or more glasses of milk per day, compared to one or zero glasses of milk per day, was associated with greater foetal weight gain in the third trimester and an 88 g higher birth weight (95% CI: 39-135 g). Head circumference was also increased by 2.3 cm in the offspring of mothers drinking three or more glasses of milk compared to one or zero. No association was found for length. Another prospective cohort study examined the effects of milk consumption during pregnancy in Danish women on their offspring's nutrition (anthropometry) at 101 Section C | Effects of terrestrial animal source food on health and nutrition over the life coursebirth and health (IGF 1 levels, insulin levels) outcomes over approximately 20 years of follow-up (n=685) (Hrolfsdottir et al., 2013). The investigators found that maternal milk consumption greater than or equal to 150 ml/day at 30 weeks gestational age compared to less than 150 ml was associated with higher birth weight-for-age z-score When the offspring of mothers with higher milk consumption were followed up 20 years later, they showed higher height z-scores, higher levels of IGF-1 and higher insulin levels compared to the offspring of mothers consum- ing lower milk levels, but differences were not statistically significant. Other observational studies were identified to improve the population representativeness of the assessment. Pregnant women living in an urban area of South India were studied in a prospective cohort trial (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2018). The effects of dietary intakes of milk and dairy products on birth nutrition outcomes (anthropometry) were examined using a food-frequency questionnaire (n=2036). The study found that total milk and dairy-prod- uct intakes and percentage of protein from milk and dairy products in first trimester were positively associated with birth vitamin B12 intakes from milk products was also examined, but no association with birth weight was found. An observational study among pregnant Portuguese women (n=98) found a relationship between total dairy intakes in the first trimester and head circumference (beta=0.002, P=0.014) and placental weight (beta=0.333, P=0.012) was also some indi- cation that increased dairy intakes between the first and second trimesters were associated with lower maternal weight gain during pregnancy (beta=-0.007, P=0.020). In sum, randomized controlled trials have examined the effects of consuming milk and dairy products during preg- nancy and lactation to a greater extent than the effects of consuming other TASFs. Consistent findings show that milk intake has a positive effect on healthy birth weight, with some evidence suggesting greater effects if the interven- tion starts in the first trimester. Prospective cohort studies adjusting for multiple confounding factors have similarly shown positive association between milk consumption during pregnancy and healthy foetal-growth outcomes. However, there are limitations inherent in drawing conclu- sions from observational studies. Findings for ultrasound parameters are more equivocal but give some indication that TASF consumption affects head circumference.3.2 Infants and young children It is well established that infancy and early childhood are among the life-course phases most vulnerable to malnu- trition. This subsection covers TASF in the diets of children aged between six months and 59 months. Complementary feeding is defined as the period when an infant or young child, aged between six month and 23 months, contin- ues to breastfeed but requires other foods to meet daily requirements (WHO, 2021b). TASF may be particularly critical during this period as a source of bioavailable nutri- ents that can be more efficiently absorbed (Iannotti, 2018; Murphy and Allen, 2003). Infants have limited gastric capac - ity and therefore need to be fed frequently throughout the day with complementary foods that supply nutrients that can be absorbed efficiently to support rapid growth and neurological development (Bergman, 2013; Brown and Lutter, 2000). At this phase in the life course, immunity is also transitioning from the passive immunity conferred by the mother through pregnancy and lactation to an independent, maturing system in the child. Zinc, which is found concentrated in TASF, is an example of a nutrient that is critically important for the development of adaptive immunity, in particular (Ackland and Michalczyk, 2016). As described in Section B, certain nutrients and bioactive compounds provided only by TASF or that are more biolog- ically active in TASF than in PBF are critical for growth and development during infancy and early childhood. Vitamin B12 supports neurological development, among many other processes, and can only be obtained through food by consuming TASF (Allen et al., 2018). Zinc and iron deficien- cies are highly prevalent in young children, leading to stunt - ing, diarrhoeal morbidities and mortality, and compromised cognition, language and socio-emotional development (Black et al., 2017, 2013). During the complementary-feed- ing period, the non-breastfed infant may be especially vulnerable to nutrient deficiencies and therefore require nutrient-dense foods, such as TASFs, after six months of age (WHO, 2005). At the other end of the nutrition spectrum, excessive TASF consumption during early childhood may heighten the risk of child and adult overweight and obesity (Lind et al., 2017). Overweight and obesity, acting through multiple mechanisms, are risk factors for NCD outcomes, including cancer (De Pergola and Silvestris, 2013). This subsection reviews the epidemiological evidence, across multiple contexts, for the effects of TASF on nutrition and health outcomes in infants and young children. A series of systematic reviews have examined the effects of TASF on nutrition outcomes (anthropometry) in young 102 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomeschildren. It should be noted that the reviews encompass a range of TASFs and different kinds of comparator groups (usual diet, fortified foods, etc.). One review examined the literature on the effect of TASF on growth and development outcomes among children aged between six months and 59 months (Eaton et al., 2019). The authors identified six trials (n=3 036 children) from China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, Guatemala, Pakistan, the United States of America and Zambia. Three studies showed a signifi- cant increase in the change in the height for age z-score or length for age z-score in the intervention group compared to the control. In addition, three studies reported that TASF consumption was associated with significant increases in the change in the weight-for age z-score. All-cause morbid- ities were assessed, and one study that tested the effect of yoghurt consumption reported a significant reduction in the duration and incidence of diarrhoea and upper-res - piratory infections. One randomized controlled trial exam- ining egg consumption during complementary feeding reported an increase in diarrhoea morbidity compared to the control. The review also reported findings from a study examining meat- and dairy-based diets that indicated a significant increase in length for age z-score for meat but not for dairy, and non-significant findings for weight for age z-score (Eaton et al., 2019). Another systematic review examined the effects of TASF on stunted growth among children aged between six months and 60 months, identifying 21 studies for inclu- sion (Shapiro et al., 2019). One randomized-controlled trial and one cross-sectional study covered in this review showed significant reductions in stunting. Secondary outcomes of anaemia, height/weight and head circumfer - ence were non-significant. Another systematic review and meta-analysis focused only on milk and dairy products and physical growth of children aged between two and 18 years old (de Beer, 2012). Using data from 12 studies conducted in China, Europe, Kenya, Indonesia, India, the United States of America and northern Viet Nam, authors found that for each incremental increase of 245 ml in daily milk consump - tion, child height increased by 0.4 cm per year compared to children consuming less. The results also showed that children with stunted growth had greater growth benefits from milk consumption than other children did and that the effect of milk on child height was greater than that of other dairy products. A systematic review focusing on complementary feeding practices within high-resource contexts and their impacts on infant micronutrient status suggested that meat reduced the risk of iron deficiency among breastfeeding infants who had low iron intake or were at risk of having inadequate iron stores during the first year of life. This relationship was, however, less clear for infants with adequate iron stores. There was also limited evidence available examining the impact of meat consumption on infant zinc status during the complementary feeding period (Obbagy et al., 2019). RCT and other types of experimental trials testing the effects of TASF on child nutrition and health outcomes were included in the systematic reviews described above. A few trials are highlighted here to draw attention to nuances in the findings and the importance of context and the overall dietary pattern. A series of trials tested the effects of intro - ducing eggs early in the complementary-feeding period (at between six and nine months of age) and continuing the egg intervention for six months. One of the early studies, the Lulun Project (Iannotti et al., 2017a), was carried out in Ecuador and showed a relatively large effect on child growth (length-for-age z-score increased by 0.63 (95% CI: 0.38-0.88) and The trial also found significantly increased concentrations of biomarkers of brain development, including choline and DHA (Iannotti et al., 2017b). When the study was repli- cated in Malawi (Mazira Project), however, the effect of egg consumption on child growth and development outcomes was found to be non-significant (Prado et al., 2020; Stewart et al., 2019). Important contextual differences were noted. The sample population for the Mazira Project was located near Lake Malawi and was already consuming animal source food in the form of small fish. The staple food was maize, probably high in dietary phytates that can inter - fere with TASF nutrient absorption. The Lulun sample, by contrast, had limited TASF in the diets, and the staples were potatoes and rice. The diverging findings for these two studies highlight the need to consider child diets more holistically. There are a limited number of studies assessing the consumption of insects and their products among young children. Caterpillar cereal as a complementary food was tested in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and found to have a positive effect on haemoglobin concentrations and to lead to reductions in anaemia (Bauserman et al., 2015). In a small study in Indonesia, young children aged 24 to 59 months (n=60) were put at random into two groups, one of which received 45 g/day of honey for two months while the other served as a control (Harmiyati et al., 2017). There was some evidence for an effect on anthropometry, with differences evident for height for age z-score, weight for age z-score and weight for height z-score, and this may merit replication in a larger trial.103 Section C | Effects of terrestrial animal source food on health and nutrition over the life courseIn sum, while systematic reviews indicate that TASF intake provides some benefits to infants and young children in terms of increased height/length and weight, the diverse findings highlight the importance of considering environ- mental health and overall child diets when assessing rela- tionships across multiple contexts. 3.3 School-age children and adolescents As the young child ages into middle childhood and adoles - cence, nutrition remains an important factor underlying health. The rate of linear growth slows as energy and nutri- ents are redirected into other developmental processes (Norris et al., 2022). Among primates, Homo sapiens has the longest juvenile periods in the life span (Bogin, 2009). Evolutionary biologists posit that the long duration of this period arose for multiple reasons, including to enable learning and brain development (Bogin, 2009). The middle childhood period is characterized by rapid neurogenesis and synapsis formation, which is followed by a period of intense pruning during adolescence (Black et al., 2017). Brain development has high glucose and micronutrient requirements, reaching 50 percent of the body's total basal requirements during childhood, and therefore requires an energy- and nutrient-dense diet (Goyal, Iannotti and Raichle, 2018). Similar to the situation in infancy and early childhood, the nutrients driving brain development during middle childhood and adolescence, including DHA, iron, zinc, choline and B vitamins, are those found in bioavaila- ble form in TASF. In some contexts, infection may interfere (through inflammation) with nutrition-driven neurodevel- opment (Suchdev et al., 2017). Other important biological processes during the school- age and adolescent periods require healthy diets. Growth trajectories follow similar patterns in prepubescent boys and girls (Ruxton and Derbyshire, 2013). Around nine years of age, girls begin their pubescent growth spurt, and boys do so approximately two years later. Differences related to the biological sex of the individual emerge during this phase for adiposity tissue and fat deposits (Ruxton and Derbyshire, 2013). Peak bone mass is reached during adolescence, requiring sufficient supplies of protein, calcium, vita- min D, zinc, phosphorous and magnesium, among other nutrients (Wallace et al., 2020). Evidence clearly supports the need for healthy diets to support bone health during these life-course phases (Golden, Abrams and Committee on Nutrition, 2014). The immune system also continues to develop and interact with dietary intakes and microbial exposures (Norris et al., 2022). Importantly, adolescents enter a phase of rapid reproductive development and changes to the endocrine system that require healthy diets and other health-promoting behaviours. With menarche, girls' iron requirements increase (Brabin and Brabin, 1992). Overall, the nutrient requirements of the school-age child and adolescent point to the ongoing importance of healthy diets, which may include TASF. TASF consumption has been evaluated in school-age chil- dren and adolescents for nutrition (anthropometry), health (bone health) and cognition outcomes. The above-de - scribed systematic review and meta-analysis examining milk and dairy products found an increase in height growth of 0.4 cm per year associated with daily consumption of 245 ml of milk/dairy (de Beer, 2012). Data were drawn from samples in China, Europe, Kenya, Indonesia, India, northern Viet Nam and the United States of America. Dairy consumption led to greater height effects in adolescents than in school-age children, and among all children and adolescents, milk intakes led to greater effects on height in those with low heights for their ages than in other children. Some concerns have been raised about longer-term risks of overweight and obesity associated with child consumption of milk and dairy products. One systematic review examined this question directly (Lu et al., 2016). The authors identified 10 studies (n=46 011 children and adolescents) with an average three-year follow-up period. Children in the groups with the highest dairy intake showed a reduced risk of overweight/obesity compared to those in the lowest intake group (pooled odds ratio = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49-0.80). The adjusted regression modelling showed that for each additional one serving per day of dairy, the risk of overweight/obesity was 13 percent lower than for children consuming lower quantities (odds ratio = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.74-0.98). A previous systematic review and meta-analysis showed consistent findings for milk or dairy consumption in rela- tion to adiposity (Dror, 2014). This analysis included data from 36 studies of children across multiple age catego - ries - pre-school, school-age and adolescents - living in high-income countries. It found that milk or dairy intake did not lead to a significant increase in adiposity and that, among adolescents, dairy intake reduced adiposity with an effect size of -0.26 (95% CI: -0.38 - -0.14, P<0.0001). As well as anthropometry, bone health has been studied in relation to dairy and egg consumption in school-age children and teenagers. A review of randomized controlled trials found eight studies indicating positive effects of dairy consumption on both bone mineral content and bone mineral density (Kouvelioti, Josse and Klentrou, 2017).104 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesAnother observational study, in a population in the United States of America, examined egg consumption and bone health among 13 year olds (n=294) (Coheley et al., 2018). The authors found that egg consumption was positively associated with bone mineral content (radium corti- cal bone mineral) and biomarkers of bone metabolism (osteocalcin). Although there is compelling evidence for highly active brain development during childhood and adolescence that could be responsive to TASF in the diet, few studies have examined this linkage. One systematic review aimed to examine the effects of consuming beef and beef prod- ucts on cognitive outcomes in children and young adults (An et al., 2019). It assessed findings from five unique inter - ventions, some of which are covered above in the section on young children (Krebs et al., 2012). Interventions eval- uated in the trials compared beef to other TASFs (e.g. a glass of milk) or PBFs. There was only one intervention that compared beef to a usual-diet control group, and this was also the only one that showed positive effects on cognitive outcomes (Neumann et al., 2007). The series of papers published from a cluster rand- omized-controlled trial carried out among Kenyan school children (n=911) has been widely cited in the literature on TASF nutrition (Gewa et al., 2009; Hulett et al., 2014; Neumann et al., 2007; Whaley et al., 2003). The papers in question compared the health and development outcomes of four groups: children given meat with gith- eri stew (maize, beans and greens); children given milk with githeri stew; children given githeri stew alone; and a control group. It was found that children in the meat group showed higher rates of increase in Raven's Progressive Matrices (which reflect fluid intelligence, abstract reason- ing, problem solving, perceptual awareness and reason- ing) than all the other groups, while only younger children and those stunted at baseline in the milk group showed a greater rate of height gain than other children in the milk group (Neumann et al., 2007). Multiple other health and nutrition outcomes have been reported from this study. Vitamin B12 plasma concentrations were increased in the meat and milk groups (McLean et al., 2007; Siekmann et al., 2003). Arm muscle area and mid-upper arm circumference were significantly higher over time in the meat and milk groups than in the githeri and control groups (Neumann et al., 2013b). Differences were also observed for morbidities, among other outcomes (Neumann et al., 2013a). In sum, the school-age child and adolescent undergoes critical growth, reproductive, endocrinal and neurodevel- opmental changes that require energy and nutrient-dense foods. As with pregnancy and lactation, more synthesized evidence is available on the effects of milk and dairy-prod- uct consumption during this period of the life course than on the effects of consuming other TASFs, although meat has been evaluated for cognition, growth and other health impacts. Findings from systematic reviews on milk and dairy consumption show that it is associated with increased height, increased bone mineral content and density, and lower risks of overweight and obesity. Meat and milk intakes were associated with positive health, nutrition and cognitive outcomes in a cluster randomized-controlled trial in Kenya. 3.4 Adults Healthy diets are important during adulthood for main- taining biological systems, responding to changes that may occur, such as infection or other environmental exposures, and supporting ongoing neurogenesis. Overall anthropometry and body composition differ between men and women, influencing the levels of macronutrients and micronutrients required in the diet to maintain health (Brown, 2019). On average, muscle mass is higher in men than women, while women have higher fat mass, which means that dietary needs differ (Gallagher, Chung and Akram, 2013). Women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) have additional requirements for nutrients found in TASF (e.g. iron) because of menstruation and other reproduc - tive-health processes. During adulthood, TASF - within the context of a healthy diet - can protect and promote health. This section provides an overview the benefits and risks associated with dietary intakes of TASF at a range of different levels. Table C2 summarizes the levels of intake given as healthy reference intakes or as risk thresholds, depending on the nature of the analysis, for various TASFs. For example, the healthy reference diet of the EAT-Lancet Commission incorporates daily intake levels for several different TASFs based on nutrient intake adequacies and analyses of the literature (Willett et al., 2019b). Similarly, the Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) is a food-based metric consisting of 25 food groups, of which 16 are classified as healthy, seven as unhealthy and two (red meat and high-fat dairy products) as unhealthy when consumed in excess. Investigators based the score on the analysis of datasets containing 24 hour dietary recalls across different regions and an analysis of the association of each candidate metric with a range of diet-quality outcomes related to nutrient adequacy and NCD risk. In contrast, the Global Burden of Disease estimates provide thresholds for 105 Section C | Effects of terrestrial animal source food on health and nutrition over the life courserisk analyses across different types of foods, including processed and unprocessed meats (Afshin et al., 2019b; Murray et al., 2020b). In the Global Burden of Disease 2019, theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) is reduced to zero, as shown in Table C2. Very high consumption of red meat can, however, be associated with overweight, obesity and NCDs. The World Health Organization established the Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases 2013 2020 (WHO, 2013) targeting cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabe - tes. Unhealthy dietary behaviours are among the risk factors targeted for chronic-disease prevention (WHO, 2014). There is a large body of epidemiological evidence available examining the association between red meat consumption and colorectal cancer (Bouvard et al., 2015). In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer Monographs Programme classified consumption of red meat as \"probably carcinogenic to humans\" based on limited evidence and processed meat as \"carcinogenic to humans\" based on sufficient evidence (Boobis et al., 2016; IARC, 2015; Th\u00f8gersen and Bertram, 2021). Subsequent analyses have questioned the validity of these conclu- sions because of a weak effect size, heterogeneity and a lack of dose-response patterns (Alexander et al., 2015). The biological mechanisms for NCDs vary and depend on a range of factors that extend beyond unhealthy dietary practices and include genetics, physical inactiv- ity, underlying health conditions and comorbidities, and environmental exposures. TASF consumption has been associated with increased levels of low-density lipopro - tein cholesterol in the blood, which can in turn, increase risk of atherosclerosis (disease of large arteries) and cardiovascular disease. Dietary intakes of saturated fatty acids can increase low density lipoprotein in the blood, although dietary cholesterol has been shown to have minimal effects on plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Astrup et al., 2020; Fernandez, 2012; Guasch-Ferr\u00e9 et al., 2019). As described in Section B, cholesterol has important functions in the human body, including in cell membrane activity and integrity and as a precursor for steroids such as sex hormones, adreno - cortical hormones and vitamin D (Gropper, Smith and Carr, 2021b). Cholesterol in excess may not be catabo - lized readily, leading to increased risk of atherosclerosis (Schade, Shey and Eaton, 2020). Potential mechanisms underlying the association of red meat with chronic disease include pro-inflammatory factors, serum ferritin, haem iron, heterocyclic amines, trimethylamine N oxide and saturated fats. Evidence largely derives from observational studies in humans, animal models and cell cultures (Kim, Keogh and Clifton, 2015; Kruger and Zhou, 2018). With regard to processed red meat, reviews examining the mechanisms involved highlight particular compounds that can harm DNA: carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds from the curing meats with nitrite; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from smok and Nadal, 2017; Turesky, 2018). Another review of the biological mechanisms underlying the effect of meat on colorectal cancer suggested that in vitro studies do not represent normal dietary intakes for haem exposure, in particular (Kruger and Zhou, 2018). This review also found that the types of N-nitroso compounds in the human body after ingestion of red meat are nitrosyl iron and nitrosothiols, which have chemistries that differ from those implicated in the formation of DNA adducts. As in the case of other life-course phases, milk and dairy products have been studied extensively for nutri- tion and health outcomes in adults. One metareview compiled this evidence to assess the effect on all-cause mortality (Cavero-Redondo et al., 2019). It included eight meta-analyses, 50 percent of which were considered to meet the criteria for \"very good\" quality of evidence, while 25 percent were classed as \"good\" and 25 percent as \"acceptable\" . Relative risks were reported for dairy prod- ucts, milk, cheese and yoghurt, and no excess risk associ- ated with these products was found for all-cause mortality. Other reviews have parsed the effects of milk and dairy on different chronic disease outcomes. A systematic review and meta-analysis showed one cup of milk (200 ml) per day reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, hyper - tension, colorectal cancer, metabolic syndrome, obesity and osteoporosis in a dose-response manner (Zhang et al., 2021). The study also found an increased risk associ- ated with milk for prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease. The findings for colorectal cancer were supported by the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF), Continuous Updata Report (CUP) 2018, which showed that consumption of dairy probably protects against colorectal cancer (WCRF, 2018b). This report, however, found that evidence show- ing that high consumption of dairy products increases risk of prostate cancer is limited. Another systematic review and meta-analysis drew data from 13 cohort studies for coronary heart disease and seven for ischaemic stroke and found that an increase of 200 g/day intake of high-fat milk was positively associated with coronary heart disease, RR 1.08 (95% CI: 1.00-1.16), while an increase of 90 g/day of cheese reduced the risk 106 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesof coronary heart disease, RR 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93-0.98) (Jakobsen et al., 2021). In another updated systematic review and meta-analysis, investigators focused on risk assessment for dairy products and hypertension only (Heidari et al., 2021). The combined 16 studies showed reduced risks of hypertension for the following types of food: all dairy products, RR 0.90 RR 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91-0.99). In subgroup analyses, however, the authors reported differential findings based on sex, region and stage of hypertension. Milk and dairy products also seem to protect against type 2 diabetes. A systematic review and meta-analysis combined 22 cohort studies to show that each 200 g/day increase in dairy intakes reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, RR 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95-1.00) (Gijsbers et al., 2016). Yoghurt intakes at 80 g/day versus no intake also reduced risk, RR 0.86 (95% CI: 0.83-0.90). However, heterogeneity across the studies was high. A meta-analysis of cohort studies in adults in the United States of America found only yoghurt to be protective against type 2 diabetes, HR 0.83 (95% CI: 0.75-0.92) (Chen et al., 2014). Breast cancer has also been studied in relation to milk and dairy intakes in a system- atic review and meta-analysis (Zang et al., 2015). This study also included a total of 22 prospective cohort stud- ies. The authors showed that high and modest intakes of dairy products reduced the risk of breast cancer relative to low intakes, and subanalyses for particular dairy products indicated protective effects for yoghurt and low-fat dairy. The WCRF, CUP 2018 for breast cancer also shows that consumption of dairy products at 200 g/day minimally reduces risk of premenopausal breast cancer, RR 0.02-0.99) (WCRF, 2018a). Other systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that consuming milk and dairy products reduces the risk of metabolic syndrome (Chen et al., 2015), colorectal cancer in men (Ralston et al., 2014), vertebral fracture (Mat\u00eda-Mart\u00edn et al., 2019) and hip fracture (for yoghurt only) (Hidayat et al., 2020). One systematic review and meta-analysis showed that dairy intakes reduced the risk of endometriosis (Qi et al., 2021). Those consuming more than 18 servings per week of full-fat dairy products showed a relative risk of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.76- 0.96). In stratified analyses by dairy product, the relationship held for cheese but not for whole or reduced-fat/skim milk or yoghurt. Few studies have systematically examined the effects of TASF substitute or replacement foods. One prospective cohort study over 32 years in the United States of America found that consuming nuts, legumes or whole grains instead of dairy foods was associated with lower mortality and that consumption of red and processed meat instead of dairy was associated with higher mortality (Ding et al., 2019). Concerns over dietary egg intakes in adults have largely focused on the risk of blood cholesterol with respect to coronary heart disease, stroke and hypertension. However, there is no strong evidence supporting these associations among healthy adults. A systematic review of meta-analyses of randomized-controlled trials exam- ined the impacts of egg consumption on blood pres - sure in adults (Kolahdouz-Mohammadi et al., 2020). The authors identified fifteen randomized controlled trials (n=748 participants) and found that, overall, egg consumption had no significant effect on systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference 0.046 no heteroge - neity among the included studies. An earlier systematic review and meta-analysis eval- uated the association between egg consumption and stroke and coronary heart disease (Rong et al., 2013). The authors drew data from 17 reports (3 081 269 person years and 5 847 incident cases for coronary heart disease, and 4 148 095 person years and 7 579 incident cases for stroke). Findings indicated no association for either condi- tion. The relative risks of one egg per day were 0.99 (95% CI:0.85-1.15) for coronary heart disease and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.81-1.02) for stroke. Heterogeneity assessed using I2 (the percent variance from the point estimate attributable to heterogeneity in study design) was 0 percent. A subgroup analysis among diabetic individuals showed that there was an increased risk of coronary heart disease at the highest intake level as compared to the lowest intake level, RR 1.54 (95% CI: 1.14-2.09). Another systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out in China using the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study and included 28 024 participants without cardiovascular disease at baseline (Xu et al., 2019). This study confirmed the findings presented above, showing that there were no significant increases in risk of all-cause mortality, mortal- ity from cardiovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease or stroke associated with high (more than seven eggs per week) relative to low (less than one egg per week) egg consumption. The authors found a small reduction in risk of stroke (HR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85-0.98) but recommended further study.107 Section C | Effects of terrestrial animal source food on health and nutrition over the life courseTable C2.

As a bioavailable source of haem iron (see Section B), meat may affect iron status and anaemia in adults. One systematic review of stud- ies in adults from high-income countries identified seven high-quality studies examining this question (Jackson et al., 2016). The studies examined intakes of animal flesh foods, defined as muscle tissue of an animal carcass, and included both red and white meats from chicken/poultry, sheep, pig, cattle, goat, fish, seafood, buffalo, kangaroo, camel, deer or rabbit. They included processed meats, such as ham, bacon and sausage, but excluded offal, such as liver and kidney. Five of the studies indicated that meat intake (85 300 g/day) was positively associated with iron status. Red-meat consumption (processed and unprocessed) in adults has been studied in association with NCDs. Processed meats were typically defined as including those that have undergone changes such as salting, curing, smok - ing or addition of chemical preservatives. While there is a relatively large evidence base, it has been noted that it has serious limitations in that it is largely based on observa- tional studies with moderate-to-high risk of biases. Analyses have been carried out explicitly to examine the quality of evidence from epidemiological studies evaluating red and processed meat consumption. One such study, looking at processed meat only, found risk of misclassification of expo - sure, serious risk of confounding and moderate-to-serious risk of biases, including selection, reporting and miss - ing-data biases (H\u00e4ndel et al., 2021). In another assessment, a panel of experts from seven high-income countries was convened to develop recommendations on consumption of processed and unprocessed red meat (Johnston et al., 2019). They used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to evaluate the body of evidence and recommended that adults should continue current levels of both unprocessed and processed Risk thresholds Food Study Mean (range) Method for calculating rangeAnalysis or data sourceReference Red meat, assessmentAfshin Burden of Disease 201720% above/below meanComparative risk assessmentAfshin et al., 2019 Red meatGlobal Burden of Disease 2019eNo dataComparative risk assessmentMurray et al., 2020 Meat, processedGlobal Burden of Disease 2019cNo dataComparative risk assessmentMurray et al., 2020 Notes: Foods are named as in the respective reference. a World Cancer Research Fund recommendation: Consumption of red meat should be limited to no more than about three portions per week.

Two assessments of dietary risk factors using statistical analyses have in recent years been carried out for the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) at the Institute of Health Metrics. The GBD 2017 study established thresholds for dietary intake levels based on compilations of epidemi- ological data (see Table C2) (Afshin et al., 2019). The assess - ment showed that red and processed meat contributed to global burden of disease calculated as life years lost due to disability or death, although they ranked low relative to other dietary risk factors such as high sodium consump - tion, low fruit consumption and low consumption of whole grains. The authors noted that the relatively low ranking could be a function of limited evidence compared to other dietary risk factors. For the GBD 2019, the theoretical mini- mum risk level was reduced to zero, increasing the esti- mate for the contribution of meat consumption to mortal- ity and burden of disease (Murray et al., 2020b). There may be uncertainty and a lack of representation of LMICs in the data used for both the GBD studies (Beal et al., 2021). Potential links between red meat consumption and specific NCDs have been examined largely through prospective cohort studies. The prospective cohort study Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) included data from 21 countries, with representation from low-, middle- and high-income populations. It showed that higher intakes of processed red meats ( 150 g/week versus 0 g/week) increased risk of total et al., 2021). There was found to be no significant association between unprocessed red meat or poultry consumption and the various negative health outcomes studied. Another prospective cohort study, in a population of men in the United States of America, found an increased risk of cardiovascular disease for one additional serving of meat per day: total red meat HR 1.12 (95% CI: 1.06-1.18); unprocessed red meat HR 1.11 meat HR 1.15 (95% CI: 1.06-1.25) (Al-Shaar et al., 2020). As described above, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) analyses found substantial epidemiologi- cal evidence linking meat to colorectal cancer, in particular processed meat (IARC, 2015). The World Cancer Research Fund's Continuous Update Project 2018 also concluded that there is convincing evidence that consumption of processed red meat is a cause of colorectal cancer (WCRF, 2018b). A more recent umbrella review of meta-analyses found suggestive evidence for positive associations between red and processed meat consumption and risk of colorectal cancer: 50 g/day of processed meats RR 1.16 (95% CI: 1.08-1.26) and 100 g/day red or processed 1.19 (95% CI: 1.10-1.29) (Papadimitriou et al., 2021). Cohort studies have also found associations between red meat consumption and pancreatic and advanced-stage prostate cancers (Bouvard et al., 2015). Another, older, prospective cohort study, carried out in the United States of America, showed a positive association between increased daily servings of unprocessed red meats (430.9 g/day) and processed meats (421.8 g/day) and four-year weight gain (Mozaffarian et al., 2011). Red-meat consumption has been associated with differ - ent forms of diabetes in cohort studies. Mar\u00ed-Sanchis et al. (2018) report that among Spanish women, total meat consumption (highest versus lowest quartile) was associ- ated with increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (OR 1.67 [95% CI: 1.06-2.63]), with greater red meat (OR 2.37 [95% CI: 1.49-3.78]) and processed meat (OR 2.01 [95% CI: 1.26-3.21]). An older study (Pan et al., 2011) examined red-meat consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes in adults in the United States of America and found that a one serving a day increase in consumption of unprocessed meat (100 g/day) had a relative risk of diabe - tes of 1.19 (95% CI: 1.04-1.37) and that the equivalent figures for (50 g/day) were 1.51 (95% CI: 1.25-1.83). Biomarkers of chronic disease have also been examined in relation to meat. A systematic review and meta-anal- ysis examined the effects of total red meat consump - tion by comparing pre- and post-values for biomarkers for diet periods with intakes of 0.5 or more servings (35 g)/day of total red meat to those for diet periods with intakes of less than 0.5 servings/day in a series of rand- omized controlled trials. It found no significant differ - ence in change values for glucose, insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance or c-reactive protein (O'Connor et al., 2021). Few studies have examined meat within the context of the overall dietary pattern over the short or longer term. One recent prospective cohort study, however, showed that the level of consumption of fruits and vegetables together with processed meats mattered for cancer risk (Maximova et al., 2020). The reference point used by the authors was high intake levels of vegetables and fruits (> 5 serv- ings/day for women and for men aged 55 years or more, 111 Section C | Effects of terrestrial animal source food on health and nutrition over the life courseand > 6 servings/day for men aged less than 55 years) or whole grains (> 1.1 servings/day for women and > 1.5 servings/day for men) with low intake levels of processed meat (< 28 g/week for women and < 42 g/week for men) or unprocessed red meat (< 150 g/week for women and < 250 g/week for men). They then estimated hazard ratios and confidence intervals for incidence of all-cause cancer and 15 cancers for different combinations of intake levels of red and processed meat, vegetables and fruits, and whole grains. The highest risk of all-cause cancer and 15 cancers was found to occur when low intake of vege - tables and fruits or whole grains was combined with high intake of processed meat (HR men 1.9; HR women 1.4; HR men 1.8; HR women 1.5). When low intake of vegetable and fruits or whole grains was combined with high intake of unprocessed red meat, risk was less pronounced and associations were less consistent. Replacement or substitution of meat with other foods has also been minimally studied. A meta-analysis compared red meat consumption to consumption of the following list of alternative \"protein sources\" for a variety of NCD risk factors: sources carbohy- drates (low-quality refined grains and simple sugars, such as white bread, pasta, rice, cookies/biscuits); or usual diet (Guasch-Ferr\u00e9 et al., 2019). No differences were observed between red meat and the combined category of all alternative diets for changes in blood concentrations of total, low-density lipoprotein or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoproteins A1 and B or blood pressure, although there were smaller reductions in triglycerides for the red meat compared to the combined alternatives category (weighted mean difference, 0.065 mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.000- 0.129). Red meat resulted in smaller reductions in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein compared to high-quality plant-protein sources, while compared to fish, red meat yielded greater reductions in low-density lipoprotein concentrations. Poultry meat consumption, while sometimes included in analyses of unprocessed meats, has been evaluated to a lesser extent than consumption of red meat and other TASFs. A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies assessing poultry consumption and stroke risk identified seven relevant studies (n=354 718) (Mohammadi et al., 2018). Pooled RRs for total stroke risk were found to be non-significant: highest versus lowest poultry intake categories, Subgroup analyses provided evidence for inverse relationships in a population in the United States of America and in women. A non-linear association was also revealed for lower risk of stroke at the consumption level of one serving per week. Evidence is minimal for the effects of insects, grubs and insect products in the diets of adults on health outcomes. One systematic review looked at bee products and cardi- ovascular risk but was unable to draw conclusions based on the evidence base (Hadi, Rafie and Arab, 2021). Rasad et al. (2018) found that honey consumption improved lipid profiles relative to sucrose consumption. In another study, honey was shown not to adversely affect blood lipids in adults (Al-Tamimi et al., 2020). A double-blind randomized controlled trial found evidence suggesting that cricket powder improved gut health and reduced inflammation; however, the authors called for more stud- ies (Stull et al., 2018). In sum, considerable evidence has accumulated on the health effects of dietary intakes of milk and dairy prod- ucts. Findings suggest protective effects for several metabolic syndrome; and fractures. Evidence for the effects of milk and dairy intakes on coronary heart disease is equivocal, and there may be some increased risks in the cases of prostate cancer, Parkinson's disease and iron-deficiency anaemia, but heterogeneity and confounding across the respective studies may lessen the strength of the findings. The evidence for egg consumption largely points to null effects on a range of chronic-disease outcomes in adults. Meat has been studied fairly extensively in adult popula- tions, although limitations related to design heterogeneity, focus on high-income countries and risk of biases preclude definitive conclusions. Consumption of muscle tissue from a range of animals improves iron status and reduces anaemia. While evidence has shown unequivocally that processed red meat consumption increases risk of mortal- ity and chronic disease outcomes (cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer), recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis have found unprocessed red meat intake to have non-significant effects on health outcomes and biomarkers of chronic diseases. Poultry consumption has been studied to a lesser extent, with evidence indicating that it has non-significant effects on chronic disease. More research is needed on the potential health benefits and risks of consuming meat from hunting and wildlife farming and of consuming insects.112 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes3.5 Older adults Several physiological processes occur during aging that may alter dietary needs (Solomons, 2013). At the cellu- lar level, senescence or growth arrest of replicating cells commences and leads to altered protein expression and increased oxidative stress due to accumulation of iron and other inflammatory factors. Tissues (e.g. depigmentation of hair or loss of connective tissue in skin) and whole systems may change during aging (Brown, 2019). Inflammatory processes and alterations in blood flow and neurotrans - mitter metabolism can influence cognition and memory. There has been increasing interest in the potential role of TASF in addressing some of these deficits in older adults, although the evidence base remains minimal compared to that for other life-course phases. One example of a nutri- ent that is found concentrated in TASF and whose role in healthy aging is attracting interest is choline, which has been shown to improve memory, among other neuropro - tective effects (Blusztajn, Slack and Mellott, 2017). TASFs contain nutrients and bioactive compounds that may be critical for preserving muscle mass and bone health and reducing brain disorders and impaired cogni- tion among older adults (Cardoso, Afonso and Bandarra, 2016). Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle or lean body mass in the aging process (Santilli et al., 2014). Protein metabo - lism changes with age such that protein synthesis cannot compensate for protein catabolism (Baum, Kim and Wolfe, 2016). Investigators have suggested increasing high-qual- ity protein intakes in older adults to 25 to 30 g per meal (Paddon-Jones and Rasmussen, 2009). Meat containing bioactive compounds such as creatine and carnitine has been hypothesized to counteract some of the above-men- tioned problems (Phillips, 2012). One narrative review showed that the consumption of 113 g of meat five times a week would be the optimal dietary intake level in older adults for addressing sarcopenia (Rondanelli et al., 2015). Relatedly, TASF may protect bone health and prevent oste - oporosis, which results from the body's inability to replace old bone with new bone tissue. For both men and women, dietary nutrient requirements for some minerals increase after the age of 65 years, notably calcium and magnesium. These minerals, as well as vitamin D, are needed to prevent bone loss and related frailty fractures in aging people (Bonjour et al., 2013). Finally, TASFs that provide DHA, such as eggs, may be important for enhancing memory, prevent - ing macular degeneration and brain disorders, and neuro - protection more broadly (Cardoso, Afonso and increasing epidemiological evidence, particu- larly from high-income countries, related to the effects that dietary intakes of TASF have on nutrition and health outcomes among older adults. However, this evidence has limitations. For example, older adults are sometimes grouped with other adults in the literature. Moreover, they experience more medical conditions than people in other life-course phases. Given that this assessment covers stud- ies in apparently healthy populations, the latter factor limits the breadth of evidence available for older adults. Milk and dairy consumption in older adults, or earlier in the life course with impacts measured in older adults, has been evaluated for nutrition (sarcopenia), health (frailty) and cognitive outcomes (cognitive decline, Alzheimer's). A narrative review examining the effects of dairy intakes on sarcopenia, frailty and cognitive decline among older adults (Cuesta-Triana et al., 2019) found only six relevant studies: five observational prospective cohort studies and one randomized-controlled trial. High consumption of dairy products was found to be associated with reduced frailty and sarcopenia through improved skeletal muscle mass. The authors highlighted two prospective-cohort studies conducted in Japan that demonstrated positive effects on cognition, although across all studies the effects on cognition were equivocal. The Cuesta-Triana review also found that milk consumption in midlife may diminish verbal memory performance later in life. Another literature review examined the effects of milk and dairy consumption in terms of preventing dementia and Alzheimer's disease (Bermejo-Pareja et al., 2021). Again, the two prospective cohort studies from Japan provided evidence supporting an effect - one showing that high milk intake (almost daily compared to less than four times a week) reduced the odds of vascular dementia (Yamada et al., 2003) and the other finding that increased consumption of milk and dairy reduced the risk of Alzheimer's disease (Ozawa et al., 2014). Another systematic review (Granic et al., 2020), which covered intervention and observational trials examin- ing whole foods, including TASFs, for effects on muscle health and sarcopenia, reported consistent and robust findings for beneficial effects of lean red-meat and dairy- food consumption on muscle mass or lean tissue mass. Evidence for eggs and fish was inconclusive. Other recent experimental trials not included in the systematic reviews were identified for this assessment. A cluster RCT was carried out in Australia across 60 resi- dential age-care facilities (n=7 195 participants, mean age 86\u00b18.2 years) (Iuliano et al., 2021). Thirty residential 113 Section C | Effects of terrestrial animal source food on health and nutrition over the life coursefacilities received additional milk, yoghurt and cheese as the intervention. Results showed that risks were reduced by 33 percent for all fractures (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% CI: 0.48-0.93; P=0.02), by 46 (HR 0.54, 95% CI: 0.35-0.83; P=0.005) and by 0.89, 95% CI: 0.78-0.98; P=0.04). Significance was reached for falls by three months of dairy intake and for hip frac - tures by five months. No difference in mortality risk was observed. Another cluster randomized-controlled trial, also in Australia, tested the effects of lean red meat, 160 g/d consumed six days/week with progressive resistance train- ing, on muscle health (Daly et al., 2014). Compared to the control group, which received progressive resistance train- ing but no lean red meat, the intervention group showed greater gains in total body and leg lean-tissue mass and muscle strength. A similar randomized-controlled trial in a different Australian setting provided some contrasting find- ings. In a six-month bundled intervention with three-day/ week resistance training combined with either two 80 g servings of cooked lean red meat or approximately 225 g of cooked pasta or rice (control) on training days (n=154; age 65 years), no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of changes in total body and leg lean mass. There were also no significant differences between the groups in terms of changes in thigh muscle cross-sectional area, leg and back muscle strength, exec - utive and cognitive functioning, systolic blood pressure or physical function. The lean red meat group had greater improvements in arm lean mass, gait speed, muscle density and appendicular lean mass than the control group. The control group had significantly greater improvements for indicators of memory and learning at 12-week and 24-week follow-up points in the study (Formica et al., 2020). Other small-scale dietary intervention studies have been conducted in older adults - one assessing the effect of replacing meat with a soy-based diet in post-menopausal women (Roughead et al., 2005) and the other comparing a lactovegetarian diet with a meat diet in older men (Haub et al., 2002). Neither showed significant differences between the diets in terms of effects on health outcomes. Another study, carried out in the Netherlands, showed that consum- ing a fermented milk drink improved bowel habits in older adults (van den Nieuwboer et al., 2015). A large prospective cohort study (n=16 948) (Jiang et al., 2020) assessed the relationship between consumption of different types of meat (red meat, poultry, fresh fish/ shellfish, preserved fish/shellfish) during midlife (mean age at baseline: 53.50\u00b16.23 years) and cognitive outcomes during later life (mean age at endline: 73.18\u00b16.41 years). Based on a cohort from the Singapore Chinese Health Study, the findings indicated that individuals in the highest quartile of red-meat consumption (median intake: 48.61 g/ day) had significantly higher odds of cognitive impairment (OR 1.16, 95% CI: 1.01-1.32, P for trend = 0.009) than those in the lowest quartile (11.81 g/day). On the other hand, poultry intake in the highest quartile (median intake: 37.18 g/day) was found to be protective against cognitive impair - ment, although this relationship was not statistically signif - icant (OR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.78-1.02, P for trend = 0.10). In sum, epidemiological evidence for the health effects of TASF consumption in older adults comes primarily from high-income countries. There is consistent strong evidence that lean red meat consumption has positive effects on muscle health, while one prospective cohort study exam- ining unprocessed and processed red meat has suggested that consumption increases the likelihood of cognitive impairment, except in the case of organ meat. Other evidence suggests that milk and dairy products and other TASFs have potential in mitigating sarcopenia (muscle loss), fractures, frailty, dementia and Alzheimer's disease.114 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes4. Allergies related to terrestrial animal source food Food allergies vary in prevalence, severity and potency (FAO and WHO, 2021a). They represent a key concern at both individual and food business operator levels (Sicherer and Sampson, 2018; Taylor, 2000). According to the Codex Alimentarius Expert Committee on Food Allergens (FAO and WHO, 2021b), among the many different TASFs analysed, egg and milk were found to pose allergenic risks to the popula- tion. It is therefore often mandatory for allergen labelling on food products to indicate the presence of eggs or milk if they are among the ingredients (FAO and WHO, 2020). The ration- ale behind such rules and the potential risks posed by milk and egg allergies are discussed below. 4.1 Milk sensitivity Milk sensitivity can be caused by lactose or by milk proteins (Muehlhoff et al., 2013). In the former case the sensitivity is caused by the non-digestion of lactose, the main sugar present in human and other mammals' milks, because of lactase deficiency. In the latter, there is an adverse reac - tion to proteins. The two types of sensitivity have differ - ent symptoms, diagnosis and management or treatment. Box C5 provides a glossary of terms used in this section and explains the differences between them. Lactase deficiency and lactose malabsorption are not diseases but normal variants of human metabolisms. They thus differ from congenital lactase deficiency, which is a very rare genetic disorder. According to a recent systematic review (Storhaug, Fosse and Fadnes, 2017), the global prev- alence of lactose malabsorption among individuals older than ten years is estimated to be 68 percent, with signifi- cant differences across regions and among countries (see Figure C3). Some of these variations relate to differences in assessment methods, definitions or thresholds or to limi- tations associated with the lack or non-representativeness of data from some countries. Lactose malabsorption is Box C5. Terms related to allergies and intolerances caused by milk Lactase deficiency: also called lactase non-persistence, is the inability to digest large amounts of lactose. Lactose is digested and absorbed by the body thanks the enzyme lactase, concentrations of which are highest during infan- cy and decrease after weaning (Misselwitz et al., 2019). Congenital lactase deficiency: a very rare genetic disor - der (e.g. ranges in western European populations are between 1 in 23 000 and 1 in 44 000 births) that appears right after birth and has severe symptoms, such as delayed mental development and death, frequently caused by a fulminant E. coli sepsis (EFSA, 2010). Lactose malabsorption: refers to failure to digest and/ or absorb lactose in the small intestine. Lactose malab - sorption can have various causes: primary lactose malab - sorption (the most common form) is caused by lactase deficiency, whereas secondary lactose malabsorption can be transitory and be caused, inter alia, by rapid small-in- testinal transit or small-bowel bacterial overgrowth (Misselwitz et al., 2019). Not all individuals with lactose malabsorption have lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance: indicates symptoms associated with the ingestion of food containing lactose, for example abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhoea. Individuals with lactose intolerance have different levels of tolerance of dairy products. In some people with lactose malabsorp - tion, less than 6 g of lactose can lead to symptoms of lactose intolerance. However, according to the European Food Safety Authority Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies, the vast majority can tolerate up to 12 g with no symptoms or minor ones (EFSA, 2010). According to a systematic review on the management of lactose intoler - ance (Shaukat et al., 2010), this figure is between 12 g and 15 g, whereas another review (Deng et al., 2015) indicates that the figure is 20 g in lactase-deficient individuals. Furthermore, the severity of symptoms in people with lactose intolerance depends on the dosage and the type of food consumed as well as on the individual's microbiome and whether visceral hypersensitivity (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome) is present (Misselwitz et al., 2019). Milk-protein allergy: also called cow's milk allergy, is an immune-mediated adverse food reaction to milk proteins and can be caused by immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediat- ed, non-IgE mediated or mixed reactions (Di Costanzo and Berni Canani, 2018). Around 60 percent of those with cow's milk allergy have the IgE mediated form (Flom and Sicherer, 2019), although there is some variation across populations and age groups. Although cow's milk contains approximately 20 potentially sensitizing proteins (Fiocchi et al., 2010), those involved in cow's milk allergy are mainly Lactoglobulin and casein (Muehlhoff et al., 2013). Cow's milk allergy is one of the most common food allergies, especially in the first year of life, but tends to be outgrown by patients at around the age of two to five years (Di Costanzo and Berni Canani, 2018). Symptoms of cow's milk allergy include gastrointestinal, skin and respirato - ry reactions (Fiocchi et al., 2010). Clinical manifestations of IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy are usually immedi- ate (from a few minutes to two hours) and include urticar - ia and/or angioedema, with vomiting and/or wheez- ing (Lifschitz and Szajewska, 2015). Mixed and non-IgE mediated cow's milk allergy tend to have delayed onset and mainly involve the gastrointestinal tract and the skin. In general, cow's milk allergy causes mild to moderate reactions; anaphylaxis, a life threatening reaction, is rare (1-2 percent) (Lifschitz and Szajewska, 2015).115 Section C | Effects of terrestrial animal source food on health and nutrition over the life courseTable C3.

In northern and western Europe, the prevalence of lactose malabsorption is low to moderate (4-36 percent), whereas in eastern Europe it is moderate to high (28-81 percent). The figure for Latin America is 38 percent (ranging from 48 percent in Mexico to 80 percent in Colombia), for Oceania 45 percent (ranging from 10 percent in New Zealand to 99 percent Solomon Islands) and for northern America 42 percent. Interestingly, in Canada and Australia, native populations show different prevalences from the rest of the respective national populations. There is a hypothesis that selection has played a role in maintaining lactase persistence in popu- lations where cattle have been important in order to allow digestion of dairy products. This is the case in Northern Europe (Storhaug, Fosse and Fadnes, 2017) and among pastoralists in Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Central Asia (Ranciaro et al., 2014). Evershed et al. (2022) have linked the evolution of lactase persistence in Europe, beginning in the Early Neolithic period, to both the crisis mechanism, where the selection was driven by famine, and the chronic mecha- nism based on the increased exposure. Not all animal milk and dairy products contain the same level of lactose (see Tables C3 and C4). Lactose content in 100 g of milk ranges from 2.9 g in reindeer milk to 6.6 g in horse milk and from as low as zero in ghee and vari- ous types of cheese, such as hard cheese and blue/white mould cheese, to around 5 g in buttermilk and yoghurt. 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0PercentMiddle EastWorldNorthern AfricaAsia excluding Middle EastSub-Saharan Africa OceaniaNorthern America Latin AmericaEastern Europe, Russian Federation and former Soviet RepublicsNorthern, Southern and Western EuropeFigure C3.

Live cultures contained in yoghurt and other dairy products with added live cultures are able to support lactose diges - tion in the gut, thus reducing the likelihood of symptoms associated with lactose intolerance (Muehlhoff et al., 2013). Individuals with lactose intolerance who avoid milk and dairy products may have reduced intake of calcium, which in turn can cause rickets in young children and low bone mineral density and higher risk of fracture in adults (Hodges et al., 2019). WHO (2019) indicates that calcium intakes lower than 300 mg/day are associated with an almost fivefold increase in the risk of developing rickets. A number of factors influence tolerance of or sensitization to cow's milk, including genetic predisposition, infections, alteration of intestinal microflora, age at first exposure, maternal diet, antigen transmission through breastmilk, and the nature, quantity and frequency of antigen load (Fiocchi et al., 2010). According to a recent review (Flom and Sicherer, 2019), the prevalence of cow's milk allergy (CMA) in high-income coun- tries at one year of age ranges between 0.5 percent and 3 percent. The authors focus specifically on IgE mediated CMA and observe that available studies are very heterogeneous, making comparison and estimates difficult. In a review of nine guidelines published between 2012 and 2019, Vincent et al. (2022) indicate that existing CMA guidance for infants may lead to caregivers mistaking normal infant reactions to cow milk for CMA, and therefore to overdiagnosis. It seems that 70 percent of children with CMA can tolerate baked foods containing milk if extensively heated (Sicherer and Sampson, 2018). In cross-sectional studies a CMA prevalence of 0.6 percent to 2.5 percent of pre-schoolers, 0.3 percent of older children and teens, and less than 0.5% percent of adults is reported (Fiocchi et al., 2010). WHO's guiding principles on complementary feeding indicate that there is no evidence that avoiding potentially allergenic foods (such as eggs and milk) after the age of six months can delay or prevent reactions (PAHO, 2003). However, they advise delaying consumption of liquid milk until after 12 months of age because of the risk of contamination wherever hygiene is poor. Diets that completely exclude milk, especially long- term diets of this kind, need to be monitored to control for nutritional adequacy, as there is a risk of negative outcomes, and there should be a passage to normal diets as soon as feasible (Fiocchi et al., 2010). 4.2 Egg hypersensitivity Egg hypersensitivity is one of the most frequent food aller - gies and has an estimated prevalence of 1.7 percent (Hasan, Wells and Davis, 2013). It is the most common food allergy in children with atopic dermatitis (Benhamou et al., 2010). While the first studies date back to the 1980s (Hasan, Wells and Davis, 2013), egg hypersensitivity is a complex phenomenon that has only partially been characterized (Benhamou et al., 2010). Ovomucoid, one of the proteins found in egg white, is the dominant allergen, although it only makes up 10 percent of egg-white protein (Benhamou et al., 2010). Unlike other egg proteins, ovomucoid is heat-resistant. Clinical signs usually appear during the first year of life (Benhamou et al., 2010) and can include hives, wheezing, vomiting, eczema, asthma and, very rarely, anaphylaxis (Hasan, Wells and Davis, 2013). Mild reaction in the past does not exclude severe reactions in the future, and vice versa (Hasan, Wells and Davis, 2013). Some initial studies related to the resolution of the condi- tion have indicated that the majority of children outgrow egg allergy before they reach school age, while others do so during their late teens (Hasan, Wells and Davis, 2013). Consumption of baked or well-cooked eggs (350 \u00b0C for 20 minutes) can accelerate the development of tolerance to eggs (Hasan, Wells and Davis, 2013). As in the case of eggs, WHO recommendations on comple - mentary feeding advise introducing eggs at six months, as no evidence is available on the benefit of delayed consumption for the purpose of allergy prevention (PAHO, 2003).117 Section C | Effects of terrestrial animal source food on health and nutrition over the life course5. Policies shaping consumption of terrestrial animal source food Food and nutrition-related policies inform food consump - tion patterns at national, regional and global levels (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO, 2021). This subsection explores how policy can shape the food system, thereby influencing consumption of common TASFs, such as milk and dairy products, red meat, poultry and eggs. Food, nutrition and health policies can have a significant impact on the quantity and diversity of TASF consumed by the public (Bechthold et al., 2018). Unlike agricultural and supply-chain policies, which affect the quantity and quality of food produced, food-based policies influence the food system of an entire commodity sector. For exam- ple, according to a model developed by Springmann et al. (2020), moderation of red-meat consumption, as suggested by contemporary food-based dietary guide - lines (FBDGs), could potentially reduce average green- house-gas emissions by 13 percent and premature mortal- ity by 15 percent. Miller et al. (2021) note that 70 percent of FBDGs encourage increased dairy consumption, while less than 55 percent advocate increased consumption of meat. The authors suggest that these guidelines may have influenced school feeding policies, many of which now aim to reduce or moderate meat consumption while increasing dairy consumption in order to improve health and environ- mental sustainability. National, regional and global policies must balance the various implications of TASF consumption (Herforth et al., 2019). This means adjusting consumption recommen- dations based on their health outcomes in the generic population and among vulnerable groups and concerns over environmental and socio-economic impacts, while accounting for emerging ethical concerns such as animal welfare (Dave et al., 2021). As these policies evolve, it will be important to take stock of the changes made and ensure that recommendations align with the contexts they aim to influence. In view of the importance of policy, the following five sets of food and nutrition-related instruments (see Box C6)were reviewed as part of this assessment in order to determine trends in global policy on TASF consumption: FBDGs from the FAO FBDG website (FAO, 2021a); NCD policy from the WHO NCD document repository (WHO, 2021a); nutrition policy from the WHO global database on the implementa- tion of nutrition action (GINA) (WHO, 2021); food legislation from the FAOLEX database (FAO, 2021c); and food and agri- culture policy decisions from the FAO Food and Agriculture Policy Decision Analysis (FAPDA) Database (FAO, 2021d). Nutrition policies and programmes are guidance docu- ments or policy frameworks that contain diet-related guidelines and commitments related to healthy diets and nutrition outcomes (WHO, 2018). These documents often aim to address local malnutrition-related issues such as stunting and wasting in children under five years of age. The WHO Global Database on the Implementation of Nutrition Action (GINA) is a repository of such documents. All documents were reviewed manually to identify policies related to TASF consumption. Documents were considered in all languages, as published. FBDGs from all years availa- ble on the FAO food-based dietary guideline website were included in the review. For the other above-mentioned databases, all documents published from 2016 to 2021 were considered. Both the search terms and keywords used in each database are detailed in Box C6. In addition to the search criteria and keywords, the review considered the following for each policy recommendation: country; region; quantitative/qualitative status; target group within the life cycle (general [adults], infants, young children, adolescents, women of reproductive age, pregnant women, lactating women, older men, older women, older adults in general); and document type (FBDG, NCD, nutrition recommenda- tion, policy framework) (see Annex Tables C10-C15). The flow diagram presented in Figure C4 summarizes the process. The review also considered whether recommendations relate to human micronutrient needs, overweight, obesity or diet-related NCDs such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer, whether they include environmental sustainability considerations (e.g whether recommended serving sizes are based on environmental considerations) and whether they follow a life-course approach (with a focus on meeting the needs of nutritionally vulnerable individuals). In addition, the review noted references to an emerging topic of concern - animal welfare.118 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesBox C6. Food and nutrition-related policy instruments Food-based dietary guidelines FBDGs are government-endorsed documents that promote healthy diets (Wijesinha-Bettoni et al., 2021). They typically aim to influence the food environment and consumer behaviour, guiding individuals towards choosing/demanding healthier diets (Leroy and Cofnas, 2020). FAO takes a leading role in providing technical support for their development: a full list of national FBDGs is provided on the FAO website (FAO, 2021a). Non-communicable disease (NCD) policy documents NCD documents are targets, policies and guidelines that focus on the prevention and treatment of NCDs, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer (Boudreaux et al., 2020). These documents often make dietary recommendations, with the primary goal of either reducing the symptoms of an NCD or support- ing healthy lifestyle choices that reduce NCD risk. TASF consumption is a common theme, with lean meat, egg and low-fat dairy intakes suggested as good sourc- es of micronutrients that support growth and prevent undernutrition. Moderating or reducing consumption of fatty meat, processed meat and red meat is suggest- ed as a means of reducing the risk of obesity, cardio - vascular disease and cancer (Herforth et al., 2019). The WHO NCD repository contains a rich set of global NCD documents, making it an ideal source for NCD-related national publications.FAOLEX FAOLEX is a repository of national laws, regulations and policies on food, agriculture and natural-resources management. Legal and regulatory documents and policy frameworks have strong implications for the food systems within their remit. For example, Mexico's use of fiscal policy to tax soft-drinks has led to a reduc- tion in the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages among young children and adolescents (Thow et al., 2018). Another example is the mandatory fortification of grain products with folic acid in several countries, which has significantly reduced the prevalence of spina bifida in newborn babies globally (Martinez et al., 2021). Many countries have implemented food policies and legislation related to the consumption of TASF, with legislation often targeting school feeding programmes (Miller et al., 2021). FAO's database on national policy documents (FAPDA) Like FAOLEX, FAPDA contains national documenta - tion related to food, agriculture and natural-resources management. FAPDA, however, focuses mainly on policy framework decisions, which define the basis for broad-based strategic, programmatic and financial planning on food systems, including those linked to the consumption of food produced by the livestock sector.

PRISMA Flow diagram assessing policy trends related to TASF consumption120 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesRecommendations on consumption of terrestrial animal source foods: This subsection discusses the collated results obtained from the five databases analysed. Most recommendations are found in the FBDGs, which also contain the highest number of quantitative recom- mendations, mostly on milk, dairy products, eggs and meat (see Figures C5 and C6). One example of quantita- tive recommendations is the following from China: \"the recommended daily intake for lean meat is 120-200 g\" (Chinese Nutrition Society, 2016). The other types of policy document have fewer recommendations, and these are mostly qualitative and largely generic. One example of a qualitative recommendation is the following from Nigeria: \"children 25-60 months of age should consume meat, milk and eggs when possible\" (Federal Ministry of Health Abuja, 2006).

Quantitative recommendations on terrestrial animal source food, by type of policy document121 Section C | Effects of terrestrial animal source food on health and nutrition over the life courseRecommendations related to micronutrients: FBDGs from at least 95 countries acknowledge TASF consumption as part of the daily diet. The nutrient benefits of TASF are also recognized in NCD-related documents and in other legal documents and policy frameworks, with approxi- mately 20 countries linking TASF consumption to a healthy diet. Micronutrient-related recommendations in FBDGs are evenly distributed across country-income groups. However, the granularity of these recommendations was found to be variable across countries (Figure C7). For example, Sierra Leone's FBDG states that \"animal source food tend to be better sources of some micronutrients than plant-source foods, particularly iron, zinc and calcium\" (Government of Sierra Leone, 2016) and Kenya's mentions that \"foods of animal origin, due to their high bioavailability in micro - nutrients and as an important source of protein play a key role in improving the nutritional condition of populations\" (Kenya Ministry of Health, 2017), while New Zealand's states that \"red meat is an excellent source of key nutrients like iron (in an easily absorbed form) as well as zinc; low iron levels are a problem for some New Zealanders, particu- larly young women\" (Ministry of Health New Zealand, 2020) and Belgium's encourages citizens to \"have at least three servings of dairy per day, as these are a good source of calcium and vitamin D\" (Minister van Sociale Zaken en Volksgezondheid, 2020). Further examples from FBDGs are provided in Annex Table C7. One instrument found in the FAOLEX database mandates serving dairy in school meals to boost nutritional status: Honduras's Law of the Glass of Milk for Strengthening School Lunch (Legislative Decree No. 452010) requires the serving of \"a glass of milk to fortify the school snack\" (Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica de Honduras, Number of incomeLower middle incomeUpper middle incomeHigh income Qualitative Total050100150200250300350Figure C7. Quantitative and qualitative micronutrient recommendations, by country income classificationQuantitative recommendations, such as advice to consume three servings of 250ml of milk per day, are more frequently present in the FBDGs of middle- and higher-income coun- tries than in those from other countries (Cocking et al., 2020). These recommendations are often linked to specific age groups, for example the following statement from a docu- ment from New Zealand: \"pre-schoolers should have two to three servings of milk and milk products per day\" (Ministry of Health New Zealand, 2021). Lower-income countries tend to make more generic qualitative recommendations that indicate TASF as a good source of micronutrients, for exam- ple the following instance from Bangladesh: \"meat/ poultry/ eggs are good sources of haem iron\" (Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation in Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders, 2013). Some of the most comprehen- sive recommendations on TASF consumption, covering specific food groups, vulnerable demographics and daily dietary guidelines, are to be found in FBDGs from high-in- come countries such as Denmark, New Zealand and the United Stated of America (Wyness, 2016) where average meat intake is well over 150 g/day (FAO, 2021e). In the case of LMICs, there are some variations by region, with the majority of Latin American countries having some form of quantitative guidelines, while most African coun- tries currently lack FBDGs and do not have TASF recommen- dations in their policy frameworks and legal documents. Interestingly, small-island developing states in general tend to lack detailed recommendations related not only to TASF consumption but also to most other food groups. The above findings give rise to the following points for consideration. First, country income status plays a role in the development of more quantitative recommendations on micronutrient-related TASF consumption, but it does not necessarily result in the systematic inclusion of specific recommendations for nutritionally vulnerable groups or recommendations aimed at preventing TASF consumption above agreed levels associated with overweight, obesity and NCDs. Second, the level of detail in recommendations on TASF consumption within FBGDs varies even among lower-income countries, with public-health concerns likely to play a role; for example, overweight and obesity tend to be a growing issue in Latin American countries (Caballero et al., 2017), which may explain the greater emphasis on quantitative recommendations in these countries relative to small-island developing states and African countries. Recommendations related to non-communica- ble diseases: While the food legislation and food and 122 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesagriculture policy decisions reviewed do not discuss NCD risks, the FBDGs and the NCD-related policies contain several recommendations on TASF selection and moder - ation in the diet. NCD-related recommendations from 55 countries were found, with approximately 317 specific recommendations, which is almost 50 percent less than the number of countries with micronutrient-related recommendations. As with micronutrient-related recommendations, NCD-related recommendations are evenly distributed across coun- try income groups (Figure C8). For example, Guatemala (Ministerio de Salud P\u00fablica y Asistencia Social, 2012) and Ecuador (Ministerio de Salud P\u00fablica Ecuador and FAO, 2021) respectively advise the general population to \"consume lean meats up to four times per week\" and \"limit the consumption of red meat and avoid processed meats; do not eat more than 500 g (cooked weight) per week red meat, such as beef, pork and lamb; eat small amounts or no meat and processed meat such as sausages, hams, and bacon\" , while the United States of America (United States Department of Health and Human Services and United States Department of Agriculture, 2015) and Singapore (Health Promotion Board and Ministry of Health Singapore, 2016) respectively advise them to \"reduce saturated fat intake\" and note that \"non-lean meats and dairy may cause weight gain.\" Number of recommendations QuantitativeLow incomeLower middle incomeUpper Qualitative Total020406080100120140160Figure C8. Quantitative and qualitative non-communicable disease recommendations, by country income classification NCD-related recommendations lack granularity, do not adequately target vulnerable groups and do not consider risks associated with the links between NCDs and micronu- trient deficiency and overweight and obesity. Many of the frameworks and guidelines reviewed focus solely on reduc - ing animal fat and processed-meat consumption as risk factors for overweight, obesity and NCDs. For example, the risk of obesity due to consumption of meat above specific levels is well-recognized in the French dietary guidelines for children aged below 36 months and for those aged between three and 17 years (Haut Conseil de la sant\u00e9 Publique, 2020), which states that \"adolescents should consume no more than 500 g/week of meat.\" However, there is no acknowledgement of the risk to development or of anaemia associated with a lack of meat consumption. It is also notable that some countries with a recognized prob - lem of the double burden of malnutrition focus only on the obesity, overweight and NCD-related risks associated with TASF consumption. Only three out of the 317 recommendations found in NCD-related policies link TASF intake to undernutrition, including risks of micronutrient deficiencies. These recom- mendations are from the Dominican Republic (targeting undernourished individuals) (El Despacho de la Primera Dama Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, 2009), Lesotho (target - ing children under five years of age) (Food and Nutrition Coordinating Office Lesotho, 2016) and Slovenia (target - ing older adults) (Republic of Slovenia Ministry of Health, 2016). Recommendations related to meat consumption: The distribution of quantitative recommendations by country for meat are presented in Figure C9. The data were obtained from a review of 123 FBDGs, 61 NCD documents, 41 policy frameworks and five nutrition policy recommendation documents from 127 distinct countries. These were found to contain 139 detailed quantitative meat-related recom- mendations in total, with variations in the recommended number of grams per capita per day and considerable gaps between the recommended daily intakes for meat and the average daily supply of unprocessed and processed meat for the respective countries as extrapolated from FAOSTAT's supply utilization accounts. Recommendations related to environmental sustain- ability: Environmental sustainability concerns associated with livestock farming have come to the fore in recent years. As concerns over climate change have grown, as indicated by renewed commitments from countries at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2021, TASF consumption has come under the spotlight. However, the review of recommendations on TASF consumption indicates that very few of these recommen- dations link TASF consumption directly to environmental 123 Section C | Effects of terrestrial animal source food on health and nutrition over the life course Recommendation per day Unprocessed Processed United States of State of) BelgiumBangladeshAustriaAustraliaAlgeria050100150200250Figure recommendations versus estimated average daily supply of unprocessed and processed meat Note: All available quantitative data on recommended meat consumption (recommendations/guidelines specifically referring to \"meat\" as the target food group) were obtained from national FBDGs; qualitative data were excluded. The data were compared to supply data from FAOSTAT's supply utilization accounts ( FAO. 2022. FAOSTAT . February from the element \"food supply quantity (g/cap/day)\" from 2019 were used. The \"unprocessed meat supply (g/cap/day)\" category included: meat nes; meat, bird buffalo; camel; cattle; cattle, meat, duck; meat, extracts; meat, game; meat, meat, goose and guinea fowl; meat, horse; meat, mule; meat, other rodents; sheep; sea. \"processed meat supply (g/cap/day)\" category included: bacon and ham; meat nes, preparations; meat, beef and veal sausages; meat, beef, dried, salted, smoked; meat, beef, preparations; meat, chicken, canned; meat, dried nes; meat, homogenized preparations; meat, pig sausages; meat, pig, preparations. Across all countries, standard data collection methods were used. concerns. Only eight countries were found to have recom- mendations that make this link: Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Italy, South Africa, Sweden and Uruguay (Figure C10). The number of policy recommen- dations that connect TASF consumption and environmen- tal sustainability is limited, probably because the global climate agenda for food systems is nascent and policy is updated only periodically. Most of the recommenda- tions are qualitative, for example \"to reduce the effect on the environment, eat a more plant-based diet and less meat\" (Denmark) (Lassen et al., 2020) or \"there is evidence supporting a lesser environmental impact of patterns of eating higher in plant-based foods and lower in animal- based foods. Potential benefits include helping to conserve soil, water and air\"(Canada) (Health Canada, 2019). Only one quantitative recommendation was found: \"to limit environmental impact, reduce consumption of meat to a maximum of 500 g per week, consume two to three portions of dairy products per day, more is not necessary and eat fish (only) once a week\" (the Netherlands) (Stichting Voedingscentrum Nederland, 2020). A list of environmen- tal sustainability recommendations is provided in Annex Table C8.QuantitativeLow incomeLower middle incomeUpper middle incomeHigh income Qualitative Total012345678910Figure C10. Quantitative and qualitative sustainability recommendations, by country income classification TASF consumption can be excessive in high-income coun- tries. A relative reduction in consumption may therefore benefit the environment. However, countries that wish to develop recommendations linked to environmental sustainability should ensure that they reflect local and regional realities. For example, some populations depend on agropastoral livelihoods and animal protein from 124 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomeslivestock. Many populations, including those most nutri- tionally vulnerable, such as children, adolescent girls and pregnant and lactating women, have lower TASF consump - tion than the average of the national population, especially in low-income settings. At present, recommendations on TASF consumption linked to environmental sustainability are nascent and mostly driven by environmental concerns in high- income countries. If generalized without attention to context, they may run the risk of jeopardizing health (in addition to generating other risks, such as those related to the economy and trade balances). It is suggested that context-specific and granular recommendations are needed in all countries irrespective of their income classifi- cation (Adesogan et al., 2020). Recommendations related to animal welfare: Animal welfare is a contemporary topic in food and nutrition policy (Buller et al., 2018). While the COVID19 pandemic has raised some concerns, most of world's countries do not account for animal welfare in their food and nutrition guidelines. In fact, out of 1 161 recommendations found in the review, there were only two related to animal welfare. The Danish FBDGs, The official dietary guidelines - good for health and climate, suggest that \"the state animal welfare label will enable consumers to select animals that live up to the requirements for animal welfare; this includes milk and milk products\" (Lassen et al., 2020). These guidelines recommend that labels including animal-welfare scores should be attached to TASF products to inform consum- ers about the quality of life had by the animals from which the products come. The Danish FBDGs suggest that consumers select foods that have a high animal-welfare score. Similarly, the Swedish FBDGs, The Swedish dietary guidelines - find your way to eat greener, not too much and be active, suggest that \"if you cut back on meat, you'll have enough money for meat produced more sustain- ably, with attention paid to the welfare of the animals\" (Livsmedelverket, 2015). It remains to be seen whether labelling schemes such as those in Denmark and Sweden will gain traction, and how soon such policies will be adopted in LMICs. However, in planning any such measures it is prudent to consider the economic and nutritional concerns that may be associated them. As with environmental sustainability issues, intro - duction of animal welfare guidelines requires a multifac - eted overview of the entire food system and all its drivers. Non-specific, generic guidelines may risk jeopardizing food and nutrition security. Life-course analysis for vulnerable groups: Recom- mendations related to vulnerable groups feature in the FBDGs and in other policy documents. These include recommendations referring to pregnant and lactating women, infants, young children, adolescents and older adults. Of these groups, recommendations for adolescents, young children and infants are the most common. In total, 378 recommendations related to vulnerable groups were found, 325 of which came from FBDGs . Colombia's FBDGs suggest that \"to prevent anaemia, chil- dren, teenagers and young women should eat organ meats once a week\" (Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar and FAO, 2020) and Cuba's suggest that \"children aged 36 years should consume two servings of meat, poultry or eggs per day\" (Ministerio de Salud P\u00fablica, 2009), while FBDGs (Stichting Voedingscentrum Infants Young childrenAdolescents Women of reproductive agePregnant womenLactating womenOlder adults Low income Lower middle income Upper middle income High income TotalFigure C11. Quantitative and qualitative life-course recommendations, by country income classification125 Section C | Effects of terrestrial animal source food on health and nutrition over the life courseNederland, 2020) and Latvia (Veselbas ministrijas, 2003) respectively suggest that \"girls aged 14-18 should consume 600 g per day of milk\" and that \"pregnant women consume protein-rich products - lean meat, fish, eggs, legumes, nuts and seeds, including three to four servings per day.\" Further examples are listed in Annex Table C9. While the life-course related recommendations identified come mostly from high- income countries, a small number of such recommendations from low-income countries were also iden- tified (Figure C11). Within the documents that did make such recommendations, there was found to be a similar number of quantitative and qualitative recommendations. There are still many countries that lack TASF consumption guidelines, both for the general population and for vulnerable groups. Although clear recommendations on TASF consump - tion for vulnerable groups should be included in every coun- try's FBDGs, data indicate that - as with other categories of food - other drivers within the food system, such as economic status, food access, agricultural productivity and consumer education, also have a critical influence on TASF consumption (Comerford et al., 2021; FAO, 2021e).126 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes6. Gaps and needs in the evidence base The above-described evaluation of the literature on the effects of TASF on nutrition and health outcomes reveals that this literature has several limitations. Most evidence comes from observational studies that have limitations with regard to causal inference. These studies were found to have considerable heterogeneity in design with respect to context (high-income countries versus LMIC), interven- tion/exposure (quantity of TASF intakes) and counterfac - tual or control groups. In most studies, the comparison group was consuming usual diets that may or may not have been healthy. More data are needed on co-consumption of other foods with TASFs in dietary patterns and on the effects of TASF relative to those of healthy PBFs and other substitution or replacement foods. There was found to be moderate-to-serious risk of bias in the evidence. Some TASFs were found to be overrepresented in the literature relative to other TASFs, which limits the evidence base for particular life-course phases. A summary of the gaps and research needs identified is presented below. General across all life-course periods: $ Rigorous evidence: Experimental trials are needed for all TASF and human-health outcomes, and these need to have continuity in design, including in terms of the comparator group or counterfactual, the context-spe - cific factors and the dose (quantity of TASF). $ TASF within diets and overall dietary patterns: A holis - tic examination of animal source foods (terrestrial and aquatic) within broader dietary patterns is needed in relation to health benefits and risks. $ Cognition, neurodevelopment and mental health: Evidence points to positive effects of TASF on cognition and neurodevelopment, especially during childhood, but more evidence is needed across the entire life course. The effects of TASF on mental health are under - studied. Specific life-course periods: $ Pregnancy/lactation: More research is needed on the nutrition and health effects of TASFs other than milk and dairy products. The effects of TASF on the nutrition and health of the mother should also be examined to a greater extent. Research on TASF impacts on foetal, neonate and infant brain development is also needed. $ Infants and young children: There are gaps in the evidence for the nutrition and health effects of consum- ing meats from pigs, poultry, goats, sheep, wild animals and insects. There is a need for more research on the effects of TASF consumption on bone health, brain development and immune system pathways. Minimum frequency and quantity of TASF needed is another gap in the literature for this life-course phase. $ School-age children and adolescents: Gaps in the literature remain for the effects of egg consumption on school-age children and adolescents and for the effects of consuming other TASFs such as meat from pigs, poultry, goats, sheep, wild animals and insects on these groups. This age-group should be studied for the impacts of TASF consumption on brain development, school performance, endocrine-system functioning and growth plasticity, body composition (bone density, muscle mass, fat mass), and anaemia and iron defi- ciency. $ Adults: Significant gaps remain for meats other than beef and for effects on nutrition and health outcomes. Additional evidence on the effects of TASF consump - tion in unhealthy populations (diabetic, overweight/ obese) may be merited in view of the high prevalence of these conditions. Confirmative research is needed on the effects TASF consumption on iron and zinc defi- ciencies. Research gaps remain for the health effects on adults of consuming meats from wild animals and insects. $ Older adults: There is a need to prioritize this life-course phase in view of global demographic trends. Research on the effects of TASF consumption in older adults should further examine bone health, muscle mass (sarcopenia), neurocognitive function, and general health and well-being. As in the case of younger adults, research may be needed on the nutrition and health impacts of TASF consumption in unhealthy popula- tions. Population representation: $ Greater representation of certain populations globally in studies of the effects of TASF consumption may be needed, particularly populations in certain phases of the life course. For example, more evidence on older adults is needed from LMICs. More research on TASF consumption and overweight/obesity and chronic disease outcomes is needed from low-income coun- tries. There are also gaps in knowledge on TASF intakes and their effects on nutrition and health outcomes among Indigenous Peoples and in countries experienc - ing humanitarian crises.127 Section C | Effects of terrestrial animal source food on health and nutrition over the life course7. Implications for food and nutrition policies and programming Policy recommendations: $ Small-island developing states and many African countries lack updated FBDGs, and TASF-related recommendations are hardly present in food and nutrition policies. Further work in this area is recommended. $ National FBDGs should be updated with a view to adequately considering TASF and specific nutrient requirements during the life course, where these factors are not yet considered. Given the increasing coexistence of micronutrient deficiencies and NCDs, recommendations should take into account the implications of TASF consumption above or below specific levels. Given that the double burden of malnutrition affects most LMICs, recommendations on TASF should not focus only on NCD-related risks but should also consider the role of TASF in the prevention of undernutri- tion, especially among vulnerable age groups. $ In upcoming policy documents, it is critical that countries make context-specific recommendations, accounting for existing levels of TASF intake, the needs of vulnerable groups based on their life-course stage and other socio-eco - nomic factors, the most prevalent forms of malnutrition in both rural and urban areas, and potential trade-offs with the environmental, socioeconomic and cultural dimensions of sustainability. $ Many countries' food and nutrition guidelines and policy frameworks need to be updated to reflect TASF consump - tion as part of healthy diets, but these documents alone will not guarantee healthy TASF consumption; other factors, such as national programmes, consumer awareness, the quality of the supply chain and food environment also play a significant role. Programming recommendations: $ When appropriate, animal milk should be promoted - as part of diverse, healthy diets - to improve the nutrition and health of pregnant and lactating women, with adaptations based on context, for example to account for cultural pref - erences, background nutritional status, dietary patterns or access to TASF. $ Eggs, milk and meat should be promoted - as part of diverse, healthy diets - for infants and young children, school- age children and adolescents, with adaptations based on context, for example to account for cultural preferences, background nutritional status, dietary patterns or access to TASF. $ Meat, in moderate quantities within diverse, healthy diets, should be promoted to reduce iron deficiency anaemia across all life-course phases. $ Healthy diets that include TASF intakes in moderate quantities could be promoted in apparently healthy adults and older adults.128 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomesReferences Abreu, S., Santos, P .C., Montenegro, N. & Mota, J. 2017.

This is mainly linked to bacterial causes and diarrhoea. While evidence on food-borne disease (FBD) hazards and health outcomes has been documented, as have risk analysis methods, data on the burden (inci- dence and severity) of these diseases are lacking in many countries. Understanding the main disease-transmission routes along the value chain is crucial if national policies are to be improved, yet these are not well documented. u Changing agricultural practices, especially the intensification of livestock production and increased use of inputs (e.g. feed and veterinary medicine), the lengthening and broadening of value chains and shifts towards consump - tion of processed food contribute to increased exposure to food-borne (FBD) disease hazards. Antimicrobial resi- dues present additional challenges. u Reducing the food-borne disease burden requires improvements to hygiene and sanitation and mitigation of health risks at the animal-human-environment interface, through a One Health approach. Sensitization of the public, including education programmes that target food producers, transporters, processors, storage-facility operators, distributors and consumers, has the potential to improve food safety. Improvements can be achieved by strength- ening and enforcing national food-control systems. Verifiable evidence is needed to support such interventions. Summary Ensuring safe and nutritious food, especially food of terrestrial animal origin, is a global public-health challenge. The interlinkages between unsafe food, poor nutrition and the absence of food security create a vicious cycle of disease and malnutrition that particularly affects the young, older people, the immunocompromised and the sick. The United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition 2016-2025 highlights the need to integrate food safety into the global food-security and nutrition agenda if significant progress on improving nutrition is to be made. Subsection 2 introduces concepts and terms used in the discussion of food safety and FDBs. This includes concepts and terms related to risk assessment, disease-burden metrics (DALYs), zoonoses, markets, food control, food-safety management and surveillance. The methods used to prepare this subsection are also described. Subsection 3 highlights the significance of risk-based approaches to the mitigation of FDBs. The concepts of food risks and food hazards are presented and differentiated, as is the role of risk assessment, which provides the scien- tific basis for evaluating known or potential health effects resulting from human exposure to food-borne hazards. Subsections 4 and 5 discuss food-borne hazards and their impacts. An understanding of hazards and risks is impor - tant in risk management. The World Health Organization has reported that, based on a conservative estimate, about 600 million people each year become sick after eating contaminated food, and 420 000 people die - result - ing in the loss of 33 million healthy life years. The economic burden of unsafe food is huge. An annual total loss of USD 110 billion has been estimated for LMICs. The burden of FBDs is not equally distributed. Children have been shown to bear the greatest burden. Subsections 6 and 7 discuss agrifood systems and associated value-chain activities, including markets. Adopted in 2015, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for transformation in agrifood systems in order to end hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition by 2030. Sustainable agrifood systems promote food security and nutrition while ensuring that the economic, social and environmental bases needed to provide food security and nutrition for future generations are not compromised. Achievement of several of the SDGs, includ- ing zero hunger, health and wellbeing, clean water and sanitation, and responsible production, can be promoted through improved food safety, including that of TASF. In developing countries, a significant proportion of TASF is marketed through informal markets. Such markets, especially wet markets, have been heavily linked to the emer -Section D | Food safety and food-borne diseases 141gence of important zoonotic pathogens. Public pressure is driving regulators to increase scrutiny of these markets and enforce food-safety standards. Interventions to ensure the safe and hygienic operation of food markets can mitigate risks associated both with live animals and with their products. Subsection 8 presents factors that should be considered in efforts to mitigate FBDs. These include risk-based approaches to food-safety management, regulations that specify and enforce food-safety requirements, provision of an enabling environment for food safety and adoption of the One Health approach (an integrated, unifying approach that aims to sustainably balance and optimize the health of people, animals and ecosystems). Subsection 9 summarizes current evidence gaps. National food-control systems need to be strengthened to ensure food safety and protect public health. Surveillance systems are required that facilitate the collection of country-specific epidemiological data and support the updating of FDB burden estimates, especially for developing countries. Risk assessment studies that inform prioritization and decision-making are lacking, as are traceability and food-recall tools.Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 1421. Introduction Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life (FAO, 1996). Food and nutritional security are realized when food is safe to eat and consumers have confidence in their food supply (Jaffee et al., 2019). According to the work programme of United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition 2016-2025, integrating food safety into the global food security and nutrition agenda would allow significant progress to be made on improving nutrition (FAO and WHO, 2016). Food-borne diseases (FBDs) present serious threats to public health globally. More than 200 different FBDs have been identified (Mead et al., 1999). The majority of these are caused by diarrhoeal disease agents (WHO, 2015). The relationship between diarrhoea and malnutrition is bidi- rectional: diarrhoea leads to malnutrition and malnutrition exacerbates diarrhoea (Nel, 2010). FBDs can contribute to undernutrition by increasing nutrient requirements while also causing loss of appetite, reducing food intake and increasing malabsorption and metabolic loss of nutrients (Gross et al., 2000). Malnutrition affects the functioning of all body systems (Saunders and Smith, 2010). The Food-borne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG) of the World Health Organization (WHO) ana- lysed a total of 31 FBD hazards and estimated that these caused 600 million illnesses and 420 000 deaths globally in 2010, resulting in a burden of 33 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) (WHO, 2015). One DALY is equivalent to the loss of one year of healthy life (see Box D1). The study con- sidered 11 diarrhoeal disease agents (one virus, seven bac - teria and three protozoa), seven invasive infectious disease agents (one virus, five bacteria and one protozoon), ten helminths and three chemicals. The majority (91.7 percent) of the 600 million cases were caused by diarrhoeal disease agents, such as norovirus (responsible for 124 million cases) and Campylobacter spp. (responsible for 96 million cases). Despite these high numbers of cases, diarrhoeal agents accounted for only 55 percent of the FBD burden. The impact of food-borne metals on the burden of disease are largely overlooked; however, results from a study by FERG indicated that ingestion of arsenic, methylmercury, lead and cadmium resulted in more than 1 million illness - es, over 56 000 deaths, and more than 9 million DALYs worldwide in 2015 (Gibb et al., 2019). FBD burden is not equally distributed. Children under five years of age bear 40 percent of the DALY burden according to FERG data; geographically, they are most likely to die from FBDs in sub-Saharan Africa, followed by South Asia (Jaffee et al., 2019). African subregions have the highest DALY bur - den (ranging from 1 200 to 1 300 DALYs per 100 000 popula- tion in 2010), followed by Southeast Asian subregions (rang- ing from 690 to 710 DALYs per 100 000 population in 2010) (WHO, 2015). The North American subregion has the lowest burden: 35 DALYs per 100 000 population in (WHO, 2015). Livestock and other animals used for food may transfer hazards to TASFs and present significant risks to public health (Abebe, Gugsa and Ahmed, 2020; Haileselassie et al., 2013; Heredia and Garc\u00eda, 2018). The burden associated with consumption of contaminated TASFs is estimated at 168 DALYs per 100 000 population (about 35 percent of the global burden of FBDs) (Li et al., 2019). A World Bank study (Jaffee et al., 2019) estimated that unsafe food costs USD 110 billion per year in LMICs, includ- ing productivity losses (USD 95.2 billion) and treatment (USD 15 billion). Improving food safety will facilitate the achievement of several of the SDGs, including zero hun- ger, health and wellbeing, clean water and sanitation, and responsible production. Safe food can promote trade and enhance national and regional economies and development. Food-safety stand- ards are intended to protect the health and safety of citi- zens and ensure fair trade in food and food products, thus providing opportunities to promote national and regional economies (FAO and WHO, 2018b). The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures6 (SPS Agreement) is designed to facilitate trade between devel- oped and developing countries by improving transparency, promoting harmonization and preventing countries from imposing arbitrary food standards. However, effective imple - mentation of the SPS Agreement in developing economies requires commitment to capacity building and appropri- ate national action (Athukorala and Jayasuriya, 2003). The Standards and Trade Development Facility helps developing 6 https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/sps_e/spsagr_e.htmSection D | Food safety and food-borne diseases 143countries meet SPS standards through capacity building and ensuring trade in safe products. SDGs 8 (decent work and eco - nomic development) and 12 (responsible consumption and production) suggest that improving well-being is achievable through trade (Wilson, 2017). Labels and food safety stand- ards may promote or hamper trade and thus affect growth and capacity to attain the relevant SDGs (Wilson, 2017). FERG data provide the best estimate of FBD burden to date. The burden in developing countries is not fully known, but experts believe that it is higher in these countries than else - where (K\u00e4ferstein, 2003; WHO, 2015). This belief is consistent with the following evidence: $ high levels of hazards are often reported in food in devel- oping countries (Grace et al., 2010); $ high prevalence of potential food-borne pathogens are found in hospital and community surveys of child- ren and adults with diarrhoea in developing countries (Fletcher, McLaws and Ellis, 2013); $ an estimated 2 billion people in the world lack access to safe drinking water (WHO and UNICEF, 2021); $ use of human sewage and animal waste for horticultural production is common in developing countries; $ lack of effective government food-control systems is prevalent in developing countries; and $ developing countries tend to lack adequate checks and balances in relevant areas (e.g. little opportunity for suing if food is unsafe). A number of factors may contribute to underestimation of FBD burdens. Illnesses often go untreated, and not all treat - ed cases are reported to health authorities; when they are treated, there is usually no laboratory diagnosis or way of telling whether an illness came from food or from another source, and there are no effective FBD-surveillance systems in LMICs. FBD agents can be transmitted to humans via sever - al routes, including food, animal contact, human-to-human contact and water (Hald et al., 2016). Global disease burden estimates include only the share of illness caused specifical- ly by contaminated food. They are based on experts' best and most recent estimates but are obviously less accurate than nationally representative empirical data. FERG has developed tools and resources to enable countries to carry out national studies of FBD burden. Pilot studies were conducted in four countries (Albania, Japan, Thailand and Uganda), but there were significant data gaps that hin- dered the estimation of FBD burden. In many countries, pro - vision of the data needed to estimate the burden of FBDs nationally and globally would require improved capacity and surveillance (WHO, 2015). For most countries, and at the global level, the data needed to quantify the attribution of potential FBDs to the major transmission routes do not exist (WHO, 2015). Where this is the case, structured elicitation of scientific judgment can be used (Aspinall, 2010; Pires, 2013). Food-safety standards are measures enacted by govern- ments to protect the health and safety of their citizens and the environment in which they live. Although the SPS Agreement facilitates trade between developing and developed countries, this largely depends on the ability of developing countries to participate effectively in the imple - mentation of the agreement. However, most LMICs have negligible or no livestock product exports and are increas - ingly becoming importers of livestock products. This section discusses not only FBDs (i.e. diseases transmit - ted through food) but also diseases transmitted through animal-human contact, focusing on animals used for food.Box D1. Disability-adjusted life years The disability-adjusted life year (DALY) is a standard metric commonly used to measure the impact of diseases on population health. It represents years lived with disa - bility (YLD) (decreased quality of life) and years of life lost (YLL) as a consequence of premature death caused by a given disease or condition at the individual or population level. One DALY can be thought of as one year of \"healthy\" life lost. The burden of disease can be thought of as a measure of the gap between current health status and an ideal situation in which everyone lives into old age, free of disease and disability (WHO, 2008). DALYs aggregate morbidity and disability, expressed as YLD, and mortality, expressed as YLL, into a single figure. DALYs are calculated by adding YLL to YLD (WHO, 2015). DALY = YLD + YLL Where:YLD = the number of incident cases \u00d7 average duration until remission or death \u00d7 disability weight and YLL = number of deaths \u00d7 residual life expectancy at the age at death. Disability refers to any acute or chronic illness that reduces physical or mental health (Chen et al., 2015). Disability weight reflects the severity of the disease on a scale of zero (perfect health) to one (death). Both prevalence and incidence approaches can be used in the computation of DALY estimates (WHO, 2015). YLL are strongly influenced by high mortality rate or death at a young age, whereas YLD are influenced by the number of sequelae, high disability weight and long duration (Devleesschauwer et al., 2015). DALY is an established WHO metric with international application, and for this reason it was used by FERG to estimate FBD burden (WHO, 2015).Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 1442. Concepts, definitions and methods According to WHO, FBDs are diseases commonly transmit - ted through ingested food. These diseases are caused by food hazards, which include microbial pathogens, para- sites, chemicals and biotoxins (WHO, 2014). The effects of FBDs on individuals depend on factors such as their health, nutritional status, age and immunological status and the virulence of the pathogen.This section was prepared by synthesizing available evi- dence using recent literature reviews and guidance provid- ed by international organizations in the area of food safety, including by FAO, WHO, WOAH and UNEP . It focuses on haz - ards, risk analysis, policies and regulations affecting food safety, including the One Health approach. The choice of priority hazards was based on recent FERG estimates and on Global Burden of FBD data (WHO, 2015), with additions from the authors given the limitations of FERG evidence. Box D2. Concepts and methods related to food safety and food-borne diseases Food hazard is a biological, chemical or physical agent in food with the potential to cause adverse health effects (FAO and WHO, 1997). Codex Alimentarius defines food as any substance, whether processed, semi-pro - cessed or raw, that is intended for human consumption, including drink, chewing gum and any substance that has been used in the manufacture, preparation or treat- ment of \"food\" but not including cosmetics or tobacco or substances used only as drugs (FAO and WHO, 2001). Food safety risk is a function of the probability of an adverse health effect and the severity of that effect, consequential to a hazard(s) in food (FAO and WHO, 2001, 2014a). It is possible for hazard contamination to be high yet for the risk to be low, and vice versa. Risk analysis is a process consisting of three compo - nents: risk assessment, risk management and risk communication (FAO and WHO, 2014a). Risk assessment is a scientifically based process consisting of the following steps: 1. hazard identification; 2. hazard characterization; 3. exposure assessment; and 4. risk characterization (FAO and WHO, 2001, 2014a). Risk assessment can be qualitative or quantitative, depend- ing on the approach used and the availability of data. Risk management is the process, distinct from risk assessment, of weighing policy alternatives, in consul- tation with all interested parties, considering risk assessment and other factors relevant for the health protection of consumers and the promotion of fair trade practices, and, if needed, selecting appropriate preven- tion and control options (FAO and WHO, 2014a). Risk communication is the interactive exchange, throughout the risk-analysis process, of information and opinions concerning risk, risk-related factors and risk perceptions, among risk assessors, risk manag- ers, consumers, industry, the academic communi- ty and other interested parties, including the expla - nation of risk-assessment findings and the basis of risk-management decisions (FAO and WHO, 2014a).Zoonoses: the Second Report of the Joint WHO/FAO Expert Committee On Zoonoses defined zoonoses as those diseas- es and infections that are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and humans. Although some may not make the animal sick, they make humans sick. The infections range from minor, often short-term illness- es, to major life-changing ones that can cause death. Zoonotic pathogens may be bacterial, viral or parasitic, or may involve unconventional agents such as prions, and can spread to humans through direct contact or through food, water or the environment (WHO, 2020a). Prions are transmissible particles that are devoid of nucleic acid and seem to be composed exclusively of a modified protein; spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, scrapie in sheep, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans are among key prion diseases (Prusiner, 1998). Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is the ability of micro - organisms to persist or grow in the presence of drugs designed to inhibit or kill them (FAO, 2021). These drugs, known as antimicrobials, are used to treat infect- ious diseases caused by microorganisms, such as bact- eria, fungi, viruses and protozoan parasites. AMR main- ly develops when microorganisms adapt and grow in the presence of antimicrobials (WHO, 2015). It is a major global threat, with implications for public health, food security and the economic well-being of communities. Informal markets: the informal food sector exists in many forms and finding a clear definition for the concept is difficult given the variety of activities and trades that the term embraces (FAO, 2003). Informal markets include economic activities that occur outside formal regulations (e.g. those related to acquiring licenses, registering business and paying taxes) and are mostly guided by informal norms, values and under - standings (Sutter et al., 2017). Informal food business- es are characterized by low capital investments and the absence of specialization, and can exist at various stag- es of the value chain, including production, distribution and retailing (FAO, 2003). (cont.)Section D | Food safety and food-borne diseases 145Food control system: Food control is a mandatory regulatory activity of enforcement by national or local authorities to provide consumer protection and ensure that all foods, during production, handling, storage, processing and distribution are safe, wholesome and fit for human consumption, conform to safety and quality requirements, and are honestly and accurate- ly labelled as prescribed by law (FAO and WHO, 2003). A food control system is the integration of a mandato - ry regulatory approach with preventive and educational strategies to ensure protection of the whole food chain (FAO and WHO, 2003). A national food control system aims to protect the health of consumers by assuring the safety and quality of foods being traded, both national- ly and internationally. FAO and WHO have developed a tool, the Food Control System Assessment Tool, to help member countries assess the effectiveness of their food control systems, demonstrate performance and deter - mine areas that require improvement (FAO, 2020). Surveillance: WHO defines surveillance as the systemat- ic, ongoing collection, collation and analysis of data and the timely dissemination of information to those who need to know so that action can be taken (WHO, 2001). Animal health surveillance, according to the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the World Organization for Animal Health, is a tool for monitoring disease trends, facilitating the control of infection or infestation, providing data for use in risk analysis for animal-health or public-health purposes, substantiating the rationale for sanitary measures and providing assurances to trad- ing partners (WOAH, 2021). Public health surveillance is the ongoing systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of data, closely integrated with the timely dissemination of these data to those responsible for preventing and controlling disease (Thacker and Berkelman, 1988). It provides the scientific and factual data needed to inform decision-making and appropriate action on public health (Nsubuga et al., 2006). Surveillance for food safety is a systematic effort to collect, analyse and interpret data on food contaminants and food consumption and establish effective links with the public-health system to improve the availability of attributable data on food-borne disease (Bishop and Tritscher, 2012). An integrated surveillance system is one that links human and animal disease reporting systems. It can help identify and facilitate a response to known and emerging zoonotic diseases (Mauer and Kaneene, 2005). Residues are traces in food, agricultural commodities or animal feed and result from the use of pesticides or veterinary drugs. Residues of pesticides can include any derivatives of pesticides, such as conversion products, metabolites, reaction products, and impurities of toxi- cological significance (FAO and WHO, 2016). Veterinary drug residues include the parent compounds and/or their metabolites in any edible portion of the animal product and include residues of associated impurities of the veterinary drug concerned (FAO and WHO, 2016). The maximum residue limit is the concentration that is legally tolerated in a food product obtained from an animal that has received a veterinary medicine (FAO and WHO, 2018a). Traceability and recall: Codex Alimentarius Commission defines traceability or product tracing as the ability to follow the movement of a food through a specified stage or stages of production, processing and distribu- tion. Traceability within food control systems is used to control food hazards, provide reliable product informa - tion and guarantee product authenticity (adapted from FAO and WHO, 2012). Recall or product recall is defined as the action of remov - ing food from the market at any stage of the food chain, including when possessed by consumers (FAO and WHO, 2012a). Food recall is a fundamental tool in the management of risks in response to food-safety events and emergencies. Reliable identification and traceabil- ity systems are essential for effective animal disease control systems, food-safety systems and trade in live animals and animal products. Food-safety interventions are control measures added to a process to reduce and ultimately prevent or elim- inate food-safety risks (Bucknavage and Cutter, 2011). Food-safety interventions can be categorized based on where they occur within the food supply chain: prehar - vest interventions occur in the field or on the farm, while post-harvest interventions occur as raw materi- als undergo processing. Food-safety interventions also refer to risk management (see above for definition of this term) (FAO and WHO, 2014a).Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 1463. Hazards versus risks versus risk assessment A food hazard is a biological, chemical or physical agent in, or a condition of, food with the potential to cause an adverse health effect (FAO and WHO, 2014a). Hazards, when ingested by susceptible consumers, have the poten- tial to cause FBDs, which include any illness arising from consumption of contaminated food (Adley and Ryan, 2016). The global burden of FBDs, many of which are car - ried by livestock products, was 33 million DALYs in 2010, based on the burden evidence presented by FERG, which is considered the best to date. Of that burden, 40 percent was borne by children under five years of age (WHO, 2015). Together, the hazards caused 600 million food-borne illnesses (95 percent uncertainty interval [UI] 420-960) and 420 000 deaths (95 percent UI 310 000-600 000) in 2010. As explained in the previous subsection, risk considers the probability or likelihood of an adverse health effect occur - ring and the severity of that effect following exposure, and risk assessment is a scientific process that allows risk to be estimated. A detailed description of hazards, risks and risk assessment is provided below. 3.1 Hazards Food hazards can be biological, chemical or physical, and more than 250 different food-borne hazards have been recognized (Hoffmann and Scallan, 2017; Todd, 2014). Biological hazards include microorganisms, such as bac - teria, viruses, parasites and fungi (Untermann, 1998). Pathogens can enter food anywhere along the value/supply chain - during primary production, processing, distribution, storage or consumption. People with a food-borne illness (or another illness that impacts their immune system) and the environment can also potentially be sources of food contaminants (Schirone et al., 2017). A few bacterial hazards (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium bot - ulinum) can under certain conditions produce toxins, and it is these toxins that cause rapid-onset food-borne illness (Rhodehamel, 1992). Toxins are problematic because they are not destroyed by cooking. For most of the many food-borne pathogens known to cause disease there is insufficient evidence to develop credible global estimates of disease burden. FERG selected 31 important hazards (28 biological pathogens) for which there was sufficient evidence to develop global estimates. The most important in terms of burden were (in declining order) lead, non-typhoidal (NT) Salmonella, 2019; Havelaar et al., 2015). Together, these ten hazards accounted for nearly 75 percent of the total global burden of FBDs. Their significance may vary depending on geo - graphy and the types of foods that comprise the common diets of populations in particular locations. Outbreaks should be assessed in-depth to confirm the presence of the hazards, identify root cause(s), assess trends over time and determine the actions needed to combat future outbreaks (Adley and Ryan, 2016). There is no single clinical syndrome for all FBDs. Diarrhoeal disease agents, particularly norovi- rus, Campylobacter spp., NT Salmonella spp. and E. coli, are the most frequent causes of FBD (> 90 percent) (Havelaar et al., 2015). Their sources range from contamination during the acquisition of food from the live animal to inadvertent or intentional addition during food production, processing or preparation (Adley and Ryan, 2016). The proportion of human infection with a given pathogen that can be attrib - uted to food will differ depending on the agent, the food, the value/supply chain and the ways the food is handled, with only a few FBDs being transmitted exclusively via foods (Hoffmann and Scallan, 2017). Chemical hazards include, but are not limited to, naturally occurring components of certain food ingredients (e.g. lin- armarin, a cassava cyanide [Cereda and Mattos, 1996]), tox - ins produced by microorganisms found in the environment (e.g. mycotoxins), pesticide residues, heavy metals (from raw food ingredients or use of improper food-processing equipment or food-packaging materials) and industrial chemicals (FDA, 2012). Chemical hazards in TASF may result from the use of contaminated feed, the uptake of chemical compounds when animals graze on contaminated soil or the use of veterinary medicines. A good example occurred in Germany in 2010 when illegal use of industrial oils led to fats used for animal feed becoming contaminated with dioxin (Kupferschmidt, 2011). Other examples include the use of furazolidone in animal feed and the melamine crisis in China in 2008 (Chen, 2009; Pei et al., 2011). Physical hazards include, but are not limited to, metal items (wire, needles, etc.), sand, soil, stones, wood, plas - tic, rubber or glass items, and hair (Asselt et al., 2016; Rhodehamel, 1992). Physical hazards may be introduced into the livestock value chain during the production pro - cess (e.g. metal parts of stirring machines, rubber from Section D | Food safety and food-borne diseases 147seals or broken needles). They may also be introduced from packaging materials, especially where these are recy- cled (Geueke, Groh and Muncke, 2018), or because of their presence in raw materials or the environment. 3.2 Risks Analysis of hazards occurring in food makes it easier to iden- tify measures that can be used to reduce people's exposure to them. However, proper mitigation of FBDs requires risk- based approaches - hence the need to understand and differentiate food risks from food hazards. As noted by Fazil (2005), risk is a frequently encountered concept: people sub - consciously assess risks every day. Understanding FBD risks makes it easier to prioritize and manage them and provides a framework for solving trade-related disputes. The food value chain is very complex and involves many players. In a system of this kind, many factors will affect both the likelihood that FBDs will occur and their severity if they do (Fazil, 2005). Factors such as failure to observe good production practices, use of unsafe water to clean and process food, poor storage and unhygienic food-handling practices can increase FBD risks, especially when coupled with inadequate or poorly enforced regulatory standards and a lack of industry compliance (Todd, 2020). A risk profile is a description of the food-safety problem and its context, while a risk estimate is the quantitative outcome of risk characterization (FAO and WHO, 2014a). FBD risks are perceived differently by different catego - ries of people, and this could be related to their levels of food-safety awareness and how well particular risks have been publicized. 3.3 Risk assessment For over half a century, FAO in collaboration with WHO, has formulated scientific advice that has provided the basis for the international food-safety standards, guidelines and codes of practice developed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission on issues related to the following issues (FAO and WHO, 2018d): $ safety assessments of chemicals such as food additives, veterinary drug residues, pesticide residues, contami- nants and natural toxins in food; $ safety assessments of biological agents such as micro - organisms, fungi, parasites and prions in food; $ assessments of practices and technologies used for the production of foods, for example safety assessment of foods derived from biotechnology; and $ issues in human nutrition such as the use of probiotics, human nutrient requirements and food fortification. Risk assessment is the scientific evaluation of known or potential health effects resulting from human exposure to food-borne hazards (FAO and WHO, 2001) and is the first step in the Codex Alimentarius risk-analysis process. The process consists of the following four steps (FAOHazard identification: the identification of the biological agent that may be present in a particular food or group of foods and capable of causing adverse health effects. 1. Hazard characterization: the qualitative or quantitative, or both, evaluation of the nature of adverse health effects associated with the biological agent that may be present in food, and in such cases a dose-response assessment should be performed if the data are obtainable. 2. Exposure assessment: the qualitative or quantitative, or both, evaluation of the likely intake of the biological agent through food, as well as through exposure from other sources, if relevant. 3. Risk characterization: qualitative or quantitative, or both, estimation, including attendant uncertainties, of the probability of occurrence and severity of known or potential adverse health effects in a given population based on hazard identification, hazard characterization and exposure assessment. In 2000, FAO and WHO launched a programme on microbio - logical risk assessment that led to the publication of guide - lines on the various steps of the risk assessment process: $ Hazard characterization for pathogens in food and water: guidelines (WHO and FAO, 2003); $ Viruses in food: scientific advice to support risk manage - ment activities: meeting report (FAO and WHO, 2008); and $ Risk characterization of microbiological hazards in food (FAO and WHO, 2009a). The guidelines recognized risk management decision-making and effective risk communication within the risk analysis framework require reliable estimation of risk, combined with appropriate uncertainty analysis. In 2021, a single updated guideline on risk assessment has been developed to remove the need to consult three separate guidelines (FAO and WHO, 2021). The development of the guidelines for risk assessment paved way for a number of microbial risk assessments in commodity-pathogen matrices (LeJeune et al., 2021), such as Salmonella in eggs and broiler chick - ens (FAO and WHO, 2002), Listeria monocytogenes in ready- to-eat foods (WHO and FAO, 2004) and Campylobacter spp. in broiler chickens (FAO and WHO, 2009b).Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 1484. Biological food hazards and associated public health impacts TASFs are a good medium for microbial growth and can become contaminated with hazards at any stage along the value chain, from primary production to manufacture, distribution and retailing, or through handling during preparation and consumption. Biological food hazards include pathogenic organisms (bacteria, viruses, para- sites, fungi and prions) and their toxins (Abebe, Gugsa and Ahmed, 2020). Microbial growth in food is influenced by a number of factors, both intrinsic (e.g. pH and nutrient content) and extrinsic (e.g. humidity and storage temperature) (Preetha and Narayanan, 2020). Livestock, farmed wildlife and hunt - ed animals are important reservoirs for many of the path- ogens that contaminate TASFs, including meat, dairy and egg-based products (Heredia and Garc\u00eda, 2018). Although they provide some micronutrients that are difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities from plants, for instance vita- min B12 (Murphy and Allen, 2003), TASF - like foods of plant origin - are prone to contamination and present significant risks to public health (Haileselassie et al., 2013). 4.1 Bacterial hazards Among biological food hazards, bacterial hazards present the greatest threat to food safety and human health (Desta Sisay, 2015) and are the most studied and monitored (Newell et al., 2010). The frequency and of seriousness of FBDs vary (Abebe, Gugsa and Ahmed, 2020). Salmonella enterica Paratyphi A and Salmonella enterica Typhi are among the common bacterial causes of FBDs (WHO, 2015). Some bacteria may cause severe complica- tions, including Listeria monocytogenes and Vibrio Production of toxins and struc - tural virulent factors is responsible for the pathogenesis of bacteria such as Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (Abebe, Gugsa and Ahmed, 2020). Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a gram-positive microorganism that is present as a commensal on the skin, nose and mucous membranes of healthy humans and animals (Lozano et al., 2016; Tessema and Tsegaye, ogen (Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00e1zaro et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017) and can cause diseases with diverse severity in both humans and animals (Abraha et al., 2018; Lozano et al., 2016) as an infectious agent or through its toxins. S. aureus is able to grow in a wide range of temperatures (7 \u00b0C to 48 \u00b0C, with an optimum of 30 \u00b0C to 37 \u00b0C), pH (4.2 to 9.3, with an opti- mum of 7.0 to 7.5) and sodium chloride concentrations (up to 15 percent NaCl). These characteristics enable it to sur - vive in a wide variety of foods, especially those that require manipulation during processing, including fermented food products such as cheese (Argaw and Addis, 2015). It has a wide range of hosts, including humans and livestock (Wang et al., 2017). Contamination of food with S. aureus may occur directly from infected animals or because of poor hygiene dur - ing production, retail or storage (Massawe, Mdegela and Kurwijila, 2019). Cows with mastitis are a common source of S. aureus in raw milk (Tarekgne et al., 2015). S. aureus in food products is a serious concern because of the food- borne intoxication caused by enterotoxigenic strains of coagulase-positive staphylococci, mainly S. aureus (Tsepo et al., 2016) and very occasionally others species, such as S. intermedius (Genigeorgis, 1989; Khambaty, Bennett and Shah, 1994). A variety of food items can be contaminated by staphylococcal enterotoxins, with moist food contain- ing starch and proteins (Wu et al., 2016), unpasteurised milk and dairy products (Beyene et al., 2017; Abunna et al., 2016), pork, beef, mutton, poultry and eggs having been implicated in staphylococcal food poisoning (Wang et al., 2017). S. aureus growth and toxin production is influenced by factors such as the composition of the food, the tem- perature and the time allowed (Hennekinne, De Buyser and Dragacci, 2012), and this provides an indication of areas that should be targeted by efforts to mitigate exposure and improve health. Many cases of staphylococcal food poisoning have been reported globally (Hennekinne, De Buyser and Dragacci, 2012). Staphylococcal food poisoning results from the ingestion of enterotoxins preformed in food by enter - otoxigenic strains of S. aureus (Hennekinne, De Buyser and Dragacci, 2012). Staphylococcal enterotoxins are resistant to environmental conditions (freezing, dry- ing, heat treatment and low pH) that easily destroy the enterotoxin-producing strain. They are also resistant to Section D | Food safety and food-borne diseases 149proteolytic enzymes and hence are able to remain active in the digestive tract after ingestion (Hennekinne, De Buyser and Dragacci, 2012). Generally, heat treatments commonly used in food processing do not completely destroy staph- ylococcal enterotoxins present in the concentrations at which they are expected to be found in food involved in food poisoning outbreaks (0.5-10 \u00b5g per 100 ml or 100 g) (Hennekinne, De Buyser and Dragacci, 2012). The widespread use of antibiotics and the ability of bac - teria to acquire antimicrobial resistance have led to the emergence of resistant strains, such as methicillin resist - ant S. aureus (Abraha et al., 2018; Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00e1zaro et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017). Methicillin resistant S. aureus has been reported in animals (Weese, 2010). Multidrug resist - ant strains of S. aureus have been associated with high mortality and morbidity (Tsepo et al., 2016). Delaney et al. (2008) studied a cohort of 1 439 patients with methicillin resistant S. aureus and 14 090 patients with no methicil- lin resistant S. aureus; within one year, 21.8 percent of the methicillin resistant S. aureus patients had died as compared with 5 percent of the non-methicillin resistant S. aureus patients. Staphylococcal infections have a short incubation period (the time from infection to the manifestation of symptoms) of two to four hours after consumption of contaminated foods (Desta Sisay, 2015). The bacteria can cause symp - toms that range from simple skin infections to life-threatening septicaemia, necrotizing fasciitis, infec - shock syndrome (Che Hamzah et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017). Staphylococcal infections are characterized by nausea and vomiting, chills and headache (Dhama et al., 2013) and abdominal cramping with or without diarrhoea (Kadariya, Smith and Thapaliya, 2014) but not by fever (Wang et al., 2017). Children and elderly persons are more susceptible (Wang et al., 2017). Control and prevention of S. aureus mainly requires strat - egies that interrupt its modes of transmission, as the organisms are ubiquitous and impossible to eliminate from the environment (Argaw and Addis, 2015). Preventing contamination and cross-contamination and cooking food thoroughly are effective ways of preventing staphylococcal infections. Improving public awareness of how to handle food safely and cook it well, along with other public health interventions, can be effective means of preventing out - breaks (Kadariya, Smith and Thapaliya, 2014). It is notewor - thy that although S. aureus is one of the most important food-borne pathogens it was not considered in the FERG study, probably because global data were lacking. This illustrates how the FERG study, still the best available guide to the burden of FBD, underestimates the true burden. Salmonella species Salmonella is a gram-negative bacterium that can survive for several weeks in a dry environment and for several months in water. Salmonella are divided into typhoidal (S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi) and non-typhoidal Salmonella serotypes (Feasey et al., 2012). Most Salmonella serotypes are present in a wide range of hosts and typically do not cause complicated infections that warrant treatment; however, some are host specific, for example S. serotype Dublin, which resides in cattle, and S. enterica serotype Choleraesuis, which resides in pigs (WHO, 2018a). When these particular serotypes cause disease in humans, it is often invasive and can be life threatening (WHO, 2018a). Non-typhoidal S. enterica usually cause gastroenteritis (EFSA and ECDC, 2018; Lane et al., 2014). Globally, S. ente - ritidis and S. typhimurium are the two most commonly reported serovars of Salmonella spp. transmitted through food (EFSA and ECDC, 2018). Salmonella is the most common cause of FBD in both developing and developed countries, although incidence rates vary according to the country (Addis et al., 2011). Salmonella is one of the four key global causes of diarrhoe - al diseases (the others are norovirus, enteropathogenic E. coli and Campylobacter) 2018a). Globally, non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. were estimated to cause approximately 78 million cases of illness, 59 000 deaths and 4 million DALYs in 2010 (Havelaar et al., 2015). The numbers were also high in the WHO European Region, where non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. occupied the first position in the ranking of DALYs and deaths due to food-borne hazards, causing 107 000 DALYs and 1 854 deaths in 2010 (WHO, 2017b). In 2017, the 28 member states of the European Union reported a total of 93 583 human salmonellosis cases, 91 662 of which were confirmed cases, resulting in an European Union notifica- tion rate of 19.7 cases per 100 000 population. This was a slight decrease (0.7 percent) compared with the figures for 2016 (20.4 cases per 100 000 population) (EFSA and ECDC, 2019). Livestock and other animals used for food are a major reservoir for many food-borne Salmonella spp. (Heredia and Garc\u00eda, 2018). Humans are the only reservoir of typhoid Salmonella (Gal-Mor, Boyle and Grassl, 2014). Non-typhoid Salmonella serovars have animals as the main reservoirs (Eng et al., 2015). S. enterica, subspecies enterica serotypes are principally found in warm-blooded animals, whereas the other, non enterica, subspecies are Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 150principally found in cold-blooded animals, although there are some exceptions (Lamas et al., 2018). The incidence of diseases caused by non-typhoid Salmonella differs from country to country; for example, it is estimated to cause 690 cases per 100 000 population annually in Europe, while the infection rate in Israel is around 100 cases per 100 000 annually (Eng et al., 2015). S. typhimurium is the dominant serovar around the world and is associated with food-borne outbreaks in both developing and devel- oped countries (Mohammed, 2017). The transmission of non-typhoidal Salmonella infection to humans can occur through the ingestion of food or water contaminated with waste from infected animals, by direct contact with infect - ed animals or by consumption of food from infected ani- mals (Eng et al., 2015; Garedew et al., 2015; WHO, 2018a). This bacterium has been isolated from a wide range of animals - poultry, ovines, porcines, and fish and other aquatic animals - and their food products, and also from some other cold-blooded animals (Flockhart et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2016; Zajc et al., 2016). Salmonella spp. infections are characterized by acute onset of fever, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea and sometimes vomiting (WHO, 2018a). Non-typhoidal sal- monellosis is usually self-limiting and does not require specific treatment other than oral fluids (WHO, 2018a). Salmonella spp. infection can, however, cause severe dis - ease, especially in children, the elderly and immunocom- promised people. In invasive salmonellosis, the bacteria enter the bloodstream, resulting in bacteraemia, menin- gitis, osteomyelitis or septic arthritis and sometimes even death. Treating this type of infection with antimicrobial agents is justified, although antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella spp. is increasingly becoming a public health concern (WHO, 2011). Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella is endemic in Africa, and children and human immu- nodeficiency virus (HIV) infected adults carry most of the burden of invasive disease (Morpeth, Ramadhani and Crump, 2009). A systematic literature review and meta-analysis reported multidrug resistance in 75 percent of non-typhoid Salmonella isolates obtained in sub-Saha- ran African regions after the year 2000 (Tack et al., 2020). In Viet Nam, 71 percent of patients included in a study on invasive non-typhoid infection had HIV (Phu Huong Lan et al., 2016); S. Enteritidis (48 percent; n = 102) and S. Typhimurium (25 percent) were the main serovars. To prevent the infection, it is recommended that food should be properly cooked and served when hot, and that hands should be thoroughly and frequently washed, using soap, in particular after contact with pets or livestock and after visiting toilets (WHO, 2018a).Campylobacter species Among the 17 species and six subspecies assigned to the genus Campylobacter, the most frequently reported in human diseases are C. jejuni (subspecies jejuni) and C. coli (WHO, 2020b). These organisms are found in the environ- ment, and many species are susceptible or act as reservoirs (Gebremichael, Berhe and Amede, 2019; Ogden et al., 2009). Poultry (Desta Sisay, 2015), cattle, sheep, pigs and other animals used for food (Khoshbakht et al., 2016; Silva et al., 2011; Woldemariam, Asrat and Zewde, 2009), as well as wild animals and birds (Gebremichael, Berhe and Amede, 2019), are reservoirs of Campylobacter. Companion animals (cats and dogs) and rodents may also act as reservoirs of Campylobacter spp. (Woldemariam, Asrat and Zewde, 2009). Large numbers of Campylobacter bacteria can be found in the intestinal tracts of animals (G\u00f6lz et al., 2014), although they seldom causes disease in animals. Most often, car - casses or meat are contaminated by Campylobacter from faeces during slaughtering. Table eggs are not considered to be an important source of the organism (Dhama et al., 2013). A worldwide meta-analysis study on the prev- alence of Campylobacter spp. in animal food products reported a pooled prevalence of 29.6 percent (95 per - cent CI 27.6-31 percent); C. jejuni (19 percent) and C. coli (9.7 percent) (Zbrun et al., 2020). Poultry flocks are highly colonized with the bacteria (G\u00f6lz et al., 2014) and con- taminated broiler meat is considered the most important source of Campylobacter infection in humans (Abebe, Gugsa and Ahmed, 2020; WHO, 2017b). However, levels of colonization can vary by production system and species. Most reported cases are associated with chickens, espe - cially those raised in organic and free-range systems rather than in intensive production systems, probably because of increased environmental exposure (Hendrixson and DiRita, 2004). A community-based cross-sectional study involving children aged 11 to 13 months conducted in the Haramaya woreda (district), East Hararghe Zone, Oromia Region, Ethiopia found Campylobacter prevalence based on child faecal samples to be 50 percent (n = 101) (Chen et al., 2021). The risk of Campylobacter spp. presence was found to be significantly higher in children that were currently consum- ing TASF (in last 24 hours) (OR 4.87; 1.58-17.76). The same study found 12 percent of the children to have diarrhoea. The withdrawal of chicken and eggs from retail sale fol- lowing the 1999 dioxin crisis in Belgium resulted to a 40 percent reduction in human campylobacteriosis cases (Vellinga and Van Loock, 2002). In most cases of campylobacteriosis, the first symptoms occur two to five days after infection. The most common Section D | Food safety and food-borne diseases 151clinical symptoms are diarrhoea (frequently with blood in the faeces), abdominal pain, fever, nausea and/or vomit - ing (WHO, 2020b). The symptoms typically last three to six days. Treatment other than electrolyte replacement and rehydration is not generally required. Antimicrobial treatment is recommended in invasive cases where the intestinal mucosa cells are invaded and tissue is dam- aged. Death from campylobacteriosis is rare and is usu- ally confined to very young or older patients or to those with another serious disease such as AIDS (WHO, 2020b). Complications such as bacteraemia, hepatitis, pancreatitis and miscarriage have been reported at varying frequency. Postinfection complications may include reactive arthritis, which can be a long-term (indeterminate) sequela and last more than a two months, and neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a form of paralysis that can result in respiratory and severe neurological dysfunction or death in a few cases (WHO, 2011). A recent review of Campylobacter spp. shows that the incidence and prevalence of campylobacteriosis have increased in both developing and developed countries (Kaakoush et al., 2015). According to FERG, in 2010, food- borne Campylobacter spp. were responsible for more than 95 million cases of illness and slightly more than 21 000 deaths worldwide. The global burden of this hazard was estimated to be over 2.1 million DALYs per year, consisting mostly of years of life lost (YLL) due to the disease (WHO, 2017b). In the WHO European Region, Campylobacter spp. were the second leading hazard in terms of food-borne illness (nearly 4.7 million cases per year), deaths (459 per year) and burden (more than 82 000 DALYs per year). It is undoubtedly a major threat to public health in the region, where the median was nine DALYs (95 percent UI 6 - 13) per 100 000 population in 2010 (Havelaar et al., 2015). In 2017, human campylobacteriosis data were reported by 27 European Union members states, with 246 158 con- firmed cases, resulting in an European Union notification rate of 64.8 cases per 100 000 population, a slight decrease compared with 2016 (when there were 66.3 cases per 100 000 population) (EFSA and ECDC, 2018). The risk factors that contribute to the susceptibility of humans to campylobacteriosis include travelling, con- sumption of undercooked chicken, environmental expo - sure and direct contact with livestock (Shad and Shad, 2019). Prevention of disease caused by Campylobacter is based on control measures at all stages of the food chain, with the most effective being heating of TASF to temperatures that will completely inactivate all types of Campylobacter (WHO, 2020b). Enhancing biosecu- rity to avoid transmission of Campylobacter from the environment to flocks of birds on farm can reduce the prev- alence of Campylobacter in poultry, but this option is fea- sible only where birds are kept in closed housing. Hygienic slaughtering practices reduce contamination of carcasses by faeces, although this does not guarantee the absence of Campylobacter from meat and meat products. Bactericidal treatment, such as heating (e.g. cooking or pasteurization) or irradiation, is the only effective method of eliminating Campylobacter from contaminated foods (WHO, 2020b). Listeria monocytogenes Listeria monocytogenes is widely distributed in nature and causes listeriosis in both animals and humans (Derra et al., 2013; O'Grady et al., 2009). Listeria spp. are gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria. L. monocytogenes occurs worldwide (Lee et al., 2019). Most cases of listeriosis are sporadic, although outbreaks may occur (Dhama et al., 2015). In gen- eral, incidence is relatively low (0.1 to 10 cases per 1 million people per year, depending on the country and region of the world), but hospitalization and fatality rates are high (WHO, 2018). Unlike most other food-borne pathogens, L. monocytogenes can grow in food at fairly low moisture levels, at high salt concentration and at refrigeration temperatures. The ability to persist and multiply in the food environment when other bacteria and pathogens do not grow makes L. monocytogenes more difficult to control (Schlech and Acheson, 2000). Unlike other common food-borne patho - gens, L. monocytogenes is one of the most virulent patho - gens of public-health concern globally (Mulu and Pal, 2016). It has a high case-fatality rate of approximately 30 percent, partly because of its ability to cause spontaneous abortion of human foetuses (Odu and Okonko, 2017). Where active surveillance of sepsis and meningitis has been carried out, attack rates of about 0.7 cases per 100 000 population have been reported (Gellin et al., 1991). The infection is much more common in infants (10 cases per 100 000 population) and older persons (1.4 cases per 100 000 population) and has a predominance among males (Schlech and Acheson, 2000). According to FERG estimates (Havelaar et al., 2015), lis - teriosis resulted in more than 14 000 cases of illness, over 3 170 deaths and over 118 000 DALYs globally in 2010. The proportion of perinatal cases was approximately 20 per - cent. In Europe, it is evident that listeriosis has public health impact. The disease caused an estimated 1 781 cases of illness, 399 deaths and almost 15 000 DALYs in the WHO European Region in 2010 (WHO, 2017b). Listeriosis was the fourth leading food-borne hazard in terms of deaths in the region and the fifth in terms of DALYs (WHO, 2017b). There Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 152were 2 480 confirmed human cases of listeriosis reported in the European Union in 2017, and a statistically signifi- cant increasing trend in cases of listeriosis was observed between 2008 and 2014 (EFSA and ECDC, 2017). Listeria species are commonly found in raw food, vege - tables contaminated by soil and water, and raw animal products (Seyoum et al., 2015; Vaidya et al., 2018). L. mono - cytogenes is frequently isolated from food of animal ori- gin such as ready-to-eat products, ground beef (Pal and Awel, 2014; anlbaba and Uymaz Tezel, 2018), (sausages) (Carrique-Mas and Bryant, 2013; Dhama et al., 2013), fish and fish products (Nayak et al., 2015), and milk and dairy products such as soft cheese and ice cream (Mashhadany et al., 2016; Mulu and Pal, 2016). Occupational exposure from animal sources has been reported in livestock keepers, butchers, poultry workers and veterinary surgeons (Mashhadany et al., 2016; anlbaba and Uymaz Tezel, 2018). Healthy people infect - ed with L. monocytogenes may experience febrile gastroen- teritis, which is usually mild and self limiting. However, in patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity, L. mono - cytogenes can lead to severe illness, including severe sep - sis, meningitis or encephalitis and therefore have lifelong consequences or even lead to death (de Noordhout et al., 2014). In South Africa, an outbreak of listeriosis between January 2017 and July 2018 caused 1 060 confirmed cas - es and 216 recorded deaths (Tchatchouang et al., 2020). Epidemiological investigations indicated that ready-to-eat processed-meat products from a food-production facility contaminated with L. monocytogenes were responsible for the outbreak (Tchatchouang et al., 2020). Listeriosis occurs mainly in risk groups such as pregnant women, older people, people with AIDS and other immuno - compromised conditions, people that have undergone solid organ transplantation, people with diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis or renal failure, anlbaba and Uymaz Tezel, 2018). Infection during pregnancy can result in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or preterm birth (Chan and Smith, 2018; Maertens de Noordhout et al., 2014). Infants can acquire the infection in two ways: their mothers may consume contaminated food and develop occult sepsis, resulting in chorioamnionitis and delivery of a septic infant or foe - tus; and infected mothers may contaminate the skin and respiratory tract of their babies during childbirth (Schlech and Acheson, 2000). The infants may then develop bac - terial meningitis two to three weeks after exposure at the time of birth (Schlech and Acheson, 2000). In North America, L. monocytogenes is the third most common pathogen causing bacterial meningitis among neonates, after Group B streptococcal infection and Escherichia coli (Dawson et al., 2018; Goulet and Marchetti, 1996). Food- borne listeriosis can be prevented by controlling the organ- ism at all the stages of the food chain - ensuring good hygienic practices (GHPs), good manufacturing practices (GMPs) and a food-safety system based on hazard analysis critical control points (HACCP), with careful attention to preparation and choice of foods in the household and, in special circumstances, use of antibiotic prophylaxis (WHO, 2018; Schlech and Acheson, 2000). Escherichia coli Escherichia coli is part of the normal bacterial flora in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other warm-blooded animals; most strains are harmless other than in immu- nocompromised individuals (Kaper, Nataro and Mobley, 2004). However, some strains can cause illness and even severe FBD (Abreham et al., 2019; Disassa et al., 2017; Taye et al., 2013, WHO, 2017b). Transmission of E. coli occurs via the oral-faecal route through consumption of contami- nated foods. Meat can be contaminated with E. coli dur - ing slaughter as a result of the carcass and environment becoming soiled with faecal material (Johnson et al., 1996). People can become infected with diarrhoeagenic E. coli by consuming or handling contaminated food or water or by contact with infected animals (Abreham et al., 2019; Dhama et al., 2013). Person-to-person transmission is also possible (WHO, 2017b). E. coli are categorized into groups according to their vir - ulence mechanism (Kaper, Nataro and Mobley, 2004). Diarrhoeagenic E. coli include coli enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Shiga tox - in-producing E. coli (also known as verotoxin-producing E. coli [STEC/EHEC]). Cattle and other ruminants are the natural reservoirs of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli Desta Sisay, 2015; Dhama et al., 2013). Globally, this type of E. coli has been associated with several life-threatening food-borne outbreaks, especially in young children and older people (Elmonir, Abo-Remela and Sobeih, 2018; WHO, zoonotic (Fairbrother and Nadeau, 2006). E. coli O157 is the most commonly report - ed serogroup, but other serogroups, such as O26, O103, Mustafa, 2018). TASFs typically associated with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli include raw milk and dairy products, and poorly cooked ground-meat products (Abdissa et al., 2017; Ayscue et al., 2009; Bogere and Baluka, 2014). The major factors contributing to Section D | Food safety and food-borne diseases 153E. coli O157:H7 infection include consumption of under - cooked meat and unpasteurised milk, mass catering, complex and lengthy food-supply procedures and poor hygiene practices (Haile, Kebede and Wubshet, 2017). According FERG's 2010 global estimates (Havelaar et al., 2015), ETEC were the group of E. coli that caused the most cases of food-borne illness (86.5 million cases and 26 000 deaths), followed by EPEC (24 million cases and 37 000 deaths) and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (1.2 million cases and 13 000 deaths). The annual DALY burdens caused by ETEC, EPEC and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli in 2010 were 2.1 million, 2.9 million and 12 953, respectively (Kirk et al., 2015, FAO and WHO, 2018). In the WHO European Region, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli caused more than 150 000 cases of illness in 2010, making it the seventh out of the ten most common causes of food-borne illness (FAO and WHO, 2018, EFSA and ECDC, 2015). The annual burdens of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, EPEC and ETEC in the WHO European Region in 2010 were estimated to be 1 000, 46 and 35 DALYs, respectively (Havelaar et al., 2015). In 2017, 6 073 confirmed cases of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infections were reported in the European Union. The European Union notification rate was 1.66 cases per 100 000 population, which was a 6.2 percent decrease compared to the 2016 figures (FAO and WHO, 2018; EFSA and ECDC, 2015). In the same year, 20 deaths due to Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infection were reported, which resulted in a European Union case-fatality rate of 0.5 percent (FAO and WHO, 2018; EFSA and ECDC, 2015). The most commonly reported Shiga toxin producing E. coli serogroup in the European Union is O157, although its proportion relative to other serogroups appears to be decreasing (FAO and WHO, 2018; EFSA and ECDC, 2015). E. coli infection has an incubation period of two to ten days, which is followed by the onset of diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, haemorrhagic colitis, the more severe form of haemolytic uraemic syndrome, with acute kidney fail- ure, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a rare dis - order that causes blood clots in small vessels of the body (Abreham et al., 2019; Mersha et al., 2010). Septicaemia (presence of bacteria in the blood with multiplication that can lead to organ damage/death) starts with bacteraemia (presence of bacteria in blood) and ends with toxaemia (presence of bacterial toxins in blood); its severity depends on the effect of bacteria localization in a variety of tissue spaces throughout the body (Desta Sisay, 2015). Although prevention and control of E. coli infections are similar to those of other food-borne bacterial diseases, their severe consequences in young children mean that special precautions are required (Desta Sisay, 2015). Control measures include good sanitation measures during food preparation, handling and transport (Saeedi et al., 2017). In cattle, intervention measures such as probiotics, vaccination, antimicrobials, sodium chlorate and bacteriophages may reduce the prevalence of infec - tion with E. coli O157:H7 (Karmali, Gannon and Sargeant, 2010). Measures such as training of food handlers, inspec - tion of food premises and community-based education programmes promoting proper food handling and prepa- ration are effective in reducing public exposure to food- borne pathogens, including E. coli (Karmali, Gannon and Sargeant, 2010). 4.2 Viral hazards Viruses are composed of genetic materials, i.e. DNA or RNA, enclosed by a protein, sometimes combined with lipids to produce one or more membranous coats. Besides being much smaller than bacteria, viruses also differ from them in that they are incapable of reproducing on their own: bacteria can reproduce in any suitable environment, but viruses need to infect a living cell and introduce their genetic material into the cell's replication system (FAO and WHO, 2008). Viruses use the cell's resources to produce more viruses that are then able to invade more cells. As they require living cells in order to replicate, viruses are not able to grow in food and water. The infective dose of most viruses is low (10 to 100 infectious viral particles). Most food-borne or water-borne viruses are relatively resistant to heat, disinfection and pH changes (FAO and WHO, 2008). Food-borne infection through ingestion of products from an animal infected with a zoonotic virus is rare, but hepa- titis E virus has been reported after consumption of pork, wild boar and deer (Ruggeri et al., 2013; Van der Poel, 2014). Hepatitis E virus is a small, spherical and non-enveloped RNA virus of approximately 7.2 kb. It belongs to the family Hepeviridae and the genus Hepevirus. Hepatitis E virus has emerged as a potential zoonotic threat (Bosch, Pint\u00f3 and Guix, 2016) and is known to be a major cause of acute human hepatitis in regions with inadequate water supplies and poor sanitary conditions (Guthmann et al., 2006; Purcell and Emerson, 2001). It has been found to be highly prevalent in pigs in countries where hepatitis E virus in humans is rare (BIOHAZ, 2011). Hepatitis E virus variants found in pigs are almost identical to the viruses found in some humans (Meng et al., 1997), a finding that provided the first evidence of zoonotic transmission of hepatitis E virus.Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 1544.3 Parasites Parasitic organisms affecting humans include spp.) (WHO, 2020a). These parasites are usually transmit - ted via food, water, soil or person-to -person contact, but some, such as fish-borne trematodes, are only transmitted through food (WHO, 2017b). According to FERG data (WHO, 2015), the parasitic diseases with the largest number of symptomatic incident cases attributable to contaminated food in 2010 were acquired toxoplasmosis and ascariosis. The global burden of 11 parasitic diseases was 8.78 mil- lion DALYs, of which an estimated 6.65 million DALYs were attributed to food (WHO, 2015). Toxoplasmosis Toxoplasmosis is a food-borne infection caused by the protozoa Toxoplasma gondii. Cats are the primary hosts. Other animals, including food animals, are intermediate hosts. Humans can become infected when they come into contact with the faeces of these animals. Human transmis - sion can also occur through consumption of raw or under - cooked meat (Attias et al., 2020; WHO, 2020a) and raw milk (Saad, Hussein and Ewida, 2018). In many people, toxo - plasmosis does not cause any problems, and no treatment is required. The parasite can reach the foetus through the placenta (Attias et al., 2020). This can result in foetal death if it occurs in early stages of pregnancy and may cause hydro - cephalus and blindness in children (McAuley, 2014; Scallan et al., 2011). According to Scallan et al. (2011), T . gondii infections cause approximately 87 000 illnesses, 4 400 hospitalizations, and 330 deaths each year in the United States of America, mak - ing it the second leading cause of food-borne mortality and the third leading cause of food-borne hospitalizations The global burden of toxoplasmosis, both congenital and acquired combined, was 1.68 million (95 percent UI 1.24- 2.45 million) DALYs in 2010 (WHO, 2015). Preventative meas - ures include proper cooking of meat to a minimal internal temperature of 70 \u00b0C or freezing at -20 \u00b0C and avoiding eating food potentially contaminated with oocysts from cat faeces (Mirza Alizadeh et al., 2018; Rodrick, 2003). Cryptosporidiosis Cryptosporidium parvum is a zoonotic parasite that is most - ly transmitted through contaminated water, food or fomites (Zambriski et al., 2013). Cattle are important reservoirs. A systematic literature review reported a pooled prevalence of 22.5 percent (95 percent CI = 19.6-24.6 percent) for conventional microscopy and 29 percent (95 percent CI = 23.1-35.6 percent) for detections done using the PCR method (Hatam-Nahavandi et al., 2019). Another review, focusing on studies done in the Islamic Republic of Iran, found a prevalence of 14.4 percent (95 percent CI = 11-18.6 percent) (n = 40 studies) (Haghi et al., 2020). C. parvum is the species most often responsible for diar - rhoeal diseases in animals and humans (Laberge et al., 1996). Infected calves may suffer from watery diarrhoea, inappetence, lethargy and dehydration (Robertson et al., 2020). Lombardelli et al. (2019) sampled a total of 1 073 calves and found 26 percent to be positive for oocysts, using microscopic examination. The major symptoms of Cryptosporidium infection in humans are fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and anorex - ia. Gastrointestinal symptoms usually last about seven to 14 days, unusually five to six weeks, while persistent weak - ness, lethargy, mild abdominal pain and bowel looseness may persist for a month (Casemore, 1990). In young, mal- nourished children, symptoms may be severe enough to cause dehydration, malabsorption and even death. Illness and oocyst excretion patterns may vary with factors such as immune status, infective dose, host age and the viru- lence of the organism. In humans, the prepatent period is between seven and 28 days. The mean incubation period is 7.2 days (range 1-12) with a mean duration of illness of 12.2 days (range 2-26) (Jokipii and Jokipii, 1968). Oocyst excretion can continue for two to three weeks after the dis - appearance of symptoms, creating problems with infection control (Soave and Armstrong, 1986). The global burden of cryptosporidiosis in 2010 was esti- mated to be 128.4 per 100 000 population, with a range of 50.3 to 601.6 (WHO, 2015). Cryptosporidiosis mortality was estimated to be 0.015 per 100 000 population, with a range of 0.003 to 0.08 (WHO, 2015). However, the proportion of food-borne cryptosporidiosis burden attributable to TASFs (most commonly dairy products) was less than 10 percent in all subregions (the lowest proportion among all hazards, with a global burden of 0.3 DALYs per 100 000 population) (Li et al., 2019). Trichinosis Trichinosis, or trichinellosis, is one of the most widespread global parasitic diseases of humans and animals (Foreyt, 2013). It is a zoonoses caused by the larval stage of parasitic roundworms WOAH, 2021). T . spiralis is the most important cause of human disease (Gottstein, Pozio and N\u00f6ckler, 2009). Trichinosis is mainly associated with the ingestion of contaminated raw or insufficiently cooked pork or wildlife meat. Consumption of meat from horses and other animals can also be a source Section D | Food safety and food-borne diseases 155of human infection, although this depends on cultural, die - tary and livestock-husbandry practices and is not common (Foreyt, 2013). For example, in China, outbreaks of human trichinosis attributed to T . nativa have been caused by consumption of dog meat (Cui and Wang, 2001). In France and Italy, human infections have been linked to consump - tion of horse meat (Dupouy-Camet, 2000). T . spiralis is the predominant species in the United States of America, but T . pseudospiralis and T . murrelli have also been identified (Worley et al., 1986). Following the ingestion of meat con- taining encysted larvae, the cysts dissolve in the intestine, releasing the larvae, which then enter the gastrointestinal tract epithelium. The parasites then mate and deposit lar - vae in the lymphatic system. The larvae infect other body tissues through lymphatic circulation. Initial symptoms are gastroenteritis, which may be followed by irregular fever (39-41 \u00b0C), muscle pain and difficulty in breathing, talking or moving. Duration ranges from 21.5 to 70 days (Murrell and Pozio, 2011). The larvae in muscles can be killed by a number of methods: heating to 65.5 \u00b0C or freezing at 15 \u00b0C for three weeks or at -30 \u00b0C for one day. According to data compiled by Murrell and Pozio (2011), 51 percent of cases of infection in humans are in males and most are in people between 20 and 50 years of age. Trichinosis is a public health threat (Dupouy-Camet, 2000). In many countries, including the United States of America, decreases in the number of reported cases have been brought about by prohibiting the use of untreated garbage (swill) as pig feed and improving surveillance, public edu- cation, livestock-husbandry systems and hygiene (Foreyt, 2013). Trichinosis prevalence of up to 50 percent has been reported in pig herds in Belarus, Croatia, Latvia, Romania, the Russian Federation and Ukraine (Pozio, 2001). In Argentina, Chile, Mexico and the Plurinational State of Bolivia, trichinosis remains endemic and prevalent due to an increase in the number of small farms, which often do not use good management practices, a lack of sani- tary regulations and regulations for home slaughter, and the misconception that trichinosis is no longer a disease of concern (Gajadhar and Gamble, 2000). The occurrence of the disease has been attributed to lack of veterinary controls, economic problems and war, changes in live - stock husbandry, changes in marketing and distribution systems, complacency and increases in wildlife reservoirs (Pozio, 2001). Trichinosis can be controlled and prevented through edu- cation and improved hygiene in the environment and in the home. Transmission of trichinosis to garbage-fed pigs can be prevented by cooking the garbage (swill) to an internal temperature of 71 oC to inactivate the Trichinella larvae (Pozio, 2001). Cooking the meat to 71 oC (Gajadhar and Gamble, 2000) will kill larvae and prevent human infections; however, it is more effective for meat producers and suppliers to prevent infected meat from reaching con- sumers, for example through meat inspection (van Knapen, 2000). At production level, control can be enhanced by implementing biosecurity measures, controlling rodents and not feeding wastes to pigs (van Knapen, 2000). 4.4 Prions Prions are infectious pathogens associated with specif - ic forms of neurodegenerative disease (Prusiner, 1998). They are composed of a modified protein and are devoid of nucleic acid (Prusiner, 1998). Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or \"mad cow disease\") is a prion disease of cattle and is thought to have originated as a result of cattle being fed with animal protein derived from scrapie-infected sheep. The disease is associated with the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in humans (Campbell, 1998). Consuming bovine products containing specified prion-containing risk material, such as brain tissue, nerve ganglia or spinal tissue, appears to be the most likely route of transmission of the prion agent to humans (WHO, 2020a).Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 1565. Chemical hazards and associated public health impacts Chemicals have both beneficial and negative impacts on human health (World Health Organization, 2014). Contam- ination of food can occur at various stages of the value chain. Public health concerns arise when chemicals are present where they should not be or in amounts that are higher than recommended (Rather et al., 2017). The cat - egories of substances involved in food contamination in- clude: $ agrochemicals such as pesticides and herbicides; $ veterinary medicines and residues of veterinary medi- cines; $ environmental contaminants: mainly heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants, and natural toxins; and $ processing contaminants resulting from cooking, processing or packaging: for example, nitrosamines, chloropropanols, acrylamide, and Carrizo, 2016). 5.1 Agrochemicals Residues of pesticides According to FAO and WHO (2014b), a pesticide is any sub - stance or mixture of substances of chemical or biological ingredients intended for repelling, destroying or controlling any pest or regulating plant growth. At the international level, the Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues in Food is responsible for assessing risks associated with pesticide residues in food and estimating maximum residue levels compatible with avoiding toxicological risks to health (FAO, 1997). The Codex Alimentarius Commission, through the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues, aims to reach consensus among governments on the maximum residue limits allowed in food. Pesticides are used in agriculture to protect plants and ensure that produce is not destroyed by pests, and in public health to control vector-borne diseases (Nicolopoulou-Stamati et al., 2016). Pesticides can be natural or synthetic and include insecticides, pesticides, herbicides and fungicides (Cabras, 2003; Stoytcheva, 2011). Over 1 000 pesticides are known to exist. When not proper - ly used, pesticides can contaminate the environment and negatively affect soil, water, vegetation (Aktar, Sengupta and Chowdhury, 2009) and animals. Public-health concerns relate to their persistence as residues (Aktar, Sengupta and Chowdhury, 2009). Dichloro-diphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) was prohibited as an insecticide in the United States of America in 1973 and its production and use thereafter decreased rapidly in most industrialized countries (Turusov et al., 2002). However, in countries such as India, DDT use is still permitted for the control of malaria-bearing vectors, even though vector resistance has been reported (van den Berg, Manuweera and Konradsen, 2017; Curtis, 2002). Pesticides used in agriculture can contaminate feeds and be excreted in milk produced by animals that consume these feeds. A study in the United Kingdom found that 21 percent of feed samples contained pesticide residues that could potentially end up in cow's milk (FAO, 2004). Studies in Bundelkhand, India, detected pesticide con- tamination in 56 percent of 533 feed samples analysed (but many at levels below the regulatory limits) (Nag and Raikwar, 2010) and in 63 percent of 325 milk samples (Nag and Raikwar, 2008). Another study in India, involving peri-urban areas in five states, reported residue prevalence rates of 6.3 to 11.2 percent in milk (Gill et al., 2020). Most insecticides are neurotoxic and act by attacking the nervous system of target organisms. Chemical compounds that act on the nervous system of insects have similar effects on humans (Costa, 2008). Cancer and asthma are among the diseases associated with pesticide exposure in humans (Kim, Kabir and Jahan, 2017). Health outcomes depend on the type of pesticide, the duration and route of exposure and the health status of the individual affected (Nicolopoulou-Stamati et al., 2016). Residues of veterinary medicines Veterinary medicines are used in livestock production to prevent, control or treat disease, improve feed uptake and promote growth. However, the benefits provided come with the risk that food products will be contaminated with residues. Drug residues present at the time of slaughter pose significant health risks to consumers on account of their effects on the evolution of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria, especially if residues exceed recommended lev- els. In recognition of the public health risk that may arise as a result of the presence of veterinary medicine residues in food, the Codex Alimentarius Commission established the Codex Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods to advise member governments and the Commission on issues related to public-health hazards and barriers to inter - national trade caused by residues in foods of animal origin. Section D | Food safety and food-borne diseases 157The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives has previously held meetings to specifically address the issue of veterinary drug residues in foods of animal origin (FAO and WHO, 2000). Several studies have documented the prevalence but not the actual levels of veterinary medicine residues in TASF, making it difficult to assess the risk to humans. The results of prevalence studies for veterinary product residues in eggs and beef (Mensah et al., 2014; Omeiza et al., 2012; Omeiza, Ajayi Ode, 2012) and in milk (Abebew, Belihu and Zewde, 2014) have been reported. Some veterinary medicine residues in TASF occur because of the unintend- ed presence of residues of approved veterinary drugs in food animals as a result of the drugs being carried over in feed (FAO and WHO, 2019). Hypersensitivity reactions, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity and disruption of intestinal flora are the main concerns associated with presence of veterinary medicine residues in animal source foods (Tufa, 2015). It is important to sensitize value-chain actors about the need to observe drug withdrawal periods to ensure that prod- ucts sold are safe for human consumption. 5.2 Environmental contaminants Dioxins and Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) Dioxins are widespread contaminants that arise from human activities, especially industrial processes, incom- plete combustion processes, such as waste incineration, and improper disposal of transformer oil used in the elec - trical-distribution industry (Marinkovic, 2010). Over 95 per - cent of human exposure to dioxins and PCBs is through the ingestion of high-fat foods, including meat and meat prod- ucts, fish, and milk and dairy products (Zennegg, 2018). A number of food and animal-feed contamination inci- dents occurred between 1997 and 2010 in Europe, and these highlighted the need to monitor dioxins and PCBs in food and feed (Zennegg, 2018). An outbreak involv- ing dioxin and PCBs in animal feeds occurred in Belgium in 1999 (van Larebeke et al., 2001). Cattle from extensive farming systems have been found to have higher levels of dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs) than conventionally raised cat - tle, implying exposure through grazing and indicating that the chemicals are less present in concentrate feed than in silage and green fodder (Zennegg, 2018).According to WHO (2016), short-term exposure of humans to high levels of dioxins may result in altered liver function and in skin lesions such as chloracne and patchy darken- ing of the skin. Long-term exposure is linked to impairment of the immune system, the developing nervous system, the endocrine system and reproductive functions. Heavy metals The term \"heavy metals\" is used to describe a number of metals that if present in food or feed beyond a recom- mended threshold may present a significant risk to human health. Heavy metals can persist for long periods in the environment and have the potential to bioaccumulate in food value chains (WHO, 2007). They interfere with normal body functions and affect health. According to WHO bur - den estimates (WHO, 2015), ingestion of arsenic, methyl- mercury, lead and cadmium resulted in 1 122 436 illnesses, 56 192 deaths and 9 164 162 DALYs worldwide in 2015, with the greatest impact in terms of DALYs occurring in WHO's Western Pacific B subregion (Gibb et al., 2019). All the met - als were found to give rise to more DALYs per case than other FBD agents, including infectious and parasitic agents (Gibb et al., 2019). Lead, arsenic and methylmercury were found to give rise to more DALYs per 100 000 population than other FBD agents (Gibb et al., 2019). Lead Lead (Pb) is the most toxic heavy metal in the environment (Wani, Ara and Usmani, 2015), where it occurs primarily in organic form. Human exposure is mainly via food and water, with some occurring via air and soil. The WHO bur - den study found that lead accounted for 54 percent of the illnesses, none of the deaths and 60 percent of the DALYs caused by the four above-mentioned heavy metals global- ly in 2015 (Gibb et al., 2019). A recent systematic review on the occurrence of lead in TASF over a ten-year period (2010 to 2019) in the Islamic Republic of Iran reported a number of studies that showed concentrations above maximum recommended limits in meat, milk and their products (Sarlak et al., 2021). A greater proportion of ingested lead is absorbed in child- ren than in adults; it accumulates in soft tissues and - over time - in bones (Wani, Ara and Usmani, 2015). In children, lead exposure affects cognitive functions (Sanders et al., 2009) and may cause abnormal behaviours (Hou et al. 2013). Lead and calcium compete for protein: lead can interfere with calcium metabolism and impair bone forma- tion (Dongre et al., 2013). The central nervous system is the main target organ for lead toxicity (Tong, 2000).Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 158Lead has a long half-life in the body, which leads to chronic toxicity (Sanders et al., 2009). Studies have shown a link between blood lead concentration and chronic kidney dis - ease at relatively low blood lead levels (Buser et al., 2016; Harari et al., 2018; Rastogi, 2008). The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives establishes the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) for lead at the international level (FAO and WHO, 2011a). Cadmium Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal found as an environ- mental contaminant as a result of natural occurrence and pollution from industrial and agricultural sources. It has no known biological function in animals or humans. Foods are the main source of cadmium exposure for the non-smoking population (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 2012; UNEP , 2019). The WHO bur - den study found that cadmium accounted for 1 percent of the illnesses, 4 percent of the deaths and 1 percent of the DALYs caused by the four heavy metals under considera- tion globally in 2015 (Gibb et al., 2019). Poultry, cattle, hors - es and wildlife are among the animal bio-accumulators of cadmium (ATSDR, 2012; Raicu, Vlagioiu and Tudor, 2020). Meat normally contains lower levels of cadmium, than ani- mal offals (kidneys and liver) that can have high cadmium concentrations, as these are the organs where the metal particularly accumulates (Drapal et al., 2021). Cadmium absorption after dietary exposure in humans is generally low (3-5 percent), but it is retained in the human kidney and liver and has a very long biological half-life, ranging from 10 to 30 years (ATSDR, 2012). Cadmium exposure has been associated with accumulation in the proximal tubu- lar cells of the kidney over time and may cause renal mal- function and osteoporosis through bone demineralization and neurotoxicity (European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), 2009; Genchi et al., 2020). Mercury Mercury (Hg) is widely distributed in the Earth's crust, sea- water, freshwater and air. Bioaccumulation of mercury in the food chain in Poland was analysed for a period of ten years (2009 to 2018) by monitoring the muscle tissue and liver of various livestock and game animals (Nawrocka et al., 2020). Most of the results for muscle tissue were below the limits of quantification. However, the mean mercury concentrations in muscle tissue were between 0.6 and 5.6 g/kg of wet weight and those in liver between 0.8 and 16.4 g/kg of wet weight, with the lowest levels recorded in chickens and the highest in wild boars; these levels of mercury were not considered to pose a health risk. A recent study in Iraq on the bioaccumulation and toxicity of heavy metals in edible chicken liver found mercury concentra- tions of 110 +/- 83 g/kg (Ali et al. 2020), while a study in Saudi Arabia found mean mercury levels of 125 g/kg in sausages (Alturiq and Albedair 2012). Levels as high as these are a public health concern. Mercury toxicity usually manifests itself mainly as neuronal disorder, immunotoxicity and kidney damage (Clarkson, 2002). People affected by a mercury poisoning incident in a small fishing town near Minamata, Japan, in the 1950s suf - fered muscle weakness, paralysis and speech and hearing problems. Over 40 percent of those exposed died, and oth- ers suffered permanent damage. This poisoning incident was the worst in Japan in the 1950s (Kessler, 2013; Onuki, 2020). Arsenic Arsenic (As) is a heavy metal that occurs in various inor - ganic and organic forms. It is very prevalent in the envi- ronment, where it occurs both naturally and as a result of human activity. It can easily enter the agrifood system through contaminated soil or water. The WHO burden study found that arsenic accounted for 20 percent of the illnesses, 96 percent of the deaths and 14 percent of the DALYs caused by the four heavy metals under considera- tion globally in 2015 (Gibb et al., 2019). A study that evaluated the role of milking cattle and poul- try as sources of arsenic in the human food chain in West Bengal, India, showed that milk, poultry egg yolk and albumen and all poultry organs from arsenic-endemic zone had higher levels of contamination than those from control areas (Datta et al., 2012). It was concluded that con- sumption of eggs and milk might be a factor in the arsenic - osis cases occurring in the area (Datta et al., 2012). Another study, also in India, assessed arsenic levels in different kinds of chicken meat and found that the highest levels of accumulation were in breast meat, followed by stomach meat, with lower levels in leg and heart meat (Mondal, 2020). These levels imply that if a person eats 60 g of chick - en meat daily, they may be consuming 0.186 to 0.372 g of total arsenic per day (Mondal, 2020). The main health effects associated with long-term expo - sure to inorganic arsenic in humans are skin lesions and cancer (Hong, Song and Chung, 2014; Naujokas et al., 2013). A causal link between oral exposure to arsenic and skin, lung and bladder cancers has been established; there are also indications for liver, kidney and prostate cancers (Hong, Song and Chung, 2014). Other effects related to chronic ingestion of arsenic include cardiovascular diseas - es, developmental toxicity, abnormal glucose metabolism, Section D | Food safety and food-borne diseases 159type 2 diabetes and neurotoxicity (FAO and nitrites form salts with a number of elements. These salts occur naturally in the environment and in most foods (plant and animal tis - sue). Nitrates are involved in the nitrogen cycle and large deposits build up in some locations, especially in the form of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) (EFSA, 2020). Dietary nitrate is converted to nitrite by symbiotic bacteria in the oral cavity and stomach, then to nitric oxide (NO) (Ma et al., 2018). Nitrates and nitrites have various uses in food and agricul- ture, for example in the production of fertilizers and food preservatives. The European Union has authorized the use of nitrites (sodium nitrite - E249, potassium nitrite - E251, potassium nitrate - E252) as food additives under Commission Regulation (EU) No. 1129/2011. Their use as food additives to stabilize vari- ous types of processed meat, to keep it red and give flavour is permitted in some countries; nitrates are used to prevent certain cheeses from bloating during fermentation (EFSA, 2017) . The major human health risk associated with exposure to nitrates is considered to be production of methae - moglobin, a molecule with very limited oxygen carrying capacity. Clinical symptoms include anoxia, tachycardia, dyspnoea, muscle tremors, reduction in blood pressure, weakness, vomiting, unstable gait, cyanosis (manifested by brown-coloured arterial blood), polyuria, lethargy and death (Bruning-Fann and Kaneene, 1993). Studies have shown that when it reacts with second- ary amines under acidic conditions, nitrite can form N-nitrosamines (Gupta et al., 2010; Robles, 2014). This reaction may potentially be of toxicological significance because some of the dialkyl- or cyclic N-nitrosamines are genotoxic and carcinogenic. Nitrosating agents produced from nitrite under acidic conditions in the stomach can react readily with nitrosatable compounds, especially sec - ondary amines and amides, to form N-nitroso compounds, some of which are potential carcinogens (Shephard, Schlatter and Lutz, 1987). Natural toxins Natural toxins are toxic compounds that are naturally produced by living organisms (WHO, 2018b). These tox - ins, though not harmful to the organisms themselves, may be toxic to other organisms, including humans. They may be produced by plants as a natural defence mecha- nism against insects or microorganisms or in response to climate stresses such drought or extreme humidity, or they may be a consequence of infestation with microorganisms such as moulds. Microscopic algae and plankton in oceans and lakes may produce natural toxins that are not toxic to the fish or shellfish that eat these organisms but are toxic to humans. The natural toxins affecting livestock production and livestock products are described below. Mycotoxins are chemical metabolites of food- and feed- borne fungi that can cause toxic and carcinogenic effects in humans and animals (WHO, 2018). In the context of live - stock production, animals can be exposed to mycotoxins through contaminated feed, and humans can in turn be exposed to a subset of these mycotoxins by eating food obtained from animals. Although mycotoxins, particularly aflatoxins, are responsi- ble for a large burden of human disease worldwide, caus - ing more than 600 000 DALYs and 19 000 deaths per year (WHO, 2015) as well as substantial economic losses to farm- ers, most of these losses occur as a result of exposure to mycotoxins in crops such as cereals and nuts. Crop-based exposure gives rise to a variety of mycotoxin-related health risks in humans, spanning cancers, acute liver failure, immunosuppression, gastrointestinal illness and growth impairment (Wu, Groopman and Pestka, 2014). In the case of human exposure through TASF, only two mycotoxins - aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) and ochratoxin A (FAO and WHO, 2018c) - pose potential risks (Chen and Wu, 2017). AFM1 is a metabolite of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), the most toxic and carcinogenic of aflatoxins. Aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1, G2) are a group of chemicals produced primarily by the fungi Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus in food and feed crops such as maize, groundnut, tree nuts and oil- seeds. Aflatoxin was first discovered in 1960, following the death of over 100 000 turkey poults that had consumed aflatoxin-contaminated peanut meal (Kensler et al., 2011). In the subsequent decades, it was discovered that afla- toxin causes hepatocellular carcinoma - liver cancer - in humans and numerous animal species (IARC, 1993). AFB1 is bio transformed in the liver into multiple metabolites, including AFM1, by cytochrome P450 enzymes. When dairy animals consume AFB1 in their feed, they secrete AFM1 in their milk, and this can lead to human exposure to AFM1 via the consumption of milk and milk products. Saha Turna and Wu (2021) provide an overview of AFM1 occurrence in different forms of milk, including raw milk, and resultant AFM1 exposure based on milk consump - tion data country by country. They report exposures ranging from 0.0021 to 125.6 ng/kg bodyweight per day. Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 160Unsurprisingly, the highest exposures to AFM1 were found to occur in countries where animal feed is highly contam- inated with aflatoxin and where humans consume large quantities of milk, for example India, Pakistan and sever - al sub-Saharan African countries. A recent study by Saha Turna et al. (2022) found that AFM1 exposure through con- sumption of liquid milk does not substantially increase liver cancer risk in humans. The question is whether AFM1 exposure gives rise to any human health risk. AFM1 is much less carcinogenic than its parent compound AFB1. Only two studies have demon- strated that AFM1-related tumours can be induced in mam- malian species (Cullen et al., 1987; Lutz et al., 1980). To date, no epidemiological study has linked AFM1 exposure in humans to liver cancer. In the absence of human data, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (1998) used existing animal studies to estimate that the can- cer potency of AFM1 was one-tenth that of AFB1. Using this cancer potency factor, it was estimated that AFM1 exposure through milk consumption would cause, at maximum, only 13 to 32 additional liver cancer cases worldwide per year (Saha Turna et al., 2022). However, other potential health effects of AFM1 exposure remain to be examined. A small number of studies suggests that AFM1 exposure through breastmilk may predispose infants to growth impairment (Khlangwiset, Shephard and Wu, 2011), although the evi- dence is mixed. Ochratoxin A (OTA) is found in a wide variety of foodstuffs and is produced primarily by the fungi Aspergillus ochra- ceus and Penicillium verrucosum (FAO and WHO, 2007). It has been found in dairy and meat products worldwide. Ochratoxin A secretion in the milk of ruminants is, how- ever, limited because of the action of ruminal microflora (Sorrenti et al., 2013). A study involving dairy farms in Norway found ochratoxin A in six of the 40 (11-58 ng/l) conventional and in five of the 47 (15-28 ng/l) organic milk samples analysed (Skaug, 1999). A study involving 132 French farms (Boudra et al., 2007) found three out of 264 milk samples to be ochratoxin A positive at levels of 5.0 to 6.6 ng/l. Contamination of cheese with ochratoxin A was reported by Altafini et al. (2021). A study in T\u00fcrkiye found mean ochratoxin A contamination levels to be 137\u00b157 ng/l in raw milk, 135\u00b18 ng/l and Keyvan, 2019). J\u00f8rgensen (1998) reported ochratoxin A contamination (mean 0.05 g/kg) in organic pork in Denmark (four out of seven samples tested were above the limit of detection). A recent study in the United States of America (Mitchell et al., 2017) found ochratoxin A exposure from pork to be highest in 12 month to 5-year -old children; the mean was 0.16 ng/kg bodyweight per day and 0.6 ng/kg bodyweight per day in heavy consumers of pork. The same study found milk-based ochratoxin A exposures in adult average and heavy milk consumers to be 0.02 and 0.04 ng/kg body- weight per day, respectively. There is little evidence for human health risks as a result of ochratoxin A exposure through animal source food consumption (Bui-Klimke and Wu, 2015). Ochratoxin A exposure on the whole has, however, been associated with renal diseases in both livestock and human populations (Caba\u00f1es, Bragulat and Castell\u00e1, 2010). The International Agency on Research on Cancer (IARC, 1993) has classified ochratoxin A as a Group 2B possible human carcinogen: a classification assigned because suggestive evidence for ochratoxin A-related cancers has been found in animal studies but no such evidence exists in human studies.Section D | Food safety and food-borne diseases 1616. Changing agrifood systems Climate change affects the social and environmental determinants of human, animal and plant health. Impact is reflected in the form of novel, emerging and re-emerg- ing diseases (vector-borne, soil-borne, water-borne and food-borne) that threaten the health of vulnerable groups of people and aggravate economic and social inequalities (FAO, 2018). Higher local temperatures are also associat - ed with increased rates of antimicrobial resistance (Blair, 2018). Agrifood systems have transformed rapidly as a result of factors such as rising incomes and rapid urbanization, and this has led to nutritional shifts as consumption patterns have changed (FAO, 2017b). Consumption of processed and imported foods has increased, posing challenges in terms of meeting food-safety and nutrition standards. Food-safety issues have been linked to traditional agri- food systems where technological advancement is limited. However, the development of modern agrifood systems has brought new risks. Intensive production and extensive international transfers of animals and animal products facilitate long-distance pathogen transmission (Dury et al., 2019). Intensification of production has given rise to waste management challenges, especially in LMICs. Much of the waste produced, which contains large quantities of path- ogens, is disposed of on land without any requirement for pretreatment, posing an opportunity for human contact and transmission to wild animals, both avian and mamma- lian (Nachman et al., 2005; Zheng et al., 2006). Large-scale, high-input livestock production systems tend to bring humans and animals into close contact with each other, and this has led to the emergence or spillover of zoonotic diseases such as Nipah virus infection in 1999, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) (Hassan 2014; Greger 2007), although none of these examples are FBDs. FBDs occur mainly as a result of the consumption of con- taminated animal products, vegetables and fresh fruits (Dury et al., 2019). Consumption of these foods is increasing in urban settings, and supply chains are getting longer. Various activities within agrifood systems may make food less safe. In rural areas, the significance of post-harvest activities as means of preparing produce for market is increasing as society becomes more urbanized and econo - mies become more market oriented. Although post-harvest activities enhance product storage and transportation, and improve foods' organoleptic, nutritional and sanitary qual- ities, they can be a source of contamination. Food is important to many people's sense of identity and belonging to a particular community. Cultural differenc - es mean that different societies process food products in different ways, and this variation needs to be considered when designing FBD interventions. Since the early 1930s, antibiotic use has intensified in vet - erinary and human clinical settings, household products and agricultural production, bringing various benefits to patients, producers and consumers (Allen et al., 2013). In livestock production, antibiotics are used to treat, control and prevent disease and in growth promotion (Allen et al., 2013), with the aim of increasing production and hence economic benefits. Repeated use of antimicrobial agents in livestock, including the use of non-therapeutic doses for growth promotion, is reported to significantly contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance (Agyare, 2016; Elliott, Kenny and Madan, 2017; Lekshmi et al., 2017). The emergence of drug-resistant infection has led to sub - stantial costs in terms of human and animal health. Use of antimicrobials in livestock may result in the presence of residues in foods such as milk, meat, eggs and their prod- ucts, and this may cause health-related problems. The rise in antimicrobial resistance may also make FBDs more common (O'Neill, 2014; Sachi et al., 2019). There is thus an urgent need to significantly reduce antimicrobial use in agrifood systems in order to combat rising levels of drug resistance. Global efforts to combat antimicrobial use and resistance are prominent in the One Health approach pro - moted by the Tripartite FAO/WHO/WOAH Joint Secretariat (WHO, 2012).Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 1627. Food markets TASFs are vital components of the diets and livelihoods of many people globally (Staal, 2015). They are frequently traded in formal, regulated markets and in local, unregulat - ed markets. Consumption of these foods tends to be higher in cities than in rural areas (AGRA, 2020). Informal markets, which are common in many developing countries, are not necessarily dangerous, although they can pose significant health risks to consumers (Roesel and Grace, 2014). Formal markets are also not necessarily safe. In both cases, care must be taken to ensure that the products sold are safe. Both types of market are discussed in this subsection. Marketing of livestock and livestock products is a dynam- ic process (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012) and largely driven by demand, although other factors play a role (Staal, 2015). Formal markets are managed on the basis of inter - national standards and are driven by demand beyond local boundaries. Consumer demand is driving a move towards higher standards, and this is being channelled through increasingly integrated production and supply chains in which the role of supermarkets is growing. Regulators, in turn, are responding to public pressure by increasing food-safety standards and scrutiny of their implementa- tion (Staal, 2015). Many formal markets comply, or try to comply, with government regulations where these exist and are sufficiently well known, but generally there is a lack of effective food-safety management systems in devel- oping countries. Food safety in these countries is largely driven by the private sector, with government establishing and enforcing the legal framework under which the sector operates (AGRA, 2020). Formal food markets need to address the complexity of handling and regulating highly perishable animal products, which at times have greater human health implications than crop products (Staal, 2015). They involve regulatory infrastructure along the value chain that links the producer to the consumer (Baltenweck, 2014) (Figure D1). Figure D1.

Informal markets (also called traditional markets)7 provide afforda- ble, accessible and diverse food for the urban poor, while at the same time supporting the livelihoods of millions of small-scale producers, traders and vendors (Resnick, 2017), who include youth and women. They are conven- ient, accessible and play critical roles in nutrition and live - lihoods. In Zambia, for example, the informal sector is a major source of employment and livelihoods, and almost 80 percent of the country's informal workers are employed in agriculture-related activities (Mwango et al., 2019). However, the conditions under which the informal sector operates raise concerns about the safety and quality of the food sold, including TASF. The informal sector focuses on the sale of fresh food, while supermarkets and other formal stores supply more processed products (Romanik, 2008). Traditional food markets have also been associated with important food-borne and zoonotic disease outbreaks, including most recently COVID-19 (Pekar et al., 2022; Worobey et al., 2022; WHO, 2021). A safe and healthy traditional food market should provide people with food that is not only safe but also nutritionally adequate (WHO, 2021). Factors that need to be considered if this is to be achieved include physical layout and facil- ities, hygiene practices and food handling, including that of ready-to-eat food. A combination of diverse interven- tions, encompassing research, regulation and education and operating at different stages of the food chain, has the potential to yield the best results (WHO, 2021). In addition, informal markets, especially those in developing countries, should be monitored to ensure food safety is maintained (Baltenweck, 2014). The term \"wet market\" is defined differently by different authors. The definitions also differ by location or region, especially with respect to the range of products sold within such markets. A \"wet market\" can be defined as a public market that sells, among other products, eggs, meat and fish in an open-air setting (Zeng, 2016). Emerging and re-emerging zoonotic infections have increased in frequency in the past centuries (Bengis et al., 2004). A number of factors contribute to zoonotic dis - ease transmission: population size, population mobility, intensification of production, urbanization, deforestation, wildlife trade, climate change and improper disposal of faeces, among others (Horby et al., 2014; National Research Council (US) Committee on Achieving Sustainable Global Capacity for Surveillance and Response to Emerging Diseases of Zoonotic Origin, 2009; Sosbey et al., 2006). The increased demand for and trade in meat from wildlife increase the chances of exposure to the pathogens that these foods may carry. The increasing human population has led to greater contact between humans and animals as a result of growing demand for foods of animal origin and greater encroachment on wildlife habitats for human activities and settlement (Naguib et al., 2021). Wet markets in China and meat from wild animals in Africa are strongly implicated in many recent zoonotic transfers and spillovers (Haider et al., 2020; 2022; Worobey et al., 2022). Such zoonotic diseases exert a significant burden on human health and have consid- erable socioeconomic impact globally. The interaction of humans, live domestic animals awaiting sale, food products and wild and scavenging animals increases the threat from emerging infectious diseases. SARS-CoV-2 was initially associated with a wet market in Wuhan province, China (Rabi et al., 2020). One leading theory is that the virus \"jumped\" from a bat to a pangolin or other wild animal, which was in turn sold in a wet market (Rabi et al., 2020). Similar theories have been reported in the past for the ori- gin of Ebola and other diseases, including HIV-AIDS (Zhang et al., 2020). Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) have also been reported to have originated from wet markets (Peiris, Guan and Yuen, 2004; Hui et al., 2020). In addition, the 2003 to 2006 avian influenza H5N1 outbreak, which culminated in 113 human deaths was linked to contact with infected poultry (Naeem et al., 2007). It is important to understand the epidemiology and pathogenesis of such pathogens, which may move into humans directly from the original host species or via intermediate or amplifier hosts. There is no doubt that a lack of action to make wet markets safer and more hygienic may endanger already-fragile agri- food systems, human health and human rights, and ulti- mately sustainable development at global scale (Akhtar, 2012). Several strategies have been instituted to minimize the public health impacts arising from such markets. The Convention on Biological Diversity has called for a move to reduce the number of live animals in wet markets and for stricter controls on the sale and consumption of wild species (Everard et al., 2020). In 2021, WHO has developed 7 Traditional food markets include wet markets, informal markets and farmers' markets that sell foods of animal origin/non-animal origin/dried goods and where live animals are sometimes housed and slaughtered on site (WHO, WOAH and UNEP , 2021).Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 164food-safety and hygiene standards for wet markets (WHO, 2021). Calls to ban wet markets may be met by local or national resistance in countries where such markets abound, thereby blocking opportunities to target the types of wet markets that actually pose serious risks to people or biodiversity. In order to reduce the risk of further pandemics, there is a need to reconsider guidelines on biosecurity and hygiene at wet markets, especially in high-risk regions. Measures such as installing handwashing facilities and toilets, requiring adequate drainage, separating live animals from meat and produce, and implementing protocols for food cleaning and animal slaughtering can help reduce pathogen expo - sure and transmission. Other options include strengthening zoning and land-use planning, developing appropriate leg- islative frameworks, integrating healthy design standards into infrastructure, improving the quality and distribution of public spaces, and strengthening the regulation and sur - veillance of agrifood systems. Science-based risk assess - ment of the zoonotic risks associated with wet markets is recommended (Naguib et al., 2021). One Health should be integrated into risk assessment frameworks, incorporat - ing data on ecosystem health, animal disease and human health (Naguib et al., 2021). In addition, policies should focus on minimizing harmful disruptions to communities while mitigating future health and biodiversity risks posed by emerging and re-emerging zoonoses and FBDs. All of these solutions would stand to benefit from a clearer classification of the different types of wet market that exist and the differential risks they pose. Lin et al. (2021) have provided a typology whereby \"wet markets sell consump - tion-oriented, perishable goods in a non-supermarket setting. While wildlife markets sell non-domesticated wild animals, either captive-bred or wild-caught, dead or alive, and live-animal markets sell live animals.\" Failure to differ - entiate between different types of wet market or treating wet markets as the only source from which pandemics may arise could lead to unfeasible or ineffectual policy deci- sions. Outright banning of wet markets could destroy the livelihoods of people that depend on them or even drive the development of even riskier black markets facilitated by corruption (Aguirre et al., 2020). Banning wet markets carries the risk that they will evade public scrutiny, making them even harder to quantify, regulate and reform (Roe et al., 2020). A middle ground could be to allow informal markets to operate with improved food-safety and hygiene standards, less animal crowding, regular inspections and increased surveillance focused on reducing the risk of emerging zoonotic diseases and the impact of FBDs. In low-income countries, government enforcement of reg- ulations tends to be weak and the informal sector tends to be large, providing more than 70 percent of total employ- ment in emerging market and developing economies (Ohnsorge and Yu, 2022). In such countries, many market actors are not licensed and do not pay taxes, traditional processing, products and retail prices predominate, and effective health and safety regulations are often evaded (Roesel, 2018). Failure to taxes affects revenue collection and governments' ability to provide services (Ohnsorge and Yu, 2022). The informal sector accounts for up to 39 percent of local gross domestic product (Roesel, 2018) . More than 80 percent of the TASF produced in poor coun- tries is marketed through informal markets (Mwango et al., 2019). Thus, measures should be put in place to safeguard the sector as food systems change while also ensuring product safety and protecting public health.Section D | Food safety and food-borne diseases 1658. Food-safety management Current evidence highlights the need to invest in food safe - ty through education and strong food-control systems. Food safety is closely linked to the way agrifood supply and distribution chains are organized - a factor that needs to be considered in future mitigation efforts. Agriculture is key to meeting the SDGs, and this has led to increased investment in intensification and diversification of production (Vipham, Chaves and Trinetta, 2018). Improving food safety requires broad stakeholder participation that to ensures that good practices are followed during production (farmers and pas - toralists), transportation, processing (manufacturers) and distribution (traders) (Oloo, 2010). Agribusiness rms are restructuring their production processes and distribution systems by transforming their contractual relations from market-based arrangements (e.g. traditional arms-length transactions) to integrated supply systems (e.g. vertical integration, formal contract or preferred supplier) and from food markets with no quality or safety standards to ones that use publicly or privately provided standards (Abebe, Bijman and Royer, 2016). National food-control systems are critical in ensuring better consumer health and supporting trade (FAO, 2020). Care of slaughter animals in production, transportation, markets and abattoirs is central to the pro - vision of safe and good-quality meat. Food-safety decision-making premised on risk analysis provides a framework for assessing food-safety risks, managing such risks and communicating both risks and decisions taken on how to mitigate them (FAO, 2017a). Policymakers and risk managers should always consider the complexity and dynamic nature of the various factors that can influence food-safety decisions. Risk is a function of the probability of an adverse health effect and the severity of that effect, consequential to a haz - ard or hazards. Risk analysis is an international approach to improving food safety. It is based on science and provides a basis for international trade in food products. Countries require an effective and efficient food-safety system based on scientific risk assessment and management. However, resources are limited. The desired outcome of a risk assess - ment is a measure of the probability of effects on human health attributable to a specific hazard, food, process, region, distribution pathway or some combination of these (H\u00e4sler et al., 2017). The Codex Alimentarius Commission and other bodies, such as the Codex Committee on General Principles, the Joint Expert Committee on Microbiological Risk Assessment, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives and the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues, have adopted a risk-analysis approach to food safety that consists of three stages - risk assess - ment, risk management and risk communication (FAO and WHO, 2014a). The process of assessing risk is divided into four steps (hazard identification, hazard characterization, exposure assessment and risk characterization) that are applied throughout the food chain to determine the risks a hazard poses to human health and capture the dynamics in the chain (see Subsection 3.3). Effective communication of information and scientific opinion on risks associated with real or perceived haz - ards in food is an essential and integral component of the risk-analysis process. Risk communication may originate from official sources at international, national or local lev- els or from other sources, such as industry, trade, consum- ers or other interested parties (FAO and WHO, 1999). The major challenges to food safety centre around, but are not limited to, inadequacies, inconsistencies, inequities and inefficiencies in the entire agrifood system (Vipham, Chaves and Trinetta, 2018) and this also includes livestock systems. Food-safety systems - both the policy and the operational aspects of food-safety management - at the national level require a solid foundation of epidemiolog- ical data, which often is lacking (FAO and WHO, 2003). In many developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, unsafe water is usually associated with diarrhoeal illness; reviews of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes have reported varying figures (20-60 percent) for the percentage of diarrhoea that can be attributed to unsafe water (Engell and Lim, 2013). In most developing countries, there is a lack of infrastruc - ture for laboratory testing and a lack of resources for rou- tine monitoring and/or enforcement (e.g. properly trained inspectors), and this represents a big gap in food-safety systems (Bartoloni and Gotuzzo, 2010). Although some governments have incorporated Codex Alimentarius guid- ance into their national health plans, lack of infrastructure makes operationalization of standards difficult. There are also inconsistencies in standards, regulations and certification in food-safety systems worldwide (e.g. formal market versus informal market standards and con- trols, and food production for domestic use versus food production for export) (Vipham, Chaves and Trinetta, 2018). Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 166Inconsistencies exist both within countries and between countries and are highly influenced by trade agreements, customer willingness to pay and government priorities. Failures in food safety have highlighted the need for new regulations to safeguard human health. A number of meat-related standards have therefore been developed by governments in many developing countries. These stand- ards are intended to achieve a workable balance between food safety, consumer health and the concerns of various stakeholders in the market portion of the value chain, including producers, commercial transporters and traders. FAO and WHO established the Codex Alimentarius Commission to address the safety and nutritional quality of foods and develop international standards to promote trade among countries. The Commission develops stand- ards for microbiological specification in foods, maximum limits for contaminants and toxins, maximum residue lim- its for pesticides and veterinary products, and maximum levels for food additives. The standards are intended to protect consumer health and ensure fairness in food trade. At national level, governments develop food-safety legis - lation to enforce standards and monitor compliance with official standards8 through approaches such as HACCP , food inspections, prerequisite programmes and GHPs. However, in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, there is need to create awareness among local government reg- ulators and private-sector value-chain actors of the exist - ence of standards and to enforce them. Standards can be adapted for particular countries (see Table D1). The future of food-safety surveillance will see the processing industry and regulators embracing data-collection and analysis technology in a quest for greater depth, specificity and accuracy (Detwiler, 2020). Table D1 Localized risk-management standards in Uganda Standard Description Handling and transportation of slaughter animals (US 733:2007 standard) Labelling (coding of animals coming in and going out) Use of designated cattle transport trucks Separation of young and adult animals Avoidance of overcrowding (animals are often crammed into vehicles; many are injured or trampled to death) Avoidance of exhaustion and dehydration (animals can be in transit for days, often suffering extremes of temperature and lacking sufficient food, water or rest; many die as a result) Avoidance of pain and stress (animals are sentient beings and feel pain and stress just like we do) Design and operation of abattoirs and slaughterhouses (US 734:2007 Standard) Availability of equipment for stunning, bleeding, skinning and processing Use of hygienic machines that are easy to clean Use of well-designed structures Use of food-grade colours Use of appropriate floor and drainage channels Hygienic requirements for butcheries (US 736:2007 standard) Use of a clean environment (butcheries) Use of clean hygienic clothing Maintenance of good personnel hygiene Use of refrigerated trucks for meat transporting Use of food-grade colours Use of chillers and freezers Hygienic requirements for the production of packaged meat products (processed or manufacture) (US 737:2007 standard) Use of food-grade packaging materials Use of disposable paper towels Use of acceptable material cutting boards Requirement for animal stock routes, check points and holding grounds (US 778:2007 standard) Use of gazetted livestock routes for movement between production sites, marketing or other user sites or areas, and terminal market destinations Designation of animal species and the area they occupy (also referred to as the carrying capacity) Designation of accredited animal and/or meat inspectors Placement of permanent animal check points along major stock routes 8 https://www.fao.org/fao-who-codexalimentarius/codex-texts/en/Section D | Food safety and food-borne diseases 1679 https://www.who.int/news/item/01-12-2021-tripartite-and-unep-support-ohhlep-s-definition-of-one-healthOne Health Although One Health is not a new concept, it was defined in 2022 by FAO, WOAH, WHO and UNEP9 as follows: One Health is an integrated, unifying approach that aims to sustainably balance and optimize the health of peo - ple, animals and ecosystems. It recognizes the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants, and the wider environment (including ecosystems) are closely linked and inter-dependent. The approach mobilizes multiple sectors, disciplines and communities at varying levels of society to work together to foster well-being and tackle threats to health and eco - systems, while addressing the collective need for clean water, energy and air, safe and nutritious food, taking action on climate change, and contributing to sustaina- ble development (see Figure D2). The term is used to refer to approaches to tackling zoonotic diseases that consider all components that might lead to or increase the threat of disease (Cunningham, Daszak and Wood, 2017). The One Health approach was first described in 2004 (Atlas 2013) and has become increasingly important given the emergence and re-emergence of zoonotic infec - tions. It has been shown that 61 percent of human infections and over 70 percent of emerging infections are zoonotic (Jones et al., 2008; Taylor, Latham and Woolhouse, 2001). Understanding the complex nature of food-borne pathogens requires a One Health, transdisciplinary approach involving microbiologists, pathologists, epidemiologists, veterinari- ans and animal, plant and environmental (Garcia, Osburn and Jay-Russell, 2020). Summa, Henttonen and Maunula (2018) reported finding human noroviruses in 31 out of 115 wild-bird faecal samples (27 percent), two out of 100 rat faecal samples and zero out of 85 mouse faecal samples collected from animals at a dump site in southern Finland. Wildlife intrusions into cultivat - ed fields are a threat to the safety of preharvest produce (Garcia, Osburn and Jay-Russell, 2020). For example, wild- life such as pigs, birds and rodents can move from garbage sites to fields, spreading faecal pathogens in the process. One Health is being implemented - to varying degrees - in a variety of settings and at local, national and inter - national scales. Its use in the prevention and control of zoonotic diseases with pandemic potential has gained momentum as governments and other stakeholders have increased their emphasis on health risks that emerge at human-animal-ecosystem interfaces as part of longer- term strategies to prepare for severe outbreaks of human disease (Nabarro and Wannous, 2014). One Health plays a major role in the formulation and adap - tation of policies promoting sustainable, safe and equita- ble livestock-rearing practices (Nabarro and Wannous, 2014). The approach encourages a systematic focus on the links between agricultural livelihoods (especially those of HUMAN ENVIRONMENT ANIMALSECTORS and DISCIPLINES Collaboration Capacity buildingCommunication Coordination Healthy humansHealthy ecosystems Healthy animals Regional and globalLocal and nationalRural, urban, mobile communities Inclusivity, equity and accessSOCIETY ONE HEALTHFigure D2.

It requires constant atten- tion to climate change adaptation and mitigation, land tenure, efficient and safe use of water, access to energy and infrastructure, and maintenance of environmental services. The critical feature of One Health is that it is a multisec - toral strategy for addressing public health concerns, which is very important in food-safety management. Hence, governments should look for ways to link their efforts to increase the productivity and efficiency of agrifood sys - tems, promote infrastructure development and access to energy, water and affordable health care, and sustain environmental services (including mitigation of climate change) (Nabarro and Wannous, 2014). In the context of food-safety management, when animals are healthy and TASFs are safe, people are also safe and healthy. When the environment in which people, plants and animals live is safe, then animals, plants and people are safe. It is there - fore crucial that all stakeholders in the livestock sector address food-safety issues. Food-safety management sys - tems must strongly embrace the notion of One Health. The approach is vital to sustainable livestock production and to improving the quality and safety of TASFs.Section D | Food safety and food-borne diseases 1699. Gaps and needs in the evidence-base The global emergence and re-emergence of food-borne pathogens have increased the importance of microbiologi- cal safety and food quality to public health (Odeyemi and Bamidele, 2016; Odeyemi and Sani, 2016). International trade and travel increase the spread of FBDs and contrib - ute to the emergence of new hazards, creating additional challenges for disease prevention, control and surveillance (WHO, 2017b). The WHO initiative that estimated global and regional bur - dens of FBDs was an important step for food safety. Reports by FERG are comprehensive sources of information on the status of FBDs, globally and regionally (WHO, 2015, 2017b). This information indicates the importance of preventing and mitigating risks to food safety. It also guides the devel- opment and implementation of food-safety policies and the strengthening of food-safety systems (WHO, 2017b). However, the FERG reports indicate that the FBD incidence and burden data they present are probably underestimates given the limitations of surveillance systems, possible errors in diagnosis and the fact that not all sick people seek med- ical care (WHO, 2015). Furthermore, the WHO analysis was based on modelling and expert attribution of the roles of food in disease. Developed-country studies that make more use of clinical data generally suggest that these roles are greater than estimated in the WHO reports (Grace, 2017). Comparing the European regional rankings with those of other regions reveals major differences in the burden of FBDs. For instance, apart from non-typhoidal Salmonella spp., the ten leading food-borne causes of DALYs in the European region are hazards that are systematically ranked lower at global level (WHO, 2017b). The burden in the European region is dominated by invasive infectious diseases, while the burden at global level is dominated by diarrhoeal diseases. Microbial pathogens are responsible for a significant part of FBD burden in developed countries, where they cause 20 to 40 percent of intestinal disease and a similar or greater burden of non-intestinal manifesta- tions of FBDs (Kirk et al., 2014; Scallan et al., 2011; Tam et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2013). The proportion of diarrhoea caused by food in LMICs remains unknown (Grace, 2015b). Evidence on FBDs in LMICs is still limited (Grace, 2015b). However, recent studies have increased concerns about them, particularly those caused by biological hazards. A few studies in Southeast Asia have relied on the opinion of victims to determine whether disease is food-borne: these also suggest high levels of FBDs (Ho et al., 2010). One sur -vey in China reported FBDs as the second greatest risk peo - ple faced in daily life (after earthquakes), with 92 percent of respondents reporting that they expected soon to become a victim of food poisoning (Alcorn and Ouyang, 2012). Consumption of fresh, perishable foods sold in informal markets increases the risk of FBDs in developing countries (Grace, 2015b). Research gaps in food safety have been re - ported to include: $ data on FBDs at country level that would allow evidence-based prioritization of FBDs; $ diagnostic and reporting systems that would allow more accurate assessments of FBDs, including FBDs in the community; and $ ways to raise awareness of the importance of FBDs through more effective risk communication (Grace, 2017). FBD has been increasing in some developed countries and is likely to increase in developing countries as a result of massive increases in the consumption of TASF, the length- ening and broadening of value chains, greater bulking of food from different sources and increases in the distance between production and consumption (Grace, 2015b). Over the years, FBD outbreaks attributed to unsafe raw food, poor storage practices, inadequate cooking, poor person- al hygiene, improper handling methods and cross con- tamination have been reported (Lamuka, 2014; Odeyemi and Bamidele, 2016; Odeyemi and Sani, 2016). There is a need to continuously sensitize both food handlers and consumers about the need for personal hygiene and food-safety awareness, as studies have shown that there is a strong correlation between food-safety awareness and food-safety attitudes (Ba, afak Ersun Parry-Hanson al., 2016). In Kenya's milk value chain, preharvest activities are recognized to have impli- cations for post-harvest food safety, particularly for milk, because of their effects on microbial, adulterant and afla- toxin contamination and antimicrobial residues. Capacity building on aspects of milk safety for various stakeholders so that they will be better able to detect food-safety issues and take action to address them has been suggested (Kang'ethe et al., 2020). A study on improving the productiv- ity, quality and safety of milk in Rwanda and Nepal report - ed that weaknesses of food-safety concern in the milk val- ue chain included suboptimal hygiene, problems with milk cooling, lack of proper cleaning through all the phases of milk processing and lack of basic dairy-management edu- cation (De Vries, Kaylegian and Dahl, 2020). The authors of this study also recommended training all stakeholders on food safety in the milk value chain.Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 170In developing countries, the structure of agrifood systems compounds the problem of FBDs. The food-control systems in most of the developing world are heterogeneous, frag- mented and involve many actors (Grace, 2015b). Structural challenges are exacerbated by generally poor capacity to enforce regulation. Governance challenges in food-systems regulation include inadequate policy and legislation, mul- tiple organizations with overlapping mandates, outdated, fragmented or missing legislation, inappropriate stand- ards, lack of harmonization and alignment of standards, failure to cover the informal sector, limited involvement of civil society, and limited enforcement (Jaffee et al., 2019). In China and Viet Nam, for example, changing industry struc - ture, rapid market development, rapidly changing prices for products and inputs, low profit margins, lack of bar - gaining power on the part of key players and lack of gov- ernment support to stabilize markets all exert pressure on value-chain actors to cut corners and sacrifice food safety (Grace, 2015b). Lack of standardization of food controls and methods of assessment across jurisdictions is another major gap that requires greater attention. In developed countries, considerable investments have been made in food safety. Despite this, the European Union region and the United States of America have experienced FBD incidents (EFSA and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [ECDC], 2014; CDC, 2014). One argument is that investments in food safety have had limited impact not because the strategies were ineffective but because risk has increased as a result of factors such as globalization, chang- es in eating habits and changes in farming practices (Newell et al., 2010). In Europe and the United States of America, food safety was an issue of intense concern during the periods when they were most rapidly industrializing and urbanizing, and this concern is now evident in more rapidly industrializ - ing developing countries, many of which are undergoing rap - id agricultural intensification, which may increase the risk of FBDs (Jones et al., 2013). A review of agricultural intensifica- tion and human health in the Greater Mekong region found links between irrigation and fish-borne parasitosis, between livestock manure and contaminated produce, between anti- microbial use and the transfer of resistant bacteria through food, and between pesticide use and food contamination (Richter et al., 2015). A multicountry review found that a 1 percent increase in crop output per hectare was associ- ated with a 1.8 percent increase in pesticide use and that pesticides were weakly regulated in countries undergoing intensification, implying greater risk of food contamination (Schreinemachers and Tipraqsa, 2012). Some developed countries have succeeded in reducing the burden of FBDs over relatively short periods of time (Grace, 2015a), for example the decline of nontyphoidal Salmonella achieved in the United Kingdom through legislation, food-safety advice and a voluntary, private sector-led vacci- nation programme (O'Brien, 2013). In Denmark, Salmonella was reduced to below 5 percent in broiler flocks, below 2 per - cent in layer flocks and below 1 percent in pork products by monitoring herds and flocks, eliminating infected animals, and differential processing depending on Salmonella status. This resulted in savings of USD 25.5 million in 2001 (Wegener et al., 2003). In these examples, control was achieved by tak - ing action along the value chain, with emphasis on reducing disease in the animal reservoir rather than in retailed prod- ucts. Although these control approaches are more feasible in industrialized countries that have intensive farming sys - tems and good enforcement capacity, they are likely to be useful in developing countries as well (Grace, 2015a). Control measures along the value chain are particularly important. This is because not all food handlers and consumers under - stand the roles they need to play to protect their health and that of the wider community, such as adopting basic hygien- ic practices when buying, selling and preparing food (FAO and WHO, 2003). Developing countries often cite the lack of information on the cost of FBDs as a major reason for the lack of engagement by national policymakers. Country-level data on the cost of FBDs are important and should ideally be integrated with assessments of health burden; standardized methods for assessing the economic costs of FBDs in devel- oping countries would also be helpful, as use of different methods leads to wide variations in estimates (Grace, 2017). Legislation and policies on food may fail to achieve their objectives if they do not account for the concerns of key stakeholders. A study monitoring improvements to food safety in the largest abattoirs and meat markets in Nigeria found that policies had become ineffective partly because the authorities had attempted to move butchers to an abat - toir that was more modern and hygienic but was also more distant, a step that was resisted by the butchers and led to riots. It was concluded that an enabling environment and stakeholder collaboration in efforts to improve food safety are important (Grace, Dipeolu and Alonso, 2019). According to WHO (WHO, 2017b), responsibility for addressing and tackling FBDs should be shared by stakeholders along the food chain from production to consumption. Collaboration between government, the food industry, academia and civil society is essential, as is awareness raising among all stake - holders and consumer education about food safety risks and how to prevent and reduce them. A number of factors contribute to the presence of hazards in foods, including inappropriate livestock-production practices, poor hygiene at all stages of the livestock food chain, lack of Section D | Food safety and food-borne diseases 171preventive controls in food processing and preparation, mis - use of chemicals, especially veterinary drugs, contamination of raw materials and water, and inadequate food storage (Birlouez-Aragon et al., 2010). Concerns about food hazards have usually focused on microbiological hazards, pesticide residues, misuse of food additives, chemical contamination (including contamination with biological toxins), and adul- teration; each of these issues needs to be fully addressed by legislation at relevant levels (FAO and WHO, 2003). Increasing international trade, an expanding world econo - my, liberalization of food trade, growing consumer demand and developments in food science and technology mean that food-safety systems and control measures for food hazards remain complex (FAO and WHO, 2003). Focusing on food safety, especially food safety in developing countries, is vital to efforts to enhance cross-border trade. Creating and sustaining demand for food products in world markets relies on building the trust and confidence of importers and consumers in the integrity of agrifood systems (Unnevehr and Ronchi, 2014). The Codex Alimentarius Commission plays an important role in coordinating food standards at the international level and ensures that the health of con- sumers is protected and that fair practices in food trade are fully exercised (FAO and WHO, 2003). Governments should therefore use Codex Alimentarius standards to determine and refine policies and regulations within their national food-control systems. To strengthen food-control systems, there is a need to strengthen food-safety programmes addressing the man- agement of risks associated with physical and chemical food hazards. The main role of food control is to enforce food standards protecting consumers from unsafe, impure and fraudulently presented food by prohibiting the sale of food that is not of the nature, substance or quality demanded by the purchaser - and this increases consumer confidence (Havelaar et al., 2015). FBD outbreaks involving agents such as E. coli and Salmonella and chemical contaminants have led consumers to conclude that modern farming systems, food processing and marketing need to provide better safe - guards for public health (FAO and WHO, 2003). Surveillance and traceability of hazards are very important. For example, within dairy value chains most chemical and physical hazards are controlled via quality assurance sys - tems on the farm and at the dairy factory.

There is evidence that this is an effective option when used as a therapeutic supplement in the management of severe acute malnutrition in infants and young children. Egg powder and fish powder have been significantly less used as ingredients in fortified and blended foods, probably because of palatability and shelf-life issues and the processing techniques involved. u The science related to alternatives to terrestrial animal source food (TASF), including plant-based foods and cell-cul- tured \"meat\" , is relatively new. Evidence suggests that these products cannot replace TASF in terms of nutritional composition. Microalgae are highly regarded as a TASF alternative because of their rich nutritional composition and the advantages they may offer as a natural carbon sink. Plant-based meat alternatives that are widely available on the market have been found to be deficient in some essential nutrients and rich in saturated fat, sodium and sugar. Further research is needed to complete the food safety risk assessment for cell-cultured \"meat\" in the context of industrial-scale production. u While insects can provide many essential nutrients - and there is some evidence relating to nutrition outcomes - cultural barriers and individual preferences currently constrain their consumer acceptability. The environmental sustainability of using insects as human food seems compelling, and demand for them may increase in the coming years. Nevertheless, food-safety concerns need to be considered in the scaling up of insects as food or feed. u Current \"omics\" applications offer promise in terms of the characterization of nutritional quality and safety, devel- opment of precision or personalized nutrition, especially for defined targeted groups of people (e.g. young chil- dren), and comparison of the nutritional composition of alternatives to TASF. u Microbiome science has recently revealed that some effects of the diet on health may be mediated by the gut mi- crobiome - the trillions of microorganisms that live in the human gut. Various TASFs, including meat and fermented dairy products, affect the composition and function of the gut microbiome and hence might affect human health via the production of microbial metabolites. High intake of red and processed meat and saturated animal fats may have deleterious effects, while fermented dairy products seem to be associated with reduced inflammation. Posi- tive or negative impacts on health may be modulated by the overall quality of the diet (in terms of fats, sugars and fibre). u Assessment of the contribution of TASF to sustainable healthy diets needs to consider regional variation in natural resources, background health and nutrition, nutritional needs over the life course, the availability and accessibility of food, and the ecosystem roles of livestock. Emerging evidence on the sustainability of diets shows that the diver - sity of species (plants, and terrestrial and aquatic animals) in the diet contributes to higher nutrient adequacy.Section E | Emerging topics related to terrestrial animal source food 193Summary This section addresses emerging and ongoing scientific themes related to the contribution of terrestrial animal source food (TASF) to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes. A large and diverse range of TASF products are now available on the market or used by international aid and devel- opment projects as part of fortified and blended products. It is difficult to establish direct causal links between the consumption of TASF ingredients and human-health outcomes, but there are compelling findings indicating an asso - ciation between small-quantity lipid supplements that include milk powder and improved child growth. The science of alternatives to TASF is relatively new, but evidence suggests that alternative products cannot replace TASF with respect to nutritional composition. Insect and insect products may hold greater promise in terms of contributing to nutritional requirements and offsetting the environmental impacts of other TASF. The emerging topic of \"omics\" has the potential to yield an increasingly nuanced understanding of how components of TASF interact with other foods in the diet. It may allow deeper insights into how TASF interact with the genome, epigenome and metabolome, and ultimately affect human health. Evidence on the relationships between TASF and the gut microbiome has increased rapidly in recent years. The gut microbiome has been shown to mediate the effects of meat consumption and fermented dairy-product consump - tion on human health. Emerging research addressing TASF and sustainable healthy diets is vital in the context of discourse and action on climate change. This section is not intended to be exhaustive in its discussion of each emerging topic. Ongoing investments in all these fields of research are needed in order to provide a deeper understanding of the roles TASFs play in human nutrition and health. A comprehensive overview of current scientific evidence is summarized in Sections B, C and D, and gaps in research and policy are identified. This section draws on existing reviews and reports to provide a brief description of some emerg- ing topics related to TASF, nutrition and health. The search strategy and methods used to evaluate the quality of the evidence were similar to those described in Section C. Some topics are covered in other sections (e.g. insects), so only novel aspects are highlighted here. It is acknowledged that the section does not cover the full range of emerging issues.Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 1941. Terrestrial animal source food products With advances in biotechnology and food science, a range of TASF products or TASF-related products have been developed. Two categories of product are discussed in this section: 1. fortified or blended foods containing TASFs as ingredients; and 2. TASF alternatives (plant-based and cell-cultured products and others). There are various moti- vations for the development of such products. In the case of the first category, the intention has largely been to improve the nutritional quality of products used, particularly in the context of food aid and/or supplementary feeding targeting vulnerable individuals. The development of products in the second category is motivated by environmental and health concerns, largely in the context of high-income countries. Fortified and blended foods containing TASF as ingredients Fortified foods are foods to which micronutrients have been added, generally with the aim of improving nutrient composition. Blended foods may combine several differ - ent food ingredients into single products, such as pastes, cereals or biscuits. TASF, specifically milk powder, has been used for decades to improve the nutritional quality of food-aid products and supplements, and there is some evidence that this is effective in the management of severe acute malnutrition (Hoppe et al., 2008; Iannotti, to-use therapeutic foods (e.g. Plumpy'Nut) that combine peanut paste with milk powder, oil, sugar and other forti- ficants have been used for community-based treatment of children with severe acute malnutrition. More recent - ly, small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (e.g. Nutributter) with similar ingredients (notably the milk powder) have been used as supplements to prevent malnutrition. A meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials among children aged between six and 24 months (n = 37 066) showed that such products reduced stunting by 12 percent, wasting by 14 percent and underweight by 14 percent (Dewey et al., 2021). Cost and access to milk powder remain significant barriers to large-scale produc - tion and wider distribution and use, especially in LICs and in contexts where acute malnutrition burdens are high (Potani et al., 2021). Other TASFs have been used to a lesser extent than milk powder to enhance the nutritional quality of foods. Egg and fish powders have been used as ingredients in fortified blended foods used as food aid or nutritional supplements, although palatability and shelf-life may be issues (Chitrakar, Zhang and Adhikari, 2019). The processing involved in producing such foods may also lead to changes in the nutri- ent and bioactive composition of the TASF ingredients. A relevant systematic review and meta-analysis of TASFs (including aquatic foods) and supplements (fortified supplements containing fish or milk powder, milk formu- la-based supplementation) was identified. The study (Pimpin et al., 2019) examined the impacts of such interven- tions on mothers and on preterm and term infants (defined as born after 37 weeks gestation) and on growth outcomes at birth and during early childhood. Investigators synthe - sized evidence from 62 trials involving over 30 000 individ- uals across samples and found greater evidence for effects on weight than on height outcomes. Maternal supplemen- tation with fortified blended foods or TASF increased the weight of the child at birth by 60 grams. Supplementation of infants (aged 6 to 12 months) and young children with fortified blended foods or TASF increased weight by 0.14 kg. Weight -for-length z -score was increased in food supplementation trials by 0.06 among term infants. TASF supplementation increased height -for-age z -score by 0.06 and odds of stunting by 13 percent. TASF alternatives: plant-based and other products TASF alternative products have emerged in some markets around the world, primarily for commercial reasons relat - ed to growing consumer interest in healthy food, reducing environmental footprints and improving animal welfare (He et al., 2020; Ismail, Hwang and Joo, 2020; Kyriakopoulou, Dekkers and van der Goot, 2019; Lee et al., 2020). Despite claims about these products, substantial gaps remain in the empirical evidence base related to them (Rubio, Xiang and Kaplan, 2020; Santo et al., 2020). It is unclear whether they reduce environmental impacts - especially in high-income contexts where the livestock-related environmental issues are predominant - or adequately meet nutritional require - ments for human health. Life-cycle analyses suggest that greenhouse gas emissions from the production of plant- based meat alternatives are lower than those from the production of beef finished in feedlots but not lower than those from the production of beef from cattle finished on well-managed pastures (van Vliet, Kronberg and Provenza, 2020). Demand for plant-based alternative products is growing in some regions, and they are being incorporated into some niche diets such as flexitarian, vegetarian and Section E | Emerging topics related to terrestrial animal source food 195vegan diets (Chriki and Hocquette, 2020; Rizzo and Baroni, 2018). Box E1 summarizes the current state of knowledge on the nutritional quality of cell-cultured \"meat\" and relat - ed food-safety issues. TASF alternative products may use fungal or plant deriv- atives, such as mycoprotein and soy leghaemoglobin (for the meat alternatives) and nuts or soy (for milk alter - natives). Mycoprotein, which is found in some products such as sausages or patties, is a protein-rich food made of filamentous fungal biomass. The organism Fusarium venenatum is used, together with egg albumen, colour and flavour compounds, to produce mycoprotein. The use of agro-industrial residues as a substrate for mycoprotein production may reduce environmental impacts below those of other TASF alternatives (Souza Filho et al., 2019). Soy leghaemoglobin, developed by Impossible Foods, Inc., is used to emulate the taste and texture of beef. One review of the literature found no evidence for risk of allergenicity or toxicity for leghaemoglobin or other host proteins (Jin et al., 2018). Microalgae are another TASF alternative and have received attention particularly for their rich content of long-chain n-3 and n-6 fatty acids. In addition to the advan- tages they may offer as a natural carbon sink, they have been recognized for their value in human food and animal feed. Species of Chlorella, Arthrospira and Aphanizomenon contain quality proteins, while Haematococcus and Dunaliella are dense in antioxidants, including carotenoids (Kusmayadi et al., 2021). TASF alternatives are relatively new to global food markets, and the literature on their health impacts is therefore limit - ed. Some studies have analysed the nutrient composition of plant-based meat alternatives relative to TASF and human requirements. One analysis compared the food chemistry of plant-based products (Beyond Meat Burger, Impossible Foods Burger and Morning Star's Black Bean Burger) to that of meats and found sodium and saturated fat content to be higher in the plant-based products (Swing et al., 2021). Moreover, while essential amino acid levels were higher, some nutritionally important ones - methionine and lysine - were unavailable in the plant-based alternatives. Another study underscored some of these findings by modelling a reference omnivore diet compared to flexitarian, vegetari- an and vegan diets using traditional and novel plant-based foods (Tso and Forde, 2021). Nutrient intakes in the novel plant-based substitute diet were found to be below daily requirements for vitamin B12, zinc, calcium, potassium and magnesium. Intake levels for saturated fat, sodium, and sugar were found to be higher in the novel plant-based substitute diet than in the reference omnivore diet. Plant- based milk alternatives, which often contain sugar and Box E1. Nutritional quality of cell-cultured \"meat\" and related food-safety issues Cell multiplication to produce cell-cultured \"meat\" re- quires a growth medium containing nutrients such as vitamins, amino acids, minerals, glucose, growth fac- tors and hormones. Some of the additives in the me- dium are substrates needed for cell development and viability. The most efficient and widely used medium is derived from bovine blood. Research is ongoing on how to replace it with a medium derived from plants (Chriki and Hocquette, 2020). The nutrient content of the resulting tissue should re- flect that of the growth medium, but the uptake of dif- ferent micronutrients by cells remains to be fully under - stood, including the uptake of essential micronutrients that are only found in TASF (e.g. conjugated linoleic acid produced in the rumen, heme-iron and vitamin B12) (Post and Hocquette, 2017). Laboratory production conditions can affect nutrient content in the cells: a low-oxygen environment is needed to enable myoglobin expression, and iron uptake by the cell requires further research (Post and Hocquette, 2017). There is no current evidence on the bioavailability of micronutrients in cul- tured cells as compared to those in meat (Chriki and Hocquette, 2020; Warner, 2019). The aseptic conditions and environmental control re- quired for the production of cell-cultured \"meat\" is like- ly to reduce the risk of contamination with food-borne pathogens (Warner, 2019), especially microbiological hazards (e.g. Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes). However, the use of animal-blood components as growth medium (foetal bovine serum has been widely used to date) can be a source of hazards (e.g. viruses and prions) (Hadi and Brightwell, 2021). The addition of biochemical compounds to the medium to enable cell growth and of antimicrobials to impair bacterial infec- tion of the resulting tissue needs further risk analysis for each such compound, both in terms of toxicity to the consumer and in terms of antimicrobial resistance (Post and Hocquette, 2017). The potential occurrence of unexpected dysregulation of biological mechanism (e.g. cell multiplication similar to that of cancer cells), which has also been reported, needs to be included in human health risk assessment (Chriki and Hocquette, 2020). The potential use of genetic engineering (improvement of the means of production, potential use of exogenous genes) triggers a need for continuous risk assessment (Hadi and Brightwell, 2021). Despite the growing literature on cultured cells, evi- dence on nutritional value and food-safety outcomes re- mains more theoretical than practical. Further research is needed to complete food-safety risk assessment, espe- cially in the context of industrial-scale production and to enable regulators to address public-health issues.Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 196micronutrient fortificants, may not be able to completely replace animal milk with regard to nutrient composition and flavour (Tangyu et al., 2019). Few experimental trials have examined the impacts of TASF alternatives on human health. One small cross- over randomized trial (n = 36 adults) studied the effect of consuming plant-based meat alternatives on serum trimethylamine -N-oxide (TMAO) and other biomarkers and on anthropometric outcomes (Crimarco et al., 2020). It found that consuming the plant-based products was associated with significantly lower TMAO concentrations than consuming TASF. TMAO has been implicated as a cardiovascular risk factor in adults, but some questions have been raised regarding its specificity and responsive - ness to diet, and its significance in infant and child health is unknown (Blesso, 2015; Hamaya et al., 2020; Landfald et al., 2017). A randomized control trial based on a sample of adults in the United Kingdom (n = 155) evaluated the impact of a four -week intervention with TASF alternatives and messaging on the benefits of consuming less meat on meat intake, consumption of TASF alternatives, and a set of nutrition and health outcomes (Bianchi et al., 2019, 2022). The study found significant reductions in meat consump - tion for the intervention group relative to the control group - reductions of 63 g/d and 39 g/d at four-week and eight- week follow-ups, respectively. Acceptability of TASF alternatives and consumer behav- iour will be covered in Component Document 2, but rele - vant findings are described here. One systematic review (Onwezen et al., 2021) examined the consumer acceptance of what the authors termed \"alternative proteins\" . These included pulses, algae, insects, plant-based alternatives and cultured meats. The acceptability of cell-cultured meat was found to be low, ranking only above insects (which are discussed below). Important determinants of acceptance across all alternative foods were social norms, familiarity, taste and health motives, attitudes, food neophobia and disgust. Another recent review of the literature (Lonkila and Kaljonen, 2021) concludes that the ethics of TASF alternatives need to be explored in greater depth.Section E | Emerging topics related to terrestrial animal source food 1972. Insects: novel products, acceptability and scalability Insects have been consumed by humans for millennia. It is estimated that almost a quarter of the world's population consumes insects, across 1 900 species, most common- ly from the orders Coleoptera (beetles), Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Hymenoptera (bees, ants and wasps), Orthoptera (grasshoppers, locusts and crick - ets) and Hemiptera (cicadas, leafhoppers, planthoppers, scale insects and true bugs) (Huis, 2013) (see Figure B1). However, urbanization and increased access to other TASFs means that in many societies insect consumption is no longer widespread. In recent years, consumer demand for environmentally friendly, nutrient-rich foods has led to a return to consuming insects, this time in the form of novel products. As discussed in Section B, insects can fulfil requirements for many essential nutrients (Orkusz, 2021). Depending on the species and the stage of maturation, they may be especially rich in protein, polyunsaturated fats, vitamin C, dietary fibre and several minerals, including zinc, iron, copper, magnesium, manganese, phosphorous and seleni- um (Rumpold and Schl\u00fcter, 2013). While epidemiological evidence for health impacts associated with consuming insects remains limited, their potential was noted in recent narrative review (Nowakowski et al., 2021). Small-scale intervention studies are highlighted in Section C of this document and suggest positive effects on the nutrition of young children living in low-resource settings (Bauserman et al., 2015; Harmiyati et al., 2017).Cultural barriers and individual preferences interfere with broad acceptance and with bringing some products to scale (Jantzen da Silva Lucas et al., 2020; Onwezen et al., 2021). However, commercial companies have devel- oped products from insects such as mealworms, crickets, locusts and black soldier flies that have higher accepta- bility, including powders, patties, bars, breads, pastas and snacks. Food-safety concerns should be considered in the scaling up of insects as food or feed. Contaminants may be biological (bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites) or chemical (mycotoxins, pesticides, heavy metals or anti microbials), and allergenic risks have also been described (FAO, 2021). The environmental sustainability appeal of using insects as human food seems compelling and may increase demand in the coming years. Insects' high feed conversion rates (their efficiency in transforming feed into human food) have been particularly noted (Nowakowski et al., 2021). One anal- ysis showed that for the same protein yield, crickets need six times less feed than cattle, four times less than sheep, and two times less than pigs and broiler chickens (Rumpold and Schl\u00fcter, 2013). Insects also produce less greenhouse-gas emissions than livestock and can be grown on organic waste. Another analysis compared production systems for conventional TASFs, insects and TASF alternatives (plant- based and cell-cultured \"meats\") for agricultural land requirements and showed that insects have high poten- tial, particularly relative to conventional TASF production (Alexander et al., 2017). Insects can efficiently transform agricultural by-products and food waste into edible food, and this merits more research and future investment.Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 1983. Foodomics as it relates to terrestrial animal source food, diets and effects on health Foodomics was first defined by Cifuentes (2009) as \"a disci- pline that studies the food and nutrition domains through the application and integration of advanced omics tech- nologies to improve consumer's well-being, health, and knowledge.\" It is a scientific approach to studying the rela- tionship between food and health through the application approaches: genomics, proteomics, metabolom- ics, metagenomics addresses two nutrition-specific fields of research: nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics. All these disci- plines use various methods to characterize and quantify molecules that contribute to human health (see Box E2). This subsection briefly describes the application of nutrition subsection (Mayneris-Perxachs and Swann, 2019; R\u00e5djurs\u00f6ga et al., 2018). The science of \"omics\" can be applied to broader fields of livestock management and health (Banerjee, Pal and Ray, 2015; Rothschild and Plastow, 2014; Sun and Guan, 2018), but the discussion here is restricted to its use in relation to TASF and human health. To date, the various \"omics\" methods have been primar - ily used to examine the nutrient and bioactive compo - nents of TASF, as relevant to topics covered in Section B. For example, a study on bovine milk that used metabo - lomics analyses from nuclear magnetic resonance, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and inductively coupled mass spectrometry Box E2. What are \"omics\"? Omics is a scientific discipline or field of research that analyses complete genetic or molecular profiles in humans and other organisms. Depending on the specific component analysed, omics is commonly divided into the following categories: genomics: the study of the genome (the complete set of DNA); transcriptomics: the study of the transcriptome (the complete set of RNA); proteomics: the study of the structure, function and interactions of proteins produced by the genes of a particular cell, tissue or organism; and metabolomics: the study of the set of metabolites within an organism. These components, in interaction with the environ- ment, determine the phenotype (observable character - istics) of an individual. Overview of omicsTwo areas of research focus on the relationship between human genes and nutrition: nutrigenetics: the study of gene variants linked to differential response to specific nutrients and the rela - tion of this variation to different diseases, for example obesity and non-communicable diseases; and nutrigenomics: the study of the effects of nutrients and other components of food on gene expression and of how genetic variations may affect human health. Nutrigenomics is important in the study of the preven- tion and treatment of non-communicable diseases. Systems biology is increasingly being used to under - stand the constellation of factors influencing human nutrition. This trend, along with improvements in analytical methods, such as 1H nuclear magnetic reso - nance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, and major advances in big data science, has created a growing evidence base for \"omics\" and human nutrition. DNA RNA Proteins Metabolites Genomics Transcriptomics Proteomics MatabolomicsPHENOTYPESection E | Emerging topics related to terrestrial animal source food 199metabolite species (Foroutan et al., 2019). Metabolomics can be used to identify biomarkers of the nutritional qual- ity and safety of TASF. One study identified the following candidate biomarkers for potential use in the fields of milk quality, safety and traceability: choline, citrate, valine, hippuric acid, (Zhu et al., 2021). Another study (van Vliet et al., 2021) used metabolomics to compare plant-based TASF alternatives to ground beef from grass-fed production systems and revealed substantial differences in metabolite abundanc - es (171 out of 190 profiled metabolites; false discovery rate adjusted p < 0.05). Only the beef samples contained DHA, niacinamide (vitamin B3), glucosamine, hydroxyproline and several anti-oxidants, while only the plant-based TASF alternatives contained vitamin C, phytosterols and several phenolic anti-oxidants. Proteomics and transcriptomics have been used to study proteins in milk (Anagnostopoulos et al., 2016; Bertram and and Piras, 2018) and eggs (Gautron et al., 2010). Scientists have described the potential appli- cation of nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics to animal milks in order to enable precision or personalized nutrition, both for humans and animals (Benitez, Nunez and Ovilo, 2017; in experimental, population-based studies of the effects of TASF on human nutrition and health has been more limited. Targeted metabolom- ics was used for the studies described in Section C of eggs in the nutrition of young children in Ecuador (Lulun Project) and Malawi (Mazira Project). In the Lulun Project, a hypothesized set of metabolites was tested using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to assess the effects of eggs on biomarker concentrations in child plasma. The study found that eggs improved the concentrations of several metabolites in the methyl group metabolism path- way (Iannotti et al., 2017). Findings from the Mazira study, using both targeted and untargeted metabolomics, are still being analysed. One small cross-over design study (n = 32) compared serum metabolites using nuclear magnetic reso - nance vegan, ovo -vegetarian and omni- vore (R\u00e5djurs\u00f6ga et al., 2018). It found that betaine, choline and creatine concentrations were higher in the omnivore diet, while 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, carnitine, proline and tyrosine concentrations were higher in the ovo -vegetarian diets. The application of \"omics\" and precision nutrition may be promising and appropriate for well-defined target - ed groups of people (e.g. young children), but it is not yet feasible as a population-health solution.Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 2004. Terrestrial animal source food and the human microbiome Over the past 15 years, there has been a growing aware - ness of the role of the gut microbiome in interconnections between food and human health. The term microbiome refers to the microbial community (bacteria, archaea, protozoa, fungi and viruses) and its \"theatre of activity\" (genome, proteins and metabolites) in a given environment (Berg et al., 2020). Most studies on the human gut microbi- ome examine the bacterial population found in the human colon. Recent progress in DNA sequencing and \"omics\" technologies (see Box E2) has revolutionized capacity to investigate the microbial communities that live in symbio - sis with humans. It is now possible to know which species of microbes are present (even unculturable species), their functional potential and their metabolic activity at a given time in the gut. The gut microbiome is involved in several host functions: synthesis of certain vitamins; nutrient and xenobiotic10 metabolism; maintenance of gut barrier integrity; and protection against pathogens. Its action is not limited to local effects in the gut. Microbial metabolites - diet-de - pendent or diet-independent - can reach the bloodstream and act on other parts of the body, modulating several important host functions (glucose and lipid metabolism, systemic immunity, bone metabolism and even lung phys - iology and brain function) (Cryan et al., 2019). Increasing amounts of evidence from both animal and human studies show that aberrant (dysbiotic) gut micro - biomes are associated with, and may even contribute to, the pathogenesis of various common metabolic disorders (including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseas - es, undernutrition, obesity, cancer, auto-immune diseases and even neurodegenerative diseases [reviewed Ruff, Greiling and Kriegel, 2020 ]). High species diversity and gene richness, as well as high abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and low abundance of potential pathogens, are features usually associated with health. Multiple environmental and host factors shape the human gut microbiome, with diet being one of the main drivers across the lifetime. Both specific nutrients and whole diets may modify the composition of the microbiome and its function, with possible consequences for health (reviewed in Zmora, Suez and Elinav, 2019). As microbiome science is still a new field, evidence for impacts on health comes from converging studies, both in humans (observation- al and randomized control trials) and in animal models, that provide mechanistic explanation and help to eluci- date causality. Only data related to TASF are discussed in this subsection. Subsection 4.1 presents the impact of TASF products on the composition and function of the gut microbiome, and Subsection 4.2 discusses possible conse - quences for health. 4.1 Effect of terrestrial animal source food on the gut microbiome Data suggest that TASF have contributed to shaping the gut microbiome over the course of human evolution. For exam- ple, people in hunter-gatherer and some rural communi- ties have a very low level of Actinobacteria, including low levels of Bifidobacterium (Afolayan et al., 2019; Filippo et al., 2017; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2015; Schnorr et al., 2014), while in adults from urban environments Bifidobacteria common- ly make up 1 percent to 10 percent of the gut microbiome population. Lack of Bifidobacterium in pre-agriculture communities may be caused by the absence (or low levels) of dairy products in their diets (De Filippo et al., 2017). In vegan populations, the representation of Actinobacteria and Bifidobacterium is very low (Matijai et al., 2014; Zimmer et al., 2012). Losasso et al. (2018) report that among human cohorts omnivores had lower gene richness (alpha diversity) than long-term vegetarians. However, dura- tion of the diet may be important, as Zhang et al. (2018) observed a low effect on overall microbiome composition after a three-month vegetarian intervention. Losasso et al. (2018) found that differences between cohorts (vegan, vegetarian and omnivore) were greatest at the genus and species level and relatively minimal with respect to broad- er compositional features such as diversity and richness. At the species level, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a major SCFA producer, has been found to be distinctly more preva- lent in vegetarians than in omnivores (Matijai et al., 2014). 10 Xenobiotics are chemical substances, mostly synthetic, that are not normally present in the environment of living organisms. The gut mi- crobiome has a strong metabolizing capacity and is capable of biotransforming xenobiotics. It can modify the half-lives of xenobiotics and their potential biological effect (inactivate drugs or increase or alleviate toxicity) in the human host.Section E | Emerging topics related to terrestrial animal source food 201Bacteroides spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae spp. have been found to be present at significantly higher levels in omnivores than in vegans and vegetarians (Zimmer et al., 2012). There are also clear changes at functional level (genes, proteins and metabo - lites) (De Angelis et al., 2020; do Rosario, Fernandes and Trindade, 2016). High animal protein intake (tested in urban populations) modifies the gut microbiome and is highly associated with a gut microbiome dominated by the enterotype Bacteroides (Wu et al., 2011). In a short-term intervention in humans, a diet based on TASF was shown to increase the abundance of bile-tolerant microorganisms (Alistipes, Bilophila and Bacteroides) and to decrease the bromii - SCF-producing bacteria) (David et al., 2014). Long-term adherence to diets based on TASF has been shown to increase the abundance of pro-inflammatory species, including those related to Ruminococcus gnavus and Collinsella spp. (van Soest et al., 2020). Protein origin seems to influence the gut microbiome (Lang et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2015). The faecal bacteri- al communities of rats fed with meat proteins (red meat [beef and pork] or white meat [chicken and fish]) had a similar overall structure to those of rats fed with non-meat proteins (casein and soy) (Zhu et al., 2015). However, the beneficial genus Lactobacillus was present at a higher level in the white-meat protein group than in the red-meat or non-meat protein groups (Zhu et al., 2015). In both mice and humans, beef consumption has been found to increase the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes and to a decrease that of Bacteroidetes (Zhang, Li and Tang, 2019; Zhu et al., 2015). Overall, studies in humans and animals have found that consumption of dairy products (milk, yogurt, kefir) has a positive impact on the gut microbiome, increasing bacterial diversity and the abundance of the beneficial genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium (Aslam et al., 2020). Consumption of dairy products during childhood determines the acquisition of methanogenic archaea such as Methanobrevibacter smithii (van de Pol et al., 2017). M. smithii seems to play an impor - tant role in human physiology. Its depletion has been asso - ciated with both obesity and severe acute malnutrition in children (Million et al., 2012, 2016). TASF preparation may affect the gut microbiome. In humans, fried-meat intake has been found to lower micro - bial community richness (Gao et al., 2021; Partula et al., 2019) and to decrease Lachnospiraceae abundances while increasing Dialister, Dorea, and Veillonella abundances (Gao et al., 2021). Those changes were associated with increased levels of intestinal endo - toxin and systemic inflammation, but some of the effects may also be related to saturated fats (Gao et al., 2021). Processed meat has been shown to be inversely correlat - ed with Roseburia, a butyrate-producing bacteria (Yu et al., 2021). A study on mice, found that feeding raw rather than cooked meat had no discernible effect on the animals' gut bacterial populations (Carmody et al., 2019). Fermented TASFs (sausages, cheese, yogurt, kefir) are sources of food-borne microorganisms, mainly lactic-acid bacteria, that can be found in the gut microbiome and are usual- ly associated with positive health outcomes (David et al., 2014; Firmesse et al., 2007, 2008; Pasolli et al., 2020). The most frequently detected are starter cultures for fermented foods, such as Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis. Traditionally prepared TASF (e.g. dried raw meat prepared by Inuit people) may also be a source of environmental microorganisms (Hauptmann et al., 2020). As well as being a source of bacteria, fermented products can also modulate the resident microbiome via other mech- anisms. For example, cheese consumption has been found to be negatively associated with Akkermansia muciniphila abundance (Partula et al., 2019). In patients with irritable bowel disease (IBD), consumption of fermented milk (rath- er than non-fermented milk) led to a decrease in the abun- dance of Bilophila wadsworthia (a bacterial species asso - ciated with interabdominal infections and inflammation) and an increase in that of butyrate-producing bacteria and SCFA (Veiga et al., 2014). Differences observed between the effects of different TASFs on the gut microbiome may be caused by the fact that they vary in amino-acid composition, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), taurine, choline and carnitine. In addition to amino-acid composition, different protein sources vary in their content of other macronutrients, such as fats and fibres. For example, red and processed meats are rich in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (Lang et al., 2018). In addition, processing (e.g. fermentation) and cooking also influence the content of foods and the accessibility of nutrients. Finally, TASF may contain exogenous components such as food additives and the residues of veterinary drugs used in livestock production. Antibiotics at therapeutic doses have a strong impact on the microbiome, with consequences for health. Effects of antimicrobial drugs at residual level deserve further study. Food additives commonly used in processed meat, such as potassium sorbate and sodium nitrite, have been shown to disturb Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 202the gut microbiome in animal models (reduced diversity and increase of proteobacteria) (Cao et al., 2020). More data are needed to determine impacts on health. 4.2 Microbial metabolism of terrestrial animal source food and health The type and quantity of TASF consumed influence the composition of the microbiome and the microbial meta- bolites it produces, with potential consequences for human health (O'Keefe, 2016; Singh et al., 2017). Importantly, the overall quality of the diet may compensate for, or exacer - bate, some of the effects described in this section. Protein metabolism and health TASFs are a major source of proteins. Undigested dietary proteins can reach the large intestine and are broken down by proteolytic bacteria and subsequently used by bacteria as a source of amino acids for making their own proteins or fermented by proteolytic fermentation as an energy source. Bacterial metabolism of dietary proteins produc - es several types of metabolite. Like fibre fermentation, protein fermentation produces beneficial SCFA, but lower quantities are produced. Fermentation of aromatic amino acids by the gut microbiome is also particularly important biologically, as it generates a wide range of bioactive end products, such as phenol and p-cresol (derived from tyros - ine) and are derived from p-cresol and indole and are associated with kidney diseases (Chen et al., 2019). Indole and its derivative may have both nega- tive and positive impacts, promoting neurodevelopmen- tal or psychiatric diseases but possibly protecting against multiple sclerosis (Diether and Willing, 2019). Protein fermentation by the gut microbiome releases potentially toxic nitrogenous and sulfur metabolites, such as ammo - nia, amines, nitrites and 2017). Branched-chained fatty acids are reliable markers of proteolytic fermentation, as they are produced exclusively through the fermentation of BCAAs. In mice, an animal-based diet has been found to lead to higher production of branch-chained fatty acids (David et al., 2014). However, little is known about the effects of branch-chained fatty acids on host physiology. The gut microbiome also plays a role in amino-acid availability and circulation levels in the human host, and this has possible consequences for health. For example, BCAAs are essential amino acids found in several TASFs. Elevated levels of circulating BCAAs have been associated with health problems such as type 2 diabetes and obesity in humans (Newgard et al., 2009). The gut microbiome is involved in both BCAA degradation and BCAA biosynthesis (Gojda and Cahova, 2021). In human trials, insulin resist - ance has been found to be positively correlated with the abundance of genes encoding enzymes involved in BCAA synthesis (Pedersen et al., 2016). Microbiomes of obese individuals have higher potential to produce BCAAs, and their BCAA degradation pathways are depleted (Liu et al., 2017). Interestingly, diet influences bacterial BCAA meta- bolism. A study in humans found that vegan and vegetari- an groups had lower levels of circulating BCAAs, correlating with higher expression of genes involved in microbial BCAA degradation pathways, than an omnivorous group (Wang et al., 2019). However, in animal studies BCAA supplemen- tation has been found to affect the composition of the gut microbiome, with a potential anti-obesigenic effect (Yang et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2016). More studies are needed to characterize the interconnections between dietary BCAAs, gut microbiome and human health. TASF and inflammation Several studies in animals and in humans have shown an association between diets rich in TASF and pro-inflam- matory bacteria in the gut (David et al., 2014; Devkota et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2021; van Soest et al., 2020). In a large participant prospective study, high total protein intake, especially animal protein (fish and meat, not eggs and dairy products), was found to be associated with a signif - icantly increased risk of IBD (Bisanz et al., 2019). In mice, interactions between dietary protein of animal origin and gut microbiota increase sensitivity to intestinal inflam- mation (such as colitis) by promoting pro-inflammatory response of monocytes (Kostovcikova et al., 2019). Some studies have reported that animal fats may be associat - ed with pro-inflammatory change in the gut microbiome in animals and humans (Caesar et al., 2015; Wan et al., 2019). Conversely, in a rat model, processed meat enriched with prebiotic inulin decreased pro-inflammatory bacte - rial populations (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2019). In humans, high intake of fermented food (mix of dairy and plant products) has been shown to reduce inflammation via modulation of the gut microbiome (Wastyk et al., 2021; Marco et al., 2021). Yoghurt supplemented with Bifidobacterium pro - biotic could help maintain a normal microbiota composi- tion during the ingestion of a meat-based diet (Odamaki et al., 2016). High intake of cheese and yoghurt has been shown to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer (meta-analysis) (Barengolts et al., 2019; Gille et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019b, 2019c), which might be partially explained by a reduction in the low-grade inflammation associated with several NCDs.Section E | Emerging topics related to terrestrial animal source food 203TASF and cancer Data suggest that several substances present in red and processed meat could play a role in carcinogenesis, with some of the effects being mediated by the gut micro - biome. Heterocyclic amines (HCAs) are generated from amino acids in red meat during cooking at high tempera- tures and during preservation processes. Some HCAs can be taken up by bacteria and converted by the enzyme -glucuronidase into activated mutagenic intermediates (Zhang et al., 2019a). Red meat is rich in heme. A study in a mouse model showed that a heme-rich diet increased the abundance of mucin-degrading bacteria, leading to impaired intestinal barrier function and inducing cell hyper - proliferation (Ijssennagger et al., 2015). Data also suggest that the microbiota may play a role in the heme-induced promotion of colorectal carcinogenesis by contributing to heme-induced lipoperoxidation (Martin et al., 2015). The bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum have been strong- ly associated with colorectal cancer. Diets rich in red and processed meat have been found to be associated with F. nucleatum positive tumours but not with F. nucleatum negative tumours (Liu et al., 2018). F. nucleatum has the ability to produce hydrogen sulfide (from cysteine) (Basic et al., 2017), a substance that could induce carcinogene - sis in the colon, as it can damage the epithelium, induce chronic inflammation and influence epithelial prolifera- tion/differentiation (Abu-Ghazaleh, Chua and Gopalan, 2021). Hydrogen sulfide is involved in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, a risk factor for colorectal cancer. Bilophila wadsworthia may also produce hydrogen sulfide from taurine (Peck et al., 2019). This species has been found to be positively correlated with intake of dietary fat and meat (David et al., 2014). Diets high in certain animal proteins and fats may also promote colorectal cancer by selecting for bacteria capable of converting primary host bile acids into toxic, tumour-promoting secondary bile acids, such as deoxycholic acid (Ridlon, Wolf and Gaskins, 2016). P-cresol may also induce DNA damage and alter cell cycles (Al Hinai et al., 2019). O'Keefe et al. (2015) compared diet and faecal microbiota in African Americans, a population with a high incidence of colorectal cancer, to those in rural South Africans, a popula tion with a low incidence of colorectal cancer. Higher levels of proteolytic fermentation products were observed in the rural South Africans, but this was accompa- nied by increased carbohydrate fermentation and a lower incidence of colorectal polyps. When metabolic networks are examined, BCAA fermentation appeared to be higher in the African diet. Data suggest that high fibre intake may alter protein fermentation pathways and protect against inflammation and the disruption of cell cycles (Diether and Willing, 2019; O'Keefe et al., 2015). In human clinical trials, consumption of maize starch has also been found to prevent the promutagenic effect of red meat and to correlate with changes in the gut microbiome (Le Leu et al., 2015). Polyphenol from cranberries has been found to attenuate the impact of a TASF-based diet on microbi- ota composition, bile acids and SCFA (Rodr\u00edguez-Morat\u00f3 et al., 2018). There is also experimental evidence that Lactobacillus probiotics may directly bind to heterocyclic amines and therefore potentially protect the host from the induction of DNA damage (Vernooij et al., 2019; Zsivkovits et metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) has attract - ed attention because recent meta-analysis has shown that, in humans, higher circulating TMAO concentration aggra- vates or increases the risk of ovascular events (Farhangi, Vajdi and Asghari-Jafarabadi, 2020; Tang et al., 2021), diabetes (Zhuang et al., 2019), chronic kidney disease (Zeng et al., 2021), liver steatosis (Flores-Guerrero et al., 2021; Le\u00f3n-Mimila et al., 2021) and obesity (Dehghan et al., 2020), as well as all-cause mortality (Farhangi, 2020). TMAO production results from the fermen- tation by the gut microbiota of dietary nutrients such as choline, phosphatidylcholine and L-carnitine (mostly pres - ent in protein-rich food of animal origin), which are trans - formed into trimethylamine, which is in turn converted into TMAO by hepatic enzymes. Tang et al. (2013) found that, in humans, ingestion of phos - phatidylcholine produces a post-prandial peak in circulat - ing TMAO levels but that this did not happen if the intestinal microbiota had been depleted by broad-spectrum antibi- otics. Several bacteria and Aerobacter) can produce trimethylamine. In humans, diets that are high in animal proteins increase production of TMAO (Crimarco et al., 2020; Ijssennagger et al., 2015; Mitchell et al., 2019; Park et al., 2019). Long-term (more than one year) vegans/vegetarians have been found to have lower levels of circulating TMAO than omnivores and a markedly reduced capacity to produce TMAO from oral carnitine (contained for example in red meat) (Koeth et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018). Bacteria responsible for TMAO production are enriched in omni- vore microbiomes, and frequent exposure to L-carnitine or phosphatidylcholine induces the gut microbiota's capacity to produce TMAO (Koeth et al., 2013, 2018; Wu et al., 2019, 2020; Zhang et al., 2018). Different animal-protein sources affect plasma TMAO differently: red meat (carnitine) increases TMAO (Wang et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2020), while white meat, eggs, dairy products (Burton et al., 2020) and phosphatidylcholine (Cho et al., 2020) are not correlated with higher TMAO levels.Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 204A study of the so-called Palaeolithic diet (high meat and egg consumption but no dairy products) found that it increased TMAO levels relative to a control diet, while TMAO levels were found to be inversely associated with whole-grain intake (low in the Palaeolithic diet) (Genoni et al., 2020). Removing red meat from the diet reduces plasma TMAO within four to eight weeks (Crimarco et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019). Burton et al. (2020) report that TMAO postpran- dial response is lower after consumption of fermented dairy products than after consumption of non-ferment - ed dairy products but that daily consumption of dairy products was found to have no effect on TMAO levels. In a recent cross-sectional study in Hispanics/Latinos in the United States of America (Mei et al., 2021), TMAO was found to be associated with a higher risk of cardiovascu- lar disease. The same study found fish, red meat and egg intakes to be major dietary factors associated with serum TMAO; it also found the association between red meat and TMAO to be dependent on microbial TMA production from dietary carnitine but found the fish-TMAO association to be independent of gut microbiota. Jaworska et al. (2019) proposed that TMA (directly produced by bacterial metab - olism) might have a more negative impact on health than TMAO. Fibre intake might modulate serum TMAO, higher intake being correlated with TMAO levels (Genoni et al., 2020; Leal-Witt et al., 2018; Li et al., 2017). Studies in animal models have provided mechanistic insights into how diet-induced TMAO production by the microbiome may be involved in various health conditions (exacerbation of hepatic steatosis [Ji et al., 2020 ], ather - osclerotic [Gregory et al., 2015 ] and throm- bosis [Zhu et al., 2016 ]). More data are needed to confirm TMAO effects in humans. 4.3 Terrestrial animal source food and microbiome over the life course Most studies on the effects of TASFs on the gut microbi- ome have been done in adults, but some data suggest that impacts may vary with age. The first 1000 days of life (from conception to two years of age) are critical for child develop - ment and for the establishment of the gut microbiome. In one cohort, intake of red and processed meat during preg- nancy was found to be associated with high content of bene - ficial Bifidobacterium in the child microbiome (Lundgren et al., 2018). In another cohort, maternal intake of animal protein, but not total protein, contributed to a change in the maternal and the child gut microbiomes and correlated with child health outcomes (Garc\u00eda-Mantrana et al., 2020). Infants from mothers with higher intake of animal protein and saturated fat were found to have a higher BMI by the age of 18 months than infants from mothers with higher intakes of plant-based products (Garc\u00eda-Mantrana et al., 2020). Few studies have looked at the introduction of TASFs as complementary foods. A study of breastfed infants found that the effect on the gut microbiome of introducing meat as a complementary food differed from that of introduc - ing cereal food (Krebs et al., 2013). Another study found Enterobacteriaceae to be more abundant in infants given meat as a complementary food than in those given cere - al but that the relative abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae did not differ from that in the cereal groups (Qasem et al., 2017). In formula-fed infants, introduction of meat was found to induce more changes than dairy products (Tang et al., 2019), which was to be expected given that most formula are based on cow's milk. Two independent studies on cohorts of children from the United States of America and Europe, respectively, showed that an unbalanced TASF consumption in the first year of life was associated with asthma (Hose et al., 2021; Lee-Sarwar et al., 2019). More specifically, asthma correlat - ed positively with high daily meat consumption associated with low milk/yoghurt consumption in the Hose et al. (2021) study and with fried and processed meat in the Lee-Sarwar et al. (2019) study. In both cases, there were correlations with changes in gut microbiome composition and function. The deleterious effect of unbalanced TASF consumption was reduced by increased duration of breastfeeding but increased by prolonged formula feeding (Hose et al., 2021). In contrast to studies on early life, two studies in older adults showed that dietary interventions that increased animal-protein consumption had little impact on the microbiome or on levels of protein-fermentation products (Dahl et al., 2020; Mitchell et al., 2020). In conclusion, numerous studies - both animal models and human cohort studies and randomized controlled trials - have shown that diverse TASFs affect the gut micro - biome. Data support the view that the microbiome has a potential mediating role between TASF and human health. Red and processed meat, as well as animal fats, may damage health via the production of detrimental microbial metabolites (e.g. TMAO and hydrogen sulfide). Fermented dairy products are associated with positive changes. The impact of TASF on the gut microbiome may be modulated by the overall quality of the diet. More data on humans are needed to confirm the role of the gut microbiome in TASF- health interconnections.Section E | Emerging topics related to terrestrial animal source food 2055. Terrestrial animal source food and sustainable healthy diets Links between TASFs and planetary health constitute another critical emerging topic where evidence is accumu- lating. As noted in the introduction to this document, the topic will be addressed in Component Documents 2 and 3 of the assessment. However, some threads of research emerging under the broader category of TASF intake and sustainable healthy diets (described in the introduction to this section) are discussed here. Livestock are essential components of agroecosystems - and are contributing to the agroecological transi- tion of our food systems. Based on the ten elements of agro ecology defined by FAO (2018a) and approved by member states, livestock have been shown to contribute to agroecological transition not only by enhancing diver - sity (Dumont et al., 2013; Soussana et al., 2015), synergies (Bernu\u00e9s et al., 2011; Swagemakers et al., 2017; Martin et al., 2016) and recycling on farms (Bonaudo et al., 2014; Magne et al., 2019) but also by contributing to cultural and food traditions (Alexandre et al., 2014; Nyantakyi- Frimpong et al., 2018), to circular economy (Bona et al., 2020; Ramirez et al., 2021) and to the overall efficiency and resilience of food systems (Dumont et al., 2018; Billen et al., 2021; Morais et al., 2021). For example, they gener - ate a variety of products adapted to local cultural values and food traditions. Specific markets for such products - some of which may become more popular with consum- ers as incomes rise - provide an opportunity to add value and improve livelihoods and to conserve animal genetic resources by keeping them in profitable use. The need to achieve balance between human nutrition, food consumption and sustainability has led to discus - sion of the links between dietary patterns and planetary health (Ridoutt, Baird and Hendrie, 2017; Willett et al., 2019). It has been suggested that TASF consumption should be limited in order to reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions and other environmental impacts caused by livestock production. However, it has also been argued that to address sustainability, consider - ation should be given to regional variation in resources, background health and nutrition (Capper, 2013). Others argue that the proposed changes in diets to improve planetary health may not meet all human nutritional requirements, particularly in the case of women and children, and that some foods in the healthy reference diet of the EAT-Lancet Commission may not be avail- able or accessible in certain contexts (Adesogan et al., et al., 2020; Perignon et al., 2017). Livestock play a crucial role in enhancing the food secu- rity and nutrition of the public at large and the rural and urban poor in particular, providing access to nutri- ent-dense TASFs such as meat, milk and eggs. In addition, if managed sustainably, they can contribute to important ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling, soil carbon sequestration and the conversation of agricultural land- scapes (FAO, 2018b). Another emerging theme related to TASF and sustainable healthy diets is the important contribution that biodi- versity makes to public health and nutrition. Livestock include a diverse range of species and breeds raised in a variety of production systems (FAO, 2018b). Reduction in breed diversity has so far been greatest in HICs, where a limited number of widely used, high-output breeds have become dominant. All human health depends on ecosystem services that are made possible by biodiver - sity. Biodiversity can therefore be considered the foun- dation for human health. Biodiversity conservation, the sustainable use of biodiversity and the equitable shar - ing of benefits derived from biodiversity are thus global responsibilities at all levels and across all sectors (FAO, 2012). Efforts are underway to blend disciplines such as environmental science, agricultural science, genetics and human nutrition in the application of metrics across different sectors and the creation of novel metrics for measuring TASF impacts on the environment. For exam- ple, dietary diversity could be reframed and re-evaluated using indicators of biodiversity and metrics from the field of ecology. A study that analysed 24-hour recalls from seven LMICs to examine relationships between biodiver - sity indicators (species richness, Simpson's index of diver - sity and functional diversity) and human dietary diversity (Lachat et al., 2018) found that species richness, defined as the number of different species consumed per day, positively correlated with nutrient adequacy and dietary diversity among women and children in rural areas. FAO has published a food-composition database (INFOODS) Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes 206for biodiversity that reports the value of nutrients and bioactive components for foods with information avail- able below the species level, including genus, species, subspecies and variety/cultivar/breed (Charrondiere et al., 2017). Efforts are underway to develop metrics that account for nutrient density when measuring the impacts of TASFs and other foods, and this may present a different picture with respect to dietary recommendations for planetary health. Evidence for TASF in sustainable food systems in LMICs is also emerging and allowing a fuller analysis that will help provide a basis for meeting nutritional needs while safe - guarding human health, livestock biodiversity and the environment.Section E | Emerging topics related to terrestrial animal source food 207 References Abu-Ghazaleh, N., Chua, W.J. & Gopalan, V. 2021.

(adapted from FAO and WHO, 2022) Meta-analysisStatistical analysis of combined data from a number of independent studies of the same subject in order to determine overall trends. (EXS290 Research Guide, 2022) MetaboliteMolecule used or produced during metabolism: for example, glycine and L-arginine are precursor amino acids of the biosynthesis of creatine, which is the final metabolite. MicrobiomeCommunity of microorganisms (such as fungi, bacteria and viruses) that exists in a particular environment. In humans, the term is often used to describe the microorganisms that live in or on a particular part of the body, such as the skin or gastrointestinal tract. (NIH, 2022) Micronutrient deficiencyLack of essential vitamins and/or minerals that the human body requires in small amounts; also called hidden hunger. Monogastric Animal with a one-compartmented stomach (e.g. avian species, pig, rabbit, horse). MorbiditySymptom arising from a disease or condition and usually presented as a prevalence calculated by dividing the number of affected individuals by the total number of individuals within a specific population. (Hernandez and Kim, 2021) MortalityDeaths caused by a disease, injury or disability: may be communicated as an absolute number or as a rate calculated by dividing the number of deaths in a given time in a given population by the total population. (Hernandez and Kim, 2021) Non-communicable diseaseIllness that is the result of a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors; also known as chronic disease: examples include cardiovascular diseases (e.g. heart attacks and strokes), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (e.g. obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma) and diabetes. (WHO, 2021) Non-significantA result from a statistical test that does not allow the conclusion to be drawn that the differences in the data are valid and consistent. Non-significant results do not necessarily imply that there is no association between the exposure and the outcome. Any observed differences in results may be attributable to chance alone or to random factors. For example, when studying a factor in relation to human nutrition, non-significance could indicate that there is no association in the sample population, but it could also indicate that the study size is too small to identify an association that does exist in the sample population. NutrientSubstance that is required by the body for optimal growth, development and maintenance of good health. Nutrient density Amount of nutrients per calorie, food volume or serving size. Nutrient requirementsRecommendations to consumers on nutrient intakes, amount of nutrients needed to maintain health in an otherwise healthy individual or group of people; nutrient requirements are periodically updated based on new evidence. Nutrient, essentialNutrient that cannot be produced by the body in sufficient quantities to meet physiological requirements and must therefore be supplied from foods or other sources (e.g. supplements). Nutrient, macronutrientEnergy-containing nutrient needed in substantial quantities, typically above 10 g per day (e.g. carbohydrates, proteins and fats). Nutrient, micronutrient Nutrient required in small amounts, usually below 2 g per day (e.g. vitamins and minerals). Nutrient, non-essentialNutrient that can be synthesized by the body under normal conditions and is thus not required in the diet. OffalOrgan meat and blood from mammalian and avian species, e.g. liver, kidney, heart, lungs and intestines. (adapted from FAO and WHO, 2022)225 Glossary225OmicsScientific discipline or field of research that analyses complete genetic or molecular profiles in humans and other organisms. One HealthIntegrated, unifying approach that aims to sustainably balance and optimize the health of people, animals and ecosystems. It recognizes the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants, and the wider environment (including ecosystems) are closely linked and inter-dependent. (One Health High-Level Expert Panel (OHHLEP) et al., 2022) Overweight and obesityBody weight that is above normal for height as a result of an excessive accumulation of fat. It is usually a manifestation of expending less energy than is consumed. In adults, overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or more, and obesity as a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more. In children under five years of age, overweight is defined as weight-for-height greater than 2 standard deviations above the WHO Child Growth Standards median, and obesity as weight-for-height greater than 3 standard deviations above the WHO Child Growth Standards median. (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO 2022) PCR (polymerase chain reaction) methodMethod used to amplify specific segments of DNA into numerous copies; one of its applications is to identify infectious agents. Plant source food Food derived from plants (e.g. vegetables, fruits, legumes, seeds, nuts). Protein qualityProtein quality relates to the ability of a protein source to support healthy growth, development and maintenance of body mass. To be considered a \"high-quality\" or \"complete\" protein, a protein must contain all the essential amino acids (building blocks of proteins) in the right proportion and be easily digested. The Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) measures and compares the protein quality of various food sources. Those with a score of 1.0 are considered \"high-quality\" or \"complete\" proteins. (Nutrition & Biosciences, 2022) Public healthScience that promotes and protects the health of people and communities, generally by applying a population-based approach to disease prevention: subfields include epidemiology, biostatistics, health policy, global health and environmental health. ResiduesIn the context of food safety, residues are traces of substances such as pesticides or veterinary drugs in food, agricultural commodities or animal feed. Review, narrativeAnalysis that describes the evidence on a topic but is not systematic and does not follow a specific method. Review, systematicAnalysis focusing on a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and reproducible methods to identify, select and critically appraise all relevant research. (adapted from BMC, 2022) RiskA measure of the probability and severity of adverse effects; human health risk is the probability that a given exposure or series of exposures will damage the wellbeing of individuals. Risk analysisProcess consisting of three components: risk assessment, risk management and risk communication. (FAO and WHO, 2014) Risk assessmentHuman health risk assessment is a process intended to estimate the risk to a given person, system or (sub)population, including the identification of attendant uncertainties, following exposure to a particular agent, taking into account the inherent characteristics of the agent of concern as well as the characteristics of the specific target system. RuminantHoofed herbivorous grazing or browsing mammal that is able to acquire nutrients from plant- based food by fermenting it in a specialized stomach principally through microbial action (e.g. cattle, buffalo, goat, sheep). Shelf-lifeTime, under defined storage conditions, during which food remains safe, retains desired sensory, chemical, physical and biological characteristics and complies with any label declaration. (Decker, 2010) Small-for-gestational ageTerm used to describe a newborn with weight below the tenth percentile in comparison with average infant population of the same sex and gestational age. (adapted from WHO, 1995) Study, case controlObservational study that compares people with an existing health issue to people without the issue.226 Contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes226Study, cohortObservational study where a group of individuals with shared characteristics (cohort) exposed to an intervention and a group who are not exposed to the intervention are followed over time (often years) to determine the occurrence of disease. The incidence of disease in the exposed group is compared with the incidence of disease in the unexposed group. Study, cross-sectionalObservational study that analyses numerous characteristics and variables at once (at a single point in time). Study, observationalStudy of the effects of an intervention on people who were already exposed to the intervention before the study. StuntingLow height-for-age, reflecting a past episode or episodes of sustained undernutrition. In children under five years of age, stunting is defined as height-for-age more than 2 standard deviations below the WHO Child Growth Standards median. (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO 2022) SurveillanceSystematic ongoing collection, collation and analysis of data and the timely dissemination of information to those who need to know so that action can be taken.

(c) It is recommended that iron supplements in tablet form be given to all pregnant women because of the difficulties in correctly assessing iron status in pregnancy. In non-anaemic pregnant women, daily supplements of 100mg of iron (e.g. as ferrous sulphate) given during the second half of pregnancy are adequate. In anaemic women higher doses are usually required.

Examples of micronutrient related recommendations from food-based dietary guidelines Country Document title and web link Recommendation Afghanistan National food-based dietary guidelines for Afghans - a manualAnimal source foods are a good source of iron, zinc, calcium, B vitamins and protein. Australia The Australian guide to healthy eating During pregnancy, three to four servings a day of animal source foods are recommended to provide additional iron and zinc. Kenya National guidelines for healthy diets and physical activity Meat is a more complete source of micronutrients than plants for vitamin A, iron, zinc and vitamins B1, B2, B12. Lesotho Lesotho Food and Nutrition Policy The high prevalence of anaemia among under-five children in Lesotho is related to low intake of iron-rich foods (like meat, fish, dried beans and green leafy vegetables) combined with lower intakes of dietary enhancers of iron absorption (like Vitamin C) and higher intakes of iron absorption inhibitors (like cereal bran and grain in general). New Zealand Eating and activity guidelines for New Zealand adults Red meat is an excellent source of key nutrients like iron (in an easily absorbed form) as well as zinc. Low iron levels are a problem for some New Zealanders, particularly young women. Nigeria Food-based dietary guidelines for Nigeria - a guide to healthy eatingFoods such as liver, milk, butter and local cheese (wara) have good amounts of vitamin A.

Examples of sustainability related recommendations from Food-based Dietary Guidelines Country Document title and web link Recommendation Canada Canada's food guide There is evidence supporting a lesser environmental impact of patterns of eating higher in plant-based foods and lower in animal-based foods. Potential benefits include helping to conserve soil, water and air Canada Healthy eating and the environmentAn eating pattern that is higher in plant-based foods and lower in animal-based foods can decrease the negative impact of food on the environment Denmark The official dietary guidelines - good for health and climate To reduce the effect on the environment, eat a more plant-based diet and less meat. Italy Dietary guidelines for healthy eating - revision 2018 Select poultry or legumes over red meat to reduce environmental impact. Netherlands Food based dietary guidelines for the Netherlands To limit environmental impact, reduce consumption of meat to a maximum of 500 grams per week; consume 2-3 portions of dairy products per day, more is not necessary and eat fish (only) once a week. Norway National action plan for better diet (2017-2021) It is pointed out in the Public Health Report that a plant-based diet as well as increased intake of fish and less meat will help to reach both health policy and climate policy goals. South Africa Food-based dietary guidelines for South Africa The delicate balance between adequate, over- and underconsumption of animal sources of food remains a very complicated aspect of ensuring healthy and nutritionally adequate, yet environmentally sustainable, diets. Sweden Find your way to eat greener, not too much and be active! Limit consumption of dairy, as cattle used to produce these products have an environmental impact. Uruguay Dietary guidelines for the Uruguayan population: for a healthy, shared and enjoyable diet Combining foods of plant origin with foods of animal origin contributes to a balanced diet.

Preferences and socio-economic and cultural factors, which vary across agrifood systems and population subgroups, can shape demand for, and consumption of, terrestrial animal source food. Livestock species - mammals, birds and insects - are adapted to a wide range of environments, including areas that are unsuitable for crop production. Globally, more than a billion people depend on livestock value chains for their livelihoods. Small-scale livestock farmers and pastoralists make up a large proportion of livestock producers. Well- integrated livestock production increases the resilience of small-scale farming systems and thus enables poor farmers, in particular, to better cope with disruptions. Livestock also provide other important ecosystem services in landscape management, provide energy and help to improve soil fertility. Rangeland or grassland ecosystems occupy some 40 percent of the world's terrestrial area. Livestock keepers raise grazing animals to transform grassland vegetation into food. Challenges related to high resource utilization and pollution, food-feed competition, greenhouse-gas emissions, antimicrobial resistance and animal welfare as well as zoonotic and food-borne diseases, accessibility and affordability need to be solved if agrifood systems are to become more sustainable. FAO's Committee on Agriculture requested a comprehensive, science- and evidence-based global assessment of the contribution of livestock to food security, sustainable food systems, nutrition and healthy diets, considering environmental, economic and social sustainability. The assessment consists of four component documents. This first component document provides a holistic analysis of the contribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrition and health outcomes over the course of people's lives.
