What is Berberine? Users claim that berberine, derived from various plants such as barberry plants, suppresses appetite and improves blood sugar levels, leading to weight loss. Google searches for \"berberine\" have seen a surge since late May, reflecting the growing interest in this supplement. [Ozempic and Wegovy](/topic/ozempic-and-wegovy)continues to rise, berberine is emerging as an alternative option. Ozempic and Wegovy belong to a class of drugs called GLP-1 agonists, which mimic a hormone that reduces food intake and curbs appetite. While these drugs are highly effective, they face scarcity in the United States and come with a hefty price tag of around $1,000 or more, requiring a prescription from a doctor. Is Berberine easily available? In contrast, berberine appears to be easily accessible online and typically costs between $15 and $40 for a month's supply. According to a report by NBC, Dr. Pieter Cohen, a supplement use researcher at the Cambridge Health Alliance in Somerville, Massachusetts, noted the appeal of berberine from an advertising perspective, stating, \"You don't have to deal with a doctor, and it's going to be a lot less expensive.\" Does Berberine aid in weight loss? However, the effectiveness and safety of berberine for weight loss remain uncertain. Large-scale, peer-reviewed studies verifying the claims associated with berberine are lacking, with much of the research conducted on mice rather than humans, according to experts. A meta-analysis of 49 studies published last year in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition indicated that berberine may offer metabolic benefits, particularly for the heart, but the evidence for significant weight loss effects was limited. Dr. Fatima Cody [Stanford](/topic/stanford), an obesity medicine specialist and equity director of the endocrine division at Massachusetts General Hospital, emphasized that berberine's weight loss impact is not as remarkable as that of semaglutide, the drug found in Ozempic. Stanford, who was not involved in the research, explained that the studies suggest berberine leads to weight loss ranging from a quarter to one BMI point, far from the average outcomes of semaglutide. For individuals participating in those studies, the optimal daily dose appeared to be 1 gram, Stanford added. However, Dr. Cohen urged caution when considering berberine for weight loss. Dietary supplements are not subject to review or approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), allowing them to make a wide range of health claims, often with inaccurate ingredient amounts or undisclosed components. Cohen warned against taking an active pharmaceutical drug like berberine without proper guidance. Dr. Holly Lofton, the director of the weight management program at [NYU Langone Health](/topic/nyu-langone-health), dismissed comparisons between berberine and metformin, a medication used to lower blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Lofton stated that she does not recommend berberine for weight loss and highlighted the lack of knowledge regarding how the supplement aids in weight reduction, if at all. Side effects of Berberine Regarding safety, Cohen noted that medications derived from plants are not uncommon, citing aspirin and morphine as examples. However, known side effects of berberine in humans include nausea, vomiting, and potential liver and kidney enlargement, as observed in animal studies. To determine any serious side effects in humans, further extensive research is necessary. Stanford advised consulting a doctor before incorporating berberine into a weight loss regimen, cautioning that it may not be safe for pregnant women. Given the absence of FDA approval or regulation, she recommended seeking guidance from a knowledgeable medical professional or naturopathic physician. In the event of any adverse effects, Stanford advised discontinuing the use of berberine. Cohen emphasized that despite its potential weight loss benefits, the risks associated with berberine outweigh the potential rewards. If individuals experience weight loss while using berberine, he urged them to cease usage immediately and consult a healthcare professional as it could indicate a more dangerous issue with the product.
