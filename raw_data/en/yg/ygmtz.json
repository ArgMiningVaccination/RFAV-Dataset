Patient Perspective August is National Immunization Awareness Month National Immunization Awareness Month is held in August each year to raise awareness of the importance of immunizations to prevent diseases. Parents rely on their clinician to give them information about the vaccinations their child needs. Studies show: A strong recommendation from a clinician is the single most important factor in determining whether or not someone gets vaccinated. People want clear and consistent information about vaccines. Reminder Fast Facts July 2019 Page 10 With immunizations in the news and social media recently, it is essential to communicate clearly about th e importance of immunizations. Doctors, nurses, physician assistants and office staff all play a role in your clinic's communication about vaccinations. Among other resources, the CDC1 has a tip sheet \u2014Talking with Parents about Vaccines for Infants2. BOOST YOUR ADOLESCENT IMMUNIZATION RATES Data3 from the Minnesota Department of Health indicates that only about 47 percent of adolescents age 13 -17 are up to date on the HPV series, compared to 87 percent who have received the Tdap and meningococcal vaccines. We know the HPV imm unization works to prevent the vast majority of cancers caused by the HPV virus, so missing these immunizations means missing an opportunity to prevent future cancers. HealthPartners conducted a survey of members who are parents of children ages 7 -17 to u nderstand their familiarity with the HPV vaccine and identify barriers that may keep them from getting the vaccine. Here is some of what we learned: Parents say their child's doctor is the most influential in their decision to get their child immunized. This echoes what researchers have found in other studies of vaccine hesitancy. Parents look to their doctor as the expert, but it can be difficult to have a conversation when parents challenge their doctor's advice. The Minnesota Department of Health4 has videos demonstrating low -stress ways of recommending the HPV vaccination and answering questions. Parents are only somewhat familiar wi th the HPV vaccination. More education is needed. HealthPartners uses social media and articles5 to educate parents. Feel free to share our so cial media posts whenever you see information that is relevant to your patients. Parents have concerns about the safety of the HPV vaccination . More than 100 million doses of the HPV vaccine have been distributed since the vaccine was licensed , and data continue to show that it is safe and effective6. Parents are unsure if the vaccine is covered by their health insurance. Like all preventive vaccines recommended by the USPSTF, the HPV vaccine is covered 100 percent by insurance. There are many resources available to support your clinic's work to im prove adolescent immunizations, including from the CDC7, the Minnesota Department of Health8 and the HPV Roundtable9, including this action guide10 for large hea lth systems.
