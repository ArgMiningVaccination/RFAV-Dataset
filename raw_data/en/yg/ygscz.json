Your vet needs proof that your pet's at least 12 weeks old before vaccinating them. You must [get your pet microchipped](/bring-pet-to-uk/microchip) before, or at the same time as, their rabies vaccination. If you do not, they'll need to be vaccinated again. Getting the rabies vaccination Your pet must have had their first rabies vaccinations (the 'primary course'). This can be given in more than one dose. Your pet may need to restart the primary course if they do not have all doses or a booster at the right time. Your vet can tell you if your pet's rabies vaccinations are up to date. The vaccine must be an inactivated vaccine or recombinant vaccine that's approved in the country of use. If your pet has had the Canvac R vaccination If your dog, cat or ferret has had the Canvac R vaccination, they must have had the right number of doses of the primary course. They'll need: - 1 dose if they were vaccinated over the age of 5 months - 2 doses if they were vaccinated under the age of 5 months - the doses must have been 2 to 4 weeks apart All pets with the Canvac R vaccination must be at least 17 weeks old before they travel. If your dog has had the Canvac DHPPiL+ R vaccination If your dog has the Canvac DHPPiL + R vaccine, both of the following must apply: - your dog has had 3 doses of the primary course of the vaccine - each vaccine dose was 3 weeks apart Your dog must also be at least 21 weeks old before they travel. Travelling from a 'Part 1' or 'Part 2' listed country You must wait 21 days after the primary vaccination (or the last of the primary course of vaccinations) before bringing your pet to Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) from a [Part 1 or Part 2 listed country](/bring-pet-to-uk/listed-and-unlisted-countries). Travelling from a country that is not 'listed' You must follow certain rules after having your pet vaccinated if you're travelling to Great Britain from a country that is not a [Part 1 or Part 2 listed country](/bring-pet-to-uk/listed-and-unlisted-countries): - Your pet must have a blood sample taken at least 30 days after the rabies vaccination. - Your vet must send the blood sample to an EU-approved blood testing laboratory from either [inside the EU](https://food.ec.europa.eu/animals/movement-pets/approved-rabies-serology-laboratories/approved-rabies-serology-laboratories-eu-countries_en)or [outside the EU](https://food.ec.europa.eu/animals/movement-pets/approved-rabies-serology-laboratories/non-eu-countries_en). - The results of the blood test must show that the vaccination was successful (rabies antibody level of at least 0.5 IU/ml). - You must wait 3 months from the date the blood sample was taken before you travel - you do not need to wait if your pet was vaccinated, blood tested and given a [pet passport or health certificate](/bring-pet-to-uk/pet-passport)in the EU before travelling to a country that is not listed. - The vet must give you a copy of the test results and enter the day the blood sample was taken in a [pet passport or health certificate](/bring-pet-to-uk/pet-passport). The blood test will continue to be valid as long as your pet's rabies vaccinations are kept up to date. Booster vaccinations You must get regular booster vaccinations for your pet. Check your [pet passport or health certificate](/bring-pet-to-uk/pet-passport) to find out when the booster vaccination is due. Get an [Animal Health Certificate](/taking-your-pet-abroad/getting-an-animal-health-certificate) if your pet needs a booster vaccination while you're in Great Britain. If you miss the booster and you're travelling from a country that is not listed, your pet will need to be vaccinated and blood tested again and you'll have to wait for 3 months before travelling. Vaccination record Your pet's vaccination record in their pet passport or health certificate must show: - your pet's date of birth - microchip number, date it was put in or read, and where it is on your pet's body - vaccination date - vaccine manufacturer and product name, for example Nobivac - vaccine batch number - date the vaccination is valid until - the vet's signature and contact details Your pet can be stopped from travelling if the details in their pet passport are in the wrong place. Pet passports issued from 29 December 2014 The vet only needs to fill in the 'valid from' date for the first vaccination (or revaccination if you missed a booster). If the rabies vaccination record is a sticker, it must be covered by a laminated strip (included with the pet passport). "}
