It arises in man as a need of the heart, of the life of feeling; and it can be justified only inasmuch as it can satisfy this inner need. He alone can acknowledge anthroposophy, who finds in it what he himself in his own inner life feels impelled to seek. Hence only they can be anthroposophists who feel certain questions on the nature of man and the universe as an elemental need of life, just as one feels hunger and thirst.\" -Rudolf Steiner, Anthroposophical Leading Thoughts (1924) Benjamin is a certified medical assistant and licensed massage therapist specializing in Advanced CranioSacral Therapy (CST). Gentle and non-invasive, CST is focused on supporting the body in its capacity for self-correction and balance. CranioSacral Therapy helps release abnormal tension in the connective tissues around the brain and spinal cord (the CranioSacral System) and in it's relationships with the rest of the body. Benjamin's goal the first time he sees a client is the same as it is in every session. That is; To assess if CST is needed and then to provide the best care that he can. During the initial session, building trust is important and he usually spends some time explaining the scientific basis of CST. The conversation about what happened during a session and what possible results can be expected usually concludes the session. For thirty-seven years Benjamin has been studying and practicing CranioSacral Therapy, and learning every day from the unique conditions that different individuals present. Having had the pleasure of practicing with Dr. Lisa Del Alba, an Anthroposophical Naturopath (ND) for the last nine years. Benjamin states: \"Working on a regular basis with Dr. Lisa's patients has helped mature my palpation skills. Palpating the tissue changes that I feel are the objective result of Anthroposophical Medicine, has provided a window of perception that helps me distinguish more clearly between different types of restrictions and imbalances. I have found that clients who are also receiving Naturopathic care typically need fewer sessions and to me, their nervous systems feel more flexible. I feel that this knowledge of the benefits of Dr. Lisa's care has given me the ability to know with greater clarity, what conditions (individuals) should be addressed with CST, and which should be referred to another kind of medical practitioner for organ support and diagnosis. Personally, through the combination of receiving Dr. Lisa's care and the study of Anthroposophy*, my palpation has changed and become more refined. The study of Anthroposophy every day continues to support me in the practice of CST imbued to the best of my ability with Anthroposophical concepts and a renewed relationship with my clients based on this foundation. This increased clinical experience and refined palpation have deepened my interest in Human beings and how we heal. I am currently Dr. Lisa's Medical Assistant in our clinic, and I am still learning every day\". Benjamin received specialized training for Infant CST in 1988, and in 1996 Svea J. Gold, MLS (Neuro-Developmentalist author of \"If Kids Just Came With Instruction Sheets\") started referring young children with developmental challenges for CST. Since these two biographical parts his practice has been largely focused on working with infants, and developmental challenges within the pediatric population, in addition to central nervous system challenges in the general population. Benjamin states: \"Over the last 36 years, I have found it very fruitful working in partnership with a great variety of other professions, including; Pediatricians, ENT specialists, Dentists, Lactation Consultants, Midwives, Chiropractors, Optometrists, Physical and Occupational Therapists, Psychiatrists and Councilors, Neurologists, and Physiatrists.\" He has worked successfully with many conditions, including Migraine Headaches, Facial Asymmetry, Plagiocephaly, ADD and ADHD, Autism Spectrum, Developmental Challenges, Postnatal Care, Nursing Challenges, Reflux, Colic, Sleep Issues, Ear Infections, Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction (TMD), Motor-Coordination Impairments, Spinal Cord Injuries, Concussions, and Traumatic Brain Injuries, Chronic Neck, and Back Pain, Body Alignment, Depression / Anxiety, Emotional Difficulties, Post-Surgical Dysfunctions.
