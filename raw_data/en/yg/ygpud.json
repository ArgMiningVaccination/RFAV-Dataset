Healthy and well -kept hair helps us look beautiful and leaves a good impression on others. Well -groomed hair is an indicator of one's overall personality. It is a sign of confidence and allows others to view you in positive light and helps boost one's self esteem and body image. The importance of healthy hair cannot be overstated. Poorly managed hair can result in split ends, frizzy, dry, dandruff, lice infestation and other issues which are not only physically unhealthy but also detrimental to one's appearance and self - confidence. The condition of your hair can be one of the most important signs of general well - being. Strong and healthy hair signifies that your body is producing enough vitamins and nutrients which ensure the body is functioning well physiologically. Unhealthy, dry and frizzy hair may be a sign that you may need to change your diet or hair care routine in order to optimize your hairs' strength, texture and shine. It is extremely important to strengthen hair from the roots which can be done if you take diligent care by regular oiling, shampooing and conditioning. Hair care routine helps get a shiny and silky hair texture externally and makes it healthy from the roots too. Through this graphic novel, the importance of healthy hair and its significant role in improving one's holistic personality and beauty has been highlighted. The various problems related to hair health and the remedies to combat these issues have been addressed too. Few home remedies and important hair mask recipes are also included. Well -groomed hair is critical to both physical and mental well-being and should be taken seriously. With maintenance and care, proper lifestyle and revisiting our age- old Ayurveda system, it is possible to have healthy, beautiful hair at all times. Furthermore, your self -esteem will significantly improve which will empower you to live a fulfilling life.

She sensitizes her friends about hair hygiene & scalp care. She listens to the advice given by her mother & shares it with her friends. Zaira: Beena's close friend who is very fond of outdoor activities & sports. She is conscious of her dry & brittle hair. Pranav: Beena's classmate who suffers from dry scalp that results in dandruff which embarrasses him. Beena helps him identify the cause & together they seek help from the School Counselor, Ms. Nupur 7 It is a pleasant sunny afternoon. Mrs. Vandana is applying oil to her younger daughter, Beena's long silky hair. It was a part of the mother -daughter's Sunday morning grooming ritual. While rubbing oil on her scalp, she recalls how hesitant Beena was to apply oil on her hair during her childhood. She would complain and say in a fretful tone, \"Mother, this oil is sticky and smelly.\" Her mother had introduced her to the age-old Indian tradition of hair oiling which involved massaging the scalp with nourishing herbal oils like coconut, mustard and amla that stimulates hair follicles on the scalp. She had told her daughters that hair care is an essential component of overall health and hygiene. No wonder today, Beena's hair is thick and healthy. 8 While standing in front of the mirror, Beena admires her long and silky hair. She braids them every morning to school. But, she often wonders why her classmates have different hair types. She recalls that her best friend, Zaira has dry, brittle and frizzy hair. Beena has a conversation with her mother on different hair types, reasons for hair problems, hair texture, scalp hygiene and the do's and don'ts for proper hair care. She asks her mother, \"Why do some people have different hair types?\" Her mother replies patiently, \"People have different hair types because of various reasons... 9 \"People have different hair types\". diet, heredity, physical health, environmental conditions, haircare. Essentially, there are three types of hair - oily, dry and normal. This is based on hair texture. Oily hair becomes greasy very fast even after frequent washing. The sebaceous glands in the scalp produces too much sebum resulting in the hair looking greasy.\" Quipped Beena, \"My good friend, Zaira is also unhappy with her hair texture, it is unmanageable and dry. Mother, do you have any advi ce for her?\" Replies Mrs. Vandana, \"Zaira's hair comes in the dry category. She should not wash her hair frequently or expose them to direct sunlight. She should also avoid artificial treatments and strong chemical -based shampoos.\" 10 Mrs. Vandana also advised that Zaira should not share her comb and towel with other family members. She should avoid blow drying, electric rollers and curling irons also. She can use a moisturizing shampoo for extreme dryness. Massaging the scalp with warm hair oil before shampoo will help her overcome this problem. \"Yes mother, she sweats a lot in the sports classes. You know, she is the captain of the school football team. She washes her hair frequently because she has practice sessions every day. She also uses the blow dryer. I will tell her that her hair too can be soft and healthy if she avoids using shampoos, conditioners and other hair products that have strong chemicals\", added Beena. Beena had a lot of questions in her mind. She asked her mother what her hair type was. I enjoy the sports classes at school with my friends...IT'S SO MUCH FUN!!! 11 Mrs. Vandana replied, \"You have normal hair, dear. This is because your diet is healthy which includes a lot of protein, eggs, fruits and green leafy vegetables. Now you know why I insist that both you and your elder sister, Babita, should eat home cooked food which is well balanced and nutritious. Every Sunday, I make it a point to oil your hair just like Granny used to oil my hair when I was a young girl. The hot oil massage stimulates blood supply to the roots of the hair. Drinking lots of water is another way of not only keeping your hair moisturised, but also your body hydrated.\" 12 The next day, Beena goes to school. She sees Pranav dusting his school blazer. He had a sad look on his face. Beena goes upto him and asks him, \"What's wrong Pranav? Why are you dusting your coat? We have to go to the assembly.\" Pranav confides in her and tells Beena that he is taunted by his classmates because small white dry flakes from his scalp fall on his blue blazer, which makes him feel embarrassed. Beena understands his concern and tells him that these dry flak es are dandruff which can be easily cured. She suggests Pranav to meet the School Counselor, Ms Nupur, during recess, as they believe she is very empathetic and will be able to provide some solution to his problem. 13 The reasons could be many - improper diet, infection, poor blood circulation or lack of hair hygiene. I will make a diet chart for you to follow. Ask your mother to buy an anti -dandruff shampoo and regularly oil your scalp so that the hair follicles get stimulated. Wash your comb, towel, brush weekly with warm soap water. Both go to meet Ms. Nupur. Pranav shares his concern with her. She li stens to him patiently and tells him, \"Dear Pranav, don't be conscious or embarrassed. There is a solution for every problem. Dandruff is a very common scalp disorder, and it can be seen in both dry and oily hair. Beena, I am so glad that you understood Pranav's concern and brought him to me. Friends are there to help each other. There may be many students in your class who might have similar problems. In the next Personal Grooming class, I will 14 HAIR CONCERNS AND SCALP HYGIENE discuss this topic in detail - Hair Concerns and Scalp Hygiene .\" \"Thank you Ma'am! Some of my friends also have lice. Will you share some tips on how we can get rid of them too?\" Beena asked. Ms. Nupur agreed. The next day, Ms. Nupur takes a session on Personal Grooming and provides the Do's & Don'ts for healthy hair and scalp. She discusses all the hair problems and scalp disorders in detail. 15 Pranav later goes to Mr. Bhushan, the sports instructor. He respects him because other than training them for football, he gives them grooming tips for a fit mind and body. Mr. Bhushan tells them that fitness and wellness is reflected not only by body grooming and physique but also by proper hair care which includes regular haircuts, oiling, shampooing, conditioning and dandruff treatment. After all, hair is one's crowning glory and adds to overall personality and confidence. Healthy hair is a noticeable part of beauty and a beautiful person is one who is healthy outside and from within. 16 In the afternoon, when Beena goes home, she shared all that had happened at school with her loving Granny who was her best friend. Granny replied, \"Dear grandchild, your generation wants quick remedies for problems. You must understand that every cure takes time and patience. I have some advice for you. Our traditional Ayurvedic system believes in head massage which not only nourishes but also relieves tensions and migraines. It relaxes the body, prevents hair loss and improves blood circulation. 17 My kitchen can give you remedies... tell your friend, Pranav to make a hair mask of Aloe Vera and honey or curd, apply it twice a month and his dandruff will vanish. Zaira's dry hair can be silky once again if she applies a mixture of banana and coconut oil. Banana is a common fruit which is readily available in the market throughout the year. She can blend one ripe banana, 4 teaspoons coconut oil, 1 teaspoon glycerin and 2 teaspoons honey. This paste can be applied to her hair. She should cover the scalp with a shower cap and wash it off after 30 minutes. 18 Your mother always complained of hair fall. I made an onion juice mask for her. I grated an onion, strained it using a sieve and applied it on her scalp with a cotton ball. She applied this mask regularly for 2 months and there was considerable reduction in hair fall.\" Beena was excited and amazed. \"Granny! You have solutions to so many of our problems. No wonder I tell my classmates that you are my best friend. Thank you! I now realize the importance of mindful eating, healthy lifestyle and the five -thousand -year-old science of Ayurveda\". 19 20 Dandruff Aloe Vera & Honey mask resh aloevera gel cup honey tsp apple cider vinegar tsp Apply generously to hair and scalp, shampoo after resting for minutes Itchy Dandruff oconut oil& emon mask oconut oil tbsp thenshampoo Head &Tulsi and leaves coconut tbsp toform a paste,add toit coconut oil,apply on thescalp. eave this mask overnight and wash with herbal shampoo next morning .
