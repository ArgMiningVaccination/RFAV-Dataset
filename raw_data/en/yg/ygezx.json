When Hollywood needed a setting for Shangri-La, mythical paradise of eternal youth, it found what it was looking for in the Ojai Valley: jagged mountain peaks that could serve as a backdrop for a procession of Tibetan monks; grassy meadows where lovers might romp; orange groves, flowering shrubs, and ribbons of water flowing into worn stone basins. ''Lost Horizon,'' directed by Frank Capra, was filmed in the 30's, but those in the know had been rejuvenating themselves at Ojai for decades before that. Wheeler Hot Springs, a thermal spa in the hills above Ojai (now, alas, closed and in bankruptcy), started as a resort in the 1870's and reached a peak in the giddy days of Prohibition and bootleg barons. The Oaks at Ojai, a rambling, vaguely Spanish-style structure within the town proper, is by comparison a relative newcomer, having drawn guests seeking a Spartan regime in comfortable surroundings since 1977. The catch to Shangri-La was that you kept your youth only as long as you stayed there. Today's spas, however, project more lasting benefits, benefits that will presumably help clients stay serene and confident back in the city of angels and permanently chiseled chin lines. I went to Ojai wondering if there was life in spa-land for a person who doesn't want to lose weight, whose idea of fitness training is walking up and down escalator steps, but who would like to feel more relaxed and at the same time more energized. A few years back, my California daughter had given me as a birthday treat a massage and tub soak at Wheeler Hot Springs, about six miles north of Ojai. Two months after the birth of her first child, it was my turn to give her what I remembered as a marvelously restorative gift. Unknown to us at the time, it was also, because of Wheeler's impending financial problems, a valedictory gift. On that last visit, a few months before it closed, this oasis of palms, cedars and citrus trees, with its pungent hot waters and fragrant redwood tubs, soothed and prepared me for the highly charged atmosphere and rigorous challenges of the fitness program at the long-established (1977) Oaks, where schedules are maintained and performance counts. A low-slung building of warm ocher with a tile-roofed entrance portico, the Oaks occupies about a block of the town's main street, Ojai Avenue, and is near Libbey Park, shops and other local attractions. Off the large lobby and reception area are corridors (virtually noiseless with their green figured carpets) that lead to guest quarters and to rooms used for exercise, massage, lectures, films and just plain relaxation. There is a dining room off the lobby, plus -- behind the hotel -- tables and chairs set up in nicely planted spaces around the pool. The general atmosphere is that of a medium-sized, well-frequented resort hotel. CHECKING in at the Oaks, I was given an information packet that contained a directory of activities and services; an explanation of the Oaks food plan; descriptions of massage, scrub, body wrap, facial and other treatments supplementary to the standard program included in my $238 room charge. I also received a questionnaire to determine if I was a candidate for eating-and-fitness counseling (''Do you eat when you are not hungry? Do you eat when you are feeling sad, angry, fearful, anxious, and even happy?''); a list of beauty salon services; advice on individual fitness consultations and bio-impedance body composition analyses; plus a listing of available golf, tennis and bicycle-riding facilities. Virtually all these activities had at least some appeal. How to resist a Spa Salt Glo treatment that ''smooths skin to a silky finish by combining the healing attributes of essential oils'' with the ''exfoliating skin softening and detoxifying benefits of the mineral salts, colloidal oatmeal, green papaya, sea willow and borage powder''? The cool drenching of orange mist and body lotion plus the spiritual renewal said to follow this treatment sounded good, too. But since I was there for only two days I decided, finally, to fit an aromatherapy massage into the slot where a Spa Salt Glo might have gone, and muscle relaxation would have to double for spiritual renewal. Guests at the Oaks are advised to include one activity from the three categories of stretch, aerobic and resistance every day, at the level suited to their individual fitness level. Classes were scheduled from 6 A.M. until the 6 P.M. dinner hour, and dinner was followed by evening entertainment. It hardly surprised me to find a weekly appointment sheet tucked into my information kit. Entertainment on the evening of my arrival turned out to be Restorative Yoga. After a saltless, pepperless and, to me, tasteless meal of whitefish, baked yam, grilled tomato and a raw salad dressed with what looked like but didn't taste like yogurt, I was ready for some restoration. In a room called the Coral Spa I found 20 or so women (I saw few men at the Oaks and none taking classes) lying on the floor with their towels folded into pillows. As part of the restorative yoga routine we took positions intended to cleanse our internal organs: lying down with legs up against the wall for squeezing them and a knees-bent, pillow-under-the-pelvis position for soaking them -- in our own body fluids, I assume. In the background there was soothing music, broken only by the gentle directions of our instructor guiding us through a series of smooth, relaxing motions. Her voice was low, monotonal, vaguely therapeutic, as if she thought we might all be recovering from nervous breakdowns. The soporific approach was appropriate, though, since bedtime, followed all too soon by wake-up time, was next on the schedule. My double bedroom on the second floor was a corner room with two exposures. Although it faced Ojai Avenue on one side, the street was quiet enough so that I left the window open at night instead of turning on the air-conditioner. The twin beds had quilted spreads of a pastel print, and there were plenty of thick towels in the bathroom -- but only a liquid soap dispenser and glycerine soap. There was a television set in a corner, but I was too sleepy to watch. Trying to steer a course between overconfidence and false modesty, I considered the next morning's offerings and rejected both the six-to-eight-mile mountain hike for guests at advanced fitness levels (the 6 A.M. start time was another negative) and the morning stroll of one and a half miles, which I figured I probably did every day of my working life. I settled for the brisk three-mile walk designed for the intermediately fit. We brisk walkers did some warm-up exercises in the lobby at 7 A.M. and then set off. Zipping through the streets of residential Ojai at a pace that left scarcely a moment for visual inspection, I was nevertheless struck by the fact that for all its art-colony tradition and its current New Age aura the town still has a touch of Andy Hardy folksiness about it: neat houses, mailboxes with flags, newspapers tossed on the lawn, dogs barking friendly greetings. Back at the hotel by 7:45, I breakfasted on melon, grapes, a bran muffin, oatmeal with skimmed milk, and decaf coffee (no sweeteners). I longed for juice after my walk, but since it wasn't on the standard plan a nurse had to order it, and no nurse was on duty at that hour. A generous guest poured some of her apple juice into a paper cup. The Oaks food plan is based on 1,000 calories a day, and menus with calorie counts are posted each night for the next day. Calorie counts are also given for the various alternative or additional dishes that guests may choose from. My oatmeal, for example, added 120 calories to the standard breakfast; a hard-boiled egg would have added 80. Menus emphasize lean meats, fish, clear soups, whole-grain breads and raw fruits and vegetables, with herbs, spices, lemon juice and nonfat sauces substituted for more caloric flavorings. To me, the meals seemed needlessly bland, but since by some stroke of genetic luck I haven't had to acquaint myself with diet regimens, I may be judging this one too harshly. Certainly anyone who faithfully performed the daily physical workouts on 1,000 calories a day (there is even a 750-calorie day available with medical approval) could hardly fail to lose a respectable number of pounds. My body-awareness class fell into the stretch category, and we stretched to the point that when it was over I felt as if I had grown an inch or so. We stretched our fingers, toes, ankles, shoulders, wrists, arms and lower back; we tilted our pelvises, twisted our torsos, and reached for the sky and the walls. The class ended with some exercises involving a chair -- lifting the knee while standing and holding on to the chair back, stretching the hips while sitting down, raising the face toward the ceiling while gripping the knees with both arms, bending to touch the ankles from a sitting position. Printed illustrations of these exercises, called chair yoga, were given to anyone who felt inclined to work them into her daily home or office routine. I took two resistance classes at the Oaks. In the first, body conditioning, we exercised with weights, resistance bands for hands and ankles, step risers, and a barre for legwork. Few of us bore any resemblance to ballet dancers at the barre, but the pull in the thigh and calf -- never great enough to cause pain -- had the welcome effect of taking me back, mentally at least, to my younger, more flexible self. My second resistance class, aquatoning, was far and away the most fun of any activities I sampled. It consisted simply of going through some standard movements in the pool: walks, kicks, jumps, skips, push-pulls and the like. Standard movements, though, are anything but standard when you are performing them in chest-high water, trying to maintain an upright posture while immersed in a substance that wants you to lie down and float. The accompanying music at the Oaks featured fast-paced swing classics like ''Take the A Train.'' I tried desperately to keep the beat while working against the water. It must have looked like jitterbugging in slow motion. Between aquatoning and body resisting I ate lunch by the pool -- an onion roll, beet borscht, sliced turkey, lettuce, tomato, broccoli florets, and a dessert of mixed pineapple, melon, strawberries and black raspberries. The turkey was bland, but vegetables and fruit were fresh and appetizing. Calorie count: 350. Somewhere in the midst of all this muscle building and body toning I spent about 50 minutes either prone or supine enjoying an aromatherapy massage. I didn't enjoy the energizing scent I had chosen, eucalyptus, but the lavender scent I switched to was pleasing. The massage itself was brisk, businesslike, and thorough, although the face rest, lined with scratchy terry cloth, was rough on the cheekbones. I left Ojai feeling that the fitness program had tapped energy sources I didn't know I had and I resolved to keep better track of them. As for relaxation -- well, the town itself provided that. In my strolls along the arcade of stores on Ojai Avenue, with the Topa Topa bluffs as a backdrop, I browsed in art galleries, antiques shops and crafts centers, drank a delicious cappuccino at Tottenham Court, an attractive gift-shop-cum-tearoom, and visited Bart's Books on the street behind Ojai, an outdoor treasure trove of used books that has the feel of an exceptionally well stocked small-town library. I made a list of things to do on my next stay: visit the New Age center for, in its own words, alternative books, music and art, holistic healing and metaphysical thought; follow one of several hiking trails that start in the town and lead to picturesque viewpoints of the valley; go to the Sunday farmers' market on Matilija Street; see the ecumenical Biblical Garden (50 plants mentioned in the Bible) at the Presbyterian Church on Foothill Road. I might even indulge in a double-dip cone at the ice cream parlor down the street from the Oaks, then hop on the Ojai town trolley (25 cents, seven days a week) and breathe in the beauty of the surrounding countryside.
