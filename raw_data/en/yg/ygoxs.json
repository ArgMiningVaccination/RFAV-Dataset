Young14and Charlotte Leboeuf-Yde7 Abstract Background: In March 2020, the World Health Organization elevated the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic to a pandemic and called for urgent and aggressive action worldwide. Public health experts have communicated clear and emphatic strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Hygiene rules and social distancing practices have been implemented by entire populations, including 'stay-at-home 'orders in many countries. The long-term health and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are not yet known. Main text: During this time of crisis, some chiropractors made claims on social media that chiropractic treatment can prevent or impact COVID-19. The rationale for these claims is that spinal manipulation can impact the nervous system and thus improve immunity. These beliefs often stem from ninet eenth-century chiropractic concepts. We are aware of no clinically relevant scientific evi dence to support such statements. We explored the internet and social media to collect examples of misinformation from Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand regarding the impact of chiropractic treatment o n immune function. We discuss the potential harm resulting from these claims and explore the role of chiropractors, teaching institutions, accrediting agencies, and legislative bodies. Conclusions: Members of the chiropractic profession share a collective responsibility to act in the best interests of patients and public health. We hope that all chiropractic stakeholders will view the COVID-19 pandemic as a call to action to eliminate the unethical and potentially dangerous claims made by chiropractors who practise outside the boundaries of scientific evidence. Keywords: Covid-19, Chiropractors, Spinal manipulation, Professional traditionalism, Infodemic, Debate Background In March 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) labelled the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syn- drome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID 19, a pan- demic and called for countries to take urgent and aggressive action [ 1]. Because there is no knowntreatment for this virus, we are being asked to observe social distancing, wash our hands frequently, and curtail our activities with those outside our household. Most businesses that include person-to-person contact have been closed. Despite this grave situation, some chiropractors have advocated a misbelief that spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) or \"adjustments \"can boost immunity and thus should be offered as a preventive measure for viral infec- tions. The World Federation of Chiropractic (WFC) noted this development on March 17th 2020 and refuted this in a public statement: \"....there is no credible \u00a9 The Author(s). 2020 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

Nevertheless, some chiropractors continue promoting misinformation on social media putting the chiropractic profession at odds with scientific evidence. Evidence-based chiropractic care provides manage- ment of musculoskeletal disorders, offering an array of clinical services for a limited range of conditions [ 3,4]. The literature demonstrates the deleterious impact of musculoskeletal disorders world-wide [ 5-7]. The evi- dence based approach to the delivery of chiropractic ser- vices has made it possible for the chiropractic profession to contribute to health care as an accountable profes- sion, rooted in science, increasingly steeped in academia, and continuously seeking to improve the efficacy and safety of the clinical services it provides [ 4-6]. This is precisely the role ascribed to chiropractors by the gen- eral public [ 8]. The relevance of the chiropractic profes- sion in this context is not in question. However, some \"traditional \"(according to the Oxford dictionary: \"being part of the beliefs, customs or way of life of a particular group of people, that have not chan- ged for a long time \"[9]) chiropractors uphold the histor- ical belief that adjustments can correct spinal lesions (subluxations )[10,11], responsible for almost all disease [12], and that adjustments will improve the brain-body- environment communication [ 13]. Recent studies sug- gest that approximately 20% of chiropractors have this focus [ 14,15]. Many of their claims relate to relatively benign conditions [ 16,17] or ones where a musculoskel- etal origin is at least possible [ 18,19]. The issue of making false claims by chiropractors has previously been raised as a matter of concern both from outside the profession [ 20] and from within [ 21]. While inappropriate claims made by \"traditional \"chiropractors are never in the public 's interest, the specific claims of boosting immunity during the COVID-19 crisis presents a fundamentally different level of risk of harm to pa- tients and public health. Misinformation about adjust- ments and immunity taints public understanding of viral prevention, undermines the coordinated efforts of health authorities, and has become a cause for concern among researchers and public health authorities [ 22,23]. Statements related to the COVID-19 pandemic demon- strate that the chiropractic profession includes two distinct groups that have little in common and that mainstream chi- ropractors can no longer accept and protect the \"traditional \" fringe, because it presents a danger to the public [ 24]. Thus, the purpose of our article is to explore scientif- ically unsubstantiated statements by \"traditional \"chiro- practors to stimulate discussion and address any tolerance shown by mainstream chiropractors and regu- lators. Thereafter, we discuss where the responsibility lies for stopping this type of misinformation.Main text Search Over an 11-day period between 16 March and 26 March 2020, a group of 19 chiropractors searched social media and the internet for instances of chiropractors making claims related to immunity, chiropractic care and COVID-19. The material was sent around to colleagues, and the search snowballed from there, i.e. every post we came across led to a search to \"dig further \"for other types of misinformation. All in turn contacted their own professional networks with the intention of collecting as many different examples as possible in order to docu- ment which deleterious statements/claims were made concerning adjustments and the COVID-19 pandemic. Screenshots were taken in each case and the material was categorized according to claim and argument. Thus, we did not systematically search social media or the internet and kept no record of how many sites we examined. Material from individual chiropractors and chiroprac- tic clinics written in English, French, Swedish, Danish or Norwegian were gathered over a period of 11 days, after which saturation of statements and arguments was achieved. However, an extra statement was brought to our attention on April 10th. The examples provided herein are presented without identifying information, but screenshots and dates of capture are kept on record. Thereafter, websites of all the Councils on Chiroprac- tic Education (CCE), some CCE-accredited chiropractic teaching institutions, some chiropractic associations and regulatory boards were searched. These were assessed for unsubstantiated claims regarding COVID-19 and im- munity boosting through adjustments. For convenience reasons, we limited this search to Europe, North Amer- ica, South Africa, and Australia. Information from chiropractors In this convenience sample, 99 relevant statements were identified from individual chiropractors and chiropractic practices, as posted on social media. An overview of the origins (platforms and countries) for these posts is pre- sented in Fig. 1. However, this figure should not be con- strued as an estimate of prevalence, which is essentially unknown. It reflects the highly selective results of spe- cific online searches and social media surfing in an eleven-day time period. It should be noted, however, that the searches did not focus on general statements about COVID-19 but rather collected inappropriate or scientifically inaccurate state- ments about chiropractic, i.e. it 's supposed effect on im- mune function and, in particular, it 's supposed effect on COVID-19. Thus, all retained posts were in direct op- position to the WFC statement concerning COVID-19 [2]. Therefore, this work does not intend to provideAx\u00e9n et al. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies (2020) 28:65 Page 2 of 11information on the prevalence of messages that were op- posed to the WHO guidelines [ 25]. Rather, it provides a series of cases of unsubstantiated claims. The common element of the collected media state- ments is that adjustments boost the immune system. About half did not mention any public health interven- tion. However, the other half also mentioned factors such as hygiene, sleep, and stress management. Exam- ples of such claims are provided in Fig. 2[26]. Many claims (28% of the statements) could be traced directly to the more than 100-year old chiropractic con- cepts of the healthy spine and its purported effect on general health, including immune function (e.g. Figure 3) [27]. We are not aware of any scientific clinical evidence to support such beliefs. The type and quality of \"evidence \"provided to support these statements were not sufficient to validate the claims. Figure 4[28] shows an example of an explicit reference to a specific scientific article. In this reference, the clinical meaning of the study 's results is not known, and, in fact, the article does not provide evidence that adjustments enhance or confer immunity, as previously summarized in a rapid review from the WFC [ 29]. The most extraordinary claim that we found (17% of the statements that purported to be supported by evi- dence), was that mortality related to the Spanish fluepidemic after World War I was reduced among individ- uals who consulted chiropractors. According to the chi- ropractors who cited this study, patients treated with adjustments were less likely to die from the influenza than those treated by medical doctors. One example from a chiropractor 's website is shown in Fig. 5[30]. However, the evidence for this claim seems to be an art- icle from the January 1920 Journal of the American Osteopathic Association , reprinted in the May 2013 edi- tion [ 31]. This paper claimed that patients with influenza or pneumonia attended by osteopaths died at 1/40th the rate of those attended by medical doctors. The mortality estimates for patients receiving medical care were col- lated using information obtained from 148 state and city health commissioners in the United States. Osteopathic mortality estimates were generated using self-reported data from 2445 members of the American Osteopathic Association. Anecdotal work with spurious comparison of blatantly incomparable groups would not be pub- lished in a modern reputable journal. Misquoting and misinterpreting this biased information to the public during a pandemic is irresponsible. A common finding (29% of the statements \"supported by evidence \") was that several claims referred to un- specified evidence by stating \"research shows \"or\"evi- dence shows \"(Fig. 6)[32]. To our knowledge no such Fig. 1 An overview of the social media and internet origins as well as the countries from where claims originated from chiropractors that adjustments are beneficial in the prevention of COVID-19Ax\u00e9n et al.

Chiropractic & Manual Therapies (2020) 28:65 Page 4 of 11generally acceptable and clinically relevant research ex- ists to support such statements. It would be helpful if the chiropractors who make such claims would provide references for this anecdotal information. One chiropractor boldly stated that \"experience \" shows that chiropractic treatment has a positive effect on the immune system. This was supported by patient testimonials. Testimonials are questioned as a marketing tool in many areas of medicine [ 20,33,34], as it is not possible to confirm such claims empirically and may lead readers to disregard valid health information [ 35]. Further, because of their propensity to mislead,testimonial use by health care providers, including chiro- practors, contravenes advertising laws in some jurisdic- tions Other claims (4%) questioned undisputed and estab- lished science, such as the germ theory, and did not use \"evidence \"to back their claims. An example is shown in Fig.7[36]. A few (12%) of the statements were not accompanied by any argument at all as seen in Fig. 8[37]. One statement concerned the risk to the unborn child, resulting from prenatal stress caused by COVID-19. A chiropractor claimed that pregnant women should get chiropractic care in order to minimize consequences on the baby (Fig. 9)[38]. To our knowledge, there is no compelling clinically relevant evidence to support such a statement. Information from chiropractic regulatory agencies Information was collected from the websites of all chiro- practic regulatory agencies in the US, Canada, the UK, New Zealand, and Australia. None advocated chiroprac- tic care to improve immunity or to treat this viral dis- order. Most had information from local health authorities concerning COVID-19, pertaining to washing hands, disinfecting equipment, and/or closing down practises. In Table 1, the statements are listed from the six regulators that specifically state that they support the WFC statement on chiropractic and immunity. The General Council on Chiropractic in the UK threatens regulatory action if chiropractors breach the require- ments of the chiropractic code of practice. The regula- tory boards of Minnesota and West Virginia both state that claiming chiropractic care is beneficial to prevent or treat COVID-19 is in violation of state statue pertaining Fig. 4 An example of referring claims that chiropractic adjustment boosts the immune system to a specific scientific paper Fig. 5 Example of claiming that people receiving chiropractic care during the 1918 pandemic were less likely to dieAx\u00e9n et al. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies (2020) 28:65 Page 5 of 11to the scope of practice and advertising and the Chiro- practic Board of Australia mentions unlawful advertising. Information from chiropractic teaching institutions Information was collected from all the websites of CCE- accredited chiropractic teaching institutions in North America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Eur- ope. At the time of data collection, most institutions had not posted any messages relating to advice on the pan- demic. However, those which did, supported the WFC statement. Therefore, we do not further describe their contribution. Information from chiropractic associations To explore what chiropractic associations disseminated in terms of information on the pandemic, we also searched the websites and Facebook of chiropractic asso- ciations from Europe (some), Australia (both), New Zea- land (one), the US (all), and Canada (all), searching for information on the pandemic or the immune system in general.Many national chiropractic associations clearly sup- ported the WFC statement [ 2]: The American, Canadian, French, Norwegian and Swedish Chiropractic Associa- tions, Chiropractic Australia, the General Chiropractic Council in Britain and the UK Chiropractic Council, as did the US associations in Illinois, Alabama, California, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, New Mexico, Pennsylva- nia, and Texas. Councils on chiropractic education (CCEs) A search of the web-pages for the four CCEs (responsible for Europe, Australia, Canada and the US, respectively) and the International umbrella organization (I-CCE), did not reveal the use of inappropriate information relating to chiropractic treatment and viral disorders. Main points Some \"traditional \"chiropractors are making claims that could harm the public. In our opinion, the concept of adjustment- immunity boosting lacks biological Fig. 6 An example of referring to \"evidence \"Ax\u00e9n et al. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies (2020) 28:65 Page 6 of 11plausibility when viewed through the lens of modern sci- entific knowledge. There are of course situations where the scientific evi- dence is lacking and the biological plausibility is dis- puted, where high-quality randomized clinical trials of spinal manipulation may prove relevant. However, infec- tious disease is not one of them; the risks to the public are too high. Presently there is no generally accepted and clinically relevant evidence that adjustments protect against, nor impact, viral disease. Nevertheless, the \"traditional \"chiropractic approach, which forms the basis for the treatment to improve the immune system, survives among some chiropractors, despite scientificadvancements over the last century. Some studies sug- gest that there has been a reluctance to denounce the \"traditional \"faction of the profession because the major- ity, middle-of-the-road chiropractors and some of their organisations purposely accommodate all perspectives under the title \"chiropractic \"and avoid internal conflict [39,40]. The authors of this article, in line with modern-day concepts, assert that contemporary healthcare cannot be based on ideological beliefs and dogmatic contentions. When \"traditional \"chiropractors note the lack of evi- dence, we have observed that they often respond with a science type clich\u00e9: \"absence of evidence is not evidence Fig. 7 An example of claims stating: it is not about the germ, it 's about the immune system. This poster has been withdrawn. Not due to misleading information, but because \"it was used outside the practise \" Fig. 8 An example of claiming to boost immunity without any reference to evidenceAx\u00e9n et al. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies (2020) 28:65 Page 7 of 11of absence \". This cannot be used as an excuse to discard biological principles, common sense, and critical ap- praisal. If claims are extraordinary and contrary to other generally accepted existing knowledge, the evidence pro- vided must be especially convincing [ 41,42]. Responsibility for public safety is shared Correcting misinformation is particularly important, be- cause misinformation reaches more people and spreads more rapidly than accurate news [ 43]. This is especially true for health care misinformation [ 44], identified by the WHO as \"infodemic \"[45]. However, \"traditional \"chiro- practors, who believe in and spread misinformation, seem particularly motivated to reject correction, especially if it poses a threat to important aspects of their cultural iden- tity [ 46]. Therefore, it would be important to identify the origins of this problem in the chain of responsibilities, from educational institutions to individual clinicians, pro- fessional associations, and regulatory bodies. In all professional groups there will be outliers, people who do not fit in with the mainstream. This is probably un- avoidable. However, how likely is it that a substantial group of medical practitioners still believe in the practise of blood- letting and still reject the germ theory? In our opinion, we as a profession must take stronger measures to combat the dangerous anti-science sentiment that remains as a small but prominent part of the chiropractic community. The role of individuals Chiropractors should reflect on their personal beliefs and what it means to be a health care professional,entrusted with ensuring public benefit from their ser- vices. Those who make unfounded claims breach a fidu- ciary agreement that allows for professional self- regulation and permits professionals a great deal of au- tonomy, provided they adhere to the duty of care, the duty of loyalty, and the duty of disclosure. For health care professionals, this means that they must put patient interests ahead of their own, stay up to date with current best practises, and fully inform patients of treatment op- tions, including risks/benefits of any given procedure. Chiropractors who put their personal beliefs ahead of evidence or who selectively choose evidence that sup- ports their belief system fail to reach these standards and breach their professional duties, are legally negli- gent, and do not act in the best interests of their patients. The role of teaching institutions We would argue that the chiropractic teaching institu- tions are obligated to set the example for best practice by taking public stances on issues such as the present COVID-19 crisis. Teaching institutions, with their staff of highly educated and clinically experienced experts, are sought out for guidance, particularly at times of contro- versy and crisis [ 47,48]. Therefore, they bear a responsi- bility to act as prominent advocates of science and reason and must emphasize the teaching of evidence- based care and de-emphasize historical beliefs. Most of the institutions that posted information on the COVID- 19 pandemic did so in a responsible manner. The role of accrediting agencies Four CCEs are tasked with accrediting chiropractic pro- grams within their respective geographical region. How- ever, the standards and processes of these CCEs are not internationally homogeneous and concerns have been raised about some accredited chiropractic programs and the subsequent practice patterns demonstrated by their graduates [ 12,13,30-33]. Further, some CCEs have cre- ated a \"big tent \"approach to their accreditation stan- dards and processes, resulting in all types of understanding of the term chiropractic [ 21,22]. This ap- proach can make it difficult to define the practice and scope of chiropractic [ 34]. It has been argued that some CCEs have failed to wholeheartedly embrace an evidence-based approach to education and practice [ 35- 37]. For example, only 35% of students in some chiro- practic programs agree that immunization is an effective disease prevention and 9% believe that SMT is an effect- ive primary treatment for AIDS [ 49]. Further, many chiropractic students internationally have difficulty iden- tifying non-indications for SMT [ 50,51]. The COVID-19 crisis highlights the need for all CCEs to be agile in times of crisis and adopt the standards of Fig. 9 The claim that effects of COVID-19 stress on the unborn baby may be alleviated by chiropractic careAx\u00e9n et al. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies (2020) 28:65 Page 8 of 11Table 1 A list of statements from 14 chiropractic regulatory boards in the UK, Australia, the US and Canada, which discourage the use of chiropractic care in the prevention and treatment for COVID-19 or to boost immunity in general Regulatory board Web-page Statement UK- General Council on Chiropracticwww.gcc-uk.org/ It has come to our attention that some chiropractors are claiming or implying in published material that spinal adjustment and/or manipulation may protect patients from contracting COVID-19, boosting the immune system or aiding recovery. The General Council on Chiro- practic is clear that there is no credible scientific evidence that supports this and chiropractors must not make such a claim, or link treatment to COVID-19, in any way. Any chiropractors making such claims in any way, or making other unsubstantiated claims, run a very serious risk of being in breach of the requirements set out in the Code and regulatory action will be taken accordingly. Chiropractic Board Australiawww.chiropracticboard.gov. au/Other than sharing health information from authoritative sources, registered health practitioners should not make advertising claims on preventing or protecting patients and health consumers from contracting COVID-19 or accelerating recovery from COVID-19. To do so involves risk to public safety and may be unlawful advertising. For example, we are seeing some advertising claims that spinal adjustment/manipulation, acupuncture and some prod- ucts confer or boost immunity or enhance recovery from COVID-19 when there is no accept- able evidence in support. US- Arizona https://chiroboard.az.gov/ Chiropractors should refrain from any communication that suggests spinal adjustment/ manipulation may protect patients from contracting COVID-19 or will enhance their recovery. Doing otherwise is potentially dangerous to public health.

The role of regulatory bodies The groups entrusted with ensuring public safety must take steps to prevent pseudoscientific claims by chiro- practors. A recent meta-analytic study suggested the fol- lowing procedure for correcting misinformation [ 52]. First, make known the poor credibility of the source of the misinformation. Second, corrections should come from those who created and distributed the misinforma- tion, be made as soon as possible, and come from a credible source [ 53]. Conclusions In this search of public media in Europe, North America, New Zealand, and Australia, we discovered many cases of misinformation. Claims of chiropractic treatment im- proving immunity conflict with the advice from author- ities and the scientific consensus. The science referenced by these claims is missing, flawed or has no clinical rele- vance. Consequently, their claims about clinical effect- iveness are spurious at best and misleading at worst. However, our examples cannot be used to make state- ments about the magnitude of the problem among prac- titioners as our samples were not intended to be representative. For that reason, we also did not include an analysis of the arguments provided in the various postings. In view of the seriousness of the topic, it would be relevant to conduct a systematic study on a represen- tative sample of public statements, to better understand these issues. Our search illustrates the possible danger to public health of misinformation posted on social media and the internet. This situation provides an opportunity for growth and maturation for the chiropractic profession. We hope that individual chiropractors will reflect on and improve their communication and practices. Fur- ther, we hope that the chiropractic teaching institutions, regulators, and professional organisations will always demonstrate responsible leadership in their respective domains by acting to ensure that all chiropractors understand and uphold their fiduciary duties.
