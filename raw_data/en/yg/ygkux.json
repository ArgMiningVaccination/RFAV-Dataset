Uncertainty, fear, isolation, health concerns and financial strain as a result of COVID-19 have all taken a toll on our well-being. Recent news about effective vaccines has been encouraging, but it will be a while yet before life returns to normal. To cope with pandemic stress, many people are turning to various methods of [self-care](https://www.bayshore.ca/resources/self-care-for-healthy-aging/). Many have found support through [mental health services](https://www.bayshore.ca/resources/covid-19-mental-health-resources/). Others are boosting their mood (and staying fit) with regular exercise, or by [staying connected](https://www.bayshore.ca/resources/staying-connected-with-seniors-during-self-isolation/) with family and friends. Many of us are also exploring other techniques, including mindfulness and meditation, to soothe our frazzled nerves. What are mindfulness and meditation? The words \"mindfulness\" and \"meditation\" are often used interchangeably. They're closely related, but they aren't the same thing. Mindfulness means being present in the moment - aware of your thoughts, feelings, movements and behaviours without judging or interpreting. You can practise mindfulness anytime by paying attention to what's around you, what you're doing and what's going on in your mind. It's about engaging in the moment with all of your senses, rather than doing one thing and thinking about something else. Meditation is a more formal and intentional practice - taking time out of your day to sit, ideally in a quiet place, and practise mindfulness. Meditation might involve guided imagery or focusing on something specific, such as your breath, a sound, an object or a mantra (a short phrase). You can meditate by yourself or with others. The aim is to quiet the chaotic mental chatter that often dominates our thoughts. Health benefits of meditation Mindfulness and meditation can help you calm your busy and distracted mind. If that's not reason enough to give them a try, maybe this will convince you: they're also good for your health. Research studies have found that meditation can help reduce negative feelings, including stress, anxiety and depression. It can also decrease pain, improve [sleep](https://www.bayshore.ca/2019/09/09/sleep/) and boost immunity. Regular meditation may also benefit the [brain](https://www.bayshore.ca/resources/how-the-brain-changes-with-age/) by keeping it agile and protecting it from the effects of aging. There are other benefits, too. Mindfulness has been linked to better memory, attention, concentration and decision-making. It can help us feel more compassion towards ourselves and others. Mindfulness can also increase our self-insight, intuition and morality, as well as temper our response to fear. People who are mindful also tend to feel more satisfied about their relationships. Two more great reasons to practise mindfulness and meditation, especially during a pandemic: they cost nothing, and you can do them in the comfort of your own home. How to start meditating As anyone who has tried meditation can tell you, it's not easy to stop the mind from wandering, even for one minute. At first, it might even feel uncomfortable to sit with your thoughts. But don't get discouraged - simply observe each thought as it arises, and then gently let it go. It's okay for your thoughts to drift; simply try to notice when they do, and refocus your attention. You can start to practise mindfulness and meditation anytime.

Start with short sessions, just a few minutes at a time, and gradually extend to 15 minutes, half an hour or longer - as much time as you need to feel mentally refreshed and centred.
