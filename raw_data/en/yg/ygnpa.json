Read our | |ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02269423| | | Recruitment Status : Completed First Posted : October 21, 2014 Results First Posted : October 23, 2019 Last Update Posted : October 23, 2019 - Study Details [Tabular View](/ct2/show/record/NCT02269423) [Study Results](/ct2/show/results/NCT02269423) study is being conducted to assess whether this vaccine is safe, and if it causes the body to create an infection-fighting response. Between 1994 and the present, there have been many Ebola virus outbreaks caused by 4 different strains of the virus, affecting mostly people living in central Africa and the health care providers trying to treat them. Ebola viruses are members of the filoviridae virus family, which also includes the dangerous Marburg virus. Ebola virus causes severe and often deadly infection called a viral hemorrhagic fever, characterized by organ failure, bleeding, and death. To date, the virus is found primarily in Central and West Africa. It is not clear where these viruses come from, but it is thought that bats are the most likely source of the human outbreaks that occur. Once an outbreak occurs, the virus is spread from person to person through direct contact with infected blood or body fluids with an infected individual. Given the recent increase in Ebola virus infections occurring in Africa, there is interest in making an effective vaccine to protect against the infection. V920/BPSC-1001 is an experimental Ebola vaccine candidate demonstrating protection against Ebola virus in animal experiments. This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate a novel vaccine to Ebola using a live VSV replacing the gene encoding the G envelope glycoprotein with the gene encoding the envelope glycoprotein from the Zaire strain of Ebola (VSVG-ZEBOV also known as V920 and BPSC-1001). This phase 1 protocol provides a first-in-human study to evaluate the safety and toxicity of V920/BPSC-1001 in healthy adult participants. Participants will be randomized to receive V920/BPSC-1001 or Placebo by intramuscular injection. Three dose levels will be assessed with follow-up visits through 180 days after the injection. |Study Dose-Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of the BPSC-1001 (VSVG-ZEBOV) Ebola Virus Vaccine Candidate in Healthy Adult Subjects| |Actual Study Start Date :||October 13, 2014| |Actual Primary Date :||August a 1-mL intramuscular injection of V920 3x10^6 pfu in one deltoid 1-mL intramuscular injection of placebo in the contralateral deltoid on 0. | Biological: V920 Experimental: 2x10^7 Vaccine Cohort | Participants receive a intramuscular injection of V920 2x10^7 pfu in one deltoid 1-mL intramuscular injection of placebo in the contralateral deltoid on 0. | Biological: V920 Experimental: 1x10^8 Vaccine Cohort | Participants receive a intramuscular injection of V920 1x10^8 pfu in one deltoid 1-mL intramuscular injection of placebo in the contralateral deltoid on 0. | Biological: V920 saline placebo. | Placebo Comparator: Placebo Cohort | Participants will receive a 1-mL intramuscular injection of placebo in each deltoid on Day 0. | Other: Placebo | Normal saline placebo. - Number of Participants With One or More Solicited Local Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) [ Time Frame: Up to 14 days postvaccination ]An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study vaccine. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that starts or worsens on or after the date and time of the study vaccination. Local reactogenicity signs and symptoms include pain, erythema (redness), and induration (swelling). The number of participants that experienced at least one solicited local TEAE was assessed.

Systemic reactogenicity signs and symptoms include pyrexia (subjective and objective fever), chills, hyperhidrosis (sweats), myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and/or diarrhea. AEs were assessed for severity by the investigator as follows: Grade 1=Mild; Grade 2=Moderate; Grade 3=Severe; Grade 4=Potentially life-threatening. The number of participants that experienced at least 1 solicited systemic TEAE was summarized by grade.

The number of participants that experienced at least one unsolicited TEAE related to study vaccination was summarized by grade. - Number of Participants With Early Study Discontinuation Due to an Adverse Event [ Time Frame: Up to 28 days postvaccination ]An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study vaccine. The number of participants prematurely withdrawing from the study due to an AE was assessed. - Number of Participants With One or More Serious Adverse Event [ Time Frame: Up to 180 days postvaccination ]An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study vaccine. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that results in death, is life-threatening, results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity, results in or prolongs an existing hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or is another important medical event. The number of participants that experienced one or more SAE was summarized. - Geometric Mean Titers of ZEBOV Envelope Glycoprotein-specific Binding Antibodies [ Time Frame: Baseline, Days 7, 14, 28, 56, 84 and 180 post-vaccination ]The Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) of ZEBOV-specific immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For of quantitation (LLOQ) was 58.84. ZEBOV IgG titers at baseline (Day 0) and analysis Days 7, 14, 28, 56, 84, and 180 were summarized by V920 vaccine dose level and placebo as the mean of log10 titers, transformed into GMT. The geometric standard deviation (GSD) for the GMT at each visit was obtained by exponentiating the standard deviation for the mean of log (base 10) transformed titers. - Geometric Mean Titers of ZEBOV-specific Neutralizing Antibodies [ Time Frame: Baseline, Days 7, 14, 28, 56, and 180 post-vaccination ]The Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) of assays (PsVNA). Titers were reported for PsVNA50 values which were derived from the reciprocal of the dilution that resulted in a 50% decrease in luciferase activity. The LLOQ for the PsVNA was 20. If the PsVNA was reported 20, the numeric portion of the titer was divided by 2 for statistical purposes, which could result in a reported GMT <20.0. PsVNA50 titers at baseline (Day 0) and analysis Days 7, 14, 28, 56, and 180 were summarized by V920 vaccine dose level and placebo as the mean of log10 titers, transformed into GMT. The geometric standard deviation (GSD) for the GMT at each visit was obtained by exponentiating the standard deviation for the mean of log (base 10) transformed titers. - Number of Participants With Vaccine Viremia [ Time Frame: Days 1, 3, 7, and 14 post-vaccination ]The number of participants with viremia detected by recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of blood specimens was assessed. - Number of Participants With Vaccine Shedding/Excretion in Saliva or Urine [ Time Frame: Days 1, 3, 7, and 14 post-vaccination ]The number of participants with viremia detected by rVSV reverse transcription PCR of saliva or urine specimens was assessed. - Mean Copy Number of Vector RNA (Vector Viremia) [ Time Frame: Up to 14 days postvaccination ]Although the protocol specified a secondary endpoint that included the mean copy number of vector RNA (vector viremia), the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test used for the study reported a qualitative rather than a quantitative outcome, so the proportion of participants with viremia is reported instead of the mean copy number of vector RNA. Qualitative results are therefore reported in Outcome Measures 12 and 13. Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.
