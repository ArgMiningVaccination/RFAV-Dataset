Massage is a good form of manipulation of deeper layers of muscle, connective tissue, tendons, ligaments, joints, and even lymphatic vessels. It will soften tight muscles first and then break the knot that has accumulated over time. Our professional staff will revitalize your whole body, mind and soul. It would be a good combination with acupuncture treatment. Importance of physical therapy has rose recently. Physical Therapy helps for sciatica, fibromyalgia, acute/chronic low back/neck pain, sports injuries, plantar fasciitis, and even for preventive purpose for future injuries. We specialize in hands-on manual therapy as well as traditional physical therapy. After seen on TV from Olympic Team USA's hero Michael Phelps' back black marks, we do get lots of inquiries about cupping. It's not something that is a new technique. It's been used in Asian countries for thousands of years. Chiropractors use hands-on spinal manipulation and other alternative treatments, the theory being that proper alignment of the body's musculoskeletal structure, particularly the spine, will enable the body to heal itself without surgery or medication.
