However, his accomplishments as an architect are less well understood. His two greatest achievements in this field - two buildings known as 'Geotheanum I' and 'Goetheanum II' (built after the destruction of the 1st) - have been described as 'sculptural architecture', of a kind similar Expressionist form to Gaudi, Obrist, and Finsterlin. The focus of this chapter, Goetheanum II, is a giant sculptured form, four stories high, with sweeping lines that give the effect of a giant monolithic mass. It is home to the Anthroposophical movement, and holds a 1,000 seat performance hall in which spiritual performances take place. Contributors to an issue of the Swiss architectural magazine Werk, in 1960, on the building, agreed that the building's design must have required \"a uniform worldview and lifestyle.\" Indeed, to understand the Goetheanum requires an understanding of Anthroposophy and of Steiner himself. This chapter looks at the meaning in the aesthetic choices of Steiner in the design and construction of the Goetheanum II. Steiner's belief that the people of Western Europe needed to re-orientate their weltanschauung is understood as a spiritual need. Interestingly, it was a view shared by many Expressionist artists. Steiner could not have been unaware of a number of significant Expressionistic philosophies and forms present in Europe during his formative period. As a lecturer he travelled extensively, and came into contact with many artists and writers who shared similar ideas. His vision for the Goetheanum was grandiose, like those of many other Expressionists, though unlike many others he had the opportunity to build his vision himself. The Goetheanum has also been referred to as a gesamtkunstwerk, also a theme common in the German art scene at the time. Yet Steiner wanted something 'new' for his nascent spiritual group; \"Not to build in a style born out of our spiritual world view, would mean to deny Anthroposphy in her own house.\" As a result the Geotheanum expresses Anthroposophical ideals, a movement which itself professed to inhabit the entire cultural life of its adherents. For Steiner this was came in the form of spiritual realisation, which could best be achieved in the sculptural shapes and organic forms of the Goetheanum\" Egil Asprem & Kennet Granholm (eds.)

Also on http://fhs1973.com/2009/08/24/ A historical consideration of Rudolf Steiner's statements ca. 1905 about the \"Wirbelbewegung\" - the vortex as movement and fundamental motif of the Cosmos. A treatise on the contradictions in the environment movement, in particular deep green ecology. Whose shadow lurks behind the 20th century's celebrated scientific achievements? Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925), founder of the spiritual humanities known as anthroposophy, inaugurated and developed the idea of the threefold order of the social organism, in short social organics, in four phases. It first came to the fore in 1917 with his memoranda to the governments of the German and Austrian-Hungarian emperors as a Central-European peace initiative to end the wars against Russia and the West. It contained a radical proposal to finally realize the ideals of the French revolution by extending the separation of powers - the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government - to the three branches of the social organism, i.e. freedom in the cultural life (science, art and religion), equality in the rights sphere of the proper life of the state and politics and brotherhood in the economic life (production, distribution and consumption of goods and services). After this internal attempt failed, Rudolf Steiner went public in 1919 with his Appeal to the German People and the Civilized World followed by his book The Threefold Social Order, out of which grew a popular movement with branches in several European countries. When also this attempt failed to break through, he developed in 1922 in his Course on a Science of World Economy a new social organic form of thinking and language. And in order to further this new paradigm he and his followers refounded on a social organic constitutional basis in 1923 the Anthroposophical Society in Switzerland, which now has branches throughout the world, all designed to bring this new principle of civilization to fruition for the benefit of mankind and the earth.
