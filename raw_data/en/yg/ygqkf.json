January 21, 2023 On January 21, [Pioneer Valley Project](https://www.pioneervalleyproject.org/) (PVP) hosted a COVID-19 vaccine clinic at People's Supermarket, a Springfield-based bodega. Bilingual/Spanish-speaking staff were at the clinic to attend to the community's linguistic and cultural needs. 27 individuals got vaccinated, including the owner of People's Supermarket, who received a booster. PVP later partnered with the bodega again for a clinic on February 18, 2023, at which 25 people got vaccinated.
