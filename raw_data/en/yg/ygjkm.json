ABSTRACT The present study aims to evaluate in vitro free radical scavenging activity of methanol extract of Clinacanthus nutans and the effect of the extract on liver and kidney function parameters in normal rats. The free ra dical scavenging activity was estimated by using DPPH assay. The methanol extract was administered orally at a single dose of 2 g\u0000kg1 of body weight to female Sprague Dawley rats, and were monitored for 14 days. Blood samples were collected from each rat on day -15 after overnight fasting under light ether anesthesia. Blood serum was separated by centrifugation and used for biochemical analyses. The extract showed do se-dependent free radical scavenging activity with IC 50 value of 1.3 3 \u00b1 0.001 mg/m l. Single dose oral administration of C. nutans leaves extract at 2 g/kg dose did not produce any toxic si gns or deaths in female SD rats. There were no significant (P > 0.05) differences in alanine urea creatinine levels between treatment rats and control rats. Infra red (IR) analysis of the extract showed the p resence of C -O stretch, C=O stretch and OH band. The UV - visible absorption spectrum confirme d tha t the extract contains UV-active compounds .

The absorbance of samples was compared with control, consisting 2 ml DPPH solution and 1 ml of methanol 5. All tests were pe rformed three times . The activities of the extracts were calculated using the following formula: Free radical scavenging activity = (Ac - As) / Ac x 100% where Ac is absorbance value o f control and As is absorbance value of samples. Acute (1 day) oral t oxicity A total of 12 young male SD rats aged between 10 -12 weeks old were used for the evaluation of acute oral toxicity of methanol extract of C. nutans leaves according to OECD 423 gu ideline 6. All the rats were randomly assigned into two groups with six animals per group. First group was served as control and treated with distilled water (as vehicle) while the second group was served as treatment group that received single dose (1 day treatment) of 2 g/kg of C. nutans extract. Limit dose at 2 g/kg was chosen based on the recommendation given by OECD 423 guideline 6. Cage -side observation was conducted for 14 days to see the appearance of any toxic signs due to C. nutans treatment. Body weight changes, food and water intake were recorded on day -0, day -3, day-7 and day -14. Blood samples were collected from each rat on day -15 after overnigh t fasting under light ether anesthesia.

All the rats were sacrificed to obtain relative organs weight for liver, kidney, lung, spleen and heart. 80 | J App Pharm Vol. 6 ; Issue 1: 77-86; January, 2014 Tiew et al. , 2014 Journal of Applied Pharmacy (ISSN 19204159) Serum Biochemical parameters The following serum biochemical liver function . The serum samples were analysed by using Roche Cobas C311 chemistry analy zer (Roche, Switzerland) . Statistical Analysis Results were presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Results for acute toxicity study were analysed using Student's t -test. p<0.05 was considered as significant difference when compared to the respective cont rol group. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Extraction Maceration was used to obtain crude extract from the dry leaf powder of C. nutans . Maceration is a simple and cost -effective extraction technique which gives good and selective extraction. It uses limited vol ume of solvents. However, it requires the analytes to be sufficiently soluble into the solvent in order to be extracted from the leaves. To improve efficacy of extraction, the mixture of solvent and leaves powder were stir constantly throughout the extr action process. This ensures the concentrated solution is dispersed and accumulated around the surface of the particles, thereby bringing fresh menstruum to the particle surface for further extraction 7. Percentage yield of 15.29 % w/w was obtained by e xtraction of leaf powder (255.00 g) through maceration us ing methanol as solvent . The containers used for the maceration were covered with aluminium foil to reduce possibility of photo -degradation of the extracts. UV-Visible spectrophotometry The UV-vis a bsorption spectrum o f the extract is shown in Figure 1. The extract was found to contain compounds which absorb UV. UV-vis spectrum of the extract showed two peaks ( max) at 272 .58 and 334 .95 nm. This indicates the presence of specific chromophores in the structure of the constituents of the extracts that absorb at these particular wavelengths. The UV -Vis spectra of flavonoids (flavones) have been reported to exhibit two major peak s between 240 - 400 nm due to excitation of -electrons 8. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) FT-IR spectroscopy was useful to detect characteristic peaks and functional groups of compounds present in C. nutans methanolic extract. FT-IR spectrum of the extract is shown in Figure 2. The spectrum showed -OH band at frequency range 3200 -3600 cm-1, C-H stretch at frequency range of 2800 -3000 C=O stretch at frequency of 1628 stretch at frequency of 1050 -1400 cm-1. The presence of -OH band and C=O stretch suggest s that the constituents in the extract have -OH group and C=O group as functional group s. Phenolic and flavonoid compounds are compounds containing hydroxyl and carbonyl group as functional groups. 81 | J App Pharm Vol. 6 ; Issue 1: 77-86; January, 2014 Tiew et al. , 2014 Journal of Applied Pharmacy (ISSN 19204159) 200.0 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600.00.010.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.61.69 nmA 334.95272.58 Figure 1: UV -Visible spectrum of Clinacanthus nutans leaf extract. Figure 2: FT -IR spec tra of Clinacanthus nutans leaf extract. Estimation of total phenolic content s Total phenolic content of the extract was 0.78 \u00b1 0.005 mg GA/g dry extract . Phenolic compound is one of the important secondary metabolites and bioactive compounds of plant. The estimated total phenolic content in C. nutans can be associated with its functions. Polyphenols are bioactive constituents present in food plants which are very important in the control and prevention of tissue damage by activated oxygen species due to their antioxidant effects 9. 82 | J App Pharm Vol. 6 ; Issue 1: 77-86; January, 2014 Tiew et al. , 2014 Journal of Applied Pharmacy (ISSN 19204159) 400.0 420 440 460 480 500 520 540 560 580 600 620 640 660 680 700.00.0180.050.100.150.200.250.300.350.400.450.500.550.600.650.700.750.800.850.900.951.000 nmA Phenolic compounds are reported to increas e bile secretion, reduces blood cholesterol and lipid levels and inhibit microbial growth . Phenolic compounds are also crucial for plant growth and plant reproduction. 10 Estimation o f total flavonoid content Total flavonoid content of the extract was 0.21 \u00b1 0.005 mg QE/g . Total phenolic content was compare to total flavonoid content in extr act. Flavonoid is a sub -class of phenolic and known with its polyphenolic structures. Fl avonoid s play important role in protecting biological systems against harmful effects of oxidative processes on macro molecules. Flavonoids are reported posses antiulcer activity, hepatoprotective activity, anti -inflammatory activity, anti - diabetic effects, vasorelaxant process, anti -atheroscelorotic effects, anti -thrombogenic effects, cardioprotective effects and anti -neoplastic activity 11. Figure 3: UV - Visible spectra of DPPH solution (0.1 mM) and 60 min after mixing with methanol extract of C. nutans (1 mg/ml, 3 mg/ml), stable free radical diphenylpicrylhydrazyl ( DPPH ) radical is one of the known methods to evaluate antioxidant activity of extracts and active compounds in vitro . It is characterised as stable free radical by virtue of the delocalisation of spare electron over the molecule as whole. The reduction of DPPH causes the deco louration the purple colour of DPPH to deep violet colour with loss of absorbance at 517 nm 12. In this study, The C. nutans methanolic leaves extract showed do se-dependent free radical with IC50 value of 1.33 \u00b1 0.001 mg/m l. The free radical scavenging activity of the extract was lower compare to the positive refere nce compound, quercetin (1 mg/m l). The spectral change of DPPH solution after mixing it with the solution of the extracts and positive reference compound 83 | J App Pharm Vol. 6 ; Issue 1: 77-86; January, 2014 Tiew et al. , 2014 Journal of Applied Pharmacy (ISSN 19204159) (quercetin) is show n in Figure 3. Quercetin at 1mg/ml which has lowest absorbance value, is the most potent antioxidant compare to the extract a t 1 mg/ml and 3 mg/m l. The presence of phenolic and flavonoid compounds in the extract contributed to the antioxidant activity of the extract. Phenolic s and flavonoids are known as anti -oxidant agents and act as free radical oxidation terminator 13. Phenolic compounds have many phenolic hydroxyl groups and as a result have many active points in radical scavenging. Though the prese nce of phenol structure render compounds effective free radical inhibitors, hydrogen atoms not existing as phenolic groups have been recorded to work for radical scavenging 14 .The FT -IR spectrum of the extract showed a broad peak near 3400 cm-1 due to -OH stretching vibration . UV- vis spectrum of the extract showed two major between 240 -400 nm which indicate the presence of flavonoids in the extract 8. These observations confirm the existence of -OH moieties which have the ability to terminate propagatio n of chain carrying radicals by acting as H -atom donor. Acute (1 day) oral t oxicit y No mortality and treatment related changes in general state, behavior and external appearance was observed in the C. nutans treated female rats up to the 2 gkg-1 single dose. Body weight, food and water consumption showed no treatment -related alterations at the end of 14 days observation period (Table 1 ). The extract did not pr oduce any toxic signs or deaths hence the 50% le thal dose must be higher than 2 g\u0000kg1. Medicinal plants serve as the source of traditional medicine to treat various diseases. Th erefore, medicinal plants play an important role as complementary and alternative medicine as there is growing acceptance of traditional medicine for certain diseases Traditional healers utilised the active ingredients of the medicinal plants to achieve th erapeutic activity. It is estimated that at least 25% of modern medicines are derived from medicinal plants, directly or indirectly 15.

Effect of the extract on biochemical parameters In the present study, there were no significant differences in AST, ALT, ALP, total bilirubins, urea and creatinine levels between treatment and control group (Table 2). Hence, C. nutans does not cause either hepatic or renal toxicity. This was further supported by gross pathology on the liver and kidney and measurement of relative organ weight whereby no treatment related difference in lesions or relative organ weights was observed (Figure 4).

Data was analysed by using Student's t - test . p<0.05 was considered as significant difference when compared to the respective control group. Based on the results obtained from this study, it wa s concluded that a dose of 2 g/kg of the meth anol extract of C. nutans leaves given orally to female rats appeared to be non toxic and the oral LD 50 value is higher than 2 g/kg in female rats. This study provides important preliminary data on the acute toxicity profile of C. nutans and further invest igation on the long term effect of this plant would be necessary. CONCLUSION In conclusion, treatment of femal e rats with a single dose (1 day treatment) of 2 g/kg of C. nutans extract showed no lethality and adverse effects in female rats. The extract demonstrated in vitro free radical scavengin g activity. The qualitative UV -visible spectroscopy analysis confirme d that the extract contain compounds which are UV-active. The FT -IR analysis of the extract showed that the chemical constituents in the extract contain hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups. The leaves of the plant can be explored as non-toxic natural a ntioxidant by the pharmaceutical industries. Characterisation of the bioactive components of the extract by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry is in progress. REFERENCES 1.Hu J, Deng Y, Daniel T F. Clinacanthus .
