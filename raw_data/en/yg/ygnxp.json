Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)10/20/2020 11:05:17PM 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center87th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's Statement OVERVIEW This Legislative Appropriations Request for FY 2022-23 is grounded in the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on public health and our economy that we collectively face. It is also predicated on a strategic assessment of the future of UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) as an academic medical center and foundational support needed for our institution to continue to serve Texas as an educator of physicians, scientists and other health care providers, and conductor of cutting-edge biomedical and public health research as a viable path forward from COVID-19 and future health challenges. This request is also based on careful consideration of the Legislature's historic priorities for higher education in Texas that impact all of its Health Related Institutions (HRIs), including providing resources necessary to educate a world-class healthcare and research workforce, and upon UTSW's longstanding priority to secure accountable investment in biomedical research that simultaneously serves to expand the Texas economy and to improve the quality and availability of healthcare for all Texans. BACKGROUND AND OPERATIONS UTSW strives to achieve the public policy goals it was established to pursue, and leverages the State's investment to obtain additional federal and private support to advance its education, research and patient care missions. The State's investment in UTSW pays dividends much greater than the cost, both in terms of external dollars generated and in results produced. Since its formation in WWI barracks in 1943, UTSW has grown into a multifaceted academic medical center engaged in education with three schools, a robust research enterprise, healthcare for millions of patients and considerable community service. From a team of 20, UTSW has expanded to a comprehensive faculty of ~3,000 occupying ~14M sq. ft. of space. Administrative expense in FY19 was 3.3%, traditionally the lowest among state HRIs. Medical School & Graduate Medical Education A young school compared to its peers, UTSW's Medical School is consistently ranked in the Top 30 among 160 nationally for research and primary care, the only public Texas school so rated. As of 2020, UTSW has educated ~12,000 undergraduate physicians. At student capacity since the early 2000s, with an annual graduating class of ~240, the medical school is the 11th largest in the U.S. In FY19, 43% of our graduates entered Primary Care residency and 54% of all UTSW medical school graduates were practicing in Texas. UTSW also provides Continuing Medical Education to ~35,000 practicing physicians per year. The Graduate Medical Education program trains 1,370 residents in 118 accredited Primary and Specialty care programs across NTX. Operating the largest public GME program in Texas, UTSW trains almost one in five doctors in the state. More than 30% of UTSW residents are in Primary Care programs, including the OB/GYN and Internal Medicine programs that are the largest in the U.S., and its Pediatrics programs, the second largest in Texas. UTSW's 98 Specialty Care programs, such as Emergency Medicine, Psychiatry and Neurosurgery, train residents in specialties with some of the greatest shortages in Texas. Eighteen Specialty programs-including Forensic Psychiatry, Neurodevelopmental Disabilities, and Pediatric Orthopedics-are the only programs in Texas training these needed physicians. In total, UTSW graduates ~500 physicians per year from its GME programs and in FY19, 56% remained in practice in Texas. Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences & School of Health Professions UTSW's Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and School of Health Professions are also highly regarded. The Graduate School trains ~1,000 students and post-doctoral fellows, helping to produce the next generation of scientists as the largest program encompassing ~30% of all biomedical sciences students in Texas. The Graduate School includes two divisions, Basic and Clinical Science, offering Ph.D. degrees in 12 areas such as Biomedical Engineering, Immunology, and Neuroscience. Page 1 of 8Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)10/20/2020 11:05:17PM 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center87th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's Statement A vibrant research enterprise is essential to the education of these students-most graduate training, by necessity for practice and accreditation standards, is done in the lab. The School of Health Professions, although smaller with an enrollment of 365, for 50+ years has been a leader in training students to meet needs in a range of fields with acute shortages, including Physical Therapy, Clinical Nutrition, Prosthetics-Orthotics, and Physician Assistant studies, which is consistently ranked by US News & World Report a Top 10 program and #7 in 2019. Most programs are two years in length and effectively prepare students in a variety of academic, research and health care settings, resulting in high licensure pass rates and job placement and equipping students to care for a rapidly evolving patient population and with leadership training to help improve our care delivery system. Patient Care - Enhanced by Education & Research Although UTSW receives no State appropriation to maintain clinical facilities, we provide an enormous amount of primary and specialty care to patients from the area, and to patients referred from across Texas and the U.S. who are in need of specialty care that only a top-ranked academic center can provide. Approximately 3M outpatients and 105,000 hospitalized patients are treated annually. Patients are cared for at two UTSW owned and operated State hospitals, Zale Lipshy University Hospital Pavilion and William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital. Zale Lipshy is one of the world's premier neurological disease centers, specialized in diagnosing and treating patients with neurovascular diseases, stroke, Parkinson's, and other neurologic conditions. Specialties at the 148-bed hospital include neurosurgery, spine, orthopedics, psychiatry, and rehabilitation. Clements University Hospital is a state-of-the art 460-bed teaching facility opened in 2014, with a third tower expansion opening in 2020 to provide more operating rooms, Emergency Medicine capacity, and 290 more beds. Clements was supported by faculty who dedicated their own earning to its construction, and designed to integrate teaching and research missions while driving quality in patient care. Since opening, Clements has been ranked 2nd among all hospitals in Texas by US News & World Report, and patient satisfaction surveys put it in the top 1% of hospitals nationally. UTSW's goal is to continue pioneering a patient-centric hospital at the frontiers of science and clinical transformation -offering broad expertise from cancer and organ transplant services to cardiology and obstetrics-so Texans need never leave the state to access comprehensive care on par with world-renowned centers like the Mayo Clinic. Significant care is also provided at our major teaching hospital partners, Parkland (one of the largest teaching hospitals in the U.S.), Children's Health (a Top 10 pediatric hospital), Texas Scottish Rite, the North Texas V A, and many other locations across the region. A clinically integrated network, Southwestern Health Resources, also provides access to highest-quality, coordinated primary and specialty care with 29 hospitals and 3,000+ physicians spanning a 16-county service area, encompassing more than 7M residents throughout NTX. Through the quality of its providers and research, UTSW works to offer the most advanced care to all patients. Its Simmons Cancer Center was the second in Texas to secure the highest NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center designation; our nursing team has secured Magnet designation, the highest honor awarded by the American Nurses Credentialing Center to only 7% of hospital systems, recognizing our nurses for their excellence in care and advancing their practice through research; UTSW is certified as the only Advanced Comprehensive Stroke Center in NTX; and access to some of the most innovative treatments is available only through clinical trials at UTSW and telehealth services offered to patients across the region. UTSW physicians provide ~$148M in uncompensated care, ~4% of our entire University expense. While no funding for patient care is received from the State or UT System, the success of UTSW's university health system has historically generated funds, ~$120M per year, that have been reinvested to support more education, including GME. Page 2 of 8Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)10/20/2020 11:05:17PM 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center87th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's Statement Research - Essential to Excellence in Education & Patient Care UTSW has earned a global reputation as a top research institution. Many of its faculty have achieved recognition for accomplishments in research, which is integral to excellence in patient care and education. Six UTSW faculty have been awarded the Nobel Prize. The first in 1987 for research that led to the development of cholesterol-controlling statin drugs-recognizing work performed in Texas, a first in Nobel history-and the most recent in 2013 for seminal discoveries in cellular transport systems, with applications to all organ systems. UTSW also leads Texas in having 24 faculty elected to the National Academy of Sciences-the \"hall of fame\" for American scientists (with 4 new members elected in 2020), 16 in the National Academy of Medicine, and 13 of the 19 Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators in Texas-three of the most objective national measures of faculty excellence. In a significant achievement-and external validation of the strength of biomedical research in Texas-UTSW was ranked #1 within the healthcare category internationally for publishing high-quality scientific research, according to the renowned Nature Index Annual Tables. This global listing evaluates institutions based on the number of peer-reviewed research articles published in the most prestigious scientific journals, and placed UTSW above peers such as Columbia University, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Massachusetts General Hospital. The Nature Index for innovation also ranked UTSW #5 in the world in the number of published research articles cited as significant sources in third-party patent applications. This new metric evaluates an institution's impact on industrial innovation-how a scientific discovery leads to the commercialization of new therapies. While we are proud of our faculty's accomplishments, such recognition represents far more than academic accolades. Each day, Texans directly benefit from our research as discoveries made in labs at UTSW are translated into treatments. We have 500+ basic science and translational research labs on campus, and 550+ clinical trials annually, focused on improving therapy for patients suffering from many conditions, with select areas of expertise and institutional focus on remaining at the forefront of medical progress in: neuroscience through the recently established Peter O'Donnell Brain Institute, which includes the Center for Depression Research & Clinical Care and the State-funded Texas Institute for Brain Injury & Disease; Obesity, Cholesterol, Metabolism, and Diabetes; Cancer Therapeutics; Heart Disease and Stroke; Advanced Medical Imaging; and Gene Therapy. Research - State support & ROI Major patient care breakthroughs are the culmination of years of scientific endeavor and could not happen without consistent core research State funding. UTSW is grateful that in 2019, the 86th Legislature established a Pilot Performance-Based Research Operations Formula specific to our institution's research mission. The importance of the accountable increased predictability of this formula mechanism compared to Non-Formula Support for this work cannot be overstated. State support is essential to seeding our scientists' life-saving discoveries. It enabled UTSW to pivot efforts to 160+ projects researching for improved COVID-19 therapies and a vaccine, and will continue to be essential as we emerge from having essentially ceased our research when the pandemic began to reestablish in stages from our current 50% to full capacity to continue work on COVID and the many other diseases that afflict our population. Research investment also pays significant economic dividends to the State. In FY19, UTSW had $489M in research, a majority from out of state competitive sources such as NIH. For every $1 appropriated to UTSW for research, UTSW historically secures $7+ in external funds brought to Texas. UTSW discoveries have led to the creation of 40 biotech companies, raising more than $2B invested in Texas, and more than 1,000 technology license deals, resulting in ~$250M in revenue to date. Page 3 of 8Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)10/20/2020 11:05:17PM 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center87th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's Statement Converting UTSW's Performance-Based Research Operations Formula from a Pilot to a standing funding stream would allow UTSW to exponentially capitalize on the State's investment and augment its contributions to Texas' economy. The importance of a sound research platform and expert scientists capable of combatting disease is increasingly evident as we collectively face COVID-19, and as our own State Comptroller has cited the human value of biotech and the need to advance this sector in Texas as the only major industry that is not at risk of contracting, yet has lagged in our state even before our current recession. COVID-19 - Response and Phased Restoration Like many academic medical centers in Texas and across the nation, UTSW has played a significant role in our region and state's COVID response and we continue to develop and implement efforts that we expect will be key to our recovery. By necessity, a majority of our activities in our tripartite missions of education, research and patient care have shifted focus since early 2020 to respond to the pandemic. Our faculty and staff have accomplished unprecedented research and operational innovation to maintain the highest quality education for our students and care for all patients, while driving to understand the pathogenesis and prevalence of COVID-19. Education & Training For the safety of students and trainees and to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) for patient care, all education and training that could be accomplished remotely was transitioned to distance learning from March through June. The majority of students shifted to completing hands- off research rotations. Faculty quickly developed two electives for interested students to assist in following discharged UTSW hospital patients for post -COVID observation, as well as contact tracing in partnership with the Dallas County Health Department. Match day-a time-honored event during which our medical students anxiously await to open their envelopes together with family and friends to learn where they will complete their residency training-was held live online. Medical, Health Professions and Graduate School commencements were held virtually. However, health professions and biomedical research training by its nature cannot be accomplished remotely indefinitely. With continued commitment to the safety of our students and to conservation of PPE, in June, UTSW successfully returned 4th and 3rd year medical students and all Health Professions students to clinical rotations. Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences trainees also returned to their labs in shifts. Research - Operations & Innovation For three months beginning in March, the robust research enterprise built on decades of scientific progress and investment at UTSW was halted except for COVID-19 projects. Rebuilding the infrastructure that has been lost in laboratories-and is needed to seed and continue other important projects-will take time and reinvestment. Phased plans for a safe and gradual reopening included reaching 50% research capacity by July, with faculty, students and staff alternating schedules to limit the number of people in a lab at one time and adhering to strict non-pharmacologic interventions such as wearing masks, social distancing and hand sanitizing. Just as scientists worldwide focused on deciphering the COVID-19 virus, UTSW investigators began their work with 10 projects in March and increased to 180+ to date. Wide-ranging projects at UTSW aim to understand the basic science-our deepest strength-behind the virus and to develop effective COVID therapies and a vaccine. UTSW is deeply involved in 14 COVID clinical trials, including: the promising Remdesevir project; use of convalescent plasma; leading a potential trial using a pneumonia drug called Atovaquone that UTSW found as a potential therapeutic using computer modeling to screen thousands of FDA-approved drugs that might also combat COVID; and developing a blood-filtering device to reduce inflammation in the most severe COVID patients. Page 4 of 8Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)10/20/2020 11:05:17PM 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center87th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's Statement Public Health A multidisciplinary UTSW team of bioinformatics and infectious disease experts collaborated to create a unique modeling tool that tracks the virus based on key data including how social behaviors impact transmission and has shown-within a 5% confidence level-to accurately forecast the spread of COVID in NTX and aided in the region's pandemic preparedness. The model is publicly available and provided to policymakers as they face challenging decisions to balance public health and economic security. UTSW Population Health and Data Science along with our Infectious Disease faculty are also assessing COVID epidemiology-how the virus affects different populations and their outcomes. UTSW launched a large-scale DFW COVID Prevalence Study\u2014with a goal of 42,000 participants\u2014to understand infection rates in the general population and non-health care frontline workers and the impact of socioeconomic determinants. We also launched a Biorepository Project\u2014a collaboration between Parkland, Children's Health, and Clements Hospital\u2014to collect tissue samples of COVID patients in order to study current therapies and to pursue long term studies. These and other data science projects\u2014pivotally informed by our core basic science expertise\u2014will help provide evidence-based answers to the public health challenges that COVID and future pandemics pose, which UTSW intends to continue making available to policymakers. Finally, materials scarcity was a catalyst for UTSW researchers to quickly innovate\u2014resulting in a UTSW developed COVID-19 diagnostic to support mass testing, viral transport medium to hold test samples, and in-house production of antibacterial gel for our staff. Patient Care UTSW remains focused on the best and safest practices for ongoing care for COVID and all patients. To ensure UTSW could rapidly respond to COVID patients, even before Gov. Abbott's March Executive Order, non-urgent medical procedures were cancelled at our typically 100%+ capacity university hospitals to increase available beds. While this responsible reduction increased bed availability and preserved critical PPE and personnel bandwidth, patient care revenues experienced a sizable decrease of ~$2M/day for an initial projected loss of $153M, now mitigated to ~$98M (before $43M in CARES support). In an unexpected positive, telemedicine proved to be a very effective platform to treat patients and make them feel safe to continue addressing their health, while protecting our providers and community. From March to May, UTSW capitalized on telehealth plans that were already in work to set up and train our physicians in telemedicine who conducted no more than ~10 telehealth visits per week pre-COVID to the current rate of 2000+ per day. Recognizing the acute shortage of COVID testing, UTSW also effected a significant ramp up of capacity to serve our patients, region and state, initially using an internally developed assay as early available tests proved defective. At a cost of ~$5M for equipment alone, two Abbott Molecular instruments were procured at a time when few institutions in the U.S. were able to secure these while the UTSW procurement team worked to resolve significant supply shortages, allowing us to increase our testing capacity to 1,000/day by early May. UTSW committed 500 tests/day to Gov. Abbott's statewide testing initiative, reserving the balance for our own patients and to support other hospitals in the DFW region, including Parkland and Children's Health. Over 76,000 COVID tests have been processed as of early September. UTSW has also led in developing strategies to ensure the safety of patients and caregivers in hospitals and clinics. COVID ICU beds have been sectioned off in a separate unit and airborne isolation rooms to limit cross-contamination between patients; unique equipment set ups have been created, such as mechanical ventilator interfaces outside patient rooms to enhance safety and preserve PPE; distinctive triage routes were developed to cohort suspected COVID patients for the protection of Page 5 of 8Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)10/20/2020 11:05:17PM 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center87th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's Statement others; and safe reuse of PPE such as masks to extend the life of those supplies has been established. UTSW will continue to offer all available resources to our patients and state and to share successful practices with peers, offering weekly Continuing Education programs for healthcare providers to help prevent community spread. PRIORITIES - INSTITUTIONAL & STATEWIDE UTSW continues to strive to be a leader in all of our missions and to serve as a community leader through our shared COVID recovery . Our experts are serving as a resource to elected, community and business leaders and the public as we endeavor to keep our campus and community safe and informed during this evolving health crisis. However, sustaining world-class education, research and patient care operations and an effective COVID response entails significant cost. Given the ~$153M projected loss incurred from March through April to combat COVID, now mitigated to ~$98M (before $43M in CARES support), UTSW is very grateful for Gov. Abbott and the Legislature's decision to exempt the HRIs\u2014in recognition of their front line role\u2014from necessary mid-biennium budget cuts that have been absorbed by other State agencies. While UTSW self-supports our patient care, the exemption afforded a measure of financial predictability to continue caring for patients in a challenging COVID environment that demanded complex operational adjustments, while maintaining education and research operations that also required myriad safety protocol changes. As a public institution that is not State-supported for patient care but uses sound clinical revenue practices to cross subsidize its education and research missions, COVID losses related primarily to clinical care could have a perhaps uniquely significant impact at UTSW. Each year, UTSW provides $120M+ from its faculty's clinical earnings to maintain its medical education programs, including the largest public GME program in Texas, but this will become unsustainable if COVID clinical losses continue and/or significant reductions in State education and research funding must be absorbed. Institutional Priority UTSW remains grateful for the funding the State has provided to develop this Texas institution into a world -class academic medical center, and for the strategic investment the 86th Legislature made in establishing a mission-specific Pilot Performance Based Research Operations Formula for our institution. In the inextricably linked education, research and patient care missions of nationally-ranked medical centers, research is the driver for the excellence and ROI that UTSW works to deliver to Texas. We appreciate the very difficult choices the 87th Legislature will need to make to sustain public education, essential health and human services, and other critical State infrastructure next Session, and stand ready to absorb a proportionate share of necessary budget reductions. Within this context, UTSW has a single Legislative Appropriations Request: - we respectfully request conversion of UTSW's Performance-Based Research Operations Formula from Pilot status to an ongoing funding stream, and have enclosed a Rider Revision request to accomplish this. Funding of the performance-driven total calculated by the formula would remain at the Legislature's discretion, but the predictability enabled by having the Performance Formula an ongoing element of UTSW's State support is critical to our operations and contributions to our state . Page 6 of 8Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)10/20/2020 11:05:17PM 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center87th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's Statement Should state funds allow, restoration of the 5% reduction totaling ~$230,000 to UTSW's remaining Non-Formula Support items would enable us to continue the effective public health and education work accomplished by our four impacted programs-Science Teachers Access to Resources, Regional Burn Center, Primary Care Physician Training, and Institutional Enhancement-described in their respective Schedule 9. Predictable and strategic investment in economic engines is important in times of prosperity and essential in the downturn that we are collectively weathering. It is now particularly vital to HRIs like UTSW that are working to deliver patient care, healthcare workforce training, and research to produce improved treatments and preventative therapies for an economic and public health path forward from COVID-19 and future pandemics. Statewide & Regional Priorities UTSW joins the University of Texas System in requesting sustaining funding for higher education institutions , which are foundational to our state and can help propel us forward as educators, employers, and economic drivers. Continued support of important initiatives such as the Texas Child Mental Health Care Consortium and research funds such as the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas can also provide the seed funding needed to advance health and many economic sectors in Texas, including biotechnology as one of the few industries in which our state lags. UTSW shares the need for capital investment to continue advancing our education and programs, including two projects to expand the Peter O'Donnell Brain Institute\u2014 the most important research thrust area at UTSW, with the goal of solving unmet neurological needs\u2014and to replace our dated School of Health Professions facility, should Tuition Revenue Bonds be authorized. We also join our community stakeholders in their continued call for a State Psychiatric Hospital to serve the increasingly acute need for mental health services and hospital capacity in our region. Dallas remains the largest metropolitan area in Texas in which residents have no access to a State hospital, and UTSW remains ready to design, construct and operate a facility should the Legislature wish to provide the funding for this critical resource for North Texas . CONCLUSION UTSW deeply appreciates the State's support and respectfully requests conversion of our Pilot Performance-Based Research Operations Formula to a standing formula. With the predictability of an established research funding mechanism, UTSW can continue to deliver tremendous ROI on the State's investment-training a remarkable number of medical and other healthcare providers for Texas, successfully retaining star faculty, and recruiting and developing more recognized investigators to further increase Texas' fitting claim as a research leader and destination for the best and brightest, particularly as we collectively emerge from COVID-19. UTSW also supports statewide funding policies for its HRIs that provide resources necessary to develop a world-class healthcare and research workforce, expand the Texas economy through technology, and improve the quality and availability of healthcare for all Texans. Objective measures demonstrate UTSW provides exceptional value to Texas per State dollar received, and UTSW pledges to continue to return the State's investment many times over, while assuring quality education and health services for future generations of Texans. The University of Texas System is governed by a Board of Regents.

Strategy Request 2 STRATEGY: 1 Research Activities BL 2023729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Performance Based Research Operations UTSW is a research-intensive, at-capacity institution that capitalizes on foundational state funds to seed its research mission-an integral driver of excellence in its education and patient care. The Performance Based Research Formula seeds core operations and technologies needed to support UTSW's researchers. Home to the largest biomedical sciences PhD program and the only public medical school in Texas consistently ranked by US News & World Report among the top 30 research institutions nationally, UTSW long relied upon Non-Formula \"Special Items\" to secure state research support. In the absence of an adequate formula mechanism, given the HRI Research Formula has eroded to a 1.18% match for every $100M in research expenditures, Non-Formula items were UTSW's only option for almost two decades to secure sufficient support. However, the nature of Non-Formula items-intended for targeted short-term purposes and typically disproportionately cut in economic recessions-created instability across biennia and are ill-equipped to sustain core institutional infrastructure. Conversion of Non-Formula funds to a more predictable performance formula provides an accountable mechanism to earn state support to seed research that catalyzes patient breakthroughs and reaps external investment, resulting in an up to 9:1 ROI in external grants at UTSW and increasing the state's economic output. Withdrawal of this funding jeopardizes the foundation on which UTSW's robust research enterprise is built. EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS IMPACTING STRATEGY: 3.A.

Strategy Request 2 STRATEGY: 1 Research Activities BL 2023729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Performance Based Research Operations UTSW's Performance Based Research Operations Formula is driven by the institution and its researchers' ability to secure competitive research grant support , as measured by its annual institutional research expenditures. The formula's Performance Base Match and Tiered Increase Match are calculated based on the increase or decrease in the average annual research expenditures and are a true measure of recent performance as well as ability to maintain top nationally-ranked levels of research over time. Before the global COVID-19 pandemic presented, the quality of UTSW and its faculty compared to researchers nationally was the critical external factor driving our institutional performance and research formula funding. While this remains the case, COVID has had additional impact on institutions forced to make the correct choice for patient care by halting all research except for COVID related projects from March into June, in order to conserve personal protective equipment and to ensure the safety of faculty, students and staff. Consequently, core research technologies and labs will require significant reinvestment to ramp back up to full capacity. This type of infrastructure support is not provided by federal grants or other typical sources of research support including philanthropy, making the State performance research funding essential to UTSW's phased restoration and ongoing contributions to our state's recovery.STRATEGY BIENNIAL TOTAL - ALL FUNDS Base Spending (Est 2020 + Bud 2021) Baseline Request (BL 2022 + BL 2023)BIENNIAL CHANGE EXPLANATION OF BIENNIAL CHANGE $ Amount Explanation(s) of Amount (must specify MOFs and FTEs)EXPLANATION OF BIENNIAL CHANGE (includes Rider amounts): $89,531,145 $0 $(89,531,145) $(89,531,145) Formula funded strategies are not requested in 2022-23 because amounts are not determined by institutions.

Strategy Request 1 STRATEGY: 1 Residency BL 2023729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Primary Care Residency Training Program Medical education is only partially complete when the M.D. degree is awarded. Further education in accredited residency programs is essential for the development of the full range of knowledge and skills to perform medical diagnosis and treatment and the certification required for a doctor to practice. This residency education is a major part of the primary mission of all Texas medical schools. UTSW shoulders the burden of training the vast majority of residents, in primary and specialty care, in all of N Texas. Consequently, it has more residents than every other State institution, and thus bears the greatest share of the State's resident costs. Serving the mission of training residents has significant costs, and the primary cost borne by medical schools is that of providing education by faculty. A portion of the costs associated with faculty supervising the care residents provide is paid with Medicare GME funds. Other than the State GME formula, which pays only ~1/3rd of the ~$18,000 annual per resident faculty supervision cost, there are no dedicated funds for residents' education. This strategy helps fund the disproportionate cost UTSW bears in educating one of the State's largest number of primary care residents , including direct resident support through payment of 15 stipends. It is essential to continue the number and quality of primary care residency programs at UTSW since such programs are the most important source of primary care doctors in N Texas and statewide. Additional information for this strategy is available in Schedule 9, Special Item Information.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS IMPACTING STRATEGY: 3.A.

The National Cancer Institute recognizes this void for cancer patients in the U.S., and in 2013 issued an RFP to plan a Heavy Ion research center. In 2015, a Texas team led by UTSW secured one of two NCI 2-year planning grants. The 84th Legislature - recognizing the opportunity for Texas to lead the country - matched the NCI grant with a $2M appropriation. A California team received a 2nd planning grant, with TX and CA now vying for an NCI Center of Excellence grant expected after the planning period. UTSW, with the research consortium including MD Anderson, UT Austin, UTHSC SA, Texas A&M, Prairie View A&M, Baylor MC, NASA, and others, is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this opportunity for Texas. Efficacy of Heavy Ions has been established by foreign centers, but still needed are improved accelerator/beam technology, an understanding of the underlying biology, and clinical trials. A U.S. facility must be a comprehensive center capable of carrying out basic, pre-clinical, physics-related and clinical research. UTSW is poised to do this. The establishment of all centers worldwide has been possible only with government support given the expense, ~$200M at UTSW.

Research has historically been a major mission for UT Southwestern, driving excellence in education and patient care. With the new performance based research formula providing predicatability and rewarding on-going achievement, this strategy is ranked as the top priority. GME is the second priority. This strategy is currently subsidized by as much as $120M per fiscal year from clinical revenues. With the current financial impact from COVID on clinical operations, this strategy would be most negatively impacted by further reductions. The remaining strategies are ranked based on the magnitude of potential financial impact to the institution.Agency Code: 729 Agency: UT Southwestern Medical Center Prepared By: Budget Office Date: September 2020 Program Priority Program Name Legal Authority20 - 21 Base GAARequested FY22 Requested FY23 3.A.1.

Pilot Program: Mission Specific Support - Performance Based Research Operations Formula. The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center has a mission that is research intensive. To enhance research capacity, assist the institution in leveraging research grants and gifts, and support expansion of the institution's research operations, additional research formula funding shall be provided based on the following criteria: a. General Revenue Research Operations Formula funding provided to The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Strategy B.1.2, Performance Based Research Operations Formula, shall be allocated to the institution through two mechanisms. 1) Base Match allocations shall be based on the institution's average annual research expenditures for the previous three-year period as reported to the Higher Education Coordinating Board, excluding research expenditures from state appropriations. The Base Match rate shall be 12.1XX.X (to be updated for current performance data) percent for each fiscal year of the 20220-231 biennium. Thereafter, tThe Base Match rate shall be adjusted based on the average annualized increase or decrease in research expenditures from the prior biennium's three-year base average. 2) Performance Incentive Tiered Match allocations shall be based on the increase of the institution's average annual research expenditures since the prior biennium. The calculation of this increase shall be based on the average annual research expenditures for the two-year base period preceding each biennium, as reported to the Higher Education Coordinating Board, excluding research expenditures from state appropriations. The Tiered Match shall allocate funding in three tiers that increase on a sliding scale. Tier 1 shall provide matching General Revenue funds at a rate of 25.0 percent for any increase in the institution's average annual research expenditures between $0 and $10,000,000. Tier 2 shall provide matching General Revenue funds at a rate of 50.0 percent for any increase in the institution's average annual research expenditures between $10,000,000 and $20,000,000. Tier 3 shall provide matching General Revenue funds at a rate of 75.0 percent for any increase in the institution's average annual research expenditures greater than $20,000,000. The institution's Performance Based Research Operations Formula shall be expended for the purpose of research operations, expanding research capacity, and pursuing excellence in its research mission. Any unexpended balances as of August 31, 20220, are hereby appropriated for the same purpose for the fiscal year beginning September 1, 20220.For formula funding purposes, the amount of growth in total funding for the Performance Based Research Operations 3.B. Rider Revisions and Additions Request (continued) 3. B Page 3 of 3 Formula from one biennium to another may not exceed 5.0 percent of the institution's total General Revenue appropriations in the prior biennium, excluding tuition revenue bond debt service. The Legislative Budget Board shall implement the funding in accordance with this limitation. The mission specific Performance Based Research Operations formula established in this subsection is a pilot formula for the 2020-21 biennium that expires at the end of the fiscal year ending August 31, 2021. U. T. Southwestern requests that the Performance Based Research Operations Formula be made permanent and the base rate be updated appropriately.

Fiscal Year - HUB Expenditure Information % Goal % Actual Actual $ Actual $ % Actual % Goal Diff $143,981,622 $1,097,788,162 Attainment: UT Southwestern Medical Center exceeded Statewide HUB Procurement Goals in (2) of (6) procurement categories in Fiscal Year 2018. There are no agency goals for fiscal year 18 for UT Southwestern Medical Center. UT Southwestern Medical Center exceeded Statewide HUB Procurement Goals in (1) of (6) procurement categories in Fiscal Year 2019 and exceeded its internal goals in (3) of the (6) categories.B. Assessment of Fiscal Year - Efforts to Meet HUB Procurement Goals 11.2% 13.1% Applicability: In FY18, UT Southwestern implemented a new internal goal development process for expected FY19 HUB expenditure activity. The goal process focuses on recognizing continual improvement in HUB expenditure growth while considering the inherent variability of the Building Construction spend activity and the spend types that are limited in terms of HUB opportunity. UTSW procures millions each year in specialized drugs (cancer drugs, pharmaceuticals, etc.) where there is no HUB opportunity available. Additionally, the professional services category only consists of financial services, medical services, and architectural/engineering services. Many of these firms also have limited HUB opportunities. The internal goal process considers these challenges and allows the organization to focus on new areas of opportunity while establishing realistic, attainable goals.Factors Affecting Attainment: UTSWMC HUB program focused on the North Texas Region, leading to program recognition from the DFW Minority Supplier Development Council and the Regional \"Good-Faith\" Efforts: 6.A.

The total net margin reduction of $100.2M as compared to the FY19 pre-COVID projection is composed of direct projected COVID expenses of $33.8M, projected COVID related reimbursements of $42.9 and lost margin projected from the remainder of operations impacted by COVID of $107.9M. The margin loss of $100.2M is associated with reducing and closing clinic activity, eliminating non-critical patient care procedures and closing non-mandatory operations (food service, lost parking revenue, etc.). Lost revenue of $134M, excluding the CARES Act reimbursement, is associated with this projected margin loss of $100.2M. Actual FY20 expense is primarily composed of $7.5M of compensation (emergency leave in March, shift differentials and overtime) and $26.3M of M&O including consumable lab and medical supplies, PPE, minor equipment, contracted services, maintenance and repair and IR infrastructure required to support work from home. 6.G.

Institutional Enhancement funding at UT Southwestern supports leading-edge and innovative programs in medical education to help provide the highest quality education and training in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease to our medical students. (3) (a) Major Accomplishments to Date: Institutional Enhancement support has contributed to maintaining the highest standard of excellence in the missions for which the state has tasked UT Southwestern . A young school compared to its peers, UTSW's Medical School was again ranked in 2019-2020 by U.S. News & World Report in the Top 30 among 160 nationally for research and primary care, the only public Texas medical school so rated. Its Clements University Hospital was also ranked the No. 1 hospital in Dallas-Fort Worth and No. 2 in Texas. In 2019, the institution was named by Nature as the world's No. 1 academic medical center in published research. All of this has been built and made possible by the bedrock of State support that provides for education, training and research operations at UTSW. (3) (b) Major Accomplishments Expected During the Next 2 Years: UTSW will continue to expand and revamp existing clinical programs and develop new clinical programs to sustain the quality of our medical education . Major objectives for the school are the integration and expansion of programs in the basic and clinical neurosciences, including the O'Donnell Brain Institute's move to a third tower expansion at Clements University Hospital that is research and patient focused on the ever-increasing cognitive diseases of the aging brain. UT Southwestern will also continue growing its programs in clinical investigation, including epidemiology, medical informatics, bioinformatics, and clinical trials along with the continued development of new programs in population and health outcomes research. While the total extent and costs of these programs continues to be defined, student participation will require additional State support.

An important component of its medical education is accomplished for ~675 students in the second, third and fourth years of medical school when they rotate through the many clinical clerkships offered. Medical students participate first-hand in patient management, learning how to apply the information they learned in the first 1.5 years of medical school, and acquiring new knowledge. The excellence of these clinical programs is one of the reasons UTSW is a highly regarded medical school, and is sought after by the most qualified medical school applicants from across Texas and beyond. In the past, programs such as oncology and clinical epidemiology have been targets for development to support excellence in medical education. UTSW must remain constantly vigilant to identify new clinical programs that must be developed or expanded to maintain our cutting-edge medical education. However, as all funding sources contract, established primary care programs that are equally essential to medical education, such as Family Practice and Internal Medicine, are now also supported with these funds. Any reductions to this funding would impact the level of services that we have been able to deliver to students.(9) Impact of Not Funding: Institutional Enhancement support is needed on an ongoing basis to supplement and enhance core educational operations for our medical student rotations. Institutional enhancement funding is essential to UTSW's ability to educate and train tomorrow's physicians. State support for educating medical students has declined since the formulas were conceived, and faces further reductions as new medical schools continue to be established. This funding is essential to maintain quality education for our existing medical students and ensuring program quality in increasingly costly medical school operations.(10) Non-Formula Support Needed on Permanent Basis/Discontinu N/A as non-formula support is needed on a permanent basis.(11) Non-Formula Support Associated with Time Frame: Suggested performance metrics associated with permanent funding are reflected in Section 13.(12) Benchmarks: Institutional enhancement allows UTSW to maintain medical school program quality. Performance can be assessed by UTSW's maintenance of its top 30 ranking among schools nationally.(13) Performance Reviews: Page 2 of 11Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical CenterSchedule 9: Non-Formula Support 10/20/2020 11:06:00PM 87th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Primary Care Residency Training (1) Year Non-Formula Support Item First Funded: 1996 Original Appropriation: $1,557,500 Year Non-Formula Support Item Established: 1996 (2) Mission: Medical education is only partially complete when the M.D. degree is awarded. Further education in an accredited residency program is essential for the development of the full range of knowledge and skills to perform medical diagnosis and treatment, and to achieve the certification required for a doctor to practice. As a primary mission of Texas' medical schools, UTSW has the largest primary care residency program in Texas and consequently the institution absorbs the greatest share of costs not covered by federal and state funds. Specifically, faculty train residents at a significant cost that is primarily borne by the medical school. A small portion of the education costs are supported with Medicare GME funds and the State GME formula, which pays just over one quarter of the ~$23,000 annual per resident faculty supervision cost, but there are no other dedicated funds for residents' education. UTSW has long supplemented its graduate medical education programs to help support one of the State's largest primary care residency programs , including direct resident support through payment of 36 stipends. Texas continues to lag in training enough doctors to meet growing demand, making this funding essential to continue the number and quality of primary care residency programs at UTSW as a pipeline of primary care doctors both in North Texas and statewide . (3) (a) Major Accomplishments to Date: This item critically supports the statewide goal of decreasing the shortage of primary care doctors and providing quality primary care to the citizens of Texas . UT Southwestern continues to train more primary care doctors than any other State institution in Texas, with 403 residents in primary care programs. Have expanded upon the combined training program in Internal Medicine/Pediatrics initiated in 2016 to 16 positions. Additionally, the Family Medicine Residency program, which was expanded in 2017 to include the Texas Health Dallas training site, now includes 44 trainees. (3) (b) Major Accomplishments Expected During the Next 2 Years: Approximately 30% of UT Southwestern's 1,409 residents are in primary care programs. At maturity, the Family Medicine and Internal Medicine/Pediatrics training programs provide a total of 40 primary care training residency positions. UT Southwestern intends to continue maintaining the largest and most competitive primary care residency training programs in Texas, in order to continue graduating ~120 primary care doctors every year. This number will continue to grow as programs expand and residencies are complete, helping to address the shortage of primary care doctors and provide quality primary care to the citizens of Texas.

A further reduction would have similar impact. With increasing pressure on other sources of funding - particularly in light of COVID-19 related losses totaling more than $130 million at UTSW -and with no other funding dedicated to this purpose, a reduction in primary care residency program funding would not be replaced and would impact the quality of the education received by the largest number of primary care residents among Texas health institutions, It would also directly result in a reduction in the number of primary care residents trained. With an existing shortage of primary care doctors practicing in the state, particularly as we collectively combat COVID-19, Texas can ill afford to lose any primary care residency positions at any institution across the state.(9) Impact of Not Funding: Funding for the Primary Residency Training Program is needed on a permanent basis as it is critical to addressing the physician shortage in Texas . Moreover, as medical graduates increase statewide with the advent of new schools, the number of residency positions must keep pace as they are necessary to ensure graduates do not leave the State for other residency opportunities. This funding pays a small portion of the costly training of tomorrow's doctors, but there is no other source especially as COVID-19 response and recovery has resulted in significant revenue losses at TUSW, and is essential to producing practicing physicians to provide needed care to an ever-growing population.(10) Non-Formula Support Needed on Permanent Basis/Discontinu N/A as non-formula support is needed on a permanent basis.(11) Non-Formula Support Associated with Time Frame: Suggested performance metrics associated with permanent funding are reflected in Section 13.(12) Benchmarks: Page 4 of 11Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical CenterSchedule 9: Non-Formula Support 10/20/2020 11:06:00PM 87th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Retention and expansion of residency training programs.

STARS Program Goals: to improve science education in North Texas and beyond, to increase science awareness, to stimulate interest in STEM fields, to provide ongoing teacher/student support, to offer content and instructional aides, and to broaden the knowledge base of teachers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, STARS quickly innovated its 20 programs and projects to a virtual educational platform to meet the needs of the current, fluid global environment and continually offer no-cost high-quality programs to thousands of teachers and tens of thousands of students annually; therefore, furthering its mission. STARS also maintains important relationships with large urban school districts such as Dallas, Ft. Worth, and Irving, and is represented on many district advisory boards, to promote participation of diverse student populations in STARS functions. (3) (a) Major Accomplishments to Date: STARS offers teacher professional development services and student STEM engagement programs, all virtually free of charge and many with paid stipends. These include a(n) monthly Basic Science Symposium and In-service program, 8-week Summer Research Programs for students (900 applications -58 positions) and teachers, customized Medical Center Tours (3-4/week), monthly medical-science Exploring Programs, annual Careers in Biomedical Sciences and Women in Science & Medicine symposia, Science Ambassador and Student Mentoring Programs, and hands-on summer Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Middle School Camps where master teachers coach novice teachers in content and pedagogy, as they direct student lessons and labs. Teachers and students utilize STARS resources, such as software, videos, instruments, and science kits. New initiatives include customized district PD sessions and AP-Bio symposia. STARS, a national 2020 Inspiring Programs in STEM Award recipient, quickly innovated its programs to a virtual educational platform during the COVID-19 pandemic, maintained high-quality programs, and notably increased teacher and student participation by 11% and 16%, respectively, in the past 2 years. Since its inception in 1991, STARS has grown to serve over 20,000 teachers from 4,000 schools, plus an estimated 90,000 students have been impacted by teacher and direct student participation. Each year, there has been tremendous program growth and soaring demand from teachers and students.

Without funding, valuable virtual, hybrid, or in-person professional development for teachers will be curtailed, and the 8-10 point improvement students have shown on End of Course science related exams will suffer, students will be unable to tour medical facilities or connect with STEM professionals which inspire a career in STEM, and students seeking early research opportunities through the program will have to search for alternative options where currently only 6% of applicants can be accommodated. The program's biomedical science careers pipeline would also cease as many former students have proceeded to pursue STEM professions and matriculated into UTSW and other Texas professional schools, enriching the healthcare science workforce and industry. Unfortunately, external funds have been far more challenging to obtain in the last few years as science and outreach budgets tighten so state support is critical. For example, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute stopped its pre-college programs in 2012, and the NIH has transferred much of its outreach budget to fund its core research mission. Similarly, state funding has been reduced by over 30% since FY11-12 which makes support all the more essential to maintain STARS activities.(9) Impact of Not Funding: Core support for STARS is needed on a permanent basis to maintain and continue the remarkably oversubscribed Program. The virtual, hybrid, or in-person programs ensure that North Texas students and teachers have access to invaluable STEM related hands-on and instructional professional development; STEM engagement programs such as symposia, summer science camps, science-medicine exploring programs, student mentoring and science ambassador programs; research opportunities and tours of medical facilities. This program foster curiosity and innovation among our youngest Texans, who will ultimately steer the future of science and medicine in the 21st century and concurrently help to drive our State's economy.(10) Non-Formula Support Needed on Permanent Basis/Discontinu N/A as non-formula support is needed on a permanent basis.(11) Non-Formula Support Associated with Time Frame: Suggested performance metrics associated with permanent funding are reflected in Section 13.(12) Benchmarks: STARS provides high-quality STEM related virtual, hybrid, or in-person teacher professional development programs, student-focused STEM engagement programs throughout the school year and summers that include research opportunities, symposia, science-medicine exploring programs, student mentoring and science ambassador programs, tours and summer science camps to the North Texas region. Performance can be assessed as follows: - number of teacher participants - number of student participants - numbers of schools impacted - number of summer research program applicants and slots available - number of summer science camp applicants and slots available(13) Performance Reviews: Page 8 of 11Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical CenterSchedule 9: Non-Formula Support 10/20/2020 11:06:00PM 87th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Regional Burn Care Center (1) Year Non-Formula Support Item First Funded: 1978 Original Appropriation: $125,000 Year Non-Formula Support Item Established: 1978 (2) Mission: To provide state-of-the-art comprehensive acute burn care, burn rehabilitation, education, supplies, and banked skin allograft tissues for clinical transplant for adult and pediatric patients and healthcare professionals. The Center is the only American Burn Association and American College of Surgeons-verified burn center in North Texas, providing a regional resource for disaster management for those with burns. (3) (a) Major Accomplishments to Date: The Burn Center continues to support faculty, fellow, resident, student, and advanced clinical personnel training in burn treatment as well as providing state-of-the-art care for Texans. In 2019, the Center admitted 873 patients (24% children) and during this time clinical outcomes such as mortality were very low, roughly 2.7% of patients admitted, which is below the national standard according to ABA reports. Hospital length of stay remains below national norms. There were also over 3,200 visits to the Burn Outpatient Clinic in FY19. Educating the next generation of providers remains a focus, with ~80 residents rotating through the center annually from 5 residency programs. The Center has also developed a Burn Surgery Fellowship that includes a Critical Care Certification for the most highly specialized care for burn patients. Improvements in clinical outcomes and education are due to many factors, significantly supported by State funds. Advancements in resuscitation including patented technology, improved quality of surgical intervention, and improved metabolic support are only a few of the advances produced. Equally important, the Center continues to serve as a state and national resource for teaching and referral for the latest techniques in burn care and prevention, and leveraging of State funds has resulted in continued high national and international recognition and successful competition for federal grants. (3) (b) Major Accomplishments Expected During the Next 2 Years: The Center combines emergency care and in-hospital treatment of acute pediatric and adult burns, as well as reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation to meet the UT-Southwestern mission to provide the best comprehensive burn care. While providing world-class burn care, the Center will remain active in clinical research to further improve understanding and efficacy of treatments to improve outcomes in burns. Through these efforts, the Center also serves to advance the goals of medical care, improved patient survival and morbidity. In addition, excellence in research and patient care allows the Center to continue to actively improve and provide excellence in education for fellows, residents, medical students and professional health students in clinical and rehabilitative burn treatment.

Loss or further reduction of funding would also delay development and implementation of regional disaster management preparedness, and significantly hinder education and training for students, resident and other providers of burn care.(9) Impact of Not Funding: Funding for the Regional Burn Care Center is needed on a permanent basis to enable continuous provision of state-of-the-art burn care and education in this critical field. The only American Burn Association and American College of Surgeons-verified burn center in North Texas, the Regional Burn Care Center is critical to serving the region for these acute, life-threatening and intensely painful injuries. The Center's expert staff is also responsible for training tomorrow's specialists in burn care and prevention. Finally, the state's support is leveraged to bring in more outside dollars to support the education, research and patient care the Center provides.(10) Non-Formula Support Needed on Permanent Basis/Discontinu N/A as non-formula support is needed on a permanent basis.(11) Non-Formula Support Associated with Time Frame: Page 10 of 11Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical CenterSchedule 9: Non-Formula Support 10/20/2020 11:06:00PM 87th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Suggested performance metrics associated with permanent funding are reflected in Section 13.(12) Benchmarks: Funding for the Center is critical to training tomorrow's burn specialists in prevention and treatment, providing infrastructure to support clinical trials, publishing peer-reviewed research findings that inform burn care, and attracting more dollars to the state.
