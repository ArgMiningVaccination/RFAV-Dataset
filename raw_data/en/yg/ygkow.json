There is no IV access required forvitamin injections. The dosages of vitamins differ from those given IV since a smaller volume of vitamins can be injected into the muscle, however it still gives very similar absorption as the IV route going directly into the bloodstream. IV PUSHES - An IV Push is infused directly into the bloodstream via a plastic catheter that is inserted into a vein. IV Pushes are given with a syringe, with concentrated, high dose vitamins with minimal fluid hydration, and take about 5-10 min to administer. You get 100% bioavailability via an IV Push. IV DRIPS (INFUSIONS) - IV is an abbreviation for \"intravenous\". To administer an IV Drip, a small plastic tube (catheter) is inserted into a vein using a needle that is quickly removed once the plastic tube is advanced into the vein. IV Drips consist of 250-500 ml of fluid with a mixture of vitamins, antioxidants and amino acids. The intravenous route is the most direct way to deliver fluids and vitamins throughout the body with 100 % bioavailability in the bloodstream. IV Drips usually take 30-60 min to infuse.
