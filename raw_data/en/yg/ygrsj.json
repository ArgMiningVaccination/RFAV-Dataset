Among those surveyed, 49.2% said that a Covid-19 vaccine should be covered by basic health insurance for anyone who wants to be inoculated. Another 17.4% said the vaccine should be covered and mandatory for everyone, while 17.9% said it should only be covered for those in risk groups - as is the case with flu jabs.

Half of those surveyed said temporary border closures for private individuals would make sense.
