[Certificate of Analysis (COA)](/product_documents/COA/505_Lavender_High_Elevation_COA_31.pdf) [Safety Data Sheet (SDS)](/product_documents/SDS/505_Lavender_High_Elevation_SDS.pdf) Overview High Elevation Lavender Essential Oil Our Lavender - High Elevation essential oil is one of our most popular Lavenders. Rows of this violet-blue Lavender are cultivated at high altitudes where upper elevations appear to increase the development of the light, powdery ester, linalyl acetate.1 No wonder this oil is so universally appreciated with its uplifting, sweet-herbaceous, green floral aroma! In consumer products, true Lavender essential oils (called interchangeably Lavandula angustifolia, L. officinalis and L. vera2) are often adulterated or replaced by the less expensive, but higher yielding hybrid Lavandin essential oils. This substitution only approximates the complex and robust aroma of Lavender and offers a much narrower spectrum of aromatic constituents. 3 Although this iconic plant thrives in poor, rocky soils in many parts of the world, France is still considered to be the premier growing region and is the source of two of our other best-selling Lavender essential oils (France - Organic and Wild). In aromatherapy, Lavender is one of (if not) the most commonly used essential oils due to its general availability, modest price, versatility and universally pleasant scent. Lavender has been an integral part of fine fragrances for centuries - it is a middle to top note, can be used as a perfume modifier, and can also help mask the not so pleasant aroma of oils you want to use in blends. It is a popular addition to skincare preparations of all types, and is a favorite in diffusers, outdoor sprays, massage blends, and in relaxing baths. Lavender oil has a cooling and drying aroma that is said to help calm the body, mind and spirit. This is one oil that should be part of everyone's collection! Not sure which Lavender to choose?

Customer Reviews for Lavender - High Elevation - [Clean and uplifting pure lavender](https://www.edenbotanicals.com/review/product/view/id/9199/)Review by Alexandra - RatingThis is my favorite of EB's true lavender essential oils. It smells lke lavender wafted on a sea breeze--perfectly clean and crisp, sweet, full-bodied lavender with virtually no camphor. It's like a vacation in a bottle.(Posted on 6/10/2020) - [Wow!](https://www.edenbotanicals.com/review/product/view/id/9196/)Review by Paris Jaye - RatingI have used many lavenders from various companies and this by far is the BEST I've ever had. While lavender is traditionally one of my least favorite aromas, this particular aroma hits the spot. Sensational and beautiful when blended. There is an undeniable quality to it. I can't quite put my finger on what it is about this aroma. I just know that I can't stop using it(Posted on 6/6/2020) - [Almost unreal, it's so amazing!](https://www.edenbotanicals.com/review/product/view/id/5341/)Review by Blue Dawn Aromatherapy - RatingThis is by far the best lavender I have smelled! It's a sweet, candy-like smell, but still smells so natural and fresh.(Posted on 12/14/2016) - [Beautiful lavender](https://www.edenbotanicals.com/review/product/view/id/1960/)Review by Florence - I have continuously had bad luck with lavender because I've always received oils with a harsh, camphor scent. I mainly avoided lavender for that reason but would try samples every now and then in hopes I'd find a great one. This oil is that find. It is beautiful, full, crisp and clear. I'm happy that I tried it and I hope it stays true from batch to batch because I'll be back for more.(Posted on 2/15/2016) - [Just Gorgeous](https://www.edenbotanicals.com/review/product/view/id/1665/)Review by Donna - This smells so pure and so lovely. No harsh notes(Posted on 8/24/2015) just like a field of lavender on a warm, sunny day ! I'm so impressed by this company. Fast shipping, neatly and safely packed & superb customer service . Thank you ! - [Fresh, clean, crisp.](https://www.edenbotanicals.com/review/product/view/id/645/)Review by Lisa - I love lavender! I have purchased many lavender essential oils from various suppliers over the years, and I have not found one that compares to this chemotype of lavender. I was looking for a fresh clean, crisp, full fragrant lavender that didn't smell champhorous. Look no more! This is the one. It smells as fresh as my lavender plants growing in my garden. I'm in love!(Posted on 3/17/2013) - [A pure, fresh and clean Therapeutic Lavender](https://www.edenbotanicals.com/review/product/view/id/414/)Review by Debi - I researched for a while to find the very best oils I could. I learned all about the extraction process to keep the oils pure and therapeutic. This is how I found Eden Botanicals. This lavender is so pure, fresh, and clean smelling, it assures me I made the correct choice of companies. I have used this lavender already in my diffuser, and it filled my home with such a wonderful aroma, keeping us relaxed and happy. I have also used it to clean my mattress, and an area rug. Using baking soda mixed with the lavender freshens and cleans fabrics of all types, naturally with no harm to the fabric. I highly recommend this oil for all the therapeutic values it "}
