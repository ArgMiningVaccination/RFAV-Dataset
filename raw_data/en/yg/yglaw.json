Safety There were no treatment- related serious AEs, deaths, grade 4 -5 solicited TRAEs, or AEs of special interest in both group. The most frequently reported TRAEs were fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia and injection site pain. Most of the solicited TRAEs were grade 1- 2and one participant in the S - 268019 group and four participants in the COMIRNATY group experienced grade 3 solicited TRAEs. Compared with COMIRNATY, S -268019 led to a lower incidence of solicited TRAEs.41End of slides "}
