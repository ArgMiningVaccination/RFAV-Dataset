Organic India herbs are grown by small family farmers using organic, regenerative agriculture. Let's take a look at a few of the most popular herbs for stress relief and mood. 1. Ashwagandha Ashwagandha is well known in Ayurveda as a powerful restorative herb. The plant itself is a shrub with yellow flowers which bears red fruit, earning it the name \"winter cherry.\" Also known as \"Indian ginseng,\" both the shrub and root of this plant have been used for centuries to help: - Promote mental clarity - Improve focus - Restore feelings of calmness - Promote better sleep Ashwagandha is one of the most common of the herbs known as \"adaptogens.\" Adaptogens regulate your body's response to different kinds of stress - including physical, environmental, and emotional. Adaptogens, like ashwagandha, help the body respond and adapt to stress in part by [reducing cortisol levels.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31517876/) If you're looking for a natural way to keep your stress levels in check, ashwagandha may be the answer. 2. Tulsi [Tulsi](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4296439/), also called \"Holy Basil,\" is another adaptogenic herb used in Ayurveda to support wellness. The tulsi plant is native to India and depending on the variety, has fragrant green or purple leaves and purple or white flowers. This pungent herb is reminiscent of clove and mint and is often used as an herbal tea. A natural stress buster, tulsi helps relieve stress and promote better moods. It calms the sympathetic nervous system and returns the body to a state of rest and regeneration. When combined with chamomile and lavender, tulsi is a potent elixir for balancing cortisol levels and supporting the adrenal system. In ancient Hindu wisdom, tulsi is also known as the \"Queen of the Herbs\" due to its spiritual and restorative properties. Hindus regard tulsi as the manifestation of the goddess, Laksmi, in the form of a plant. It's one of the most revered plants and believed to impart blessings of wealth and prosperity on the home. 3. Shankhpushpi Known for its potent ability to support brain function, [shankhpushpi ](https://www.netmeds.com/health-library/post/shankhpushpi-benefits-uses-dosage-formulations-and-side-effects)actively works to boost medhya (memory) and improve cognitive function. This perennial plant that is native to India is known in English as \"Morning Glory\" or \"Aloe Weed.\" The name, shankhpushpi, comes from the shankha, or conch shape of the flowers. Packed with powerful antioxidants and flavonoids, each part of the plant has benefits that have been used to improve the power of the brain. This remarkable herb is known for enhancing concentration and increasing the capacity for focus and alertness. It also improves memory and other cognitive abilities. Supplementing with shankhpushpi may help stimulate focus and concentration. It's also known to help reduce mental fatigue from prolonged cognitive activities such as learning and memorizing. Shankhpushpi works by balancing chemicals and neurotransmitters in the brain. It keeps serotonin levels balanced, resulting in a more relaxed state for the body and mind. This helps reduce feelings of sadness and supports mental health and emotional stability. 4. Gotu Kola For thousands of years, gotu kola has had a rich history in Indonesia, China and other countries as a powerful tonic for supporting brain function. Due to its ability to boost memory and concentration, it earned the moniker, \"student herb.\" In Ayurveda, it's also known as a Medhya Rasayana. Medhya refers to the intellect or cognitive ability and rasayana means rejuvenating. Native to the wetlands of Asia, gotu kola has gained popularity across the globe for its benefits as a nootropic herb. A [nootropic ](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/features/nootropics-smart-drugs-overview)is a natural or synthetic substance that has a positive impact on the brain. Nootropics may enhance cognitive functions such as memory, attention and creativity. Gotu kola increases a brain chemical called acetylcholine which helps make synaptic connections in the brain. These connections aid in memory and learning. It's also thought to increase one's attention span and boost motivation. The neuroprotective properties of gotu kola have earned it another name, the \"longevity herb.\" Gotu kola may protect the brain from damage from toxins and heavy metals. This in turn helps the body maintain gene stability and decrease age-related diseases. Gotu kola is rich in phytonutrients and minerals such as magnesium, calcium and selenium. These minerals help heal damaged tissues and promote collagen production. 5. Bacopa Bacopa is a small creeping herb with white flowers that loves water and grows in tropical areas. The entire plant can be used in various ways as an herbal remedy. In traditional Ayurveda, it's known as a rasayana, or a rejuvenator, that helps to revitalize and rejuvenate the body. Bacopa is another herb with nootropic capabilities. It was traditionally used to support memory and focus as well as improve mood. One study suggests that [Bacopa ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22074576/)may improve cognitive function in healthy adults and may aid in reducing memory loss. In addition to its potential to improve cognitive function, bacopa is also a powerful antioxidant and supports a healthy inflammatory response.
