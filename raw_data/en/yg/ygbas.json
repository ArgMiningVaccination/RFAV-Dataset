The number of doses required is dependent upon the child's prior vaccination history \u2014 and the first dose should be given as early as possible. \"Vaccination during July and August can be considered for [children of any age](https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/childrens-health) who require only one dose,\" the CDC said.

Two of the eight approved flu shots are only for those over the age of 65; two are approved only for those older than 6 months and younger than 3 years; and another is approved only for people over the age of 18. Individuals with egg allergies will have additional flu vaccine choices for the 2023-2024 flu season, the CDC announced. \"People with egg allergy may get any vaccine (egg-based or non-egg-based) that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health status,\" said the agency. Previously, those who were allergic to eggs could not receive certain flu shots because they were created with an egg component. \"Beginning with the 2023-2024 season, additional safety measures are no longer recommended for [flu vaccination](https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/vaccines) of people with an egg allergy beyond those recommended for receipt of any vaccine, regardless of the severity of previous reaction to egg,\" said the CDC.
