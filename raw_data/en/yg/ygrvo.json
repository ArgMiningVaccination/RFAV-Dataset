Aromatherapy is based on the idea that essential plant oils have therapeutic effects when massaged into the skin. There are more than 300 different oils, used alone or in combination. Lavender promotes relaxation, ylang-ylang eases depression and rosemary is good for sprained muscles and digestive problems. What are the benefits? A recent claim by researchers that aromatherapy is \"bunkum\" and a waste of money has been rejected by the Aromatherapy Consortium, which says treatment can boost mood and alleviate pain. Aromatherapy typically treats PMS, insomnia, rheumatism, muscular pain, high and low blood pressure and some skin conditions. What does it involve? There are two elements: the massage and the oils. The client lies on a table in a soothing environment, usually with candles and music. The oil is selected after the therapist has taken a health history. Neroli is used to combat high blood pressure and menopausal symptoms. Juniper improves circulation and relieves fluid retention, while ginger helps back pain. Many oils have proven anti-microbial properties; tea tree oil is effective at treating thrush. Who does it? Aromatherapists undertake courses at FE colleges or private schools. But, as there is no statutory regulation, anyone can set themselves up as a practitioner. See [www.aromatherapy-regulation.org.uk](http://www.aromatherapy-regulation.org.uk/) for details of a voluntary registration scheme. Is there proof that it works? Aromatherapists aim to alleviate symptoms rather than cure them. Aside from anecdotal evidence, clinical trials show that lavender oil is significantly more effective than a plain oil massage or receiving no treatment in reducing heart rate, respiration, blood pressure and pain in intensive-care patients.
