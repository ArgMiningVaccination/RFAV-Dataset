The aim is to balance their energy to help boost wellbeing and treat some illnesses. Originating in China around 3,500 years ago, acupuncture remains one of the oldest and most commonly used healing systems in the world. How Does Acupuncture Work? Traditional Chinese medicine explains that health is the result of a harmonious balance of the complementary extremes of \"yin\" and \"yang\" of the life force known as \"qi,\" pronounced \"chi.\" Illness is said to be the consequence of an imbalance of the forces. Qi is said to flow through meridians, or pathways, in the human body. These meridians and energy flows are accessible through 350 acupuncture points in the body. Inserting needles into these points with appropriate combinations is said to bring the energy flow back into proper balance. Acupuncture points are seen as places where nerves, muscles, and connective tissue can be stimulated. The stimulation increases blood flow, while at the same time triggering the activity of the body's natural painkillers.
