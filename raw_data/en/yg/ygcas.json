Achillefs Kapanidis, PhD University of Oxford Achillefs Kapanidis' Biological Physics research group, within Condensed Matter Physics, studies mechanisms and machines of gene expression using single-molecule biophysical methods and biochemistry. What is your main area(s) of interest/expertise? We study the biological machinery microbes (such as bacteria and viruses) use to copy and repair their genetic information. Our studies are mainly based on detecting single molecules of the machinery via powerful microscopes that we develop in house. We also use our understanding of the microbial machinery and our novel microscopes to develop ultra-sensitive tests of biomedical importance. What are you working on right now? During the University shutdown, we focused all of our experimental efforts to repurpose a rapid viral detection assay (initially developed for influenza) to achieve diagnostics of COVID-19 in minutes, much faster than currently possible; this project is running collaboratively with colleagues in the John Radcliffe Hospital. Why is Oxford a good place to work in this field of research? At Oxford, we are blessed to be able to work with extremely talented, motivated, and innovative students and researchers, and to be surrounded by outstanding colleagues who can complement our work in areas of virology, microscopy, nucleic acid chemistry, and clinical diagnostics.
