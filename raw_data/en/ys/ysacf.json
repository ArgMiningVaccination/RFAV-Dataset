Simple, delicious recipes, rich in foods that are known for their anti-inflammatory properties. Food plays a key role in reducing inflammation in the body, so use this meal plan to help you feel better! Vegan, Paleo, and Whole 30 options. Today we're talking about anti-inflammatory food that helps nourish the body. Why follow a dairy-free and gluten-free anti-inflammatory meal plan? Well, let me explain. Disclaimer: I am not a medical practice and do not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Please seek diagnosis, treatment, and advice from qualified providers based on your condition. You see, we all have consumed grains, dairy, legumes, and meat (most of us) in our lifetime, yes? Yes! I (we) eat them all. Gluten-free grains of course. But here's the thing. As I sit here typing up this post, I can tell my brain and body need a little \"calming down.\" It's been on the crazy cycle for oh... weeks now! YIKES! Yes, stress can really take a toll on one's health and deplete you of important key MINERALS. You know what else it can do? It can cause that [oxidative stress](https://www.cottercrunch.com/eat-maximize-recovery-fight-oxidative-stress/) to rise and if we are under chronic stress (chronic inflammation), the physical and mental kind, then our immune system is going to have a hard time responding. It will try to react and recover but doesn't have the necessary nutrients in order to do so. Hey, it's pretty tired of trying to fight, ya know? Hence the continuous inflammation of the body and brain. Sad, but true. On the other hand, a little stress and a little inflammation can be good for the body. If you are healthy, managing stress, and moving the body daily, then your body will easily recover from that acute stress and build it up stronger. Unfortunately, for many of us, we get stuck in the \"chronic stress\" cycle. Am I right? Raising hand! Which is why I thought it was about time we make another anti-inflammatory meal plan. Our [first anti-inflammatory meal plan](https://www.cottercrunch.com/anti-inflammatory-gluten-free-meal-plan/) focused on grain-free and gluten-free recipes. This plan focuses on gluten-free and dairy-free. The reason that this ANTI-INFLAMMATORY GLUTEN-FREE MEAL PLAN is ALSO DAIRY FREE. In order to help COMBAT that c [hronic inflammation](https://www.cottercrunch.com/healthy-turmeric-golden-milk-vegan-tropical-smoothie/), we need to first make some MAJOR lifestyle changes (rest, sleep, take on less, etc.). Oops, I'm failing at that. We also need to MAXIMIZE certain nutrients in our diet, such as [omega 3 rich foods](https://draxe.com/omega-3-foods/) (EPA/DHA), anti-oxidants, minerals, Vitamin D, probiotics, water, and so on and so on. Temporarily removing a dairy, and maybe even certain types of grains can help absorb your body absorb more nutrients and therefore reduce stress on the body. Does that make sense? I know, you're probably now wondering... but why a [dairy-free](https://www.cottercrunch.com/dairy-free-gluten-free-meal-plan/) Anti-inflammatory meal plan? Doesn't cultured dairy do wonder for the gut? YES, it SURE does! Grass-fed dairy that's rich in probiotics, like kefir, and [yogurt](https://www.cottercrunch.com/tropical-yogurt-overnight-muesli/), and even REAL butter, can be healthy and nourishing. Plus they are SOOOO tasty! But here's the thing, if you are under that chronic inflammation and stress, then you might also be experiencing digest issues and food intolerances. Any food can be inflammatory if your body comes to see it as an \"invader\" under chronic inflammation. Which may include dairy, casein, and lactose included! Hopefully, it's a temporary intolerance, but you never know. Which is why I suggest trying out a [low FODMAP meal plan ](https://www.cottercrunch.com/low-fodmap-gluten-free-meal-plan/)first. No no, don't be worried, we can get this all worked out. Yes, we are going nourish the body and [reduce stress](https://www.cottercrunch.com/gluten-free-foods-reduce-stress-meal-plan/).

Focus on the darker fruits with less sugar to really boost the antioxidant intake. Blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, and blackberries are great choices. - Natural sweeteners: Maple syrup and honey (rich in minerals), molasses, and date sugar are wonderful to use in moderation. - Herbs and spices - Curry, [turmeric](https://www.cottercrunch.com/cold-busting-turmeric-tea-latte/), cumin, fresh basil, mint - those wonderful herbs and spices that either soothe the nervous system and digestive system and/or they boost immunity/health! *NOTE* - Eggs are healthy part of the diet but it depends on the type of egg and person. Duck egg and pasture raised (cage free organic) eggs are most nutrient dense. If you can tolerate eggs, please enjoy them in this meal plan. If you know your body does not react well to eggs, then I recommend limiting eggs temporarily until the gut and inflammation in your body heals.
